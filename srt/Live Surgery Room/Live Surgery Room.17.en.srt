00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,260
the liver cancer intervention.

192
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,930
Why is he so slow today?

193
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,930
Compared to this,

194
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,500
Jin Yaowu is really fast.

195
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,800
The difficulty with this procedure

196
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,090
is not who is faster.

197
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,140
It's the handling

198
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,930
of the four branching vessels
above and below the bladder

199
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,450
and the adaptation
of the capillary network.

200
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,830
Zheng's guidewire is entering

201
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,930
a branch vessel of the bladder artery.

202
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,900
Slow down.

203
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,780
Zheng has stopped.

204
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:38,930
Looks like

205
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,140
Changfeng's guidewire he's using

206
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,690
has reached the limit.

207
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,970
Jin Yaowu is still going on.

208
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,730
The wire is still going on.

209
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,060
Rudolph super-selected a deeper spot.

210
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,500
Jin

211
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,850
is using a domestic guidewire.

212
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,730
I don't know

213
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,140
if he can get to that spot.

214
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,780
For Zheng,

215
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,660
this is not his limit.

216
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,020
This is the limit
of Changfeng's micro guidewire.

217
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,660
Wait a little longer.

218
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,660
Jin Yaowu has reached

219
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,900
the same spot as Rudolph.

220
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,730
That's right.

221
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,970
He actually used a domestic guidewire

222
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,970
to reach Wansheng's guidewire's spot.

223
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,560
Jin Yaowu is going to break through

224
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,680
Rudolph's spot

225
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,660
and go on?

226
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,140
Diligence makes up for talent.

227
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,450
Medicine is not mathematics.

228
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,500
It's about to stop?

229
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,920
But I see that Jin

230
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,660
wants to continue.

231
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,570
He stopped too.

232
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,830
It's been difficult.

233
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,610
After all,
there's a material difference.

234
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,810
Jin did this surgery

235
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,610
better than Prof. Rudolph.

236
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,780
That's right.

237
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,730
And we're using domestic guidewires.

238
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:37,850
That means

239
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,730
we make up for the material gap

240
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,180
with skill.

241
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,020
Right?

242
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,660
Director Kong.

243
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,850
You are a great teacher.

244
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,380
I haven't done anything.

245
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,690
It's all his effort.

246
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,450
But if we stop there,

247
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,420
we'll still have the same after-effects

248
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,210
as Professor Rudolph.

249
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,140
Chatterbox.

250
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,060
What's Yun doing here?

251
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,380
Thick guidewire.

252
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,900
What's with the thick guidewire?

253
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,570
He's using the same technique

254
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,420
used during Lin Jiaojiao's surgery.

255
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,720
But such a thick micro guidewire

256
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,500
will probably cause damage

257
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,590
to the branch blood vessels
and result in intraoperative bleeding.

258
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,180
Young people have grit.

259
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,570
He's got a lot of guts.

260
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,300
Jin Yaowu has finished embolizing.

261
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,060
Contrast agent.

262
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,060
Time to show some real skill.

263
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,690
Fish through the coral.

264
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,610
Fish-head,

265
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,890
don't be so stupid as to wear out

266
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:29,780
the coral.

267
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,020
I think the dumbest thing is a fish
on a straw rope.

268
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,970
Don't think I don't understand.

269
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,180
The traditional character for "su"

270
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,610
is the character for "grass"
plus the character for "fish".

271
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,690
What a bad joke!

272
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,630
That's amazing.

273
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,530
It's a miracle.

274
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,440
Skilled.

275
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,180
Who can do that?

276
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,430
- How many surgeries did he do
- It's almost like a machine.

277
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,560
to achieve this?

278
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,020
That's too precise.

279
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,730
Now.

280
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,540
How is that possible?

281
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,260
He actually overtook Rudolph's position

282
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,420
with Changfeng's guidewire.

283
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,020
Yeah.

284
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,850
That's the way.

285
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,690
A brand new technique.

286
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:42,810
Nice.

287
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,690
Contrast agent.

288
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,060
The location is fine.

289
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,660
Embolic agent.

290
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,500
Yes!

291
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,570
It's done.

292
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,130
Micro guidewire.

293
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,670
That's amazing. He's still going.

294
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,220
Here, sit.

295
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,500
Why is it still going on?

296
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,850
The surgery was a success

297
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,020
by all accounts.

298
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,260
He's not stopping.

299
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,850
They've opened

300
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:02,890
a second vascular network.

301
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,020
Still going on, Fish-head?

302
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,270
It's only just begun,

303
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,260
greenhorn.

304
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,130
Micro guidewire.

305
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,060
He's really going at it.

306
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,760
I don't think

307
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,120
Zheng's technique

308
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,890
is as fast as before.

309
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,130
But it's still...

310
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,550
Very agile, very flexible.

311
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,090
Right?

312
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,980
I feel like

313
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,060
the guidewire has grown eyes

314
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,500
and is becoming conscious.

315
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,570
Surgery's been going on for so long.

316
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,840
After dealing
with three arterial branches'

317
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,300
capillary network,

318
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,810
his hands are still as steady as ever.

319
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,540
So young, so talented.

320
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,360
It's been so long.

321
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,500
The fourth set of embolization
is also complete.

322
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,170
Yeah.

323
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,300
Oh, my!
He's super selecting the fifth.

324
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,170
Yes!

325
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,740
For preoperative 3D reconstruction,

326
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,850
there are six groups of coral reefs

327
00:19:58,850 --> 00:19:59,540
that need to be done.

328
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,980
It's all finished now.

329
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,410
On my first day in Haicheng Hospital,

330
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,740
the pancreaticoduodenectomy I faced

331
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,980
told me one thing.

332
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,020
What is it?

333
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,130
Never rely too much on machines.

334
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,090
Contrast agent.

335
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,650
Alright.

336
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,600
Continue for the seventh group.

337
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,620
[Beida Hospital]

338
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,880
They're here!

339
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,630
They're here!

340
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,460
Yun!

341
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,500
Zheng!

342
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:42,020
- You're so great, Dr. Zheng!
- That's awesome!

343
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,070
Awesome!

344
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,950
Perfect!

345
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,810
Good!

346
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,260
Zheng!

347
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,150
- Outstanding!
- Wonderful!

348
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,740
Zheng!

349
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,510
Excellent!

350
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,060
So great!

351
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,980
- Awesome!
- Perfection!

352
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,780
Good job!

353
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,410
That's awesome!

354
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,640
Amazing!

355
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,020
Perfection!

356
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,650
So amazing!

357
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,300
What's the prognosis

358
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,940
for the surgery?

359
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,410
Within 24 hours,

360
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,550
after the acute phase

361
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,810
of prostate necrosis and edema,

362
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,090
the urinary catheter can be removed.

363
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,920
Are you so sure you'll be able

364
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,650
to remove the catheter in 24 hours?

365
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,390
Jin.

366
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,260
Let's make a bet.

367
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,740
If we can't pull out the tube
within 24 hours,

368
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,980
we'll go back to Haicheng

369
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,170
and never come back to Beida again.

370
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,330
But if we do,

371
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,220
quit your job

372
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,740
and never set foot in Beida again.

373
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,370
Want to bet?

374
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,630
What's there to bet on?

375
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,220
You all did a great job today.

376
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,300
It's hard work.

377
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,570
Get some rest.

378
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,540
Let's all go home and rest.

379
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,740
Let's go.

380
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,680
Get some rest already.

381
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,890
You're all soaked.

382
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:49,980
It was brilliant.

383
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,020
It was a real eye-opener.

384
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,100
Yeah.

385
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,150
That was brilliant.

386
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:57,920
Let's go.

387
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,370
- Go.
- Come on.

388
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,290
You guys go ahead.

389
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,260
I was wrong.

390
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,460
Mr. Kong...?

391
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,610
As Wang Long said,

392
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,020
once the branch vessels

393
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,260
and capillary network

394
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,700
of the superior bladder artery

395
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,300
were done,

396
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,170
the operation will be a success.

397
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,260
The next steps are totally

398
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,850
the icing on the cake of the adventure.

399
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,460
Could have not taken the risk,

400
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,060
but he did it anyway.

401
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:37,700
Why?

402
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,610
Because

403
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,540
he's not confident?

404
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,740
No.

405
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,810
Because in Zheng Ren's eyes,

406
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,090
there's only surgery.

407
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,940
Reputation, status, future...

408
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:54,890
He does not care

409
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,130
about any of that.

410
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,170
Oh, Jin.

411
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,090
Diligence is important,

412
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:11,940
but the road

413
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,170
to the top

414
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,780
requires focus.

415
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,540
If you see too much,

416
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,780
you won't be able to go fast.

417
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,260
You and I

418
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,700
should reflect on that point.

419
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,780
So, I'm very happy with it.

420
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,460
Zheng.

421
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,700
Your surgery today

422
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,260
was a great success.

423
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,090
Did Beida

424
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,060
and domestic consumables

425
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,130
a great favor.

426
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,570
We need to celebrate it.

427
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,700
I'd like to meet you

428
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,410
for a meal tomorrow.

429
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,220
What do you think?

430
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,940
Mr. Li's treating us.

431
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:24,940
We must come.

432
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,170
That's great.

433
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,610
Zheng.

434
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,500
What are you thinking?

435
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:32,810
I'm thinking

436
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:33,940
about the surgery.

437
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,370
It all worked out.

438
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,020
What's left to think about?

439
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,020
Still thinking about group seven
capillary network?

440
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,330
By the way.

441
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,120
Wang Long said when you did

442
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,260
the pre-surgical CT yesterday,

443
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,610
there were six groups.

444
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,650
Why was there another group?

445
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,850
I made a discovery

446
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,810
during the operation.

447
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,740
I thought there should be another.

448
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,060
So I gave it a try.

449
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,800
Validated some of my own thoughts.

450
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:54,850
Mr. Li.

451
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,650
If there's a suitable
liver cancer patient

452
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,890
or prostate patient,

453
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,330
please let us know.

454
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,810
We've discovered

455
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,220
a brand new guidewire

456
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,410
intervention technique called Zheng.

457
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,460
To publish a paper on the subject,

458
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,700
we will need more patient cases.

459
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,370
So Mr. Li,

460
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,130
please.

461
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,600
Alright.

462
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,230
We'll be waiting for your news.

463
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:10,780
No problem.

464
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,780
Alright.

465
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,750
Right, I'll let you know

466
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,500
when and where.

467
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:14,980
Okay.

468
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:15,700
Alright, Zheng.

469
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,540
I'll see you tomorrow.

470
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,220
See you tomorrow.

471
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,060
Beida

472
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,500
needs a talented person like him.

473
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,330
Hello?

474
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,220
Ying.

475
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,070
Zheng Ren's team tackled

476
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,130
prostate interventional embolization

477
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,410
with domestic guidewire
at Beida Hospital.

478
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,540
What?

479
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,260
Domestic guidewire?

480
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,020
Yes.

481
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,170
How is that possible?

482
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,970
The report went out this morning.

483
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,700
I've sent it to your phone.
Check it out.

484
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:59,220
[Beida interventional team performing
interventional procedures]

485
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,460
Yeah, I'm almost out of the hospital.

486
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,460
I'm getting out of the hospital today.

487
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,700
What else is new?

488
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,090
What?

489
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,890
Zheng Ren and his guys made it?

490
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,610
Got it!

491
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,740
That brat

492
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,020
really made it!

493
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,370
I'm furious.

494
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,060
That's enough from you.

495
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,920
You're still so angry

496
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,410
at your age.

497
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,300
Dr. Zheng is great.

498
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,940
It's a great honor
for Haicheng Hospital.

499
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,460
I've heard

500
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,410
it's not an easy operation.

501
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,570
You should be

502
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,460
happy about that.

503
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,020
Yeah.

504
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,890
I have to be glad.

505
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,460
It's a good thing they're doctors
from Haicheng Hospital.

506
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,220
Otherwise,

507
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,020
I really can't do anything

508
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,370
about them.

509
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,220
Listening is one thing.

510
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,410
Mostly you have to watch.

511
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,060
Be sure to watch more videos.

512
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,790
How did we find the breakthrough?

513
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,980
It was watching videos.

514
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:07,890
Mr. Li.

515
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,020
Let me tell you something, Yun.

516
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,740
When the video of your surgery

517
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,650
came out,

518
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,610
our department

519
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,740
was shocked.

520
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,650
It's so awesome.

521
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,020
Here.

522
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,130
I must give you a toast.

523
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:23,540
Yun.

524
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,020
You're absolutely right.

525
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,260
Halfway through the meal

526
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,370
and he's reading.

527
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,090
He's so studious.

528
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,460
I'm not kidding you, right?

529
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,410
I'll learn from him.

530
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,650
Look at Zheng.

531
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,850
He's really hardworking.

532
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,940
Eat, but don't forget to study.

533
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,570
That's very diligent.

534
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,500
Zheng.

535
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,170
Have you thought

536
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,500
about coming to Beida?

537
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,220
Zheng.

538
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,500
Say yes. Come on.

539
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,370
Quick. Say yes.

540
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:55,740
Why?

541
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,570
Because we're Beida.

542
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,060
Don't you want to come to us?

543
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,650
Yeah.

544
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,980
It's Beida.

545
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:04,610
I'm sorry, Zheng.

546
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:05,890
Beida.

547
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,060
I've got a place for a doctorate,

548
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,280
if you want to come...

549
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:13,980
Don't want.

550
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,650
Aren't you trying to pump up the number

551
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,810
of surgeries for your thesis?

552
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,060
That's what Su Yun wants.

553
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,570
I'm not really interested.

554
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,170
But

555
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,700
if you have a patient,

556
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,540
I can always come here to operate.

557
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,540
I really don't get it.

558
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,740
Haicheng is so small,

559
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,650
with so few patients

560
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:39,980
and poor equipment.

561
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,330
Haven't you thought

562
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,810
about moving?

563
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,220
I had a deal with someone.

564
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:48,890
What kind of deal?

565
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,610
That's enough, Mr. Li.

566
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:54,650
Don't make it difficult for him.

567
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,940
I'd like a toast to you all.

568
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,890
Come!

569
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,270
Come on!

570
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,020
Thank you, everyone!

571
00:28:59,030 --> 00:28:59,680
Cheers!

572
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,940

Book me a ticket.

762
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,610

765
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,090
On this trip to Beida,

768
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,630
we've developed a new procedure.

Hua.

770
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,550
We need a lot of research cases.

771
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,500
I'm counting on you for this.

772
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,250
Oh, by the way.

773
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,420
Prostate intervention embolization

774
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,250
can also be carried out
in Haicheng Hospital.

775
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,770
Use the guidewire from this company.

776
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,520

[Feng Xuhui, Sales]

778
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,420
We tried it.

779
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,940
What happened?

780
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,250
We've come home victorious.

781
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,170
Why is the long face?

782
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,020
Mr. Dong died of an acute heart attack.

783
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,210
Mr. Dong?

784
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,880
The one who's going to invest

785
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,690
in our hospital?

786
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,770
So now what?

787
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,130
Any other candidates?

788
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,650
I'll see what I can do

789
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,690
about that.

790
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,090
There's something else
I need to ask you.

791
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,820
Do you want to join Zheng Ren's team?

792
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,570
When I asked you before,

793
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,650
you refused.

794
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,150
After this seminar,

795
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,690
you've made a difference together.

796
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,130
Did it change your mind?

797
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,540
I really think you two

798
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,020
complement each other.

799
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,420
Perfect for a partner.

800
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,460
But what am I supposed to do

801
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,130
within the team?

802
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,290
Conjoined twins separation surgery

803
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,060
requires a top cardiothoracic surgeon.

804
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,150

All this time
they've been waiting for you.

You know this very well.

808
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,090
Forget about it.

809
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,540
I don't want to take up
everyone's time.

810
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,250
OK.

811
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:45,820
So, do you

812
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,900
want to join the intervention?

813
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,570

814
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,570
no less gifted at intervention

815
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,090
than you are at cardiothoracic.

816
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,130
It's time to let go of the past

817
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,340
and set new goals.

Of course.

821

You're doing a great job in Emergency.

822
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,610
But at the moment, our hospital

823
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,460
is known for interventional procedures.

824
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,210
Just like you said,

825
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,250

dramatically in the future.
