Come.

382

Take me to your mom.

You can't go in there!

- It's dangerous in there!
- It's too dangerous!

407

It's dangerous inside!

408

- You must save her!
- Zheng Ren!

409

Have a break.

416
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,250
We'll do it.

417

But no one could save him.

Did you guys come with supplies?

427
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,080
The road collapsed and the car stopped.

428
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,110
That's all we can carry.

429
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,060
Fine.

443
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,430
Is there any more gauze?

444
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,240
Did you make the call?

445
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,300
When will the helicopter arrive?

446
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,130
I just got off the phone.

447
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,890
Because it's raining,

449

- Mr. Kong!

They brought supplies too.

452

That's great. Let's share it.

453

Go over there and take a look.

458

- Ruptured spleen. We have to operate.
- Found it.

460

Surgery?

461
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,940
There's only local anesthesia.

462
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,050
There was no anaesthesia

463
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:03,940

Is there any gauze left?

477
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,460
Give me the haemostat.

478
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,240
There's more.

Just a little longer.

490

Almost there.

491
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,480
This way. Hold on.
