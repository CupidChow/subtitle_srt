Once I'm done,
I'll find you a suitable partner.

Once you're done,

190

we'll have a celebration.

191

Yes.

Patient no. 38, Qin Liren.

193
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,150
Your surgery is about to begin.

194
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,910
Alright.

195
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,960
It's time to go.

196
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,750
Let's go.

197
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,810
Be careful.

198
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,550
Go slow,

199
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,480
why are you in a hurry?

200
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,240
Old man,

201
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,490
I'll take my leave first.

202

203
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,120
were you looking for me?

204
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,150
Dr. Chang,

205
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,320
could you help me

206
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,600
send this to Chengnan Primary

207
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,410
and pass it

208
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,790
to a female teacher named Li Hong?

209
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,150

named Li Hong?

210
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,390
Yes, thank you.

211

Don't worry.

212

Your surgery will start soon.

216

Alright.

217
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,200
I'm counting on you.

218

Don't worry.

I'm Li Hong.

222
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,240
Hi, Ms. Li.

223
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,440
Mr. Bai

224
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,320
asked me to pass this on to you.

225
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,840
Why did he not bring it himself?

226
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,480
Didn't you know?

227
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,600
He has liver cancer

228
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,790
and is undergoing surgery
at Beida Hospital.

229
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,000
Dear children,

230
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,270
Grandpa Bai is here

231
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,870
to chat with you again.

232
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,790
One of you asked me

233
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,000
via his letter.

234
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,550
Grandpa Bai,

235
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,670
why do we need to study?

236
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,670
Being like you is nice too, isn't it?

237
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,240
I thought about this for a while

238
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,510
and finally have an answer.

239
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,750
I would like

240
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,320
to share a true story

241
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,720
with everyone.

242
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,840
Once upon a time, there was a kid,

243
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,360
and his family was poor.

244
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,000
His father

245
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,440
pulled a rickshaw

246
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:39,870
and he,

247
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,720
at the age of 13,

248
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,510
had worked with his father.

249
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,120
They pulled rickshaws daily.

250
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,360
And can you guess what happened next?

251
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,150
The rickshaws were replaced

252
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,480
with the motor-generated ones.

253
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,750
A few years later,

254
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,720
the motor rickshaws
could no longer fetch people.

255
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,480
So, he started fetching goods,

256
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,910
and sold some cardboard and bottles,

257
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,750
to survive till today.

258
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,870
He's a lucky man.

259
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,390
Although he's not cultured,

260
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,030
he managed to earn money

261
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,960
and feed himself.

262
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,670
He was rich too.

263
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,150
But,

264
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,120
the world changed rapidly.

265
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,870
Physical labor

266
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,320
was slowly disappearing.

267
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,480
Thus,

268
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,150
my children,

269
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,270
do you know

270
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,030
why you need to study now?

271
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,920
[Study to realize dreams,
knowledge will change your fate]

272
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,200
The future is in your hands.

273
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,390
You have to do your best!

274
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,750
Mr. Bai

275
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,630
has lived a thrifty life,

276
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,270
pulling rickshaws
and selling recyclable items

277
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,630
for the past 20 years

278
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,320
to sponsor the children.

279
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,320
He kept saying

280
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,440
that he lived
a bitter uncultured lifestyle.

281
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,200
Hence, he wished
that the children could study well

282
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,750
and have a brighter future.

283
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,120
I did not know that he had liver cancer.

284
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,910
Will it be an easy surgery?

285
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,120
It will be a difficult one.

286
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,120
But we'll do our best.

287
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,000
Please...

288
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,480
Please do your best.

Are you dumb?

There's no such thing
as morning tea in the north.

295

Who are you rooting for?

296
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,630
Probably Jin.

297
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,270
Since he's Director Kong's

298
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,080

00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,160
Oh, no! Yun. It's bleeding.

379
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,480
Bleeding?

380
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,200
Calm down.

381
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:53,920
Yun, he fainted.

382
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,990
That's good.

383
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,580
Nurse,

384
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,700
call for the ambulance.

385
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,130
I guess it was an operation error.

386
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,000
Dr. Zheng,

387
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,120
something happened
in the operating room next door.

388
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:07,950
What is it?

389
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,240
Dr. Su's patient
didn't want to cooperate.

390
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,890
The guidewire punctured a blood vessel
while he was struggling.

391
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,840
Noted.

392
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,350
What bad luck.

393
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,830
It was supposedly the easiest surgery.

394
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,070
But the patient
didn't want to cooperate.

395
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,400
He reaps what he sows.

396
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,510
It's not the time to gloat.

397
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,110
If he hadn't overestimated his ability
and transferred to the Intervention.

398
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
If he and Zheng Ren

399
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,830
hadn't secretly swapped places,

400
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:36,700
and if he

401
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:37,950
had been nicer to the patient,

402
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,030
would all these have happened?

403
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,680
I thought he'd learned his lesson

404
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,000
after that incident,

405
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,480
but apparently not.

406
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,160
How dare you bring up that incident.

407
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,530
If you hadn't trembled from the start...

408
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,240
Wang Long!

409
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,790
Enough, all of you.

410
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,400
What's important now
is who will remedy this situation.

411
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,440
Who will do it?

412
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,000
I'll do it.

413
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,530
Yun,

414
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,350
his blood pressure is plummeting.

415
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,200
Enough, I'll take over.

416
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,960
This has nothing to do with you.

417
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,240
You can't do it.

418
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,720
I said it!
This has nothing to do with you.

419
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:25,770
Su Yun.

420
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,040
Stop being emotional.

421
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,850
Does your ego matter?

422
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,270
Or the life of the patient?

423
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,680
Did you think you could just
transfer to the Intervention?

424
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,670
You can't even hold a scalpel.

425
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,550
The guidewire is much harder
to use than a scalpel.

426
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,880
Move aside.

427
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,440
Leave the rest to me.

428
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,170
Director Kong has assigned to me.

429
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:32,680
You!

430
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,590
What are you doing?

431
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,240
You're dirty.

432
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,160
How could Su Yun
violate the operation regulations?

433
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,050
That's right.

434
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,310
I don't see any problem

435
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,450
with Zheng Ren
completing this operation.

436
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,180
Everyone here saw the previous surgery

437
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,480
completed by Zheng Ren, right?

438
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,070
Yes!

439
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,200
All eight tumors have been embolized

440
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,220
and the imaging shows

441
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,240
that the liver has no abnormality.

442
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:57,980
Thus,

443
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,260
we should let Zheng Ren complete

444
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,360
the Prostate Intervention
Embolization surgery.

445
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:03,390
You're too rash. It's only one surgery.

446
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,300
Director Kong,

447
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,810
among all the demonstration surgeries,

448
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:07,560
this is the hardest of them all.

449
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,880
And he only spent 50 minutes on it.

450
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,750
- Am I right?
- Yes.

451
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,200
Fine.

452
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,440
If he can remedy

453
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,240
this surgery,

454
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,240
I'll let him do it.

455
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,720
Contrast agent.

456
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,880
The bleeding has stopped.

457
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,550
Time to look for the renal artery.

458
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,830
The tumor-associated vessel

459
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,960
branches out from the renal artery.

460
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,790
The difficulty has doubled up.

461
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,750
Also, you didn't construct

462
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,240
a CT 3D reconstruction
for Qin Liren. Am I right?

463
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,860
At this rate,
not only will you miss breakfast,

464
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,350
but you can't even make it for lunch.

465
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,680
If it wasn't because of him
moving about,

466
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,270
I would have already finished it.

467
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,960
The accident has already caused.

468
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,560
Regardless of whether the patient
caused it,

469
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,310
the surgeon is the cause

470
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,550
or even

471
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:31,200
the surgeon's assistant.

472
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,680
But to be honest,

473
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,110
I envy you.

474
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,960
You're really lucky.

475
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,110
Cause you see,

476
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,920
there's always someone
who'll fix your mess.

477
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,480
Fine.

478
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,110
I'll leave this

479
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,750
to the handsome and tall scapegoat.

480
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,510
With this amount of time left,

481
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,350
I can probably perform

482
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:52,830
two or there operations.

483
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:54,720
Apply compression hemostasis.

484
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,440
Alright.

485
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:58,920
The surgery is done.

486
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,550
How is that possible?

487
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,590
Is it done?

488
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,970
This...

489
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,240
Has it only been five minutes?

490
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,340
I'm sure

491
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,990
no one will protest, right?

492
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,480
No...

493
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,440
Director Kong?

494
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,590
Fine.

495
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,400
I agree

496
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,590
to let Zheng Ren perform

497
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,440
the Prostate Intervention
Embolization surgery.

498
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,590
Should I say that,

499
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,720
fortunately, I did not disappoint you?

500
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,550
Alright.

501
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,340
[Emergency]

502
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,070
That's awesome.

503
00:23:58,990 --> 00:23:59,720
Good job everyone.

504
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,310
Zheng,

505
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,030
after discussing with Director Kong,

506
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,510
everyone decided

507
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,400
that you should be in charge

508
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,240
of the Prostate Intervention
Embolization surgery.

509
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:09,960
Thank you.

510
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,160
Zheng Ren shall be in charge,

511
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,480
and I shall monitor from the side.

512
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:14,480
Alright.

513
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:15,960
Yun,

514
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,480
you were lifeless before.

515
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,920
But now you're full of life again.

516
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,000
The incident in the past, what if...

517
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,750
You were great.

518
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,880
He's way better than Jin

519
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,310
and Fang Lin combined.

520
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,240
Then,

521
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,070
I'll look forward
to your performance

522
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,790
for the Prostate Intervention
Embolization Surgery.

523
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,880
We will succeed.

524
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,110
Yaowu.

525
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,310
They did their best.

526
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,720
But

527
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,550
you have a better platform

528
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,960
and a higher standard
of learning environment.

529
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,720
You'll have a brighter future.

530
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,160
Don't be too mindful of today's loss.

531
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,310
Sorry, Mr. Kong.

532
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,160
The next time,

533
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,030
I will not lose.

534
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,270
I always believe in you.

535
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:49,680
Do your best!

536
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:55,830
Let's go!

537
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,550
What's wrong? Do you have any questions?

538
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,030
What grudges do you have with Jin Yaowu?

539
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,480
I thought
you were not interested in anything

540
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,680
that is not medical-related.

541
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,240
We used to be colleagues in Beida.

542
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,790
If it wasn't because of him...

543
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,510
Forget it.
I don't want to talk about it.

544
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,030
Let's go.

545
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:15,750
Continue your story.

546
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,830
He was the one

547
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,560
who told the family

548
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,920
of the advanced-stage DCM patient

549
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,720
that Ms. Wu only completed
half of the operation

550
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,920
and a newbie took over after.

551
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,830
That newbie was me.

552
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,780
[Operation Room]

553
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,610
How was the surgery, Doctor?

554
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,510
How is it?

555
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:44,960
I'm sorry.

556
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,750
We did our best.

557
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,860
What do you mean?

558
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,430
My grandson was just born.

559
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,060
Scram!

560
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,270
Ms. Wu...

561
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,640
Ms. Wu!

562
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,100
Someone!

563
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:22,410
Please help!

564
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,880
Ms. Wu!

565
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,830
Quick! Someone!

566
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,880
The surgery took 11 hours.

567
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,350
Ms. Wu ate nothing

568
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,960
as she did the first ten hours
of the surgery.

569
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,310
I only took over
because she was exhausted.

570
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,590
But still,

571
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,460
she did not leave

572
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,400
and was instructing me on the side.

573
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,070
But the family was told

574
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,270
that we disregarded a human life

575
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,480
and that we were irresponsible.

576
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,880
As for Ms. Wu,

577
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,480
the prominent surgeon
of the Cardiac Department,

578
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:11,920
she can no longer

579
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,790
hold a scalpel because of this.

580
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,110
That's not all.

581
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,750
The most disappointing of all

582
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,200
was that you noticed

583
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,480
you were not as skillful
as you thought you were.

584
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,510
When you were being needed the most,

585
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,160
you kept making mistakes.

586
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,890
Just like the Batista surgery

587
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,310

00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,510
how are Dr. Wu's hands?

592
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,820
Yes, how are they?

It was you.

What did I do?

601
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,160
Were you the one
who told the patient's family

602
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,590
that the surgery was not done by Ms. Wu

603
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,720
and that I ruined everything?

604
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,640
I was telling the truth!

605
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,640

change my surgeon without telling me?

669
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,310
to let Zheng Ren perform the surgery.

00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,440
Mr. Qin,

671
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,480
if the surgery fails,

672
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,680
I would have immediately fired them

without needing your instruction.

674
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,550
But if it's a successful surgery,

675
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,350
I don't think the Board of Directors

676
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,640
would agree to it.

00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:33,510

762

763
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,400
Dr. Zheng,

764
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,840
I hope all these
could be of help to you.

765
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,000
These are very useful.

766
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,150
Let me take a look.

767
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,480
You don't need to.

768
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,630
Why so?

769
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:35,920
You're the one who said

770
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,590
you always mess up
during critical times,

771
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,360
and it has been decided

772
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,010
that I'll be in charge
of the experimental surgery.

773
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:40,960
It's a waste on you.

774
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,230
Dr. Zheng,

775
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:43,960
I'll help you.

776
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,000
Yiren!

777
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,360
Yue, let me take a look.

778
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,320
Dr. Zheng,

779
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,320
there are still these.

780
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,400
Dr. Zheng,

781
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,560
I have two more data here.

782
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:53,710
He, you too?

783
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,760
Fine!

784
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,030
Good job everyone!

785
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,960
Hua, I'm so annoyed.

786
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,440
Yun?

787
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,590
Why is it you?

788
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,550
Ms. Su is doing a check-up.

789
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,550
She did not bring her phone.

790
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,190
Check-up?

791
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,320
Is it her heart issue?

792
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,400
Yes,

793
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,110
the head of the Cardiac Department
is checking on her now.

794
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,550
What do you need?

795
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,630
I can pass on your message to her.

796
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,400
Hua,

797
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,240
just you see.

798
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,630
I'm going to make
the cardiac surgery here

799
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,500
the number one in the world.

800
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,670
Put on your flowery clothes

801
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,400
and wait for our successful return.

802
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,670
Of course.

803
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:54,710
It's fine.

804
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,880
Get her to recover well

805
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,200
and tell her

806
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,550
I'll return with success.

807
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:13,880
Listen up!

808
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,190
I will not make a blunder!

809
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,880
I will continue to practice

810
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,590
till I catch up to you!

812
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,590

813
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:28,800
Hold on,

814
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,190
do you know I'll come back?

815
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,070
Yes, I know you.

816
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:34,840
Then why did you

817
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,840
embarrass me?

818
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,670
There were so many people.

819
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,550
Yiren was also here.

820
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,840
He, and Chang Yue too.

821
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,950
- They're all...
- Enough with your acting.

822
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,510
Quickly start.

823
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:43,710
Alright.

824
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,540
[Ms. Su, if Su Yun calls you tonight,
don't pick up his call.]

825
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,480
It cannot be solved.

826
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,680
There's no way.

827
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,110
All the professor's studies

828
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,550
end here.

829
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,190
To achieve better results,

830
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,230
we'll need to open up
the branched vessels

831
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,760
and evolve them
into a network of capillaries.

832
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,070
Then, supply blood to the prostate.

833
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,280
Theoretically, it's not wrong.

834
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,280
But how is it possible?

835
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,110
The guidewire can't go through.

836
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,710
What are you looking at?

837
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,590
When a school of fish swims,

838
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,400
why isn't there any collision?

839
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,280
Because in their retinas,

840
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,150
there are cone cells

841
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,070
that help with their vision.

842
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:07,880
Also,

843
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:08,990
their body

844
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,320
has some sort
of vibration and pressure sensors

845
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,670
that allow them to detect

846
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,880
subtle changes in water pressure

847
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,230
to react correspondingly.

848
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,710
Which is either to avoid
or pounce on it.

849
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,510
But they do sometimes collide as well.

850
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,480
It's not always accurate.

851
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,360
What did you say?

852
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,920
I said they sometimes collide too.

853
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,800
Have you not heard of collision before?

854
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,150
For example, when a lot of fish

855
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,590
are swimming,

856
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,590
suddenly a huge shark approaches

857
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,360
and opens its mouth.

858
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,190
When I learned
interventional therapy from Mr. Bu,

859
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,230
he mentioned in his first lesson

860
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,810
that different guidewires were used

861
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,800
for different symptoms.

862
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,190
There were no perfect guidewires,

863
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,840
there were only perfect skills.

864
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,930
Bu doesn't necessarily
have the perfect skills.

865
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,550
But his lectures are great.

866
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,800
Then someone asked him,

867
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,280
what the perfect skill was.

868
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:51,800
He replied with,

869
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,630
the perfect craftsmanship.

870
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,590
Doesn't it mean mastering the patterns

871
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,670
while practice makes perfect?

872
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:58,550
No.

873
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,510
His point

874
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,550
was to cut through with a thin knife.

875
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,630
That is exactly how Rudolph did it.

876
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,800
If it can't go through
the blood vessels,

877
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,000
then we'll find a thinner guidewire

878
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:11,190
to enter through
a thinner arterial branch.

879
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,230
This is based

880
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,840
on selecting the right guidewire
according to its symptoms.

881
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,760
But what has it got to do with fish?

882
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,920
When you first touched a guidewire,

883
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,150
how did it feel?

884
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,630
Nothing.

885
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,440
It's far inferior to a lancet.

886
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,550
Be more serious.

887
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,590
Fine, I'll be more serious.

888
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,670
I think

889
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,670
that the guidewire is like a sword.

890
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,670
It removes the tumor

891
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,630
but leaves no traces.

892
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,760
Once it's removed,

893
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,150
it conceals fame and achievements.
