00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,260
One of them

194
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,330
is used by Dr. Liu from around here

195
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,920
for his operations.

196
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,260
The other is still unoccupied.

197
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,850
You can use it at any time.

198
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,420
Are there a lot of patients?

199
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,690
He means patients with fractured pelvis

200
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,900
who are suited
for interventional therapy.

201
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,660
There are many.

202
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,450
Dr. Liu can't get to everyone,

203
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,900
so most of them
have been transferred to Hexi.

204
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,330
During triage,

205
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,780
tell the doctors

206
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,950
to hold back

207
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,420
any patients
with severe pelvis fractures.

208
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,610
We can treat all of them.

209
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,660
We only have two

210
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,570
digital subtraction angiography
equipment.

211
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,500
I need them.

212
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,730
I'll assign them to you.

213
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,300
Okay.

214
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,420
Well?

215
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,180
You just arrived.

216
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,300
Do you need to rest for a while?

217
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:27,970
It's fine.

218
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,610
We just need a shower.

219
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,870
The water is cloudy here.

220
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,970
You can't shower in it.

221
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,300
It's fine. He can shower
with cloudy water.

222
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,210
He likes it.

223
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,420
Alright. The washrooms are over there.

224
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:40,810
Okay.

225
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:41,850
I'll look through the list

226
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,300
of severe patients and assign the ones
in greater danger to you.

227
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:44,780
Okay?

228
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,850
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Xie.

229
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,260
Don't call me Mr. Xie.

230
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,540
Just call me Uncle Ning.

231
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,380
Is it really okay for someone at my age
to call him that?

232
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,500
Why not?

233
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,570
What do you think?

234
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,850
How boring.

235
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,260
Boring?

236
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,060
Yun,

237
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,960
why does it feel

238
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,090
like Lin Yuan isn't
in a good mood today?

239
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,570
Something's on her mind.

240
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,500
Is that so?

241
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,500
500,

242
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,930
do you know that Mr. Xie?

243
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,420
How come you never mentioned him before?

244
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,970
Is the water okay?

245
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,330
It really is cloudy.

246
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,540
Take your time.

247
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,540
It has been tough.

248
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,380
Finally, we can look
at clear contrast images.

249
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,970
In the next surgeries,

250
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,780
you'll be my assistant.

251
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,610
Be your assistant?

252
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,780
No, no.

253
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,610
My hands have returned to grace.

254
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,610
Thank you, everyone.

255
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,780
Let me introduce you.

256
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,780
This is Dr. Liu Xuzhi

257
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,060
of the Interventional Department.

258
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,900
Zheng Ren.

259
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,300
Su Yun.

260
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,780
Lin Yuan.

261
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,960
Like the -rin in aspirin

262
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,570
and the second character
for the word "abyss".

263
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,780
Hello.

264
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,260
He Qian,

265
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,420
our anesthetist.

266
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,380
Hello.

267
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,380
Thank you for helping Dongyuan Township.

268
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,200
We have a lot

269
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,040
of patients with pelvis fractures

270
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,450
who need interventional therapy.

271
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,570
I hear Dr. Zheng is great at it.

272
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,810
Let me be your assistant.

273
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,180
I work on interventional
cardiovascular surgeries,

274
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,090
so I'm not very familiar
with interventional embolization

275
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,850
for pelvis fractures.

276
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,780
It's fine. You can learn as you go.

277
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:33,900
Alright.

278
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,970
You guys have a full team here,

279
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,140
so I'll work on my own.

280
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,380
Lin Yuan, come with me.

281
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,210
Let's get ready for the surgery.

282
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,090
Okay.

283
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,020
Do you know why I called you over?

284
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,330
Isn't it to be
your operating room assist?

285
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,900
I wouldn't dare

286
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,140
want a distracted first assist.

287
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,450
Why aren't you retorting?

288
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,210
This isn't like you.

289
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,570
Graduating from Harvard

290
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,300
and interning at Manou

291
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,760
were what I thought would

292
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,380
be the peak
of a medical intern's career.

293
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,140
However, this disaster

294
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,330
made me realize just how...

295
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,060
Useless.

296
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,020
Very useless.

297
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,420
Without precision instruments.

298
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,210
Without sufficient medicine.

299
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,260
Take away all benefits

300
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,210
from societal roles
and a civilized environment,

301
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,780
and what else can I do?

302
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,570
I can do nothing.

303
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,970
Why can Zheng Ren do it?

304
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,300
When Zheng Ren

305
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,850
mastered prostate
intervention embolization at Beida,

306
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,210
he gained an understanding

307
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,260
of a special intervention technique.

308
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,900
You mean Zheng's technique?

309
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,710
Do you know what is the key

310
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,540
to that technique?

311
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,060
What is it?

312
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,140
It's turbulence.

313
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,810
The turbulence is invisible

314
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,570
and almost impossible to feel

315
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,810
yet it actually exists

316
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,060
inside our blood.

317
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,920
Once you can feel it,

318
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,420
you can better control the guidewire.

319
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,140
So,

320
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,450
have you mastered it?

321
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,210
I have not,

322
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,930
but Zheng Ren has.

323
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,780
I don't know why either.

324
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,810
It depresses me too.

325
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,540
How do you overcome it?

326
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,900
I'm out of options.

327
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,850
Everyone goes
through different experiences.

328
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,330
What we like and yearn for

329
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,180
are different, too.

330
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,810
You like practicing medicine skills

331
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,690
because you want
to be better than your dad.

332
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,450
That's why you study and work hard.

333
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,260
You walk the path of an average doctor.

334
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,450
As for me,

335
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,930
I want to be the best doctor.

336
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,540
That's why I started

337
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,630
with the hardest difficulty,

338
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,060
heart transplant for mice.

339
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,060
However, do you know

340
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,020
how Zheng Ren came to be?

341
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,060
How?

342
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,970
I've looked at his resume.

343
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,140
Disaster relief

344
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,850
and supporting Tibet and Africa.

345
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,210
His skills

346
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,690
grew in extreme environments.

347
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,090
That is why

348
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:07,850
he does so well

349
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,090
and is faster
at understanding turbulence.

350
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,730
Extreme environments?

351
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,570
We are in an extreme environment now.

352
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,020
We can also see the goal.

353
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,210
Why are you spacing out?

354
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,540
We have a goal,
so let's pursue it together.

355
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,210
Next.

356
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,260
Twenty minutes.

357
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,500
A surgery in 20 minutes.

358
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,060
Dr. Zheng, you're amazing.

359
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,900
I thought this leg was a goner.

360
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:53,900
I didn't think

361
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,610
Dr. Zheng really saved it.

362
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,420
The most important attribute

363
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,970
in doctors

364
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,330
is the faith to keep others alive.

365
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,900
That is the meaning
behind our presence here.

366
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,260
Next.

367
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,130
Okay.

368
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,260
Stopped worrying?

369
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:12,890
I stopped worrying.

370
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,090
Very relaxed.

371
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,370
You don't need me here.

372
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,330
I'll continue next door.

373
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,130
The other operating room is being used.

374
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,540
Right.

375
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,610
Take a break.

376
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,540
Have some food.

377
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,060
Alright.

378
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:29,780
The switch.

379
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,740
Contrast.

380
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,090
Select.

381
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,460
Embolize.

382
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,410

over there.
