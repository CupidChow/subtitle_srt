00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,350
Why?

195
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,560
Why is it always

196
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,750
the anesthetics?

197
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,880
Let's call it a day.

198
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,660
Go back and tweak the protocol.

199
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,830
Come back when it's ready.

200
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,590
Sorry.

201
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,920
Anesthesiology wasn't well-prepared.

202
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,990
Thought I'd tweak it
when I got to the simulated surgery.

203
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,830
I've ended up delaying everyone.

204
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,320
We'll go back

205
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,130
and add options.

206
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,040
You really should have

207
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,990
prepared for this.

208
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,230
It's been hard work.

209
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,280
See you tomorrow.

210
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:50,990
Let's go.

211
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,280
He, stay here.

212
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,510
In all the simulations,

213
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,800
there was no problem
separating the liver.

214
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,280
But when it got to the heart,

215
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,750
it was all a bust.

216
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,230
I know.

217
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,080
Without a solution,

218
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,400
the operation couldn't continue.

219
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,400
For a while,

220
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,710
I've been thinking about this problem.

221
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,280
But when it comes to simulated surgery,

222
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,470
it's all wrong.

223
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,440
First is the anesthesia.

224
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,300
Then comes the intubation.

225
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,470
Now it's tachycardia.

226
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,590
We'll think of something.

227
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,990
Do some research.

228
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,080
There's a saying in anesthesiology.

229
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,750
There is no such thing
as the best technology.

230
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,590
Only the most suitable technology.

231
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:46,960
He.

232
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,710
I'm sure you'll find the perfect one.

233
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,470
We're going to make it.

234
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,280
Dr. Chang.

235
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,110
How are the conjoined twins today?

236
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,680
Younger one's heart rate is still high.

237
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,400
Especially when feeding

238
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,320
and sleeping,

239
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,830
she has shortness of breath
and excessive sweating.

240
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,440
But fortunately,

241
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,560
there's been

242
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,280
no increase in liver size

243
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,590
or decrease in urine output.

244
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,320
Yeah, I got it.

245
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,470
I'll let you know if anything comes up.

246
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,040
Alright.

247
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,160
Professor.

248
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,810
In this team,

249
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,340
you and I have the best rapport.

250
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,510
But in terms of

251
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,890
how we treat our team members,

252
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,500
we're very different.

253
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,020
I'm more subtle,

254
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,410
and you

255
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,980
are more direct.

256
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,980
So what you're saying

257
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,930
is that

258
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,050
I shouldn't have
scolded He Qian like that?

259
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,690
He's a colleague

260
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,220
and a friend.

261
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,930
We're all trying to figure out

262
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,460
what to do about arrhythmia
in the conjoined twins.

263
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,690
Everyone did their best.

264
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,740
But,

265
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,650
he's incompetent.

266
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,140
Zheng Ren's team

267
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,530
doesn't need incompetent people.

268
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,380
Let me tell you something.

269
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,260
I...

270
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,740
I can call

271
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,860
our anesthetist to come.

272
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,260
Foreign aid?

273
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,050
Fine.

274
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,620
Even if this one works,

275
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,620
what about the next one?

276
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,690
Do we have to ask you
for outside help every time?

277
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,050
Can they come every time?

278
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,740
That's why

279
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,730
I really

280
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,220
don't understand.

281
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,020
Why don't you go to Germany?

282
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,890
I don't think I'm communicating

283
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,050
with you that well either.

284
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:07,980
Ms. Su!

285
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,620
Bad news!

286
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,020
Qin Liren along with the shareholders

287
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,290
is on their way to the hospital.

288
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,460
You can go out first.

292
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,890
We're all busy.

293
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,860
So, let's get right to it.

294
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,930
Su Li.

295
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,500
And what are you going to tell

296
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,770
the shareholders?

297
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,050
If I remember correctly,

298
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,570
there's still a month to go

299
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,290
before the deadline.

300
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,410
But you sold some of the hospital's

301
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,380
fixed assets

302
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,690
at a discount

303
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,020
to invest

in new equipment

305
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,810
for conjoined twins separation surgery.

306
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,890
We had a third-party appraisal firm

307
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,220
to evaluate the project.

308
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:10,570
All of them think

309
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,890
it's high risk and low reward.

310
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:12,770
In no way feasible.

311
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,020
That's why

312
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,380
I've called

313
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,770
all the major shareholders here today

314
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,810
to stop the losses in time.

315
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:19,650
Is that right?

316
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,690
Yes.

317
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,620
Alright then.

318
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,340
Everyone.

319
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,340
Do you want to end the year

320
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,100
with a loss,

321
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,740
or do you want to turn the tide?

322
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,380
How do you turn it?

323
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,890
It's a bad operation.

324
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,380
It'll only sow a little profit.

325
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,740
You've invested 50 million in it!

326
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:40,890
So,

327
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,290
we've decided

328
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,620
to have the conjoined twins
separation surgery

329
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,170
put on live streaming.

330
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,690
Live streaming?

331
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,170
What does that mean?

332
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,570
Is it one of those

333
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,530
singing and dancing
live streaming on the internet?

334
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,340
Impossible!

335
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,290
This is a hospital.

336
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,810
I think it's a live demonstration

337
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,170
of a surgical live streaming.

338
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,020
Live streaming?

339
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,020
Is it profitable?

340
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,570
Of course it is.

341
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,290
This

342
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,940
is a worldwide live streaming
of a surgery.

343
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,370
If it works, it'll be
the first in the province.

00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,290

to the existing medical field.

346
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,900
Ning's Holding Group
will be investing in this.

with Haicheng Hospital.

348
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,700
They're done discussing it, too?

349
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,850
You're telling me

350
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,420
that Xie's going to invest
in this project?

00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:39,900
How's it going, everyone?

352
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,700
Should I make
a betting agreement with you?

353
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,500
If the surgery is successful,

354
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,660
the platform will use this

355
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,740
as a starting point for a series

of other surgeries.

- Yes.
- Right.

Fine.

they all turned against him.

384
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,290
Hua got a complete victory.

385
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:18,980
But

386
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,850
that also means

387
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,530
we can't lose.

388
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,810
Win is the only option.

[Conjoined Twins Separation Surgery

390
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,900
Liver simulations

391
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,530
confirmed that my plan works.

392
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,980
But the abdominal wall is linked.

393
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:32,980
So after separation,

394
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,500
the abdominal wall will have

395
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,500
an oval hole.

396
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,050
We've got the patch ready.

397
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,370
But there's no guarantee

398
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,840
that there's any risk

399
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,460
of future infection or after-effects.

400
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,500
So it's best to use

401
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,700
their own skin.

402
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,980
Because they only

403
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,660
have one belly button.

404
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,740
So I gave the belly button

405
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,900
to the older sister
who was in a better situation.

406
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,740
But I researched about it last night

407
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,370
and had a new idea.

408
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,850
Is it possible to split it into two?

409
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,260
After a surgical repair,

410
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,810
turn two halves of the navel

411
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,460
into two complete navels.

412
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,530
I think it can work.

General surgery report over.

414
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,090
Previously we overcame

415
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,940
problems with anesthetic dosage
and intubation.

416
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:05,900
But, because of the conjoined twins'

417
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,180
poor circulation between each other,

418
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,180
the transfusion of blood and fluids,

419
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,460
and the subsequent hypothermia,

420
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,770
make intraoperative monitoring

421
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,700
extremely difficult.

00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,460

and circulatory crossovers

425
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,020
will inevitably

426
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,180
lead to hypovolemic shock.

427
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,770
We'll think of another way

428
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:21,700
to try.

429
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,740

The point is, you're not doing
a very good job yourself.

Yes.

is a mere 15 minutes.

466
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,850

Don't say anything, He.

472

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,260
We had a good team

477
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,020
and he

478
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,500
had to push Yun out of it.

479
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,570
It's true that Yun is bad-tempered.

480
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,370
But he never shifts the blame.

481
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,940
If he didn't do well,
he would blame himself!

482
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,740
He wouldn't say the anesthesiology
was doing a bad job!

483
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,420
Much less like you!

484
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,850
All you think about is to steal
our knowledge and personnel.

485
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,130
Do you think he really wants

486
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,610
to help us in good faith?

487
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,260
He's trying to curry favor

488
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,330
with the judges who can help him
get to the top!

496
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,020
Professor.

497
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,660
Don't try to persuade me.

498
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,700
I know what you're going to say.

499
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,850
You'd prefer it to be Su Yun, too.

500
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,020
Is that right?

501
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,900
You don't have to keep it from me.

502
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,420
I heard

503
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,850
you chose cardiac surgery

504
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,500
for him.

505
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,740
Su Yun and I were classmates.

506
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,180
In primary school.

507
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,700
In secondary school.

508
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,130
In high school.

509
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,740
But not in college.

510
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,220
Because I didn't get in the first year.

511
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,260
I repeated.

512
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,770
And then I finally got in.

513
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,570
Su Yun

514
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,530
has already become my senior.

515
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,940
When I was a freshman,

516
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,980
couldn't memorize anything.

517
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,500
He was already selected by Dr. Wu

518
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,020
to conduct heart transplant experiments

519
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,420
on mice.

520
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,610
In my sophomore year,

521
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,050
he used that surgery

522
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,980
to publish a paper in the Lancet.

523
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,220
When I was a junior,

524
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,460
he was studying abroad.

525
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,130
When I graduated,

526
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,740
he got into Beida.

527
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,130
I realized

528
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,330
I couldn't keep up with him.

529
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,130
So I continued
to study to become a postgraduate

530
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,980
and joined Haicheng Hospital.

531
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,530
At that point, I thought

532
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,130
he might stay in Beida.

533
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,370
But I didn't think
after these twists and turns,

534
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,850
he'd come back.

535
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,770
And you say it wasn't for him?

536
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,660
It was for him at first.

537
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,900
But then,

538
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,370
I really liked cardiac.

539
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,900
Everyone said

540
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:54,130
it's a department with a bleak future.

541
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,940
Especially with the arrival
of minimal invasive techniques.

542
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:56,980
Cardiac surgeons

543
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,500
got even less work.

544
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,660
But I still like cardiac.

545
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,220
Father of surgery, Billroth said

546
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,020
surgery on the heart

547
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,180
is an affront to the art of surgery.

548
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,220
But three years later,

549
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,330
German doctor Rehn,

550
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,370
at the risk of blasphemy,

551
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,660
succeeded

552
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,130
in stitching up a patient

553
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,810
with heart trauma.

554
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,350
In 1944,

555
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,980
Dr. Blalock

556
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,840
performed a B-T shunt

557
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,130
on a baby

558
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,460
with a congenital heart malformation

559
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,850
to keep him alive.

560
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,570
In 1958,

561
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,980
a heart-lung machine was developed.

562
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,370
Throughout all these,

563
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,260
no department

564
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,530
is more adventurous,

565
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,700
more twisted,

566
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,420
more whimsical than cardiology.

567
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,850
The process of fighting stereotypes,

568
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,290
battling poor imaginations,

569
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,420
and failing over and over again

570
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,530
is enough

571
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,980
to make one's blood boil.

Is there a more beautiful picture

575
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,740
in this world

576
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,290
than a beating heart?

577
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,370
Not in my book.

578
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,740
Not in my book

579
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,370
as well.

580
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,180
That's why

is the image that I wanted
to see the most!

585
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,370
It's the reason I'm in this surgery.

586
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,370
It's not for Su Yun.

587
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,420
I'd love to help you

588
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,740
realize that image,

589
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,420
but I don't think I can.

590
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,940
That guy, He.

591
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,500
What he said

592
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,260
was hurtful,

593
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,700
but part of it was true.

594
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,130
I feel like

595
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,770
I don't fit in

596
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,610

00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,900
Even though I speak Chinese

00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,130
and even Northeastern,

599
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,220
it's not the same.

600
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,610
Maybe if I give it a few more years,

601
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,810
this feeling will go away.

602
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,740
But in just a few days,

603
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,420
it's impossible

604
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,290
to get rid of this feeling.

we've achieved these words?

During liver separation,

611
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,020
I often didn't get it right

612
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,980
and slowed down the progress.

613
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,660
Why didn't you point it out?

614
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,370
You realized it now, didn't you?

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,130
It doesn't help
if I'm the one realizing it.

We're a team.

617
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,130
A team needs to communicate.

618
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,420
But you didn't say a word.

619
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,850
You make me feel like

620
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,330
it's okay if we can't get it right

I'm not a companion.

I'm just an instrument.

You've actually done well enough.

I don't need your encouragement.

It's true.

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,130
We were slow,

638
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,900
but we were steady.

639
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,810
I think being steady is more important
than just being fast.

640
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,610
In some ways,

641
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,900
my problems are much worse than yours.

642
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,940
Because I often feel like

643
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,020
even though I'm the core of the team,

644
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,050
I'm still failing.

645
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,050
What do you mean?

646
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,370
I mean...

647
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,900
I mean I know how to distribute,

648
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,290
but don't know how to coordinate.

649
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:23,980
Just like...

650
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,220
Just like what happened today.

651
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,730
I should've been the first one

652
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,820
to stop Rudolph

653
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,700
from arguing with He Qian.

654
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,570
I...

655
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,180
I'm supposed to solve their troubles.

656
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,700
But I didn't.

657
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,880
I've always felt

658
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,910
that Rudolph is unspeakably awkward

659
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,020
on our team.

660
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,900
But I don't know how to fix it.

661
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,330
In my mind,

662
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,850
I think Su Yun is a better fit

663
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,900
for this team than Rudolph.

664
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,770
But I don't know

665
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:45,850
how to get him back.

666
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,090
There are many, many things like this

667
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,370
that I don't know how to fix.

668
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,900
Just like you're asking me

669
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,530
why I don't scold you.

670
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,530
I've...

671
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,940
I've never scolded others before.

672
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,770
Frankly,

673
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,530
this is the first time I've heard you
ask for something like this.

674
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,610
Then be more honest and tell me

675
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,810
what my problem is.

676
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,290
Don't rush.

677
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,260
In surgery,

678
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,770
speed is not everything.

679
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,220
I especially understand your mentality.

680
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,180
But you can't get there in a hurry.

681
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,770
In the 29th simulation,

682
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,420
at 39 minutes 14 seconds,

683
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,570
you were desperate.

684
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,740
You tried to bypass the gallbladder

685
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,500
but ruptured a blood vessel.

686
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,900
We spent two minutes

687
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,130
on this blood vessel.

688
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:51,740
Lin Yuan.

689
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,700
I want a stable,

690
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,330
constant state

691
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,330
for this operation.

692
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,260
I chose you

693
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,660
because you're the most stable.

694
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,940
And once you started to get unsteady

695
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,020
in your quest for speed,

696
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,700
that feeling disappeared.

697
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,810
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

698
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,850
I'd have changed it
if you told me sooner.

699
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,290
That's the benefit
of being honest early on.

700
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,050
Yes.

701
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,090
This is really my problem.

702
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,020
Zheng Ren.

703
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,810
When I first saw you operate,

704
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,020
I wished I could work with you

705
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,220
to save lives.

706
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,260
There's just something about you

707
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,050
that makes people want to go with you.

708
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:40,980
So,

709
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,180
you'd be a good leader.

710
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,220
As long as you're willing

711
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,570
to talk to everyone openly and honestly,

712
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,370
everyone

713
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,090
will be willing to help you

714
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,850
and cooperate with you.

715
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:52,810
I'm...

716
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,180
I'm used to being on my own.

717
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,740
I really don't know

718
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,940
how to talk to people.

719
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,570

and all that sort of kit.

723
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,700
I'll study hard.

724
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,370
That kind of toolkit

725
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,290

separation surgery,

732
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,980

733

Why?

734
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,330
I'm not sure

735
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,180
I can fit in with your team

736
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,700

737
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,820
I'm also not sure

738
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,610
I can make the separation in 15 minutes.

739
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,020
As much as I want

740
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,460
to be the main operator,

741
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:18,780
Zheng was right.

742

747
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,300
Can you do it?

748
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,460
I'll try to do better than you.

749
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,340

751
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,210
Actually,

752
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,940
this is something I'm supposed to do.

753
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,420
But I didn't know how to ask.

754
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,460

756
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,460
You need Su.

757
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,780
He

758
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,780
is your throat.

759
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,900
I am his brain.

760
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,050
