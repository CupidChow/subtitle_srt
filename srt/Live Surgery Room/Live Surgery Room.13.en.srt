00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,120
be a bacterial infection?

196
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:25,680
No.

197
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:26,680
The scans are fine.

198
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,710
But that old woman

199
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,350
is weak from vomiting.

200
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,230
We've just been notified

201
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,680
over 100 more family members

202
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,160
of the workers

203
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,080
are showing the same symptoms.

204
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,280
How are the staff in contact
with the patients?

205
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,800
No abnormalities yet.

206
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,960
I'll head back.

207
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,560
Are you okay?

208
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,080
I'm fine.

209
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,560
Hey, Mr. Pan.

210
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,750
We're already preparing.

211
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,160
Okay. Got it.

212
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,830
The city mayor has instructed experts

213
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,230
from the guide groups to rush over

214
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,920
to consult with the hospitals

215
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,470
so that we can
find out the cause of the illness.

216
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,990
The guide group's leader

217
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,710
wants our hospital

218
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,080
to retrieve samples from the scene

219
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,110
for lab testing.

220
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:05,960
Yun,

221
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,080
transfer the vomiting patients

222
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,160
into the Emergency Department.

223
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:08,960
Treat them in quarantine.

224
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,510
Okay.

225
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,960
Before we find the cause
of their illness,

226
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,750
we'll try to stay in control

227
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,320
until the experts arrive.

228
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,320
Emergency Department staff
will have to work hard.

229
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,630
Be on shift for 24 hours.

230
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,920
No one is to go in or out
as they please.

231
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,470
Yes.

232
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,830
Su Yun,

233
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,230
go with Chang Yue
to the patients' homes.

234
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,510
Check their food.

235
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,830
Perhaps we'll have some new discoveries.

236
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,200
I leave the Emergency Department to you.

237
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:26,920
Be quick.

238
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,280
Yue, let's go.

239
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:38,830
Hello?

240
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,470
Li,

241
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,510
I heard from Mr. Pan

242
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,800
the mass incident has worsened.

243
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,560
We're searching for the cause.

244
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,750
Don't forget to come back

245
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,710
for your follow-up in five days.

246
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,920
I remember. See you in five days.

247
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,080
See you in five days.

248
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,390
Don't move.

249
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,340
Ms. Su,

250
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,490
you can't move right now.

251
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,250
Get a stretcher

252
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,080
and send her to Emergency.

253
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,930
Emergency?

254
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,990
Why to the Emergency?

255
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,610
I suspect
you suffered a sudden heart attack.

256
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,200
500? Speak.

257
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,200
What? Heart attack?

258
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,890
Get operating.

259
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,920
I'll handle the procedure once I'm back.

260
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,160
Hey, Zheng Ren.

261
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,320
Please.

262
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,680
Who has a heart attack?

263
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,040
Hua.

264
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,230
Her heart had no issues.

265
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,870
It must be due to exhaustion.

266
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,040
Hua is too stubborn.

267
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,200
She could have

268
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,280
chosen a more carefree life.

269
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,510
Do you know

270
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,560
why I call her Hua?

271
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,710
The hospital

272
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,200
is the most painful place on earth.

273
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,350
Despairing patients,

274
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,320
stunned family members,

275
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,590
exhausted doctors,

276
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,630
and haggard nurses.

277
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,830
When you're there,

278
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,230
the only thing left in the mind

279
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,960
is to keep living.

280
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,440
Keep living, not live.

281
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,710
I don't just want to survive.

282
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,590
I want to live.

283
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,750
That's right.

284
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,590
It's why

285
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,800
I must doll myself up.

286
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,800
I want everyone to know

287
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,920
what it's like to live.

288
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,510
Only by seeing the beauty in life

289
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,920
can you endure the torment of living.

290
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,830
Don't worry.

291
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,560
She'll be fine.

292
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,990
It's a family of three.

293
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:36,870
The place is so small.

294
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,630
There's not even a room divider.

295
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,200
How do they live?

296
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,040
Family dorms are all like this.

297
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,560
They just need shelter.

298
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,750
We need to find what poisoned them

299
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,710
to find the right cure.

300
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,800
Don't miss out on anything.

301
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,350
Keys.

302
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,800
Have you found anything?

303
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,350
No. Just some samples.

304
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,040
What about you?

305
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:09,750
Nothing.

306
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,200
Hello?

307
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,590
I see.

308
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,800
Okay.

309
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,440
What is it?

310
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,710
You tell me.

311
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,990
I can handle it.

312
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,560
Two out of three coronary arteries
are blocked.

313
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,870
The operation was a success.
Don't worry.

314
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:41,680
You talk so slowly

315
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,830
that has me scared.

316
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,160
Come on. Next place.

317
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,780
[Operating]

318
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,710
Two out of three coronary arteries
are blocked.

319
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,830
Thank goodness we made it in time.

320
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,470
If we had been slower,

321
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,870
Ms. Su wouldn't be able

322
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,960
to meet the experts.

323
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,960
I'm wide awake.

324
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,400
Ms. Su,

325
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,510
I did say we found out in time, right?

326
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,320
When you're in surgeries,

327
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,160
do you also talk

328
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,990
to the patients?

329
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,830
I'm livening up the atmosphere.

330
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:09,960
Ms. Su,

331
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,680
do you want to install stents?

332
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,350
Don't install stents.

333
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,590
I feel much better now.

334
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,230
When can I get up?

335
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:17,710
Ms. Su,

336
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,110
your injuries may be light
but you're not in the clear yet.

337
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,080
You can't do that.

338
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,710
So many people outside are waiting
to be transferred in,

339
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,280
yet I'm lying here.

340
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,040
I even waste your time.

341
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,560
I can't accept it.

342
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,590
Ms. Su, if you don't want
to install stents,

343
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,800
we'll send you to the ward soon.

344
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,400
I have to be hospitalized?

345
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,870
You don't want the third artery

346
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,870
to be blocked too, right?

347
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,510
Don't jinx it.

348
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,230
Okay.

349
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,990
How's the situation outside?

350
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,630
Keep me updated.

351
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,630
Do you hear me?

352
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,080
We hear you.

353
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,440
Have you slept?

354
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:07,710
I'm not tired.

355
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,560
Have you slept?

356
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,470
I'm not tired too.

357
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,440
Everyone,

358
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,230
I come from Beida Hospital.

359
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,400
I'm the deputy leader
of the guide group,

360
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,800
Kong Yumin.

361
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,200
I'm here in Haicheng

362
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,920
to lead the group

363
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,710
on the mass poisoning.

364
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,870
Please speak up in order

365
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,400
to express your views.

366
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,590
Let's brainstorm

367
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,920
and find the truth as soon as we can.

368
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,320
We have all the samples. Let's go.

369
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,600
I went through our list

370
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,830
of samples to collect.

371
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,680
Over a hundred individuals
were vomiting.

372
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,440
Other than water,

373
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,350
there's nothing in their food

374
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,650
that matches with each other.

375
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,200
If it's a problem with the water,

376
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,200
it's impossible

377
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,320
for just one area's residents
to be poisoned.

378
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,830
Say,

379
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,160
when something big happens,

380
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,290
how do you think the factory

381
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,710
notifies all the people living here?

382
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,800
Call them one by one?

383
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,160
No need to call.

384
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,080
Just shout through the loudspeaker,

385
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,200
and everyone will know.

386
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,680
That's true.

387
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,870
How did you know?

388
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,040
I've lived here before.

389
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,400
You really don't know me well.

390
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,400
Let's go.

391
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,500
[Do not use gas]

392
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,580
[Medical Record]

393
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,080
To sum everything up,

394
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,350
everyone unanimously agrees

395
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:47,680
that it's food poisoning.

396
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,440
Well, we still need to investigate

397
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,870
what food it is.

398
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,680
Where did Zheng Ren go?

399
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,440
Why isn't he back yet?

400
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,320
I don't know.

401
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,920
Do you feel better now?

402
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,030
Vomit here.

403
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,550
Zheng Ren.

404
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,880
Well? What discoveries?

405
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,990
We've brought back some food.

406
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,160
Chang Yue is sending it to the Center
for Disease Control and Prevention

407
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:40,920
for testing.

408
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,470
I hear the guide group

409
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,230
arrived early.

410
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,470
How's the discussion?

411
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,510
I didn't sit in.

412
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:46,750
As expected of you.

413
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,960
I have made no other discovery.

414
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:49,990
What do we do next?

415
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,710
Well,

416
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,120
we can only use our last move.

417
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,940
[Su Yun: No obvious reasons found.]

418
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,540
[Be prepared for the worst.]

419
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,440
Dear leaders and experts,

420
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,270
let me introduce myself.

421
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,360
I'm Lin Ge, the Vice President

422
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,070
of Haicheng Hospital.

423
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,200
It looks like

424
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,470
all of our opinions

425
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,550
are one and the same.

426
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,310
If the problem

427
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,120
is not in the food,

428
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,200
then the only possibility

429
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,990
is a large-scale infectious disease.

430
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:37,790
Everyone,

431
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:39,990
we must always

432
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,440
be prepared for the worst.

433
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,990
To avoid any chances

434
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,640
of an outbreak,

435
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,120
Haicheng Hospital

436
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,600
will have all our staff

437
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,790
undergo quarantine

438
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:54,200
in our Emergency Department.

439
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,030
During this time,

440
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,680
we can contact each other
through the Internet.

441
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,360
Every day,

442
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,920
we'll keep you updated

443
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,400
on the victims' symptoms.

444
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,400
As for the medicine needed

445
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,360
and ways to diagnose a person,

446
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,270
we can still contact
through video conferencing

447
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,070
to communicate with each other.

448
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,310
Except for the possibility

449
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,030
of a large-scale viral outbreak,

450
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,920
as the vice president of this hospital,

451
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,270
I will work hard in the front lines

452
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,200
to serve as backup.

453
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,200
To avoid any uncontrollable situation.

454
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,310
I have a question.

455
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,550
What if it's an unknown viral disease?

456
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,440
What do we do?

457
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,790
We have prepared

458
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,120
the protective wear.

459
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,070
Until now,

460
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,790
we have

461
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,920
accepted 52 patients of this kind.

462
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,990
Haicheng Hospital,

463
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,920
as the isolation unit for this disease,

464
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,030
we will do our best

465
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,160
to kill the disease here.

466
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,270
Sir, please approve it.

467
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,270
Lin really

468
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,990
is quite dependable

469
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,680
when push comes to shove.

470
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,030
What does everyone think?

471
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,230
I think

472
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,440
that Mr. Lin has a great idea,

473
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,120
but

474
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,360
things might not

475
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,680
have developed so far, right?

476
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,400
Can we

477
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,230
keep searching?

478
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,880
What if the disease spreads?

479
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,710
Who will be responsible?

480
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,750
How about this?

481
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,550
If there are no objections,

482
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,270
the guide group

483
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,750
will be based in Haicheng

484
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,510
to fight with Haicheng Hospital

485
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,440
until the danger is over.

486
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,880
I have no objections.

487
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,110
Youhao Hospital

488
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,160
will send our medical team

489
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,670
to fight beside our comrades

490
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,710
at Haicheng Hospital.

491
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,750
I have no objections either.

492
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,800
We at Haicheng No. 5 Hospital

493
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,160
will also fight with everyone.

494
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,200
Let me make a statement.

495
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,230
Before we came here,

496
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,440
we were already prepared for this.

497
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,400
We have no objections either.

498
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,470
We have no objections either.

499
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,230
Please sit.

500
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:13,790
Everyone,

501
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,790
I trust you all

502
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,160
to remember

503
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,960
the massive outbreak

504
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,470
from 14 years ago, right?

505
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,400
Don't let your guard down.

506
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,470
Plan for the worst.

507
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,640
Fight the hardest battle.

508
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,400
No problem, right?

509
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,400
No problem.

510
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,750
Okay. Dismissed.

511
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,120
Kong, you are...

512
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,920
We are brothers in arms,
my old classmate.

513
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,200
Reject all news interviews.

514
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,030
Safety is our utmost priority.

515
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,190
But Sun Zeli

516
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,240
has already reported on it...

517
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,030
Go tell her,

518
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,070
that's all for now.

519
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,400
Also, notify everyone

520
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,790
to call their families

521
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,560
and say goodbye.

522
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,880
Tell them the staff can't go home

523
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,550
in the next few days.

524
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,310
Remember.

525
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,070
Don't let anything slip.

526
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:30,790
Okay.

527
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,070
Then...

528
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,840
Can we go back?

529
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,120
I don't know.

530
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:39,920
Don't be scared.

531
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,070
After all, we have all

532
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,470
done the emergency drill many times.

533
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,030
During the massive outbreak
14 years ago,

534
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,880
we couldn't make it.

535
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:47,680
So many of our seniors

536
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,160
gave themselves to protect us.

537
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:49,990
This time,

538
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,270
it's our turn

539
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,510
to protect the next generation.

540
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
For our family.

541
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,510
For family.

[Don't let it slip even though
you may not say goodbye to your mom.]

545
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,720
There's a complex case.

I'll have to work with our daughter

to figure it out.

548

For the next few days,

549
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,270
we'll be staying in the hospital

550
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,200
and not going home.

That's great!

00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,990
I can't believe there would be a day.

554
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,440
Hurry. Take this chance
to repair your relationship.

Must you be a doctor?

558
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,160
Yes.

559
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,640
It's very tough.

560
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,680
What job isn't tough?

561
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,120
It's also very dangerous.

562
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,920
What job isn't dangerous?

563
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,960
Because I'm a doctor,

to continue down this path.

566
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,880
Quit then.

567
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,230
I'll believe you
when you're not a doctor.

568
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,030
You can't even do it.

569
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,270
Why should I give up?

570
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,470
It's not fair.

571

What are you scared of?

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,640
You were afraid

574
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,750
we would die here together,

00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,550
leaving Mom alone.

576
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,440
Hello?

577
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,600
Baby,

578
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,120
is that you?

579
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,310
I just knew

580
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,030
you would call me.

581
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,920
Your dad told me

582
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,160
you'll be working together.

583
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,470
If you team up,

584
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,750
you'll be invincible.

585
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,440
Baby,

586
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,640
once you come back victorious,

587
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,990
I'll make your favorite dishes.

588
00:25:59,310 --> 00:25:59,960
Wonton.

589
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,680
I want wonton.

590
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:05,470
Mom.

591
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,070
Okay.

592
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,510
I'll make you wonton.

593
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,070
Get back to work with your dad.

594
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,260
[Mom]

595
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:05,880
Meimei,

596
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,360
study hard.

597
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,710
Prepare for the semester exams.

598
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,600
Once I get home,

599
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,550
I'll give you a huge present.

600
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:15,550
Okay.

601
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,600
I'll end the call

602
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:18,990
and eat my meal.

603
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,030
Bye.

604
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,980
[I'll be working overtime
at the hospital for a week.]

605
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,160
Hey, Mom.

606
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,640
Don't worry.

607
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,440
I can rest after this period.

608
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,270
I will be able to go on that date.

609
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,200
Take good care of yourself.

610
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:35,710
Relax.

611
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,990
The hospital has a lot of girls

612
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:37,840
who like me.

613
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:39,840
Okay.

614
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,990
I'm hanging up.

615
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,520
He's burning up.

616
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,360
Let me take a look.

617
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,070
Don't rush.

618
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,330
Test him again.

619
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,050
Remember to drink more water, okay?

620
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,230
I'm sorry.

621
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,510
I asked you to help, but...

622
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,990
I'm already here,

623
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,120
so let's work hard.

624
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,960
If anything happens to us,

625
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,030
you can still save me.

626
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,070
I can't go back

627
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,200
and risk my mom, right?

628
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,120
Look.

629
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,160
It's not bad.

630
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,160
My next month's grant...

631
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:46,780
Don't worry.

632
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,610
It will be fine.

633
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,280
I...

634
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,560
I suddenly thought,

635
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,640
why do the studious type like you

636
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,680
insist on being a doctor

637
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,230
instead of anything else?

638
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,470
You can't eat or sleep well.

639
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,400
You stay up late and work late.

640
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,680
There's even a risk of infection.

641
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,270
Also,

642
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,600
we'll meet family members like you

643
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,600
who are unreasonable.

644
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,270
Actually,

645
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,510
being alive is already

646
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,920
quite hard to do.

647
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,270
We work hard

648
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,680
because we want more people

649
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,880
to live on

650
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,710
in good health.

651
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,030
Aren't you the same?

652
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,210
Does anything else hurt?

653
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,000

655
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,680
You shouldn't come out.

656
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,120
Go home and rest.

657
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,230
Do you have anything

658
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,120
you want to say to me?

659
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,840
I pledge myself
to the medical profession,

660
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,510
to respect my mentors

661
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,680
and uphold the ethics of the profession.

662
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,270
I will do everything in my power

663
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,840
to eliminate diseases

664
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,030

00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,030
always comes first.

669

Sixteen years ago,

00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,160
Haicheng couldn't

671
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:56,960
properly handle the massive outbreak.

672
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,600
This time is different.

673
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,680
Please witness

674
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,600
this day for yourself.

675
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,500

00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,160
Nothing wrong with this.

Well, comrades?

681
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,600
Any new discoveries?

682
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,440
There are no problems at all

683
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,880
except for the nausea.

684
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,270
I believe it's likely to be hysteria.

685
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,120
Hysteria?

686
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,120
After a whole day of discussion,

687
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,880
that's it?

688
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,710
What else?

689
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,750
What ideas do you have?

690
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,960
Either way, it can't be hysteria.

691
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,200
Why can't it be?

692
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,840
Hysteria is a mental illness.

693
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,680
It's a mental disorder

694
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:36,270
that makes them ill

695
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,600
due to a conflict between reality

696
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,990
and what they think

697
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,310
through suggestions
by others or themselves.

698
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,440
Prodigies are one of a kind.

699
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,470
You recite that bit so easily.

700
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,270
However, that's only if they're alone.

701
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,750
It doesn't happen
in groups of two or three,

702
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,270
let alone in over 100 people at once.

703
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:47,990
Of course it does.

704
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,600
It's mass hysteria.

705
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,360
What?

706
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,710
Summer of 1518.

707
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,880
It happened in Strasbourg.

708
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:55,840
Out of nowhere,

709
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,510
the dancing plague appeared.

710
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,270
Do you remember?

711
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,070
No.

712
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,640
A woman started to dance

713
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,160
down the street.

714
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,360
After four days of dancing,

715
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,200
the number of people dancing

716
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,270
reached 30 to 40.

717
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,640
Within a month,

718
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,550
over 400 in the city

719
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,310
had started dancing.

720
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,030
The entire city was congested.

721
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,470
It sounds fake.

722
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,640
It's not fake.

723
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,200
Mass hysteria

724
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,230
mainly happens in schools and factories,

725
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:13,990
places with strict rules

726
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,270
and high stress.

727
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,710
Have you watched Forrest Gump before?

728
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,230
I have.

729
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,790
Many people started running

730
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,360
alongside Forrest.

731
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,600
Don't you find that strange?

732
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,310
That was an artistic expression.

733
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,270
I don't think so.

734
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:24,510
Sometimes,

735
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
a powerful psychological suggestion

736
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,030
and certain factors

737
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,600
could lead to strange situations.

738
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:29,600
For example?

739
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,750
An animation.

740
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,840
You watch animated shows?

741
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,840

00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:33,920
At 6:30 PM

743
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,880
on 16 December

744
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,680
1997,

745
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,880
a lot of people

746
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,360
were watching the 38th episode

747
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,990
of the latest hit animation series.

748
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,360
The Porygon episode.

749
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,880
He not only remembers the name

750
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:44,960
and which episode.

751
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:45,960
But he also knows

752
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,070
exactly when and what

753
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:47,920
it was shown.

754
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,510
At around

755
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,600
6:50 PM,

756
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,120
the screen turned very bright

757
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,160
from the special effects.

758
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,960
Then, the kids started showing symptoms

759
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,270
from difficulty breathing

760
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,230
to nausea and cramps

761
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,270
to hallucinations and more.

762
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,200
Within half an hour,

763
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,550
over 600 children

764
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,550
were sent to the hospital for treatment.

765
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,270
Back then, they were diagnosed

766
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,510
with photosensitive epilepsy.

767
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,550
The cause was the special effects

768
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,310
within the show.

769
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:05,960
That's right.

770
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,030
It's because

771
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,760
of an animation technique known
as "paka paka".

772
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:09,510
Simply put,

773
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,150
swapping repeatedly

774
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,510
between different colored lights

775
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,550
would create a tense atmosphere.

776
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,110
Just like this.

777
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,030
While that does not explain

778
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:16,920
why the first batch of kids

779
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,920
would be affected,

780
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:18,960
since everyone was watching at home

781
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,760
by themselves.

782
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,880
But the current research

783
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,630
is leaning toward

784
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,760
an example

785
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,670
of mass hysteria.

786
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:30,800
Listening

787
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,920
to your discussion

788
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,360
makes me feel like I studied seven years

789
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,240
for nothing.

790
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,150
Yue,

791
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,070
could you understand them?

792
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:38,840
Wait,

793
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:39,920
so you think this time

794
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,630
the families are vomiting

795
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,400
not because of an unknown bacteria,

796
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,440
but because it's mass hysteria?

797
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:45,960
Yes.

798
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,110
When we meet the guide group,

799
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:47,990
will you say that too?

800
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,990
That's the guide group.

801
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,800
They're the best experts in the country.

802
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:53,670
What about it?

803
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:54,760
We're all doctors.

804
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,670
We're all here to treat the patients.

805
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,510
I believe it's mass hysteria.

806
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,240
Argue if you disagree.

807
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:06,720
Wait.

808
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,470
I suddenly thought of evidence.

809
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:09,720
What evidence?

810
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,760
Ignore me. Go in first.

811
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,760
Chang Yue, come with me.

812
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,440
Currently,

813
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,470
we have excluded food poisoning.

814
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,840
All that's left are infectious diseases.

815
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:23,960
As of right now,

816
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,880
we've not detected any viruses.

817
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:30,840
It's not a virus.

818
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,720
It's mass hysteria.

819
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,590
You are...?

820
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,360
He's Zheng Ren,

821
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,150
the head
of the Interventional Department

822
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,070
at Haicheng Hospital.

823
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,320
The young know no fear.

824
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:53,990
Very courageous.

825
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:55,510
Alright.

826
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:56,670
Tell us then.

827
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,760
Why is it mass hysteria?

828
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,150
I believe it's mass hysteria

829
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,110
because there are similar examples
in the past.

830
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,720
At 6:30 PM

831
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,760
on 16 December

832
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,760
1997...

833
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,440
Hurry.

834
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,320
Are you sure it can be used?

835
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:12,960
I'm certain.

836
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:13,800
I've played it before.

837
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,280
I'll search this side.

838
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:14,800
You search that side.

839
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,840
Even now, mass hysteria

840
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,240
is an illness

841
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,630
without logical explanation.

842
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,440
Those who research this phenomenon,

843
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,110
the doctors,

844
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,720
philosophers, and anthropologists,

845
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,320
have not been able to correctly

846
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,510
define mass hysteria.

847
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,990
is contagious,

848
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,760
but that does not mean

849
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,840
mass hysteria

850
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,110
is dreamed up by the patients.

851
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,400
They're not pretending to be sick,

852
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,800
but that doesn't mean

853
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,720
it is not mass hysteria.

854
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:48,880
Yes.

855
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,440
With modern neuroimaging technology,

856
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,990
we do see unusual activity

857
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,510
in the hysteric's brains.

858
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,590
They are unlike

859
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,670
the patients who pretend

860
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,670
to be sick.

861
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,630
Throughout the 20th century,

862
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,510
this situation

863
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,400
typically happened

864
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,440
among groups with strict rules.

865
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,720
Patients will feel nausea, dizziness,

866
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,320
headaches, and motility disorders.

867
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,920
It is extremely similar

868
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,320
to the situation
with the workers' families.

869
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,320
My speech is done.

870
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,540
Well...

871
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,840
Your approach is quite different.

872
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,150
Unfortunately,

873
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,150
medicine depends on proof.

874
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,440
We have proof.

875
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,720
This is a test result of the food found

876
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,360
within the residential building.

877
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,880
Among 94 families

878
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,630
and 252 ingredients,

879
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,470
the only ingredients used
in every family

880
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,920
are water and salt.

881
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,720
The lab results show us

882
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,800
that these two ingredients

883
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,920
are perfectly fine.

884
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,240
That is to say,

885
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,920
the chances of food poisoning

886
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,190
are actually the lowest.

887
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,360
That still does not prove

888
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,670
that it's mass hysteria.

889
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,110
The proof of mass hysteria

890
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:57,720
is right here.

891
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,150
A loudspeaker.

892
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:01,720
Yesterday morning,

893
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,840
the workers were poisoned

894
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,990
and sent to the hospitals for treatment.

895
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,030
By noon,

896
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,550
after the factory managers

897
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,760
found out it was nitrite poisoning,

898
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,460
they thought it important enough

899
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,920
to have their team

900
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,880
announce it
to every family living there.

901
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:12,960
They used this.

902
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,630
What does this have to do

903
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,320
with mass hysteria?

904
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,440
Everyone, we're all doctors here.

905
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,630
When we were studying,

906
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,240
we would think

907
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,190
we had the same illness

908
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:19,990
as whatever we studied.

909
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,030
I believe everyone here

910
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:21,800
has experienced it once.

911
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:23,110
We have never encountered

912
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,320
anything this massive before.

913
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,800
Rather, why not say you're young,

914
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,440
and this is for you

915
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,440
to learn from?

916
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,150
We've tried all the possibilities.

917
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,240
Our final conclusion

918
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,720
might not seem likely,

919
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,030
but it might be the truth.

920
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,470
Is it mass hysteria?

921
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,550
We will naturally know

922
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,670
in one week.

After seven days of isolation,
103 patients

936

have shown no new symptoms.

on behalf of the guide group,

that we can all leave.

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,110
Mr. Lin,

00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,510
you've worked hard.

946
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,960

00:40:58,990 --> 00:40:59,670
Let's celebrate.

950
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,720
I don't have the time.

951
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,630
I have a backlog of surgeries.

00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,510
Oh, you.

00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,030
You're so boring.

954
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,190
As Hua said,

955
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,470
life isn't just about being alive,

956
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,800
you also need to live.

957
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,470
We want to live,

958
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,920
so the patient can't be alive.

959
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:17,920
Zheng, Su.
