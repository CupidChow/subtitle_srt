00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,520
The operation was perfect.

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,440

43
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,740
How did No.3 Hospital

45
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,560
What's the point of asking?

are now ahead of us,

57
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,060
I don't think

58
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,060
it's necessary

59
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,250

68
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,110
Mr. Xie thinks the live streaming

70

I'd like to ask you

71

Let's get to the bottom of this.

74
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,300
What are you fighting

75
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,380
with No.3 Hospital for?

76
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,860
For consumables.

77
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,110
What do you mean?

78
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,370
The Interventional Department

79
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,100
has always imported consumables.

80
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,930
Mr. Kong and the president felt

81
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,570
it was time
to develop our own consumables.

82
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,800
Prostate Intervention Embolization

83
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,890
is new

84
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,780
and not yet well-defined.

85
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,300
Everyone is at a stage
of figuring it out

86
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,250
and researching it,

87
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,100
so we wanted to take it
as a starting point

88
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,660
to promote homegrown consumables.

89
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:40,930
No wonder.

90
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,620
What about No.3 Hospital?

91
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,720
They don't care

92
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,130
about possible future tech sanctions.

93
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,010
In order to get the research result

94
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:48,780
as soon as possible,

95
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,370
they chose Wansheng International's
imported consumables.

96
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,930
And Wansheng wants
to take this opportunity

97
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,980
to open up the Chinese market.

98
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,930
That's why

99
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,620
they invited Rudolph.

100
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,780
In hindsight,

101
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,480
we were still too naive.

102
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,690
Stop it.

103
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,130
You've all done your best.

104
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,420
Although Professor Rudolph

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,420
is already ahead of us,

106
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,570
I think the technology gap

107
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,300
is minimal.

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,060
But the materials, the platforms,

109
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:20,980
and the research environment

110
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,620
are the real reasons.

111
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,280
We'll just have

112
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,640
to think of something else.

113
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,250
Frankly, Director Kong.

114
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,180
Now, Beida lost to No.3 Hospital.

115
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,330
Domestic consumables lost
to the imported.

116
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,100
Zheng Ren and I

117
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,060
are also risking our future

118
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,130
because we've completely

119
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,450
offended Qin Liren.

120
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,490
He said he's going to fire us both.

121
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,890
We'll also be held responsible for this?

122
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,980
Of course you will.

123
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,420
You're the ones who gave him the spot
for the demonstration surgery.

124
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,300
Then what do you want?

125
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,200
Now they've finished.

126
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,080
They're finished,

127
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,490
so can't we continue?

128
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,460
You mean

129
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,630
now we have

130
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,260
to order this special guidewire

131
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,920
from Wansheng International
and continue the challenge?

132
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,740
No.

133
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,490
We have to use domestic guidewire.

134
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,100
It's the only way

135
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,250
to make sense of this operation.

136
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,220
Mr. Kong.

137
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:05,890
As you can see,

138
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,130
the guidewire they use
is not the same as ours.

139
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,390
We can't make them

140
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,490
at our current level.

141
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:12,860
That's right.

142
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,540
You see?

143
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,570
He agrees with me.

144
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,300
It only makes sense
that we use domestic guidewire.

145
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,980
That's right.

146
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,060
I don't think

147
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,220
Rudolph's surgery was perfect

148
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,540
or this microguidewire

149
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,490
is good enough.

150
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,180
This is the thinnest guidewire
I've ever seen.

151
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,740
At this point,

152
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,100
he embolized a branch

153
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,620
of the superior bladder artery

154
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,740
instead of going further down.

155
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,740
If you embolize in this position,

156
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,130
there's a 90% chance
that the embolic agent

157
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,010
will be flushed back,

158
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,450
which leads to ectopic embolization.

159
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,010
So I think

160
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,780
the patient would develop complications

161
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,420
such as bladder weakness

162
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,130
and urinary retention soon.

163
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,620
It's a rough surgery.

164
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,780
By my standards,

165
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,330
this surgery

166
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,890
was a failure.

167
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,740
So,

168
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,370
what do you think?

169
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,010
Director Kong.

170
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,540
Please give us three more days

171
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,300
to see Wang Yuanshan's post-op feedback.

172
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,980
If it's really what I expect,

173
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,570
we still have a chance.

174
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:28,980
Jin.

175
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,620
What do you think?

176
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:35,900
Mr. Kong.

177
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,780
We prepared for so long
to convince the president

178
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,060
and invite everyone
from all over the country

179
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,850
just to watch the surgery.

180
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,850
I'm not willing to give up

181
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,930
without even trying it.

182
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,380
That's right.

183
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,060
Wang Yuanshan has had his surgery,

184
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,500
but we can get a few more

185
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,850
experimental patients.

186
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,450
The game isn't over yet.

187
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,060
Director.

188
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,810
I want to continue.

189
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,060
Director Kong.

190
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,330

191
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,690
Mr. Kong.

192
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,260
Okay, then.

193
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,090
Let's continue.

194
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,690

195

196
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,930
I heard

197
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,740
that the foreigner had finished

198
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,970
that operation first.

199
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,140
That means

200
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,020
Zheng Ren and Su Yun both lost.

201
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,780
You said

202
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,210
you'd fire them

203
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,610
if the operation failed.

204
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,810

about Zheng Ren's success,

210
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,090
but now,

211
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,060
everyone knows he failed.

212
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,500
I can tell you

213
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,450
that Mr. Dong

214
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,210
was very upset.

215
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,780
He and his friends have decided

216
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,450
to book Rudolph for the operation.

217
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,850
So,

218
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,060

219
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,500

What?

224
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,380
We've advertised prostate surgery

225
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,090
on our website before.

226
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,090
A lot of patients booked it,

227
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,260
but then they heard something

228
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,570
about it somewhere,

229
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,810
and they've been canceling

230
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,450

231

258

Look at this.

259
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,020
This is

260
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,840
where Rudolph embolized.

261
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,090
It's some distance

262
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,260
from the oxygen supply vessels
down there.

263
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,610
He couldn't go any further,

264
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,380
so he chose to start embolizing

265
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,420
at this branch.

266
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,210
If we want to do a precise embolization,

267
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,970
we have to keep going down.

268
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,380
His guidewire is fine enough,

269
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:13,570
but it still can't get down there.

270
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,900
Because the blood is flowing.

271
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,330
That's like threading a needle

272
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,610
through running water.

273
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,660

angle, and strength

275
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,780
would be off.

276
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,730
Without fixing the frictional resistance
of the blood vessel walls

277
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,660
and the turbulence on the guidewire

278
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,020
from the difference
in blood flow speeds,

279
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,140
it's simply not going to work.

280
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,260
I still have the same question.

281
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,570
How to solve it?

282
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,850
I don't know.

283
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,180
It's hard.

284
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,640
You also find something hard?

285
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,970
As a matter of fact,

286
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,090
I find it hard
when I do all my surgeries.

287
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,500
I didn't see that.

288
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,660
Because I don't want
to be like my father.

To me,

290
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,330
my father seemed like a very strong man.

291
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,500
As long as I can remember,

292
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,380
I've never seen my father

293
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,180
flinch or get tired.

294
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,020
In the flood fight in 1998,

295
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,060
he didn't sleep for three days,

296
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,180
carrying on.

297
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,180
When he got home, he was very sick.

298
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,690
When the hospital
was being built in 1999,

299
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,330
he stayed up late every day.

300
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,930
When the hospital
was established in 2000,

301
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,730
there was no staff there.

302
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,540
He ran around every day

303
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,500
and lost more than ten kilos.

304
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,930
Such a strong man

305
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,690
died that way.

306
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,060
He only left a "good night".

307
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,500
I often wonder

308
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,570
if he really wanted to be lazy for once

309
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,420
because it was too hard,

310
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,570
but the "once"

311
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,810
took him away from me.

312
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,900
I don't want to be like my father,

313
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,260
so whenever I find it hard,

314
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,450
I tell myself

315
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,780
I can't give up.

316
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,730
Because giving up

317
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,540
means the end.

322
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:56,900
Yes.

324
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,210
lost her sight.

325
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,450
The doctor said it's ischemia
of the blood vessels under the eye,

326
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,690
so she can't undergo surgery.

343
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,090
What happened to your eyes?

344
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,420
Headquarters invited me

345
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,300
to the annual VIP party,

346
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,780
so I wanted to have
a hyaluronic acid injection

347
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,020
this morning,

348
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,690
but an hour later,

349
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,810
my vision in this eye went down.

350
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,330
After half an hour,

351
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,540
it went completely blind.

352
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,330
Hyaluronic acid.

353
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,500
The ophthalmologist has looked at it
with a fundoscopy.

354
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,140
Retinal ischemia.

355
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,850
It could be an acute obstruction
of the ophthalmic artery.

356
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,570
They're going to ask the patient
to undergo Interventional Angiography.

357
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,140
If it's a thrombus blockage,

358
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,300
it's still relatively easy
to fix a thrombus

359
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,450
that formed not too long ago,

360
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,260
so don't worry.

361
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,200
It is likely that the location
of the hyaluronic acid injection

362
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,500
has created a deviation.

363
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,500
Somehow the biomacromolecules

364
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,610
got into the capillary network,

365
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,450
causing blockage

366
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,450
and pseudo-blindness.

367
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,850
Biomacromolecules?

368
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,420
Thrombolysis can be considered.

369
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,380
Thrombolysis?

370
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,850
It's not a thrombus.

371
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,540
Why thrombolysis?

372
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,090
The blockage has been there
for more than two hours,

373
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,900
so there should be
localized thrombus formation.

374
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,690
If it's not unblocked in time,

375
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,330
it can cause true blindness.

376
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,210
Don't scare me.

377
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,450

00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,210
This is my relative.

381
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,570
Can I do the surgery?

382
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,850
Dr. Zheng, aren't you too...?

383
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:43,540
I'm sorry.

384
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:46,970

385
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,300
Let Jin do it.

386
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,900
Okay, Ms. Lin.

387
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,210
Let's get ready for the surgery.

388
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,730
I'll help you. Take it easy.

389
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,780
OK.

390
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,180
Thank you. Excuse me.

391
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,020
Based on your relationship,

392
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,300
she should've chosen you.

393
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,500
Why Jin Yaowu?

394
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,940
Prepare for the injection
and angiography.

395
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,810
Injection completed.

396
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,410
The ophthalmic artery is blank.

397

No blood supply.

398
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:51,850
Urokinase.

399
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,410
300,000 units. Prepare for thrombolysis.

400
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,500
See? They thrombolyze it.

401
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,540
It's not enough.

402
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,740
Why not?

403
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,060
The patient is not so old.

404
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,570
A large dose of urokinase
in a short period

405
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,500
won't be much of a problem for her.

406
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,780
It's important to make it quick.

407
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,260
Another 300,000 units.

Thrombolysis. Urokinase.

410
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,330
How many?

411
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,540
300,000 units.

412
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,260
Angiography.

413
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,260
Can you do it, Jin?

414
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,460
If you can't, we'll do it.

415
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,610
300,000 more.

416
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,980
There's a huge blockage up ahead.

417
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,540
Are you worried the thrombolytic

418
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,940
won't work
on the hyaluronic acid macromolecule?

419
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,300
Am...

420
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,220
Am I really going blind?

421
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,060
Don't worry, Ms. Lin.

422
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,370
I'm working on it.

423
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,020
Try using a thick microcatheter.

424
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,460
No.

425
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,940
That will damage the lining
of the blood vessels.

426
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,300
I wouldn't choose

427
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,570
such a reckless treatment.

428
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,300
If you keep stalling,

429
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,020
she'll really go blind.

430
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:01,640

431
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,700
Jin. Please.

Be careful.

435
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:11,610
It will work.

436
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,460
If you can't do it, come out

437
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,220
and let Zheng Ren do it.

438
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,330
Come here if you can.

439
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,540
Didn't you need someone else
to save the day?

440

All talk.

441
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:34,570
Go.

442
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,220
Let me borrow Yiren.

443
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,500
Move away.

444
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,130
You can't do it.

445
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,460
Watch this, Jin.

446
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,650
The microcatheter is too weak

447
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,840
and can't extract large molecules

448
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,170
of hyaluronic acid,

449
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,810
so we'll use a thick microcatheter.

Do you know why I chose Jin

569
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,220
over you just now?

570
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,260
It's not because I have a grudge

571
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,560
against the past.

572
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,220
I was thinking

573
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,610
that if I were to go blind,

574
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,090
I couldn't put it in your hands.

575
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,740
You're Dr. Chen's only family.

576
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,370
That means you're my family too.

577
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,090
Your father is a good doctor.

578
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,130
You have to learn from him

579
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,650
but can't be exactly like him.

580
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,780
[Outpatient]

581
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,650
I heard

582
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,740
you're going to keep competing

583
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,370
with Zheng Ren and Su Yun.

584
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,220
I could care less

585
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,410
about losing to Rudolph,

586
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,540
but losing to them

587
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,500
doesn't sit well with me.

588
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,170
You've already lost

589
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,020
twice.

590
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:49,810
I told you.

591
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,780
You have a long road ahead of you,

592
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,260
so there's no need for you to dwell
on momentary gains and losses.

593
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,460
In fact,
Su Yun has always been my nightmare.

594
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,740
I thought

595
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,700
I'd gotten rid of him,

596
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,370
but I didn't expect him

597
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,220
to come back again.

598
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,890
From the moment I started school,

599
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,130
I was liked by the teachers

600
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,790
because I came first

601
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,890
in all the exams.

602
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,540
Then, I finally got the chance

603
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,890
to work as Prof. Pan's assistant

604
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,980
and tried to study hard,

605
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,130
but then Su Yun came along.

606
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,220
He stood there

607
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:40,940
slovenly,

608
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,940
but Prof. Pan said to him,

609
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,170
"You do it."

610
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,700
I'm the first assistant.

611
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,920
I studied intervention.

612
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,020
I became a doctor straight away
in eight years.

613
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,740
He was just interning
and didn't have hands-on experience.

614
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,850
Then he was done!

615
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,090
Prof. Pan asked him,

616
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,380
"Have you ever done this?"

617
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,730
He said,

618
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,540
"I've just seen it."

619
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:20,820
What the...

620
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,360
Mr. Kong, do you know

621
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,630
why I went into medicine

622
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,610
instead of math?

623
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,610
Because math is dependent on talent.

624
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,860
Genius exists

625
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,930
to refresh the common man's perception

626
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,340
and definition of genius,

627
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,460
but medicine is not about that.

628
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,940
In addition to IQ,

629
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,650
we have to work hard.

630
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:48,690
Time and experience
are the foundation of medicine,

631
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,460
But Su Yun, what makes him so special?

632
00:34:59,070 --> 00:34:59,820
It's not fair.

633
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,210
So unfair.

634
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,730
Then let's work harder than him.

635
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:50,730
How is it?

636
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,610
Were you impressed by my skill?

637
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,090
Don't you feel it?

638
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,020
How can I not feel it?

639
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,460
It's so exciting.

640
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,210
Watch it again.

641
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,390
Okay, let me enjoy it again.

642
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,210
So you're saying

643
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,090
that unclogging Lin Jiaojiao's
ophthalmic artery

644
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,280
is actually similar

645
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:27,960
to Prostate Intervention Embolization?

646
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,460
Yes.

647
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,880
So the reason

648
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,380
for the thicker catheter is because...

649
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,210
It's stiff.

650
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,570
That's right.

651
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,340
If it's stiffer,

652
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,760
we can maneuver it better

653
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,060
when we're unblocking a blood vessel

654
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,490
and make it reach places

655
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,610
that a soft guidewire can't.

656
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,250
It's like threading in water.

657
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,610
The cotton thread won't go through,

658
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,210
but the wire will.

659
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,650
So, if you say so,

660
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,540
a slightly stiffer
and thicker domestic guidewire

661
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,770
can be used

662
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,340
for Prostate Intervention Embolization

663
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,210
if it's done properly.

664
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,570
And even make it more effective.

665
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,380
Yeah, that's right.

666
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,610
Speak of the devil.

667
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,460
Idiots are always lucky.

668
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:09,800
What do you mean?

669
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,730
What do I mean?

670
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,610
Zheng Ren.

671
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,500
Look who's here.

672
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:15,900
Tell me.

673
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,840
What are you trying to do

674
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,900
with such a big box?

675
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,210
Actually,

676
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,380
I'm here to say goodbye.

677
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,500
Say goodbye?

678
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,500
The company is dying,

679
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,130
so the chairman called me back.

680
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,210
It's because
of Wansheng International, isn't it?

681
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,210
We've been busy for months

682
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,290
but falling behind,

683
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:37,090
so all the initial investment
has gone down the drain.

684
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,550
I've heard that many hospitals

685
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,820
are already
approaching Wansheng International.

686
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,760
They used

687
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,770
this Prostate Intervention Embolization

688
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,290
to open up the domestic market.

689
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,170
Once Wansheng comes in,

690
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:50,610
all the domestic companies are...

691
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,540
Dr. Zheng.

692
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,020
Here are all
the intervention consumables.

693
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,420
Some are from our company

694
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,210
and some are imported ones
that I bought.

695
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,610
I wanted to keep them for you

696
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,770
in case of an emergency,

697
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,610
but now I'm leaving,

698
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,210
so I'll leave the box with you.

699
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,250
Frankly speaking,

700
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,940
as a medical representative,

701
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,540
I got a headache

702
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,090
when meeting a doctor like you,

703
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,940
but as an ordinary person

704
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,650
who might get sick someday,

705
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,130
I'm glad there are doctors

706
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,250
like you in the world.

707
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,570
Dr. Zheng.

708
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,210
Don't give up.

709
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:55,820
Gentlemen.

710
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,090
See you at Haicheng if I can.

711
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,690
Why don't you keep him?

712
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,940
Didn't we decide
to use domestic guidewire?

713
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,170
Without practice,

714
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,770
we can't tell if the idea is feasible

715
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,820
or if the surgery will work.

716
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,210
Of course it will.

717
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,290
You and I mean the practice.

718
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,690
This is the same guidewire used
in Neurointervention Department, right?

719
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,860
It's a little thicker but a lot stiffer

720
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,730
than the one Rudolph used.

721
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,210
Maybe it's good for surgical purposes.

722
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,210
There's no better choice.

723
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,860
I didn't expect

724
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,290
a Prostate Intervention Embolization

725
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,500
to turn into a battle

726
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,800
of survival

727
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,510
between an international giant

728
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:55,610
and a domestic company.

729
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,570
We, two little butterflies,

730
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,470
have to think of a way

731
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,290
to flap our wings now!

732
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,940
How many years the domestic company's
consumables can last

733
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,250
depends on us.

734
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,570
Aren't we going to practice?

735
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,240
Why are we butterflies now?

736
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,420
Brother, you really

737
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,540
tell cold jests from time to time?

738
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,130
You taught me that.

739
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,030
Are you insulting

740
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:12,820
my DNA?

741
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,540
What's wrong?

742
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:32,650
Wait.

743
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:33,650
What attracts you?

744
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,250
You say a guidewire
is like a lonely sword,

745
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,770
but I think a guidewire
is like a group of fish.

746
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,900
The current is the veins.

747
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,390
A single sword

748
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,170
doesn't mean intervention.

749
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,610
That's surgery.

750
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,980
A school of fish traveling
through the coral.

751
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,500
Competing for water flow.

752
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,610
Hiding from companions.

753
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,820
Waiting for danger to pass.

754
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,250
Following the downstream current.

755
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:55,940
That's intervention.

756
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,940
You make a very good point,

757
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,720
but don't you get tired
of reciting poetry

758
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,420
like that?

759
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,940
Complicate the simple,

760
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,290
and simplify the complex.

761
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,860
Can't you say something
normal people can understand?

762
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:05,650
Get some rest.

763
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,720
No.

764
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,360
Compose me another poem.

765
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:07,980
I enjoy that.

766
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,000
What are you doing?

767
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,730
Why are you so narrow-minded?

768
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,690
Can't take a joke.

769
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:23,610
Qin Liren is going to fire you
and Zheng Ren,

770
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,090
[Hua, the best in the universe]
or he's going to divest.

771
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,690
He's pushing hard,

772
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,090
but I'm sure

773
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:30,550
you'll be able to conquer

774
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,060
the new procedure
for prostate intervention.

775
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,380
