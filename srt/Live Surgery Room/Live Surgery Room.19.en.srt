I have my considerations.

121
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,900
Your considerations
are definitely these three points.

122
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,700
Firstly,

123
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,780
provide the patients in need

124
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,780
with financial support.

125
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,810

127
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,900
have lined up all the way to Heidelberg.

128
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,370
Secondly,

129
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,730
you want patients and their families

130
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,050
to understand the whole procedure

131
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,340
to ease patient-doctor relations.

132
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,730
It's too idealistic.

133
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,610
In reality, you will
have countless problems.

134
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,580
Thirdly,

135
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,730
to pass on the knowledge, right?

136

Providing surgeons with easy access
to new techniques.

137
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,580
This definitely won't do.

138
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,580
If you want to give them access,

139

00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,850
Hua,

192
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,330
I know it's very expensive.

193
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,570
But after the upgrades,

194
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,610
it can't just simulate

195
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,330
a conjoined twins separation surgery,

196
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,730
but also other complicated conditions

197
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,690
for others to practice with.

198
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,180
Look at how fast technology has come

199
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,210
through these years.

200
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,570
The equipment, means, methods,

201
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,940
and business philosophy,

202
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,850
all have to be kept up-to-date.

203
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,730
Otherwise, we will be left behind.

204
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,330
High maintenance.

205
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,210
It's a golden goose.

206
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,180
Here, Hua.

207
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,300
We have to look at long-term profits.

208
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,890
We are seeing more

209
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,140
and more liver cancer patients, right?

210
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,420
It'll pay off sooner or later.

211
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,090
Didn't you say

212
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,660
everything depends on ourselves?

213
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,810
We are now

214
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,020
increasing our overall skill level.

215
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,850
Hua, I love you.

216
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,660
Thank you, Ms. Su.

[Application Form for Preoperative
Navigation System Equipment Upgrade]

220
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,690
We've settled the navigation system.

221
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,180
Do you have any leads

222
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,300
for the overall surgical plan?

223
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,380
Currently, I want two lead surgeons.

224
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,810
First, we deal with the liver.

225
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,610
Then, the heart.

226
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,140
However, in that case,

227
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,300
the anesthetist will need
to be very skilled.

228
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,540
He Qian won't do.

229
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,140
But Peng Jia offered 100,000

230
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,060
for a recording
of the intrauterine intervention.

231
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,730
He didn't sell it.

232
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,450
He's not that type of person.

233
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,300
He won't do. Don't think about it.

234
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,690
Why are you looking at me?

235
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,800
When we did
heart transplants on the mice,

236
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,180
you were the anesthetist.

237
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,210
Why don't you work with He Qian

238
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,660
as the anesthetist
for the Siamese twins?

239
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,960
It feels like you've set me up

240
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,060
to be the anesthetist.

241
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,940
Thus,

242
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,020
you either be the anesthetist,

243
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,090
or you deal with He Qian.

244
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,210
It really is a trap.

245
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:27,850
Yun,

246
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:28,940
what do you need?

247
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,690
Tell me.

248
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,450
I hear

249
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,160
that Peng Jia wanted to buy a recording

250
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,660
of the intrauterine intervention
for 100,000.

251
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,570
But you didn't sell it.

252
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,570
Why?

253
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,180
If you promote a streaming partnership

254
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,730
between Zheng Ren
and Mind And Soul Garden,

255
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,060
you'll get a higher commission.

256

257
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,520
Yun,

258
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,690
I do have some common sense.

259
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,900
That's considered theft. It's a crime.

260
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,780
Anyway,

261
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,420
I can stay in Haicheng Hospital

00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,940
all thanks to Mr. Lin's help.

263
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,540
I can't cause any extra trouble

264
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,450
to bother him.

265
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,420
Hey... You're even
considering Mr. Lin's situation.

266
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,690
What a sacrifice for the greater good.

267
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,260
I know why you sought me out.

268
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,380
I know you look down on me,

269
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,330
but everyone's life is different.

270
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,380
What can I do?

271
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,810
With my family's finances,

272
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,330
stopping work means starving.

273
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,780
Ideals are a luxury

274
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,330
I had when I was young,

275
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,490
but I'm old now.

276
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,020
I'm not fit to talk about it.

277
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,380
He,

278
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,570
don't misunderstand me.

279
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,810
I'm here today

280
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,420
because I want to know what you think.

281
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,260
I know you're under a lot of pressure.

282
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,380
We all have dreams.

283
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,450
Honestly, I know

284
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,610
that you guys and Ms. Su

285
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,540
have splurged a lot

286
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,090
for the Siamese twins' surgery.

287
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,380
You can't cover everything.

288
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,380
I really think

289
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,970
you can consider Peng Jia's suggestion.

290
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,690
Although it's risky,

291
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,970
I think

292
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,610
you're not people

293
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,810
who care what the outside world thinks.

294
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,940
How do you know that we don't care?

295
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,260
Perhaps you care,

296
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,490
but Zheng Ren doesn't.

297
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,420
Who said that?

298
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,210
He only cares about the surgery.

299
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,330
He's great for live streams.

300
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,780
Think about it.

301
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,020
All of your future research funds

302
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,020
will be someone else's responsibility.

303
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,140
You'll have an endless amount
of surgeries to tackle.

304
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,090
You can challenge

305
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:56,970
all of the difficult cases.

306
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,300
Isn't that great?

307
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,610
Forty-five.

308
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,780
Chen Miao, Zheng Ren's father,

309
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,020
was 45 when he passed away.

310
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,610
You mean to say

311
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:22,020
Chen Miao,
one of Haicheng Hospital's founders,

312
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,540
is Zheng Ren's father?

313
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,850
They're both prodigies

314
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,380
and incredibly talented doctors.

315
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,490
Due to the rumors and public opinion,

316
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,010
he took his own life in the end.

317
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,810
The consequences of horrible speech

318
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,210
can't be blocked off

319
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,850
with a simple "I don't care".

320
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,940
Zheng Ren is 35 this year.

321
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,490
Doctors like him

322
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,300
can save a lot of people

323
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,260
and conquer many severe illnesses.

324
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,090
He will be the hope for many people.

325
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,210
As one of his team members,

326
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,260
anything that could possibly lead

327
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,470
to the end of his career

328
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,690
before his time is due

329
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,420
must be killed off.

330
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,490
I

331
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,090
won't let him be the second Chen Miao.

332
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,810
I'm not my father,

333
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,140
so I won't jump.

334
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,900
If you ask me what

335
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,300
my father's greatest influence on me is,

336
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,660
the answer
would not be the medical skill.

337
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,300
It would be the role of a doctor.

338
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,900
Medical is a term
created by combining two terms.

339
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,850
It means the hidden arrow.

340
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,660
When the arrow is inside a container,

341
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,260
those who can extract the arrow

342
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,180
are called doctors.

343
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,380
My father could deal

344
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,060
with the arrows others suffered from,

345
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,850
but when it came to arrows stuck in him,

346
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,060
he gave up.

347
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,540
I'm not the same.

348
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,450
If the rumors
and cyberbullies come for me,

349
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,180
then let them.

350
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,450
I'll contain the arrow,
resist it, and extract it.

351
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,690
Then, I'll be reborn.

352
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,620
That is a doctor.

353
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,450
You mean to say

354
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,940
you will choose to live-stream it

355
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,970
even if you are shattered along the way?

356
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,580
Yes.

357
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:20,380
Okay.

358
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,940
As a doctor, I support you.

359
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,050
Still, as one of your team members,

360
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,690
I have a duty to tell you

361
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,450
that you've only ever thought of success

362
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,050
and never of failure.

363
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,420
Failure is a terrifying thing,

364
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,970
because I've failed before.

365
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,380
I know

366
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,420
what failure tastes like.

367
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,420
If we live-stream the surgery,

368
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,860
everyone will be happy if it succeeds.

369
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,900
What if we fail?

370
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,530
We'll have destroyed the reputations

371
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,820
at the cost of a team
and even a whole hospital.

372
00:17:59,350 --> 00:17:59,970
Zheng Ren,

373
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,340
if you want to live-stream,

374
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,010
I won't be joining in on any

375
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:05,770
of your surgeries from now on.

376
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,340
Including the conjoined twins
separation surgery.

377
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,380
Why?

378
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,050
I can't stop a man from being mad,

379
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,250
but I can at least keep myself safe.

380
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,140
I don't want to participate.

381
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,250
I don't want to see

382
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,940
and I don't want to know.

383
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:46,970
Do what you want.

384
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,760
Today,

385
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,250
I'm going to show you

386
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,420
a thrilling and extreme challenge.

387
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,600
It's this fountain.

388
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,620
Do you see it?

389
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,660
Hi, Sir.

390
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,900
Do you need something?

391
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,420
I'm a streamer.

392
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,010
I'm streaming right now.

393
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,050
Help me hold the phone up.

394
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,660
Thank you.

395
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,860
Hello, everyone.

396
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,620
The extreme challenge
you've all been waiting for

397
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:44,580
is about to start.

398
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,010
Send me all the planes and rockets.

399
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:48,660
Ten.

400
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,100
Nine.

401
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,620
Eight.

402
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,770
Seven.

403
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,100
Six.

404
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,940
Five.

405
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,290
Four.

406
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,620
Three.

407
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,820
Two.

408
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:08,660
One.

409
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,140
Look out!

410
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,100
What's going on?

411
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,420
She fainted.

412
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,420
Call ambulance!

413
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,140
Now!

414
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,510
He's saving her.

415
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,150
It looks serious.

416
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,380
[Emergency]

417
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,540
[Emergency]

418
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,180
What's going on?

419
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,900
She's a streamer

420
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,220
who ran into the dancing water fountain
for a challenge.

421
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,420
But the water sent her flying up.

422
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,180
Treat her now!

423
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,700
It's a gastrointestinal tract rupture.

424
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:52,730
The colon is also dilated.

425
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:53,620
There's an issue with the stomach too.

426
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,660
There's a pelvic fracture

427
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,980
and a huge hematoma
in the retroperitoneum.

428
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,620
This will be troublesome.

429
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,140
- Hello?
- Zheng,

430
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,490
we can't contact her family.
What do we do?

431
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,490
Then, head
to the Medical Affair Department.

432
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,900
We will first transfer her

433
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,860
to a hybrid operation room.

434
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,220
Once Medical Affair Department
is done with the procedure,

435
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:07,980
we'll start operating.

436
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,900
I'll get ready now.

437
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:41,770
He,

438
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,660
how is her blood pressure?

439
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:43,860
Ninety over sixty.

440
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,250
With traumatic shock. It's normal.

441
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,490
Why is this happening?

442
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,460
Wait.

443
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,620
Bronchofiberscope.

444
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,090
Okay.

445
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,180
What is it? Is there something wrong
with the breathing tube?

446
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,180
The bronchoscope is here.

447
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:08,730
Okay.

448
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,980
There's a lot of secretion.

449
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,220
It's a traumatic wet lung.

450
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,490
Connect to the ventilator.

451
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,050
Okay.

452
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,380
The sputum suction machine.

453
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,090
So the tube was inserted

454
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,140
into the esophagus.

455
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,420
Dr. He,

456
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,900
did you not notice after so long?

457
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:56,530
I...

458
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:03,980
Did she have cosmetic surgery?

459
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,140
No.

460
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:07,290
It's natural.

461
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,730
Due to her lower jaw deformity,

462
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,810
her airway was malformed.

463
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,530
If she went to a cosmetic surgeon
for bone shaving,

464
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,290
her airway wouldn't be malformed.

465
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:17,530
He,

466
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,290
it's fine.

467
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,530
I'll wash up.

468
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,490
Prepare for the operation.

469
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,090
Okay.

470
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,320
You brought the patient in.

471
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,140
Why are you blanking out

472
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,220
in here instead of watching her?

473
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,860
Zheng Ren is in the operating room.

474
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,660
With or without me,

475
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,220
it makes no difference.

476
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,380
Do you really think so?

477
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,660
In just a few short months,

478
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,420
Haicheng is now

479
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,420
the province's most famous hospital.

480
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,010
Miracle after miracle

481
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,010
was performed here.

482
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,700
And the one who created the miracles

483
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,290
was not me.

484
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,980
[Zheng Ren's Team, Star Doctor]

485
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,100
It could have been you.

486
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,490
Yes.

487
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,010
Doctors who rely on their talents

488
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,770
will lose to the more talented.

489
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:07,620
Such is fate.

490
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,860
I thought

491
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:14,970
it was luck.

492
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,420
Doctors who rely on their talents

493
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,140
will know when they meet someone

494
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:22,970
more talented

495
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,290
that talent alone is not enough.

496
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,180
In the end, it still relies

497
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,530
on hard work to win the fight.

498
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,180
Even if Zheng Ren never met you,

499
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,970
he will continue to work hard.

500
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,660
That's why I said

501
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,940
this is your luck.

502
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,100
Without Chang Yue,

503
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,210
Yu Yunxia would have jumped.

504
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,180
Without He Qian,

505
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,940
Yiren, Yingying,

506
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,860
and the cooperation and support

507
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,380
of countless hospital staff,

508
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,210
Zheng Ren alone

509
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,350
could not

510
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,770
have completed the late liver
intervention embolization.

511
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,450
It's luck

512
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,660
that allowed a group like this

513
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,530
to gather in Haicheng,

514
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,180
creating miracle after miracle.

515
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,210
We are one,

516
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,210
unable to be separated.

517
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:32,350
If Zheng Ren

518
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,530
leads this body

519
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,210
into destruction?

520
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,180
What do you mean?

521
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,780
He wants to work
with Mind And Soul Garden

522
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,450
to live-stream the surgery.

523
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,020
Hasn't Peng Jia given up yet?

524
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,290
It's Zheng Ren who hasn't given up.

525
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,900
The one who proposed it

526
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:52,970
was Zheng Ren.

527
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,300
[Emergency]

528
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,100
Ms. Su.

529
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,900
How is the surgery going?

530
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,820
It seems to be a full
gastrointestinal tract rupture.

531
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,210
Even if the surgery is a success,

532
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,250
she can't eat normally again.

533
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,940
She'll be relying
on a liquid nutrition formula to survive.

534
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,660
She'll also have to rely
on an ostomy pouch for stool and urine.

535
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,010
No quality of life to speak of.

536
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,660
Has Medical Affair Department
contacted her family?

537
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,620
We made contact.

538
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,140
But when her dad heard
she was severely injured

539
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,530
and would need an expensive surgery,

540
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,770
he hung up.

541
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,620
I've looked at her page.

542
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,010
She really works hard as a streamer.

543
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,530
All the extreme challenges

544
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,940
in the snow and at night

545
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,820
with streams in haunted
and dangerous buildings.

546
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,580
The water fountain challenge

547
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,730
was a big hit.

548
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,450
Jinx.

549
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,890
Where are the belongings
for the patient, Ren Ling?

550
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,380
Over here.

551
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,140
Why are you looking at it?

552
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,820
I want to see

553
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,900
if she has any other relatives.

554
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,530
Is your hand okay?

555
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,180
It's fine.

556
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,260
[Sister: Sis, are you okay?]

557
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,580
[Sister]
Sis.

558
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:01,900
Sis, are you okay?

559
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,860
I was watching your stream.
What happened?

560
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,300
Sis, please reply to me.

561
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,170
Sis, where are you?

562
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,620
Please be okay.

563
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,300
I'm streaming right now.

564
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,380
Help me hold the phone up.

565
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:14,970

00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,490
Stay for what?

756
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:40,780
There's a hospital to wait on her.

757
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:41,450
Let's go.

758
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:44,660
Sir.

759
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:48,570
Miss,

760
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,410
go home with your dad.

761
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,660
We'll take care of your sister.

762
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,050
Let's go.

763
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:59,130
You went too far.

764
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,570
Alright.

765
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,130
It's fine now.

766
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,570
Did you see her arm?

767
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,660
It's all bruised up.

768
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,050
That's none of your business.

769
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,570
You're just doctors.

770
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,600
Mr. Lin just messaged us.

771
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,900
The patient's family
was causing a ruckus.

772
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:35,740
But they're finally gone.

773
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,050
A ruckus?

774
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:38,530
Why?

775
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,530
I hear it's because the younger sister

776
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:41,130
brought money from home
to pay for the bills.

777
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,260
She was discovered by their dad.

778
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,570
Then, he was about to hit her

779
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:44,570
in public at the lobby.

780
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,660
Su Yun stopped him

781
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,970
and even pushed him away.

782
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:48,660
Su Yun?

783
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:49,930
Yes.

784
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,490
The dead horse threw a punch.

785
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:53,090
The dad insisted
he was hurt in the fall.

786
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,400
So, he wanted compensation.

787
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,190
There is a very high chance

788
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:57,220
that not only would we

789
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,260
not be paid for Ren Ling's care,

790
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,490
but also have to pay them compensation.

791
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,610
Zheng,

792
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,380
it's just chaos.

793
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,680
Come to Germany.

794
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,780
I have a team of lawyers

795
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,380
who can protect your interests.

796
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,300
You were examining her.

797
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,300
Is something wrong?

798
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:14,530
There is 750 ml of fluid

799
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:15,490
in her drainage bag.

800
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,780
I've checked her wounds.

801
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,010
There are no problems.

802
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,900
It's considered normal

803
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:21,930
for there to be excess fluid

804
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:22,820
after a seven-hour-long surgery.

805
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,180
I had estimated

806
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,450
200 ml at most of the excess fluid.

807
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,010
750 ml is too much.

808
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:30,530
Zheng,

809
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,970
is it a problem of mismatch?

810
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,610
Impossible.

811
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,720
While we took out
quite a lot of her intestines,

812
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,860
she was perfectly sewn back up.

813
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:37,860
There would not be a problem.

814
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,740
Can I have a look
at the surgery recording?

815
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:42,530
Okay. I'll submit an application.

816
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:44,930
Zheng Ren,

817
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,090
go home and rest.

818
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,610
It has been 24 hours

819
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,530
since you last slept.

820
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,180
Check on her again tomorrow.

821
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,610
She might be better then.

822
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,490
Doctor, please.

823
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,220
Take me to go see the video.

824
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,410
Okay. I'll just run it by my supervisor.

825
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,970
Why is it you again?

826
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:10,930
