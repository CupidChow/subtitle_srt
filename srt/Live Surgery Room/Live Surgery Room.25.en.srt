00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:15,760
Hua,

12
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,360
I was gone for too long.

13
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,920
When I took over Haicheng Hospital,

14
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,390
I promised the shareholders

15
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,520
that if I couldn't meet
the target this year,

16
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,710
I'd automatically resign.

17
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,080
It's only been half a year,

18
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,320
but the hospital
could not sustain any longer.

19
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,670
In his live stream,
Zheng Ren was right about what he said.

20
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,550
What stream?

21
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,430
What did he say?

22
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,390
Didn't you know?

23
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,150
Via emergency rescue,

24
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,220
I noticed that in Nanyang Town,

25
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:48,920
there's no Interventional Department.

26
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,960
Even at the entire Dongyuan Township,

27
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,390
there are less than

28
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,480
five interventional doctors.

29
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,240
Every doctor has their specialty

30
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,240
and it's not easy.

31
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,870
In this rescue mission,

32
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,590
interventional operation

33
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,670
has played a critical role.

34
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,590
I believe that MIO surgery

35
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,920
is the direction
that doctors should pursue.

36
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,360
I'm willing to teach

37
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,200
and share my surgical experience

38
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,670
with all doctors,

39
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,040
through live streaming,

40
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,270
such as the late liver
intervention embolization,

41
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,870
the prostate intervention embolization,

42
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,550
the TIPS surgery,

43
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,240
and more.

44
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,200
Have you agreed to it, Hua?

45
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,360
I did.

46
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,080
I think what he said makes sense.

47
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,830
Everything you've learned in textbooks

48
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,200
came from the selfless sharing

49
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,110
of your seniors.

Even before the shareholder's meeting,

58
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,150
I've decided

59
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,640
to help you all

60
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,320

62
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,590
When did Peng Jia and you close the deal

63
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,590
on the surgery live stream?

64
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,790
We've always kept in touch,

65
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,270
but the decision was made

66
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,790
during the rescue mission

67
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,590
in Dongyuan Township.

68
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,200
Why did you not

69
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,080
discuss with me about this?

70
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,440
Because I know you will object.

71
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,590
Even if I were to object,

72
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:37,910
you would still do it, am I right?

73
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:41,470
Zheng Ren,

74
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,560
when you used to work alone,

75
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,030
it's fine if you prefer

76
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,910
to act arbitrarily.

77
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,470
But now you're in a team!

78
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,680
Have you considered your teammates?

79
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,120
You want to provide free surgeries,

80
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,230
free stream,

81
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,440
and free tutorials!

82
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,680
They spend their time

83
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,640
and effort to do this with you.

84
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,760
Who will pay them?

85
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,080
Also,

86
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,790
have you considered the hospital?

87
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,320
I've considered not only the hospital,

88
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,000
but I believe

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,390
that through these surgery live streams,

90
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,050
I can pass on our advanced skills

91
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:09,760
to everyone.

92
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,910
It is through this rescue mission
that I noticed

93
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,120
there's not much difference
in the basic medical care in big cities.

94
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,410
But for the village doctors,

95
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,640
they can only treat a single patient

96
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,570
at a time.

97
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,790
They need to learn new skills

98
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,000
and they need to be exposed

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,910
to complicated surgeries.

100
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,200
The live stream
is a tutorial without a barrier.

101
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,100
If we can use this method

102
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,490
to share our skills

103
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,450
with everyone,

104
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,930
we will be able to save more people.

105
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,490
The philosophy of our hospital
has always been

106
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,570
the patient always comes first.

107
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,980
I understand your dreams

108
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,100
and I agree with your objectives.

109
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,450
But you need to at least make sure
that the hospital is sustainable.

110
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,740
What do you mean?

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,250
I'll be direct with you.

112
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,420
The reputation of the hospital
is getting better,

113
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,060
but our revenue is plummeting.

114
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,180
Hua didn't want me
to tell you about this.

115
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,200
I also think

116
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,100
that once we get through this phase,

117
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,420
things will be better.

118
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,740
But we don't have much time.

119
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,540
Why so?

120
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,450
If Haicheng Hospital's revenue
remains in deficit

121
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,370
a month later,

122
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,570
Hua will have
to take the blame and resign.

123
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,420
Resign?

124
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,010
Do you still remember Qin Liren?

125
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,330
We offended him when we were in Beida.

126
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,300
And all this time

127
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,930
he was trying to get Hua to fire you.

128
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,490
Did you know

129
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,420
what Hua told me?

130
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,930
The resignation

131
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,570
is unavoidable.

132
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,160
But before she leaves,

133
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,180
she wants to help us

134
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,060

00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,760

138

fulfill your dreams.

139
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,220
Haicheng Hospital is in danger.

140
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,010
Once Hua leaves,

141
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,720
do you think the next Director

142
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,180
will let you have your way?

143

154
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,570
we saw

my wife was crying to come back.

What did the doctor
from Women's and Children's Hospital say?

159
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,010
They said that the surgery
was too complicated

160
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,570
and wanted us to give up
on the younger one.

00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,010
The younger one, her heart failure
has worsened.

It's my fault.

180

that Haicheng

For the past two years,

mentions you in Haicheng Hospital,

296

615

Thus,

616
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,500

621
