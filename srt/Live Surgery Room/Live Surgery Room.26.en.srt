00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,080
There's a note in the surgical record.

193
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,910
The ceramic hip plant failed.

194
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,590
An all-metal hip was needed.

195
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,110
In the early 1960s,

196
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,470
Dr. John Charnley performed

197
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,920
low-friction joint replacement surgery,

198
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,230
which started a revolution

199
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,350
in artificial joint replacement.

200
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,230
The first ceramic total hip

201
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,160
was fixed with cementless

202
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,200
on the acetabular side

203
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,110
while the ceramic head was fixed

204
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,440
to the femoral stem with bone cement

205
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,800
on the femoral side.

206
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,990
The friction properties
of alumina ceramics

207
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,750
were highly praised

208
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,470
from the very beginning
of their application,

209
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,400
but problems

210
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,200
remain in practice.

211
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,630
The ceramic material is very brittle

212
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,470
and has the potential to chip,

213
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,830
so patients might be treated

214
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,750
with COC.

215
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
It was the newest powdered ceramic,

216
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,870
stronger than the previous yellow ones.

217
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,160
However,

218
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,680
the operation failed,

219
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,160
so I guess the doctors probably

220
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,630
removed the pieces

221
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,870
and replaced them
with an all-metal hip joint.

222
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,110
Your family is rich enough

223
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,800
to give an old man

224
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,630
an expensive hip.

225
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,440
Actually, it's not that expensive.

226
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,590
It's a program

227
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,040
that my dad invested in for them.

228
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,320
Indeed, in the beginning, they used

229
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,920
the latest powdered ceramic

230
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:19,830
artificial hip joint,

231
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,710
but the doctors found out
during the operation

232
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,830
that the old lady's

233
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,990
physical condition didn't allow it,

234
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,110
so they finally replaced it

235
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,200
with an all-metal

236
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,110
artificial hip joint.

237
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,280
Your father's work

238
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,560
is medical-related?

239
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,280
Why are you laughing?

240
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,320
Nothing.

241
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,230
Since you have suspicions,

242
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:45,800
verify them.

How do you know?

246
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,080
Yiren looks so much like her father.

247
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,160
Almost the same.

248
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,400
We won't tell him?

249
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,350
Of course not.

250
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,680
It's more fun to let him find out
on his own.

251
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,870

Are you sure

254
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,350
this isn't post-op scar tissue

255
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,440
but ceramic fragments?

256
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,040
When the results come out,

257
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,400
if any of the metals are more than

258
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,200
100 times higher,

259
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,960
I'm sure it's a ceramic fragment.

260
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,590
Why is that?

261
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,750
Because these little fragments

262
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,590
are like sandpaper.

263
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,710
Every time the patient moved,

264
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,080
the metal part wore away,

265
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,080
so after the surgery,

266
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,040
the patient gradually developed symptoms

267
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,080
such as deafness and blindness

268
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,230
from metal toxicity.

269
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,440
I said it was poisoning.

270

You said it was installed poison.

271
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,350
That was more exciting.

She's usually so serious.

Dr. Zheng,

275

I've contacted the doctor.

276
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,920
Which doctor?

277
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,110
The one who operated

278
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,470
on the old lady before.

279
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,750
He said he can come by

280
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,510
if necessary.

281
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,400
OK.

282
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,280
He knows what he'd done.

283
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,800
The old lady is in bad shape.

284
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,440
It's too late.

285
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,350
We have to operate now.

286
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,560
Surgery again?

287
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,590
Can't she just take her meds?

288
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,280
The hip

in there all the time,

291
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,080
so if she has the surgery,

292
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,870
there's some chance she'll survive.

293

If not,

00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,680

00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,110
After all,

your mother is 83 years old.

384
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,200
It's hard for us to guarantee

385
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,280

386

any serious complications.

387

Moreover,

388

her hearing and vision,

389
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:54,990
which were already damaged before,

390

may not be restored.

391

394

Even if she has the surgery,

395
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,230
she can't get off the operating table.

396

what's wrong with you.

407

it was the ceramic shards

419
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,750
that caused the poisoning?

420
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,070
What if I agree to the surgery

421
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,920

422

that in a doctor's mind,

all patients are important,

she is the one who stays with me.

They were just staring at the window.

I knew what they were doing.

to save her.

482
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,550

didn't come close to her pain.

487
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,510
She fell out of bed many times.

488
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,360
Because of the pain,

489
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,400
she banged her body against that bedpan.

490
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,230
Over time,

491
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,470
a dent was made in the bedpan,

492
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,360
but there was nothing I could do.

00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,200

wasn't working well.

496
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,120
So I forced myself

497
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,310
to beg Mr. Xie

to replace her hip.

[Infinite Horizons in Medicine

525
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,030
that the patient had no built-in metal

526
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,550

came from the hip joint,

they can only be sure
of saving one of them.

the older one survives,

691

702

instead of basic surgery?

703
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,310

half of the proceeds from the livestream
will go to Haicheng Hospital.

713
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,460

get through this.
