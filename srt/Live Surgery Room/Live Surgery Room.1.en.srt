00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,070
Thank goodness.

572
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:16,350
Close him up.

573
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,470
Surgery is over.

574
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,680
There are a lot of complications
post-pancreaticoduodenal trauma.

575
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:55,990
He'll need to be in the ICU.

576
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:56,870
Ensure renal perfusion.

577
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:57,840
Roger.

578
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,200
Thank you, Doctor Zheng.

579
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,280
I'm Xie Yiren.

580
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,430
Pleased to work with you.

581
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,800
Doctor Zheng.

582
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:03,800
I'm Wu Yingying.

583
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,510
I'm He Qian.

584
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,200
A surgery

585
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,240
not even Doctor Reiner can do,

586
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,430
yet he did it.

587
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,120
Who is he?

588
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,160
He's Zheng Ren,

589
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,120
our new head of Interventional.

590
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,030
A head this young?

591
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:27,600
Then...

592
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,390
He's as smart as Yun.

593
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,340
[Office Building]

594
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,240
Zheng Ren,

595
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,030
I...

596
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,280
I apologize.

597
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:20,910
Thank you.

598
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,800
I've told you,

599
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,760
an error in the scans

600
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,120
will mislead the doctor.

601
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,310
Blindly operating

602
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,680
will only lead to the patient's death.

603
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:32,870
We're lucky we can save him this time.

604
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,160
Next time,

605
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:36,990
who will it be?

606
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:39,600
I...

607
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,200
You really don't know

608
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,310
that the preoperative imaging
was problematic?

609
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,390
I do.

610
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,080
That's a scan from the past.

611
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,720
Why do you do this.

612
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,430
It's for hope.

613
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,990
Hope that he can be operated on.

614
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,200
Hope that the surgery will be a success.

615
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,030
It is because

616
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,310
of that kind of hope

617
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,050
that this miracle happened.

618
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,100
If the scans were accurate,

619
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,200
Doctor Reiner wouldn't be here.

620
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,160
You wouldn't be here.

621
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,430
You'll tell me to give up,

622
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,080
to find another way.

623
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,280
Those methods will

624
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,830
be even harder and painful.

625
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,870
I know there was no chance,

626
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,240
yet I wanted to give it a shot.

627
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,910
That is the value

628
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,240
of the patient's family,

629
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:42,470
right?

630
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,280
You are not just

631
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,200
the family of the patient.

632
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,350
You are a director of the hospital.

633
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,640
It is irresponsible to keep information

634
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,470
from the doctors.

635
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,280
As a doctor,

636
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,720
telling the family to give up

637
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,720
and choose an even worse solution

638
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,760
is irresponsible too.

639
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:57,950
You asked me

640
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,030
why I turned to Interventional, right?

641
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,470
The desire for a more humane treatment

642
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,910
is the reason I'm in Interventional.
