5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,360
Come on.

6
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,190
There's wine here.

7
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,030
Drink up.

8
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:46,880
It's all non-alcoholic.

9
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,160
When we're tired,

10
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,360
we'll go to sleep.

11
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,240
This is a vacation.

12
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,110
Come on.

13
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:51,830
Let's drink now.

14
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,270
Cheers!

15
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,270
This is life.

16
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,030
Why are you looking at me?

17
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,310
Challenge me again?

18
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,270
I won't give you a chance
to turn the tables.

19
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,670
No bathroom

20
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,670
while we're competing.

21
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,520
OK. Come on.

22
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,390
OK.

23
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,390
Dr. Zheng.

24
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,150
Eating barbecued chicken wings.

25
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,430
The heat is a bit high.

26
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,760
It's a bit burnt.

27
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,590
They say

28
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,760
there's a risk of cancer

29
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,040
from eating burnt food,

30
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,200
but it's okay

31
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,920
to eat it once in a while.

32
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,550
I'd like to say

33
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,640
I'm not that pretentious.

34
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,040
Try it?

35
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,430
Guys.

36
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,870
I suddenly had a thought.

37
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,110
Why do we have

38
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,390
to isolate the liver first?

39
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,200
We could have done the heart first.

40
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,480
If the heart's ready,

41
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,830
it's okay to go slow
on the liver, right?

42
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,590
No.

43
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,320
The risk period is too long

44
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,200
after the heart is separated.

45
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,320
The shortest liver isolation

46
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,110
we've done so far

47
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,390
was an hour and ten minutes.

48
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,110
Two already weak hearts

49
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,930
can't sustain

50
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,040
that long.

51
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,670
And it's a lot of pressure on He.

52
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,360
Actually, there's nothing wrong
with the plan

53
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,270
of Women's and Children's Hospital.

54
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,990
The older one takes priority.

55
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:16,890
Look.

56
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:17,820
The twins are in competition

57
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,000
with each other.

58
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,840
The younger one has been

59
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,640
stealing blood volume from her sister,

60
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,240
who doesn't have a heart condition,

61
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,990
and dragging

62
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,870
her otherwise healthy sister down.

63
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,310
But I think

64
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,590
the older one has been

65
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,710
protecting her sister,

66
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,280
so the younger one

67
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,750
has been able to keep going.

68
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:38,520
Also,

69
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,990
if the older one could talk,

70
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,270
I think she would have said,

71
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,110
"Please save her for me."

72
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,800
That's why the current plan

73
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,550
makes the most sense.

74
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,670
First, deal
with the most time-consuming liver,

75
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,640
then the pericardium,

76
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,430
ribs, sternum, and diaphragm.

77
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,830
Finally, the most treacherous

78
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:58,550
infections,

79
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,550
respiratory failure,

80
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,800
and circulatory imbalances
have to be addressed.

81
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,320
It's very hard

82
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,710
to keep both sisters alive.

83
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:04,990
It's not easier
than The Journey to the West.

84
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,080
The Journey to the West?

85
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,550
Ever since you gave me

86
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,240
that nickname,

87
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,590
my luck has kept going down.

88
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,200
Shut up.

89
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,360
Eat your food, Pigsy.

90
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,440
Professor.

91
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,390
I'll take care of this.

92
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,960
Go talk to them for a while.

93
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:23,790
I...

94
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,790
I have nothing to talk to them about.

95
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,520
You're not helping

96
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,790
here anyway.

97
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,880
I'm sorry.

98
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,710
Then I'll stop.

99
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,960
I'm always not helping anyway.

100
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:52,560
Professor.

101
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,150
Drinking alone?

102
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:54,760
Come on.

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,270
We have a saying in China.

104
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,680
A smile ends an enmity.

105
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,680
I'll drink it up. Make yourself at home.

106
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,590
Great! Good job!

107
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,230
Nice.

108
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,200
Professor.

109
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,440
I'll tell you what.

110
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,440
That day, I was talking nonsense.

111
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,320
Don't take it personally.

112
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,710
I won't.

113
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,350
If you hadn't provoked me,

114
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,590
I might have hesitated,

115
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,270
and we wouldn't have succeeded

116
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,030
in separating the heart today.

117
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,320
Professor.

118
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,470
Actually,

119
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,230
you're no worse than Yun.

120
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,470
What's your disadvantage?

121
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,390
The cooperation.

122
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,270
We're friends in life and death.

123
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,350
It was built
through the gastrointestinal machine

124
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,230
during the earthquake.

125
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,350
With just a look,
we understand everything.

126
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,080
You know?

127
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,710
Look.

128
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,030
Wukong.

129
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,200
A ginseng fruit.

130
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,230
Shameless.

131
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,440
Take it.

132
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,320
See? Tacit understanding.

133
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,960
Why do you call him Wukong?

134
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,270
He called me Pigsy.

135
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,150
Journey to the West.

136
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,640
Who's the Longevity Monk?

137
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,000
Zheng.

138
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,030
All the hospitals want him.

139
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,150
So...

140
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,390
Who's Yue?

141
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,200
There are only four main characters
in the Journey to the West.

142
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,640
No women.

143
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,760
Bodhisattva.

144
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,680
Female Bodhisattva.

145
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,760
When it comes to Journey to the West,

146
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,000
if you look at it differently,

147
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,590
Wukong is actually

148
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,080
narrow-minded.

149
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,910
Pigsy, I can hear you.

150
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,350
He's so vain.

151
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,960
Pigsy is actually quite benevolent.

152
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,830
You.

153
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,230
You're the White Dragon Horse.

154
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,000
You're the foreign aid.

155
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,470
And you're white.

156
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,390

are so many and bright.

168
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,790
Yes.

169
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,640
They're like shadowless lamps

170
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,590
in an operating room.

171
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,270
Please.

172
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,440
Can you stop telling cold jests

173
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,350
like Zheng Ren?

174
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,030
I didn't tell cold jests.

175
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,320
I'm serious.

176
00:07:59,030 --> 00:07:59,680
When I first

177
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,080
entered the operating room

178
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,230
as a child and looked up

179
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,350
at the shadowless light above my head,

180
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:06,760
I felt

181
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,640
it was like a star in the sky.

182
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,120
He was shining gently on me

183
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,320
and seemed to be saying,

184
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,710
"Don't worry.

185
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,520
You're going to be okay.

186
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,760
Someone is trying to save you.

187
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,230
You're going to live."

188
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,910
That's why I love surgery

189
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,560
and shadowless lights.

190
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,960
I also love watching doctors

191
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,960
save people from death

192
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,870
in order to keep them alive.

193
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,630
That's why

194
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,470
I feel especially proud

195
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,870
to be side by side with you

196
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,560
in the operating room.

197
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,470
I like the stars, too.

198
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,200
It's like a heart.

199
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,230
With every twinkle

200
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,470
and beat,

201
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,230
it seems to say,

202
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,750
"Look.

203
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,080
I'm alive."

204
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,630
Being alive

205
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,110
is the best thing in the world.

206
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:07,920
When I was abroad,

207
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,830
it was late

208
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,080
every time I walked out of the library.

209
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Seeing the stars in the sky,

210
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,350
I realized that there was one less day

211
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,750
that medicine could be with me.

212
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,280
Is about 30,000 days.

213
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,590
Time flies.

214
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,560
I can't waste it.

215
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,200
I have to move forward.

216
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,470
I'm better than I was yesterday.

217
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,400
And I'll be even more awesome tomorrow.

218
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,470
Why is it that

219
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,470
when I hear Britain and the stars

220
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,400
I think of Stargazy Pie,

221
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,680
the most demonic dish in Britain?

222
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,320
A bunch of fish looking up at the sky.

223
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,710
That's not stargazing.

224
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,080
They are turning over in their grave.

225
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,280
Don't talk like that.

226
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,350
Gross.

227
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,350
Punish him.

228
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,990
Master!

229
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,960
Help!

230
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,110
He's really the favorite

231
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,280
of us all.

232
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,200
Taking him to the front

233
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,110
was the best thing I ever did.

234
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,630
And provoking you to go to the front

235
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,960
was the best thing I ever did.

236
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,560
You...

237
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,160
500.

238
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,230
Thank you for waiting for me.

239
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,750
I'm really ready this time.

240
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:41,960
Yun.

241
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,200
Do you think the operation
will be successful?

242
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,230
That feels strange

243
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,200
coming from you.

244
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,960
I didn't say it before

245
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,470
because I had no one to say it to,

246
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,560
but now I do.

247
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,710
My answer

248
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,750
is that we trust you.

249
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,590
And you trust us.

250
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,510
If there's one team

251
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,440
that can take this surgery,

252
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,990
it's us.

253
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,630
Forgive me.

254
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,750
Yun, help me.

255
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,870
Still trying to run?

256
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,560
I surrender.

257
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,240
I surrender.

258
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:15,500
[Wen Xiuxiu]

259
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,440
Hello.

260
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,400
Mr. Zheng.

261
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,710
The younger of the conjoined twins

262
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,400
developed acute heart failure
five minutes ago.

263
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,680
All numbers are dropping.

264
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,590
We have to operate immediately.

265
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,710
There's no time to lose.

266
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,710
OK.

267
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,040
I'll be right there.

268
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,080
Acute heart failure

269
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,630
has further reduced

270
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,680
our operating time.

271
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,040
The heart and liver are getting bigger,

272
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,230
so we're going to have

273
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,400
to adjust the whole procedure.

274
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,080
We'll have to isolate the heart

275
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:50,990
before we can operate on the liver.

276
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,590
Then the anesthesia can't be adjusted

277
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,870
as slowly as it was in the simulation

278
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,230
to wait for the heart rate
to come down little by little.

279
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,280
Heart failure can cause
all the data to be wrong.

280
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,040
If we recalculate...

281
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,350
And the heart simulation

282
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,510
only worked once.

283
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,680
The younger one's heart ultrasound

284
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,470
was posted to the group.

285
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,320
Let's take a look.

286
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,960
The younger one must undergo

287
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,160
immediate corrective cardiac surgery.

288
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,560
How much time do we have left?

289
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,400
For the separation,

290
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,870
an hour and a half, conservatively.

291
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,680
But our previous record

292
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,520
was two hours and three minutes.

293
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,960
That was without heart failure.

294
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,990
With this change,

295
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,680
an hour and a half won't be enough.

296
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,630
Now,

297
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,590
there's not much time left for us.

298
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,990
To be on the safe side,

299
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,470
we can only spend one hour.

300
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,160
Separate the pericardium first.

301
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,040
Thirty minutes.

302
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,590
Can you do it?

303
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,630
And 30 minutes for the liver?

304
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,800
Our previous record

305
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,920
was one hour and seven minutes.

306
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,630
We can do it.

307
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,110
Su Yun.

308
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,160
Chang Yue.

309
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,280
Can you do it?

310
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:55,590
OK.

311
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,750
Then that's it.

312
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,560
There are four steps to the surgery.

313
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,400
Step one.

314
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,710
Separate the heart first.

315
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,800
Limited to 30 minutes.

316
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,080
Step two.

317
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,960
Separate the liver.

318
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,080
Limited to 30 minutes.

319
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,440
Step three, He Qian.

320
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,230
Extracorporeal circulation
for the younger one.

321
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,040
Su Yun performs
corrective cardiac surgery.

322
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,200
I work with Lin Yuan
to suture her sister.

323
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,160
Step four.

324
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,350
The plastic surgeon makes

325
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,080
the final patch.

326
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,230
Do you understand?

327
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:17,990
- Yes.
- Okay.

328
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:19,750
One last question.

329
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,680
Based on the current situation,

330
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,110
are we still on the air?

331
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,080
Ms. Su.

332
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,440
Zheng Ren and others
haven't arrived yet.

333
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,680
They're on their way back.

334
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,230
They said they'll be here
in half an hour.

335
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,870
Notify the operating room

336
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,110
to prepare for the surgery.

337
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,160
Ms. Su.

338
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,200
Is the surgery still on air?

339
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,990
Mr. Zheng, you decide.

340
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,160
If you say so, we'll go live.

341
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,870
Zheng Ren, don't get hung up on it.

342
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,630
It's your call.

343
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,710
At this point,

344
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,880
we trust you.

345
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,400
Yes.

346
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:24,920
Your call.

347
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:25,510
Your call.

348
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,350
Zheng Ren.

349
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,080
You're the captain.

350
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,230
Everyone listens to you.

351
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,320
If we go live,

352
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,960
the simulation of this surgery

353
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,440
has never succeeded before.

354
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,470
It's too dangerous.

355
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,990
And the younger one

356
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,320
is in acute heart failure.

357
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,470
It will cause the failure rate

358
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,590
to be much higher.

359
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,870
Ms. Su.

360
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,710
Do you think

361
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,160
we should go on the air?

362
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,200
Go straight to surgery. No livestream.

363
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,200
Try to save the sisters

364
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
and make them both

365
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:42,680
alive.

366
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:44,400
Understood.

367
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:45,750
Ms. Su.

368
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,990
No, stay on the air.

369
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,680
We'll do everything we can

370
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,510
to make this surgery successful.

371
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,200
Even if it fails,

372
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,110
we'll at least give everyone

373
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,800
more experience

374
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,800
in the next conjoined twins surgery

375
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,510
to avoid repeating our mistakes.

376
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,040
This surgery

377
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,920
will still be relevant.

378
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,400
Success involves a lot of coincidence

379
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,030
and luck.

380
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,710
It cannot be duplicated,

381
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,880
but failure is different.

382
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,750
The path that keeps moving forward

383
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,990

00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,110
Then I'll try harder.

766
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,880
This is my gift to you all.

767
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,030
This one's pretty funny.

768
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:31,720
What is this?

769
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,240
What is this?

770
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,960
Dr. Zheng, you have this hobby?

771
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:34,880
Look.

772
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:35,960
That's me, right?

00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,840
Rudolph.

774
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,630
That's you.

775
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,510
It's kind of similar.

776
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,360
It's kind of similar.

777
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,510
Am I that fat?

778
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,360
- Which one of these is me?
- This is me.

779
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,400
- Let me take a look.
- Nice.

00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:45,760
It looks good.

781
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,720
Which one of these is me?

782
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,110
The one on the left.

783
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,240
Why do we look the same?

784
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,280
- How can that be?
- It's so lively!

785

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,670
An invitation?

793
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,070
Let me see it.

794
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,880

795
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,840

796
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,630

806
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,070
I can't believe it.

807
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,070
Are you attending?

808
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,630
Of course.

809
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,670
Then we need one more.

Don't you think twice?

I've made up my mind,

814
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,400
so I have to do it right.
