Hello.

12
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,610
Ms. Su,

13
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,910
Huangya suffered acute shock

14
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,790
and based on the report,

15
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,360
we noticed the infected area

16
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:42,910
has expanded.

17
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,320
There's no way to treat it

18
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,230
through interventional operation.

19
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,280
Instead, we'll need to perform surgery.

20
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,270
I've informed

21
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,280

and vascular surgery.

22
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,630
However, Mr. Lin's phone

23
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,630
is unreachable now.

24
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:52,670
This surgery will require

25
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,880
liver autotransplantation,

26
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,600

28
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,840

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,800

to reach out to you,

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,440

43
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,000
Why not call her back?

What if

[Huang Aguo's Diagnosis Report,

58
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,680
The last time so many doctors gathered

59
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
was when we did surgery

60
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,600
for a VIP.

61
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,070
This patient is way more impressive

62
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:43,920
than any VIPs.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,950
He was a troublemaker
in the medical field

64
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,750
when he was younger,

65
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,750
and almost toppled

70
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,000
Yes.

72
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,040

73
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,870

We asked him about the medical fee,

78
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,240
but he said that his dad
was rich enough to pay for himself.

79
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,560

He could crack a joke.

104

This patient has a chance

105
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,390
of radical treatment of the lesion

106
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,950
but the risk is high.

107
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,800
It is advisable to perform
extracorporeal hepatectomy

108
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,190
and liver autotransplantation.

109
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,190
Thank you.

110
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,070
The surgery will be in three phases.

The vivo surgery,

112
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,190
extracorporeal hepatectomy,

113

The vivo surgery

116
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,360
will be the easiest among all,

117
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,630
whereas the reconstruction of IVC

118
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,190
and extracorporeal hepatectomy
will be the hardest.

119
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,950
Hence, the surgery sequence will be

120
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,040
urology surgery,

121
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,920

followed by thoracic intervention,

123
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
and lastly liver autotransplantation.

124
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,120
The liver autotransplantation surgery

125
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,920

to revealing the blood vessels
leading to the liver

136

as well as obstructing
the flow of the hepatic blood.

137
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,160
It's all very challenging.

138

and 2nd porta hepatis

141
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,270
contain important blood vessels

142

that are crisscrossed together.

143
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,870

to bleed excessively

There's no surgical field.

The local anatomical structure

151

Dr. Su is amazing.

157
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,880
He could predict Dr. Zheng's every move

158
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,520
ahead of time.

159
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,240
He even mapped out the surgical field.

160

with organ preservation solution.

167

you'll be in charge
of removing the lesion.

170
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,310
I'll repair the hepatic vessels

171
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,190
and reconstruct the IVC.

172
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,160
Alright.

173
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,460
[Haicheng Hospital]

174
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,840
Even a normal patient would not be able

175
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,030
to withstand cutting off

176
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,550
such a large area of liver tissue.

177
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,550
The damage is too huge

178

for this patient.

179
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,880
Thus,

180
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,760
is there a benefit
to doing such a surgery?

181
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,360
Of course there is.

182
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,720
For practioners like us,

183
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,520
every surgery is important.

184
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,400
Each surgery allows us

185
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,600
to increase its success rate.

186
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,670
Removed the lesion.

187
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,240
Reconstructed the IVC.

188
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,790
The next part of the surgery
will take a lot of time.

of a parked car

241
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,480
whereas the liver autotransplantation
is as if

00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,270
you're changing the engine

243
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,630
of a moving car.

244
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,390
While doing this,

245
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:56,800
you'll have to make sure

246
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,600
that the car can still
be driven normally.

247
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:04,990
Among these,

248
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,150

249
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:09,800

You're right. Experience.

I'll do it.

258
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,030
Get some rest.

259

Abdominal wash.

261
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,360
Hemostatic gauze.

262
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,960
Congratulations, Dr. Zheng.

263
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,680
Thank you.

264
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:39,800
Huh?

265
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,630
Are you thanking me?

266
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,200
If it wasn't for you,

267

I would still be hesitating.

268

Thanks to you, I made my decision.

269
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,680
Do you believe in destiny?

270
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,360
I do.

271
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,390
I met Dr. Chen

272
00:16:59,150 --> 00:16:59,910
and then I met you.

273
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,030
This is destiny.

274
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,870
It was in this hospital

275
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,320
that I was saved by Dr. Chen.

276
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,430
A few years later,
I decided to practice medicine.

277
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,080
Thus, I came to Haicheng

278
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,240
to be an instrument nurse.

279
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,110
I want the late Dr. Chen

280
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,280
to see

281
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,840
that the little girl
that he tried his best to save

282
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,430
many years ago

283
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,840
is all grown up.

284
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,190
She's not paralyzed.

285
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,670
She's living a normal life.

286
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,950
Saving people like how

287
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,430
he used to.

288
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,080
And now that I'm here,

289
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,520
I met you.

290
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,560
I've partaken in all your surgeries

291
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,520
and witnessed
how you've completed surgeries

292
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,710
that I could not.

293
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:17,470
I believe

294
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,670
that the late Dr. Chen

295
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,040
would be proud of you.

296
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,870
He would be proud of you too.

297
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,870
Successfully completed

298
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,600
the 447th surgery

299
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,240
within my 333 days

300
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,360
of working in Haicheng.

301
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,040
Mr. Lin,

302
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:23,190
you've contributed a lot today,

303
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,110
for bringing the patient back to life!

304
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,040
I know some of you

305
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,190
are worried

306
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,280
about my relationship with Zheng Ren.

307
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:43,710
I admit

308
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,800
that I once envied him.

309
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:47,840
I also admit

310
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:50,840
that I was jealous of him before.

311
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,560
I even thought

312
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,520
that I'd become old and useless.

313
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,870
But after the operation today,

314
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,630
I noticed that I'm still capable.

315
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:02,910
I can still fight.

316
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,670
The operating table is our stage

317
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,280
for us doctors.

318
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,000
It's too early

319
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,280
for us to pass on the stage

320
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,470
to the young ones.

321
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,080
Mr. Lin...

322
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,320
The young ones have stamina

323
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,360
while we have experience.

324
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:25,360
From now on,

325
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,000
we'll see it on the operating table.

326

Why are you late?

327
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,280
Didn't you say

328
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,560
that you won't take part
in the hospital's matters?

329
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,840
How can I not care?

I knew

331
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,280
you'd give in.

332
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,390
Did you skip

333
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,300

334
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,630

very much craving indeed.

339

There's no fried pork.

Let me tell you.

350

Mom,

353
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,440

Blind date.

357
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,560
It was so difficult

to find someone who doesn't mind you

359
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,520

360

00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:15,880
Hello.

383

384
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,550

just like you.

391
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,520
I told her

392
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,860
that to become a doctor,

393
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,820
you need to study hard.

394
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:41,960
Her grades have improved

395
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:42,750
drastically since then.

396
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,680

Dr. Zheng,

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,960

413
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,050
I would like to find out

414
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,890
if is it technically possible

415
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,750
to livestream a surgery.

416
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,550
Technicality-wise, it's doable.

417
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:44,710
Usually,

418
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,440
you'll need the support
of the streaming platform

419
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,640
as well as some operational

420
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,680
and promotional costs.

421
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,550
However...

422
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,790
Is there an issue?

423
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,640
Live streaming a surgery

424
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,920
is different from other forms
of live streaming.

425
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,070
You might accidentally

426
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,240
invade the patient's privacy,

427
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,200
which can

428
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,160
be quite a sensitive issue.

429
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,440
The platform that broadcasts the content

430
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,160
will need to bear the risk as well.

431
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,720
Hence,

432
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,930
you'll need to find a platform

433
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,370
that is willing to work with your team

434
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,680
and take the risk together

435
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,840
so that the project will work out.

436
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,510
I understand.

as well as ample resources.

445
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,680

The first surgery to be broadcast

459
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,480
must consist of these three elements.

460
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,960

You can tell them this next time,

526
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:07,680
the secret to eating a lot
and not getting fat

527
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,560
is anterior pelvic tilt.

528
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,100
Anterior pelvic tilt?

529
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,200
The most obvious symptom

530
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,320
is hip kyphosis.

531
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,110

534
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,500
But the lower abdomen
is slightly protruding.

535
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,750
When you often love wearing high heels,

536
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,610
it will shift the human's
gravity center forward.

537
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,970
Thus, causing the pelvic misalignment.

538
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:27,310
What else?

539
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,200

Now that you're still young.

541

542
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,080
that your internal organ starts to sag

543
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,080
and your lower abdomen
will protrude even more.

544
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,120
Your hips will grow sideways

545
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,200
and you'll develop out-toeing,

546
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:36,830
constipation,

547
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,710

who was in his advanced stage

00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,680
of dilated cardiomyopathy.

646
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,950
The patient wanted a heart transplant,

647
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,600
but couldn't find a suitable donor.

648
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:09,120
And after much deliberation,

649
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,080

Professor Wu initiated the surgery,

654
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:20,240
and Su Yun took over

655
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,910
after Professor Wu
showed signs of fatigue.

remained in critical condition.

didn't understand its risk.

667
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:47,560
The professor fell

668
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:49,600
and his right hand pressed

669
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,640
onto the glass shards.

670
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,390
So it wasn't Su Yun's hand
that got injured?

671
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,050
No.

672
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:56,240
It was the professor's.

673
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,790
And he can no longer
perform any surgery.

674
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,160
Since then, Su Yun also
