00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,830
In honor of the brothers'

382
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,730
successful surgery,

383
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,120
it's time for the monthly fellowship

384
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,570
between the hospitals again.

385
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,530
I, the single, have to take my chances.

386
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:43,640
Unlike you two

387
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,600
who have network addiction.

388
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,680
Go for it!

389
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,530
Yun.

390
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,250
I have something to do. I'm not going.

391
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,530
See you.

392
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,920
Yue, let's go.

393
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,010
OK.

394
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,490
You're going too?

395
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,400
Yes.

396
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,250
Are you ready?

397
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,730
Let's go.

398
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,640
You're going too?

399
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,120
Why can't I go?

400
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,290
Really?

401
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,840
Zheng, you're going too?

402
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,960
Oh, no.

403
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,290
Everyone in the field now knows

404
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:09,840
that Haicheng Hospital

405
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,050
has an interventional genius,

406
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,920
a cancer survivor.

407
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,160
If you go,

408
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,210
no one will pay attention to me.

409
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,330
I'm going.

410
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:16,400
Yun,

411
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,330
- you just said...
- Shut up.

412
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,010
I'm backing out.

413
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,330
I'll go change.

414
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,050
Wait for me.

415
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,160
- You're all going?
- Let's go.

416
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,640
No one will notice me.

417
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,970
Be careful.

418
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,120
Here?

419
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,530
Good choice.

420
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:00,880
Yue.

421
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,080
Which boy do you like?

422
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,030
Let me know
if you're too embarrassed to tell him.

423
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,160
I'll help you.

424
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,770
I'm here for a drink.

425
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,250
Do you want it?

426
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,210
No.

427
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,210
Then shut up.

428
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,680
No wonder

429
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,600
you always fail.

430
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,640
That's not true, Yun.

431
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,010
Every time Yue comes,

432
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,680
many boys ask for her phone numbers.

433
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,720
Really?

434
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,440
Yue is the girl who receives

435
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,730
the most flowers at Haicheng Hospital.

436
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,530
They must be from patients' families

437
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,770
who want to say thanks.

438
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:30,600
You know nothing.

439
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:43,490
500.

440
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,070
It's not a good idea

441
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:45,920
to study in this place.

442
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,870
[3D Printing
Helps Separate Siamese Twins]

443
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:48,840
It's not.

444
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,250
Too noisy.

445
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,870
Stop it. Let's go.

446
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,680
Come and dance with me.

447
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,490
Do you think I can dance?

448
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,480
I can teach you.

449
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,050
Come on.

450
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,640
Stop it. Give it to me now.

451
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,840
No.

452
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:01,680
I'll give it to you when you can dance.

453
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,400
Give it to me now.

454
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,250
You've taught me so much,

455
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,010
I should teach you something too.

456
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,080
Sorry.

457
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,970
It's you.

458
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,600
Who called her here?

459
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,440
Whammy.

460
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,840
Su Yun.

461
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,250
Graduated from a prestigious
medical university.

462
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,010
Published a paper in The Lancet

463
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,570
at the age of 21.

464
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,770
After you

465
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,110
did a heart transplant

466
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,400
with autologous stem cells in mice,

467
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,080
you became famous for a while.

468
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,810
Then, because of the accident
of your teacher,

469
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,920
Professor Wu,

470
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,440
you were devastated.

471
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,290
You returned to Haicheng Hospital
against all advice.

472
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,570
You decided to stop doing surgeries

473
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,120
and laze away in the Emergency Clinic.

474
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,160
You were arrogant

475
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,810
and thought you
were still the best in the world

476
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,120
until you met Zheng Ren.

477
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,880
Realizing that you couldn't surpass him,

478
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,290
you became his shadow.

479
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,530
Does it have anything to do with you?

480
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,250
Anything else?

481
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,360
I heard

482
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,160
you've got PTSD

483
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,250
and can't operate anymore.

484
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,050
With your condition,

485
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,490
how dare you laugh
at my hands-on skills?

486
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,530
I don't just laugh
at your hands-on skills.

487
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,400
You're much worse

488
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,680
at basic knowledge and experience.

489
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,360
Let's do it?

490
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,010
Sure.

491
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,770
No.

492
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,570
Mr. Lin.

493
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,210
I won't allow it.

494
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,160
Do what?

495
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,290
I shouldn't have agreed to you

496
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,250
going to America in the first place.

497
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,290
Look what you've become.

498
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,770
Degenerate.

499
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:49,880
Starting tomorrow,

500
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,810
let's face off.

501
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:51,920
Competing on the reception rate
and cure rate.

502
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,730
For one month.

503
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,730
If you lose,

504
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,530
I'll participate
in all Zheng Ren's surgeries from now on.

505
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,010
If you lose,

506
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,050
go back to Man'ou.

507
00:24:59,070 --> 00:24:59,520
OK.

508
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,810
Come on. Who cares?

509
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,880
This is what we're going to do.

510
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,840
Your mom told me to ask you

511
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:13,600
when you're coming home for dinner.

512
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,840
When I become vice president,

513
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,250
I'll be home for the celebration dinner.

514
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,010
Zheng.

515
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,600
Don't you stop them?

516
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,330
That's good.

517
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,250
But Zheng...

518
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,440
I think it's good too.

519
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,210
What?

520
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:38,790
Yue.

521
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,400
Why are you also talking
like you don't care?

522
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,400
I'm going home.

523
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,570
Let's go together.

524
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,840
Wait.

525
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,490
The fellowship has just begun.

526
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,080
I've already seen what I want to see.

527
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,040
But...

528
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,570
Who's paying?

529
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,810
See you.

530
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,470
Bye.

531
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,120
Bye.

532
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,730
Hey, Yiren.

533
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:11,530
How's it going?

534
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,290
Did the plan go well?

535
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:13,810
It all depends

536
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,160
on their final showdown.

537
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:15,840
To be honest,

538
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,840
when you first

539
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,810
told me about this plan,

540
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,570
I thought you came up with it.

541
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,820
But I never expected it

542
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,910
to be Zheng Ren.

543
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,580
You want to find out from me

544
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,230
which doctors are suitable

545
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,740
to join the Siamese Surgery team?

546
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,630
Don't you know the level

547
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,020
of these doctors?

548
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:36,340
You can tell by watching a surgery.

549
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,740
Surgery can only show

550
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,820
a doctor's skill level,

551
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,630
but as a companion,

552
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,230
they need something more.

553
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:44,630
That's true.

554
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,910
Then let's see their other side.

555
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,740
Outside the hospital.

556
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,470
I think they're all starting to change.

557
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,110
I need to go.

558
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,190
See you.

559
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:23,580
Dad.

560
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,360
What's this cabinet for?

561
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:26,980
For instruments.

562
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,180
For every successful surgery
you perform,

563
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,470
I'll give you

564
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:31,910
the latest customized instrument,

565
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,580
but you have to promise me

566
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,260
that after it's filled,

567
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,950
you'll quit and come back home.

568
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:41,950
You only invited Su Yun

569
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,260
but not me.

570
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,860
Is it because I'm not qualified

[Urology]

574
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,020
Come in.

575
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,950
Do I have any surgeries today?

576
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,390
Not yet.

577
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,870
But there's a medical record

578
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:16,580
in the gastroenterology department.

579
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,740
They'd like you to take a look at it.

[Medical records]

581
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:20,580
What's the patient's problem?

582
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,740
My wife has had diarrhea

583
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,870
for almost five years.

584
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,860
The patient
has had diarrhea for five years.

585
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,390
Diarrhea five to six times a day.

586
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:29,880
Accompanied by progressive lethargy.

587
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,020
Five years ago.

588
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,540
Tell the patient's family to come over.

589
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:34,740
In the beginning,

590
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,190
she had unformed stools.

591
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,500
She'd poop two to three times a day,

592
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,710
then four to five times

593
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,930
a year later.

594
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:41,870
Have you been to the gastroenterologist?

595
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,570
Yes.

596
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,870
They said it was caused by parasites,

597
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,080
but we've verified

598
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,390
hundreds and thousands

599
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,430
of parasites.

600
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:50,260
How could a farmer like me afford that?

601
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:51,470
Please come in.

602
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,630

00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,500

604
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:58,630
Yes.

605
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:00,710
You're so young.

606
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,300
Why don't you come back

607
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,230
ten years later?

608
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,710
Tell me about your husband

609
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,020
before his first attack.

610
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,230
My husband's appetite

611
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,260
became less good,

612
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,060
and he had some stomach pains
five years ago.

613
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,260
Did he eat any abnormal food?

614
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:17,870
Abnormal?

615
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:18,780
No.

616
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,980
We grow our own rice, vegetables,

617
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,950
pigs, and chickens.

618
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:24,250
There are eight people in my family.

619
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,300
They're all fine

620
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,540
except my wife.

621
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,190
It's been a long time.

622
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:31,740
I really don't remember

623
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,390
him eating anything

624
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,430
he shouldn't have.

625
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,870
But he hasn't been the same since then.

626
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,870
He wore diapers?

627
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,390
He's actually a big fan

628
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,390
of traveling and diving.

629
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:41,910
Diving?

630
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,450
We go to places

631
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,490
like Thailand and the Maldives

632
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,340
every year to dive

633
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,020
and travel.

634
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,910
Every year?

635
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:49,630
Has she traveled anywhere?

636
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:50,980
Nowhere.

637
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,390
She didn't have time.

638
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,340
This is the first time

639
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,670
I've taken my wife

640
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,630
into the city.

641
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,020
Did she do anything

642
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:58,250
before the diarrhea got bad?

643
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,500
She likes to play mahjong.

644
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:00,390
Does that count?

645
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:01,740
She had a bad temper.

646
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,260
Whenever she loses, she throws tiles.

647
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,620
Once when she threw a tile,

648
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,260
she threw it too hard

649
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:05,980
and didn't hold back...

650
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,260
Stop.

651
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,470
That's enough.

652
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,710
Is there a problem?

653
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:12,580
Just give me a second.

654
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,950
Gastroenterology?

655
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,260
Did you finish the endoscopy

656
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,230
on the diarrhea patient?

657
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,110
I want to know

658
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:19,910
if you can find parasites

659
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,060
inside the biopsy tissue.

660
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,500
I think it's traveler's diarrhea.

661
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,470
Traveler's diarrhea?

662
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:25,470
What is it?

663
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,430
Your husband's illness

664
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:27,250
is probably

665
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,710
a Giardia lamblia infection.

666
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,630
This parasite parasitizes

667
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,260
the gallbladder of the small intestine
of the body,

668
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,230
mainly in the duodenum.

669
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,260
It can cause symptoms
such as abdominal pain,

670
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,580
diarrhea, and indigestion

671
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,470
and lead to Giardiasis.

672
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:36,500
In the last decade,

673
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,630
due to the growth
of the tourism industry,

674
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,230
it has become more prevalent
among travelers,

675
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,630
so it is also called
traveler's diarrhea.

676
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,870
The intestinal capsule endoscopy?

677
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,110
What's that?

678
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,580
There's a thread on the capsule.

679
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:47,630
After you swallow this capsule

680
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:48,780
from your mouth,

681
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:49,950
the other end of the thread

682
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,870
will stay outside your mouth.

683
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,540
After three or four hours,

684
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,870
the nylon string inside the capsule

685
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,150
will reach your duodenum.

686
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:56,500
Then I'll pull this string

687
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,580
out of your mouth

688
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:58,540
and scrape the contents

689
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,340
for examination.

690
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,780
Isn't it too much trouble?

691
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,910
You don't have to do a gastroscope.

692
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:02,870
And it's cheaper.

693
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:03,910
Then this one.

694
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:04,670
It's too much trouble.

695
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:05,500
I've never heard

696
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,230
of a similar way

697
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,910
in Man'ou.

698
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,200
You tell them

699
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,780
to take a biopsy tissue with a lens

700
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,060
and use the Giardia lamblia

701
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,260
Rapid Diagnostic Kit.

702
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,210
Just do it again when you're done
with the gastroscopy.

703
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:14,980
Why hesitate?

704
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,640
But you feel bad
when doing a gastroscopy.

705
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,020
Worse than wearing diapers all the time?

706
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,880
If one person has it,

707
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,950
the whole family gets it.

708
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,540
But I'm fine.

709
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,120
A lot of medications

710
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,130
work on giardia.

711
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,240
Like the Furazolidone you're taking.

712
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,110
If diagnosed,

713
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:29,950
oral metronidazole

714
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:30,940
can be

715
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,910
over 98% effective.

716
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,490
Do you mean

717
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,430
that this disease
that has been bothering my husband

718
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,670
for so long can be cured

719
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:38,980
by metronidazole alone?

720
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,300
I'm sorry, doctor.

721
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,740
I'm not questioning you.

722
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,190
I meant...

723
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:46,430
Okay, I got it.

724
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:47,190
Thank you.

725
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,190
The results are in.

726
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,660
Giardia lamblia infection.

727
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,910
I'll give you metronidazole.

728
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,230
I've been to so many hospitals

729
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,740
in such a long time

730
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,630
while you tested it in five minutes.

731
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,580
I'm sorry.

732
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:58,910
I won't say you're young anymore.

733
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:02,820
Let me reintroduce myself to you again.

734
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,230
I'm a reporter
for Haicheng's Highlights.

735
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,670
If metronidazole

736
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,580
really works,

737
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:07,820
I'll do a story on you.

738
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:13,630
Yun, something is wrong.

739
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:14,420
The patient is in bad shape.

740
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,260
We can't do this test.

741
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:16,580
Not even

742
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,390
for the bowel test capsule?

743
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,500
Doctor.

744
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:24,380
Please.

745
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,430
What's going on here?

746
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:27,780
I'll check her first.

747
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,780
Zhou, put the pillow away.

748
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:29,950
Curl her legs up.

749
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:30,580
Be careful.

750
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,500
Be careful.

751
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:35,110
Undress her.

752
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,110
Show her belly.

753
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:37,740
Like this?

754
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:38,430
Hands off.

755
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,060
Tell me if it hurts.

756
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:42,630
What about here?

757
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,230
No.

758
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,020
Doctor, it hurts!

759
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:45,710
Here?

760
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,150
Let me see your hands.

761
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:50,780
There's a rash on my hands.

762
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,470
Her feet are swollen.

763
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:57,230
I think

764
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,540
it's eosinophilic enteritis.

765
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,430
Do a colonoscopy first.

766
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,230
No, we don't want to go through that.

767
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:01,910
Really.

768
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,630
In all the hospitals
we've been to before,

769
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,740
we've never missed a colonoscopy
or a gastroscopy.

770
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,060
We've spent all the money we needed to.

771
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,630
I came here

772
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,390
because I heard

773
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,580
you don't force us to do tests.

774
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,620
We don't want to go through that.

775
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,670
Please, no.

776
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:17,500
What does she like to eat?

777
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:20,300
Pork stew with vermicelli.

778
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,670
Could it be a tapeworm?

779
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:22,190
No, it's not.

780
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,630
Tapeworms rarely cause diarrhea.

781
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:24,450
Doctor.

782
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:25,390
Just look at her

783
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,580
and tell us

784
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,710
if you find anything.

785
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,980
If you can't

786
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,740
find anything wrong,

787
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,910
I'll take my wife home

788
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,190
and tell her to eat
what she wants to eat.

789
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:32,820
Really.

790
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,340
Since she got this disease,

791
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,980
she and I haven't had a drink

792
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:37,820
and a snail together

793
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,150
in years.

794
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,680
You guys like snails?

795
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:42,820
Zhen does.

796
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,600
She could eat a bowl of them

797
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,920
by herself in one night with wine.

798
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,230
That's still a parasite.

799
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:48,500
It's probably Trichinella.

800
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:49,970
But the key question

801
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:50,540
is not that

802
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:51,390
but why she's had trouble

803
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,540
getting out of bed for two months.

804
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,260
Isn't it an electrolyte disorder

805
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,540
caused by diarrhea?

806
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,300
I don't think so.

807
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,340
Let's skip the colonoscopy.

808
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:57,390
I think

809
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,580
it is eosinophilia

810
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,780
complicating Loeffler endocarditis.

811
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,780
Get the ultrasound machine.

812
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,110
OK.

813
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:02,490
Come on. Move her here.

814
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:03,020
Together.

815
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,150
Watch her head.

816
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,150
Doctor.

817
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,150
How much does it cost?

818
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,110
With me,

819
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,190
it costs zero.

820
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:14,590
Why?

821
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,150
My labor is worthless.

822
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,590
It's kind of cold.

823
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:20,820
Come on.

824
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,460
There's a substantial
strong echogenicity

825
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,740
attached to the apical portion
of the left ventricle.

826
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,420
It's irregular.

827
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:30,420
May be a thrombus.

828
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,900
May be Loeffler endocarditis.

829
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,260
Left ventricular

830
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,710
systolic function is reduced.

831
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,300
Moderate mitral
and tricuspid regurgitation.

832
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:40,300
Paper.

833
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,230
Wipe it.

834
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,340
Did you find anything?

835
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,670
It's not eosinophilia

836
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:47,550
with granulomas.

837
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:48,860
It's left heart failure induced

838
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:50,230
by a left ventricular thrombus.

839
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:52,940
When was the last time she ate or drank?

840
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:53,860
Just now.

841
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,300
Left heart failure.

842
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:57,940
Do we need anticoagulants

843
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,900
to ablate the clot?

844
00:34:59,100 --> 00:34:59,550
No.

845
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,420
Five years of diarrhea.

846
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,340
It's been a long time coming.

847
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:04,070
Open surgery to remove the clot
is the optimal treatment,

848
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:05,510
but the cost is...

849
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,550
How much?

850
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:08,460
150,000.

851
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,300
How much? 150,000?

852
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:14,630
Don't worry.

853
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:15,740

the cost after reimbursement

857
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,900
is about 50,000.

858
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,630
50,000?

859
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,190
It's just diarrhea.

860
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,740
Diarrhea. 50,000?

861
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,630
Is the exchange rate for money

862
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,230
in the big city so low?

863
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,070
How can we have 50,000?

864
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:44,940
What to do?

865
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,900
Qiang.

866
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,150
50,000.

867
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,630
50,000 is too hard for us.

868
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:52,590
Let's forget it.

869
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,190
