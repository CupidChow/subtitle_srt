00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,060
You're a better doctor than him.

196
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,250
I'm better-looking than him.

197
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,850
He's a good surgeon.

198
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,320
Having been at Haicheng Hospital
for over ten years,

199
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,580
he's very well respected

200
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,610
by the VIP clients.

201
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,860
You seem to know a lot

202
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,820
about this hospital.

203
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,580
I thought you didn't care

204
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,820
about anything but surgery.

205
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,060
For a very simple reason.

206
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,580
He's in general surgery.

207
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,510
I'm much more optimistic

208
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,300
about the future
of the interventional department.

209
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,660
If things go well,

210
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,820
it could bring a 20% revenue boost

211
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,490
to Haicheng Hospital.

212
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,210
Any more questions?

213
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,340
I have a question.

214
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,060
Hua.

215
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,060
You can just put him alone
in the picture,

216
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,970
but why did you add me?

217
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,490
I said I want a team.

218
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,180
A team

219
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,820
headed by you two.

220
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,970
A team.

221
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,300
A team?

222
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,850
Does he deserve it?

223
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,490
I'm the future star

224
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,370

225
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,820
Well, it looks like

226
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,730
your future is long overdue.

227
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,820
You were nothing

228
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,250
when I was famous.

229
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,320
There are a lot of fallen stars

230
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,080
in the medical world.

231
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,180
Who's fallen star?

232
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,850
You.

233
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,210
That's enough.

234
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,870
You two

235
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,600
have the same complaint rate.

236
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,340
Don't dislike each other.

237
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,130
I don't care, Hua.

238
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,420
I'm not teaming up
with this fallen star.

239
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,780
I don't need a team.

240
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,010
Don't you dare say that again?

241
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,890
You really don't need a team

242
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,370
for this kind

243
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,460
of difficult surgery?

244
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,130
That's good.

245
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,970
Looks like you agreed.

246
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,460
What about you?

247
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,890
I don't do surgery,

248
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,180
so I'm definitely not on board.

249
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,010
OK.

250
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,660
I'm sorry.

251
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,610
Not this picture.

252
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,370
I told you.

253
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,820
Mr. Lin must be...

254
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,010
Still Dr. Zheng Ren?

255
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,000
Yes.

00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,210
with combined pancreaticoduodenectomy

I am against it.

Mr. Lin

270
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,250
is number one

If we're going to choose a Star Doctor,

276
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,540
it should be Mr. Lin.

277
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,010
Okay.

was ranked number one

281
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,730

There were no grade-4 surgeries

286

and only 22 grade-3 surgeries.

287

00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,940
so if you ask me,

308
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,080
it's too one-sided

309
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,010
to just look at the surgical data.

310
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,370
There's a doctor at Haicheng Hospital

311
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,210
who didn't perform
a single surgery last year

312
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,090
but had a diagnosis rate

313
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,180

314
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,940

what the other doctors were thinking.

682
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,340

718
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,060
OK.

719
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,620
I've been having bloody urine

720
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,260
since about six months ago.

721
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,780
At first, I thought it was because

722
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,890
my period wasn't over,

723
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,060
so I didn't pay attention to it.

724
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,310
The doctor told me

725
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,620
to rest for a while,

726
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,590
but my schedule

727
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,930
was too demanding.

728
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,100
The doctor said

729
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,130
it was nothing serious,

730
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,700
but the bloody urine

731
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,580
hadn't gotten better.

732
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,490
I'm afraid

733
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,390
of seeing blood

734
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,620
every time I go to the bathroom.

735
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,690
Give me your pelvic CT.

736
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,300
What are you laughing at?

737
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,450
I guess you suspect
that she urinates frequently.

738
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,070
Because there's no trace
of white blood cells

739
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,260
in the urine test.

740
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,070
That's why you looked

741
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:56,970
at the pelvic CT.

742
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,200
And it turns out

743
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,340
that there's nothing wrong
with her urinary tract.

744
00:30:59,390 --> 00:30:59,970
Isn't that right?

745
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,970
Is that funny?

746
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,540
I need to see

747
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,210
your urine sample.

748
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,380
Why?

749
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,690
He's a straight boy.

750
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,890
He suspects you of faking the sample.

751
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,720
Why would I do that?

752
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,580
Don't take it personally.

753
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,890
It's very common in hospitals.

754
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:17,920
Some people who aren't pregnant

755
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,240
say they are.

756
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,380
Those who are sick say they're not.

757
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,630
Those who aren't sick want
to call in sick.

758
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,130
Of course,

759
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,060
I know you won't do that.

760
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:23,650
500.

761
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,380
It doesn't matter.

762
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,380
I can provide it.

763
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,970

I'm going to the restroom first.

769
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,260

Girls don't always go to the bathroom

Then what to do?

779
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,930
Very many.

780
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,780
For example,

781
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,450
Refine the make-up or lipstick touch-up.

782
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,410
Lipstick?

783
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,210
Your lipstick is the problem.

784
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,380
You went to the bathroom twice

785
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,490
and put on lipstick twice

786
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,540
in the time I've been here.

787
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,620
I think so.

788
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,620
The most common coloring dye

789
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,540
used in lipstick

790
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,780
is bromosulphalein red.

791
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:47,410
That's right.

792
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,410
Frequent use of lipstick

793
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,450
causes bromosulphalein red

794
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,410
to be absorbed into the body

795
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,540
and excreted in the urine.

796
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,890

That was at work.

I won't question that,

801
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,620
but why do you use it out of your work?

802
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:59,650
I want to make myself

803
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,380

804
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,730
Eliminate cosmetics for three days.

805
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,650
The color of your urine

806
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,620

we found no organic lesions.

810
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,570
This indicates
that the coloring agent's ingredients

811

are not very damaging

are what I just mentioned.

956
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,740
But I can't tell what's wrong

957
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,660
from the images.

958
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,340
Can't tell from the images?

959
00:39:59,350 --> 00:39:59,780
That's right.

960
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:00,970
A CT scan was done
on her lower abdomen.

961
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,040
Her intestinal lumen

962
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,820
looks as thin as a thread.

963
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,050
It's all white.

964
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,410
And...

965
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,450
I called Zheng Ren.

966
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,890
If you called Zheng Ren,

967
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:11,930
why are you calling me

968
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:12,890
so late?

969
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,530
Actually, I think

970
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,930
in case the young man

971
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,300
can't make it,

972
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,180
you can still come and save the day.

973
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,050
Okay, I got it.

974
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,530
Zheng.

975
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,620
Where's Su Yun?

976
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,430
I can't reach him,

977
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,740
even though I've made hundreds of calls.

978
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,220
