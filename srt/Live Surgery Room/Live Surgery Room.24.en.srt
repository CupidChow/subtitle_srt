Cold.

7
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:42,890
Relax.

8
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,720
Relax.

9
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:47,490
What's going on?

10
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,440
I thought he didn't hurt

11
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,800
the sciatic nerve or vital organs.

12
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,700
When we came to check on him just now,

13
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,980
we found that he had a high fever
of 39 degrees,

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,210
a heart rate of 111,

15
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,290
and his blood pressure
was dropping all the time.

16
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,280
I think

17
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,340
it's a localized bacterial infection.

18
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,460
It's septicemia.

19
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,700
Get a blood test

20
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,700
and a C-reactive protein test done soon.

21
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,570
The tests are done.

22
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,410
We're waiting for the results.

23
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,850
If it's really septicemia

24
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:04,930
caused by a bacterial infection,

25
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,210
he'll have to be amputated right away.

26
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:15,490
Doctor.

27
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,250
Don't amputate yet.

28
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,140
What?

29
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,620
I'll do
an interventional thrombectomy first

30
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,080
to save a little bit more.

31
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,060
It's his thigh.

32
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,460
Not like the patients

33
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,180
we've done before

34
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,180
with below-the-knee injuries.

35
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,340
We need to save a little bit more.

36
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,120
But without the knee,

37
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,010
even with the prosthesis,

38
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,140
he can only walk with a brace.

39
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,220
It doesn't mean much.

40
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,710
What's important now

41
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,740
is to save his life.

42
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,930
He likes to play basketball.

43
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,900
When the mass poisoning happened,

44
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,490
he didn't wear a suit

45
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,060
but a basketball uniform.

46
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,060
He's like this

47
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,620
because he was delivering consumables.

48
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,460
I'll do what I can.

49
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,490
If we can keep a little more,

50
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,930
maybe he'll be able

51
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,020

92
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:03,890

That's the femoral artery.

103
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,250
It'll bleed like a river
after the incision.

104

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,010

115
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,380

117
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,060
About the prosthesis.

118
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,300
According to textbook standards,

119
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,390
the soft tissue portion
of the residual limb

120
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,420
should be distal
to at least ten centimeters

121
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,370
from the lower femur.

122
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,330
That was before.

123
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,590

125

126
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,490
demonstrated the new bionic prosthesis,

127
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,740
which is now available in Europe
and the United States.

128
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,010
And according to the report,

129
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,660
the bionic prosthesis
can accommodate residual limbs

130
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,010

to three centimeters.

132
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,330
I know there is such a prosthetic limb,

133
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,570
but the problem is

134
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,660
if he can afford it.

135
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,420
I'll pay for it.

136
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,570
There's more than one patient.

137
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,860
There are many patients
who need to be amputated.

138
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,620
If they could all be fitted
with this new prosthesis,

139
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,420
our surgical pressure

140
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,220
would be much reduced,

141
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,620
and the patients' lives

142
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,220
would be much better after surgery.

143
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,610
How much is this gonna cost?

144
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,490
So...

145
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,730

how many I need.

of 1,000 patients in this earthquake.

Are you sure?

167
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,930
I'll give it a try.

168
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,730
If it doesn't work...

169
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,570
Don't worry.

170
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,960
If it doesn't work,

171
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,610
we'll find another way.

172
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,130
Wait for me.

173
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,130
I'll be right back.

174
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,810
We need to optimize the system.

175
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,760
Upload the casualty's transfer

176
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,930

That's right.

188
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,280

off the hospital.

00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,060
Dad.

191
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,010
You've lost weight.

192
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,380
How's it going?

193
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,810
Have you met your colleagues
at Haicheng Hospital?

194
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:37,930
Yes.

195
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,570
Dad.

196
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,780
I have a favor

197
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,140
to ask you.

198
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:48,690
Tell me.

199
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,900
I want a bionic limb.

200
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:54,900
What do you need it for?

201
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,260
The patient Zheng Ren and
I just operated on

202
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,660
not only brought us a lot

203
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,430
of consumables to help us

204
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,860
during the earthquake

205
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,190
but is also a basketball lover,

206
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,470
but without the bionic limb,

207
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,470
even if Zheng Ren operates on him,

208
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,140
he will never be able to play again.

209
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,260
Dad, I told you.

210
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,500
Dr. Chen saved me.

211
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:22,140
I must live the rest of my life
to the fullest.

212
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,900
That's why you became
an instrument nurse.

213
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,430
Yes.

214
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,500
I like surgery,

215
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,860
not management.

216
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,900
But that was before.

217
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,500
Dad.

218
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,280
I've seen a lot of wounded

219
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,860
on this trip this time.

220
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,780
I realized that you're more useful
than I am

221
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,500
in the face of a catastrophe.

222
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,190
Over the years,

223
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,500
you've gradually shifted the focus

224
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,780
of Ning's Holding Group to healthcare,

225
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,900
investing in R&D of medical equipment,

226
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,950
and preparing a critical care fund.

227
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,430
At first,

228
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,260
I didn't quite understand

229
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,380
and was even reluctant

230
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,860
to agree to go home with you

231
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,660
once my equipment locker

232
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,020
was full.

233
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,740
But now, I realize

234
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,590
that one person's ability is limited,

235
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,740
especially when I saw

236
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,980
Su Yun and Zheng Ren

237
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,900
work tirelessly for 36 hours

238
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,900
to perform 131 surgeries

239
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,550
but only managed to save 131 people.

240
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,500
However,

241
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,350
you pushed forward step by step
with the property

242
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,980
and resources of Ning's Holding Group.

243
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,230
Transporting patients.

244
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,430
Treating the wounded.

245
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,900
Searching for missing people.

246
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:45,740
Rebuilding homes.

247
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,310
I realize

248
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,260
that when disaster strikes,

249
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,590
we need people inside the operating room

250
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,140
and someone

251
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,500
outside it.

252
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,350
For example,

253
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,070
to donate prosthetic limbs
to the injured

254
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,710
in this earthquake

255
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,070
to get them through the pain

256
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,430
and keep them alive

257
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,590
and well.

258
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,110
Dad.

259
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,660
I've decided

260
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,710
to go back and fight with you.

261
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,140
To make more people

262
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,430
and myself live well.

263
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,710
Dad.

264
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,070
Dad.

265
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,550
Dad.

266
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,310
I'm back.

267
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,310
I made a deal with my boss.

268
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,900
Your boss?

269
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,980
Uncle Ning, it's 300 million.

270
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,830
Are you sure?

271
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,110
I can consider it.

272
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,140
Why just consider it?

273
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:41,860
Dr. Zheng.

274
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,660
I'd like to ask you a question.

275
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:46,740
Go ahead.

276
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,350
You're a doctor who came here to help

277
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,780
and just needed to finish the surgery.

278
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,140
It's up to the injured to choose

279
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,190
how to get a prosthesis

280
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,740
and whether to get a domestic
or imported prosthesis.

281
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,620
You don't have to be involved, do you?

282
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,950
I hadn't thought about that.

283
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,470
All I know is that bionic prosthetics

284
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,040
can give patients a better quality

285
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,140
of life after surgery.

286
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,020
That's the patient's problem,

287
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,660
not the doctor's.

288
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,470
The patient's problem

289
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,550
is the doctor's.

290
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,190
To reduce pain,

291
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,350
anesthetics were invented.

292
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,110
To recover faster,

293
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,310
minimally invasive surgery was started.

294
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:24,980
Medicine

295
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,590
has always been about

296
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,350
how to make the quality of life better,

297
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,470
not just keeping someone alive.

298
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,550
Good point,

299
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,830
but what if I don't invest?

300
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,470
What are you going to do?

301
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,260
Don't worry, Uncle Ning.

302
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,140
If you don't invest,

303
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,550
we'll think of something else.

304
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,140
We can't get a thousand,

305
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,620
but we can get a hundred.

306
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,830
If not, we'll collect donations.

307
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,660
With your temperament,

308
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,470
it's impossible to get investment.

309
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:19,780
I'm a businessman.

310
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,550
Businessmen only invest
in promising projects.

311
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,140
I hope

312
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,310
you won't let me down.

313
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:47,620
300 million.

314
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,380
He agreed?

315
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,470
300 million.

316
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,710
I think he'll be okay this time.

317
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,830
The operation was a success.

318
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,660
We're just waiting for the new limbs.

319
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,830
Zheng Ren, don't worry too much.

320
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,950
Feng Xuhui will still be able
to run and jump.

321
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,350
We've accomplished everything
we set out to do.

322
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,550
Now we have the real experience.

323
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,830
The constant optimization of technology

324
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,230
has made countless impossible things

325
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,780
possible.

326
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,070
Come on, let's go.

327
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,430
We should go back
to the Interventional Department.

328
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,140
Dr. Zheng, Mr. Ning is looking for you.

329
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,020
Please come in.

330
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:53,980
Uncle Ning.

331
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,310
Have a seat.

332
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,660
You left in such a hurry last time

333
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,350
that we haven't had a chance

334
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,380
to say thank you.

335
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,380
I've always wanted

336
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,470
to talk to you alone.

337
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,980
Do you have any other needs

338
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,190
besides prosthetics?

339
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,310
Yes.

340
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,900
Surgery live stream.

341
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,110
But the time is not right.

342
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:28,780
I guess not.

343
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,190
For example, in this earthquake,

344
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:32,900
the three of you

345
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,380
did almost 150 surgeries,

346
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,500
but what if it wasn't the three of you

347
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:40,800
but 30

348
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,860
or even 300 doctors?

349
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,950
Just like Liu.

350
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,040
If he had mastered

351
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,110
your intervention techniques earlier,

352
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,550
how many more people

353
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,380
could have been saved?

354
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,070
Before this, I always felt

355
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,520
that surgery live stream
needed to be gimmicky

356
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,260
to get greater feedback,

357
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,350
more popularity, and a brighter future,

358
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,900
but on this trip to Dongyuan Township,

359
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,270
I saw a lot of doctors who, like you,

360
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,940
have a heart of gold

361
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,750
but have to be confined to the same spot

362
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,140
due to their own lack of skills

363
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,620
and patient resources.

364
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:19,940
Yes.

365
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,510
This earthquake has caused me

366
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,700
to debunk some of my ideas.

367
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,700
I think that the live stream of surgery

368
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,110
should not only cover the most difficult

369
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,380
and special surgeries

370
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,110
but also more basic surgeries

371
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,350
that are suitable
for popularization and promotion.

372
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,510
Creating more social value

373
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,510
through live streaming

374
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,620
is my goal.

375
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,310
I'm going back

376
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,860
to Haicheng tonight.

377
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,420
Wait for my good news.

378
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,270
