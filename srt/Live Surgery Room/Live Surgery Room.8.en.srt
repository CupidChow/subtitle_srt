["Live Surgery Room"

4
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,870
When I was at South University,

5
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,960
Zheng Ren studied intervention
in the class I taught.

6
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,280
I heard that his parents had died

7
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,390
and he had taken out a loan
to go to school.

8
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,920
He had been working to pay off his loans

9
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,830
and had been having a hard time.

10
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,040
I just thought that this kid

11
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,040
was unfortunate

12
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,800
but diligent and hardworking

13
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,950
and would become a good doctor

14
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:25,670
in the future.

15
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,670
But I never thought that

16
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,040
he would be Chen Miao's son.

17
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,950
Thinking about what he has suffered,

18
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,430
I feel...

19
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,520
You went to him

20
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,200
but didn't find him.

21
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,520
I failed to protect

22
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,800
my best friend

23
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,670
nor take care of his orphan.

24
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,520
Shame on me.

25
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:54,390
Bu.

26
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,320
Although he suffered so much,

27
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,230
he became

28
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,390
such a brilliant doctor.

29
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,390
He has a bright future ahead of him.

30
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,150
You don't have to blame yourself.

31
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:10,670
Li.

32
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,040
I'm going to do something

33
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,800
but only with your permission.

34
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,430
Are you going to return

35
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,230
Chen Miao's shares of Haicheng Hospital

36
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,080
to Zheng Ren?

37
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:34,920
OK.

38
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,360
I'll take care of it.

39
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,320
It's hard to accept the truth,

40
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,200
isn't it?

41
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,760
You always think
there was something else going on,

42
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,910
that someone should be responsible

43
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,030
for the tragedy,

44
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,200
and that this person
should reflect on it, regret it,

45
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,910
and say,

46
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,350
"Actually, it's all my fault."

47
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,440
That's the only way

48
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,080
you'll be able to give vent

49
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,590
to your anger and hatred

50
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,540
and get yourself back

51
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,710
on your feet,

52
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,390
isn't it?

53
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,320
I understand how you feel

54
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,560
because that's

55
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,830
how I felt when Bu

56
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,560
wanted to divorce me.

57
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,390
I had someone stalking him

58
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,350
to find evidence of his cheating

59
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:17,640
and even

60
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,510
meanly hoped

61
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,790
that there was such a mistress.

62
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,270
Because I couldn't accept

63
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,440
that an 18-year marriage

64
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:25,950
would end up a failure,

65
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,390
just like you couldn't accept

66
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,520
that your father

67
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,950
would die with a bad name

68
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,790
thrown at him.

69
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,640
My father did nothing wrong.

70
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,640
Between the spine and the leg,

71
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,760
the former comes first.

72
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,350
I did nothing wrong either,

73
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,880
but Bu doesn't love me anymore.

74
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,150
Bu and the others

75
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,150
really didn't know back then

76
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,440
that at that night

77
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,910
your mother also...

78
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,640
If my father had stayed home that night,

79
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,830
my mother wouldn't have died,

80
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,150
and he wouldn't have jumped.

81
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,030
Maybe that's fate.

82
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,910
A doctor

83
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,830
who studied for eight years

84
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,760
and worked clinically for fifteen years

85
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,350
received a call after work,

86
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,350
rushed to the hospital at once,

87
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,120
and participated in the emergency.

88
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,790
He used his medical skills

89
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,200
to save a little girl
with a spinal injury

90
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,410
and to save the life of a patient

91
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,640
with a serious calf injury.

92
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,390
While he was operating

93
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,390
on them,

94
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,760
his wife

95
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,880
had an accident at home

96
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,640
and died of blood loss.

97
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,830
Even then, people still say

98
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,710
that he lacked medical ethics.

99
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,880
And you were telling me

100
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,470
it was fate?

101
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,080
Or what?

102
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,320
It's a misunderstanding,

103
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,520
so we have to clear it up.

104
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,710
How?

105
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,790
At that time, there was no surveillance

106
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,640
but only written operation records.

107
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,910
We showed it to the patient's family,

108
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,000
but they didn't believe in it.

109
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,760
They only believed in

110
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,560
what they saw...

111
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,560
What he saw was

112
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,470
that his mother had arrived earlier

113
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,560
but the doctor had to save the one
who came after her.

114
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,120
It's a simple thing

115
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:35,760
for a doctor,

116
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,120
but for a patient,

117
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,390
it's unreasonable.

118
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,440
Some people can't see the stars

119
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,910
but only

120
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,270
the dust close at hand,

121
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,150
but that dust

122
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,030
is enough to suffocate them.

123
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,320
Zheng Ren,

124
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,000
that was a misunderstanding

125
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,080
that happened sixteen years ago

126
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,120
and can no longer be cleared up.

127
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,760
Even if Mr. Pan and Bu show up together

128
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,950
and address the incident

129
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,120
to clear your father's name,

130
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,200
what's the use?

131
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,710
The dead are gone.

132
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,890
We,

133
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:26,760
as those who have survived,

134
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,030
have to move on.

135
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,880
Mr. Pan was very ill

136
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,150
because of what happened to your father.

137
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,640
Then his health collapsed.

138
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,120
He could only take a back seat.

More than three dozen families

141

and 42 patients

142
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,960
have suffered

143

00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,310
Is there really any point

in clarifying its truth

154
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,240
and demanding a so-called justice?

155
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,520
Wouldn't it make more sense

156
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,190
for those who survived

157
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,600
to look forward
and prevent such a tragedy

158
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,240

Lin Ge may be able to stop
for a few days.

163
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,750
Why should he stop?

164

Lin Ge's grudge hasn't gone away yet.

165
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,750
Zheng Ren is now acting like that.

They're the two mainstays

He won't.

An operation

169
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,920
will definitely cheer Zheng Ren up.

Anyway,

171
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,020
you have to be on top of things

at the hospital recently.

173
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,390
Both of them need time

to adjust their minds.

175
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:42,990

belongs to you.

Your name will be Laifu.

Life.

387
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,960
There's something

388
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,400
I think I should tell you.

389
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,590
Zheng Ren has resigned.

390
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,230
Why?

391
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,550
Zheng Ren is Chen Miao's son.

392
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,060
[Pickup area]

393
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,790
It wasn't my lucky day.

394
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,790
Miss.

395
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,070
Is Dr. Zheng Ren unable

396
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,230
to make an appointment?

397
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,030
I'm from the county

398
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,230
People there said

399
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,270
Dr. Zheng Ren can perform

400
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,750
the late liver intervention embolization.

401
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:33,990
I went there,

402
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,680
but they said he was not available.

403
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,360
Why is that?

404
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,790
Why is that?

405
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,640
Miss?

406
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,220
Miss?

407
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,780
Miss?

408
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,640
You're saying you have liver cancer?

409
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,310
[Operation failed]

410
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,200
The thirteenth operation failed.

411
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,990
Hey, Yiren, what's up?

412
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,070
Who?

413
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,480
He said he had liver cancer

414
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,480
and would like Zheng Ren
to perform an interventional operation.

415
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:44,750
Yes.

416
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:45,750
So I came to talk

417
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,680
to you right away.

418
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,070
Or I'll tell him

419
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,510
that Dr. Zheng has resigned

420
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,880
and ask him to go to another hospital.

421
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,480
It's not liver cancer.

422
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,030
Then what is this?

423
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,680
This is hydatid disease of liver.

424
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,070
That means

425
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,640
it doesn't need Dr. Zheng

426
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,310
to perform the operation.

427
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,070
This disease requires a new liver.

428
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:06,920
Normally, a patient

429
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:07,990
needs a scan

430
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:08,880
and stays for observation,

431
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,200
but since it's that guy,

432
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,440
ask him to leave.

433
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,440
Wait a minute.

434
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,310
Let me think it over.

435
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,750
Take him to have a scan.

436
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,960
I'll go to Zheng Ren.

437
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,230
You will tell Dr. Zheng?

438
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,440
But...

439
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,720
He needs to know about it

440
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,480
and make a choice.

441
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,750
Well, you're back.

442
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,270
I've been waiting forever.

443
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,030
Don't worry.

444
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,310
I'm not telling you to go back.

445
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,750
I came to you for advice.

446
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,700
[Image kit]

447
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,440
For advice.

448
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,920
Saving lives

449
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:15,920
always comes first.

450
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,320
Come with me.

451
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,440
This is extreme minimalism.

452
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,270
What advice?

453
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,640
This patient claims

454
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,630
to have advanced liver cancer,

455
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,400
but in my judgment, it's not like that.

456
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,080
I got him to have a scan.

457
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:52,990
Take a look.

458
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,680
What's your conclusion?

459
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:03,950
Hydatid disease of liver.

460
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:05,880
The banded shadow

461
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,470
and the gauze shadow below it

462
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,710
are the banded and gauze signs

463
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,950
that can help us to diagnose

464
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,190
a ruptured liver cyst acute abdomen.

465
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,270
It is indeed hydatid disease of liver.

466
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,710
It's spreading really badly.

467
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,320
Tell the patient to have the surgery.

468
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,510
If I ask you to do this surgery,

469
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:28,710
will you be interested?

470
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,710
I've resigned,

471
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,840
and the erosion

472
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,680
is too extensive for him

473
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:35,950
to be treated

474
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,400
with interventional surgery alone.

475
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:44,710
I asked you

476
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,550
if you wanted to perform the surgery.

477
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,400
No.

478
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,190
If I tell you

479
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,550
the patient's name is Huang Aguo,

480
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,710
whose nickname is Huangya,

481
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,510
and his mother is Li Aifang,

482
00:31:59,120 --> 00:31:59,920
will you do it?

483
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,470
My teacher

484
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,510
once told me

485
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:24,600
that making a choice

486
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,270
is the most painful thing

487
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,160
in the world,

488
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,680
but it is when we are faced

489
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,470
with a choice

490
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:33,710
that we truly discover

491
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,080
who we really are.

492
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,030
I put them right here.

493
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,840
Make a choice.

494
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,400
I admitted Huangya to the hospital

495
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,230
for three reasons.

496
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,080
First,

497
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:24,950
he's very sick,

498
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,080
and his cyst could burst at any time.

499
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:27,190
Second,

500
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,360
he's a professional
medical troublemaker

501
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,320
but a regular patient,

502
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,920
so the hospital can't turn him away.

503
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:31,990
Third,

504
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,160
times have changed.

505
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:34,270
Sixteen years ago,

506
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,080
he could have wronged us,

507
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:35,840
but now,

508
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,600
we have surveillance footage

509
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,160
and a great medical system.

510
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,270
Hua.

511
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,640
If we can

512
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,440
cure him this time

513
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,440
and gain his trust,

514
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:44,840
we might hear him

515
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,650
apologize

516
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,550
for what happened.

517
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,360
I don't believe human nature can change.

518
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,790
He's greedy

519
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,440
and unreasonable.

520
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:56,840
He's not gonna apologize.

521
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,120
Even if he does not apologize,

522
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,950
Zheng Ren needs this opportunity.

523
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,750
Aren't you trying to get Zheng Ren
back on his feet

524
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,120
and back to Haicheng Hospital?

525
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,720
Then we have to take some risks

526
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,300
to give him that chance.

527
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,310
Do you think

528
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,070
Zheng Ren will come back

529
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,070
to treat Huangya?

530
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,280
That's his enemy.

531
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,110
What is more exciting

532
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,070
than to favor an enemy?

533
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:24,880
It's all based on

534
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,590
a successful surgery.

535
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,320
What if the surgery fails?

536
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,510
Zheng Ren will not fail

537
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,110
Can you guarantee that the operation

538
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:31,880
will be 100% successful?

539
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,440
If the operation fails,

540
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,880
it will be discovered

541
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,920
that Zheng Ren's father

542
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,240
was dead because of Huangya,

543
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,720
and Zheng Ren will be suspected

544
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,400
of deliberate action.

545
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,360
At that time,

546
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,030
Zheng Ren will not be able
to pull himself together

547
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,760
and will fall into the same abyss

548
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:45,720
as his father.

549
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,030
We have video surveillance

550
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,630
and surgery footage.

551
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:53,920
Hua, I don't believe...

552
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:54,950
I don't believe

553
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:55,920
there's still no understanding
this time.

554
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,440
Did Haicheng Hospital

555
00:34:59,110 --> 00:34:59,590
not do enough

556
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,470
for the incident?

557
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,320
We have clearly done our best,

558
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,320
but why are we

559
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,770
being criticized and reviled?

560
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,360
A doctor didn't even go back

561
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,240
when his wife had an accident

562
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,630
and stayed here to operate

563
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,590
but he ended up

564
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,470
with a malfeasance charge.

565
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,320
Mr. Pan never went back
into the operating room.

566
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,800
Bu Ruotian lost all his strength.

567
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,150
And you.

568
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,200
Are you really reconciled

569
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,510
to all this?

570
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,070
What else can I do?

571
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,030
One more time.

572
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,470
Just once.

573
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,950
This time, let me lead the conversation

574
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,880
and tell everyone what's right.

575
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,550
It's no use telling me that.

576
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,550
