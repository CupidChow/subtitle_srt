would last ten years.

that after misplacing the ventilator,

412
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,940

00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:35,650
Where's my daughter?

571
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,460
- Get out of the way!
- Mr. Ren!

572
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,480
Mr. Ren!

573
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,690
Mr. Ren!

574
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,590
- What are you doing?
- There's a patient in there.

575
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,890
Let's talk
in the Medical Affair Department.

576
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,070
No, why are we going there?

577
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,220
I want to show everyone

578
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,060
how you solve problems.

579
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:46,810
My daughter

580
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,260
was a famous live streamer,

581
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,940
but she can't live stream anymore.

582
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,130
Who's going to pay for the damage?

583
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:51,740
Dad.

584
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,130
They're good doctors.

585
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,270
Don't be so unreasonable.

586
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,090
What do you know?

587
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,060
Stupid.

588
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:56,890
Who are you talking for?

589
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,130
If you speak for anyone else,

590
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,060
I'll kill you!

591
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,300
Which side are you on?

592
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,890
Why don't you die?

593
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,780
I don't have money
to pay for your medical bills.

594
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:07,550
And your sister

595
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,740
in bed.

596
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,570
She's a money-loser.

597
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,810
Die with her.

598
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,710
Then I'll be relieved

599
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,400
and get a lot of money.

600
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,700
Can't you have any humanity?

601
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,330
Are you insulting me?

602
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,060
Mr. Ren.

603
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,880
This is a hospital.

604
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,220
Please keep quiet.

605
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,850
You can talk to me about anything.

606
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,330
Hospital?

607
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,410
So what?

608
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,650
You want to fight?

609
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,940
You want to hurt me?

610
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,460
You'll pay for it.

611
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,780
- Sir.
- What are you doing?

612
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,740
I'm going to sue you.

613
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,460
You'll pay for it.

614
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,700
Wait and see.

615
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,850
What kind of person is this?

616
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,650
Did you see that?

617
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,230
Even the most skillful doctor

618
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,810
can't avoid this kind of situation.

619
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,460
Avoidable at General Hospital?

620
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:58,850
What's

621
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,500
the worst-case scenario?

622
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,780
One

623
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,780
is that the patient dies.

624
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:06,170
We negotiate a settlement
with the patient's family

625
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,810
and pay for it.

626
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,410
The other

627
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,600
is that negotiations fail.

628
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,540
They go to court

629
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,740
and drag on for years

630
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,850
to penalize the hospital.

631
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,890
Either way,

632
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,780
Zheng Ren will be implicated.

633
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,890
Both financially
and in terms of reputation,

634
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,410
losses are inevitable.

635
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:29,980
Mr. Lin.

636
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,260
Here.

637
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,170
Which side are you on?

638
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,370
Why don't you die?

639
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,130
Die with her.

640
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,260
Then I'll be relieved

641
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,850
and get a lot of money.

642
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,170
Good. You've gotten smarter.

643
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,890
The company you keep.

644
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,260
The second video.

645
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,170
Medical Affair Department will need it.

646
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,410
Look at my angle.

647
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,780
I don't have money
to pay for your medical bills.

648
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,510
And your sister

649
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,740
in bed.

650
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,850
She's a money-loser.

651
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,440
Die with her.

652
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,170
Then

653
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,220
I'll be relieved.

654
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:04,650
Dad.

655
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,980
I know it's hard to be a doctor,

656
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,020
especially at Haicheng Hospital,

657
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,020
but that's why

658
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,020
we desperately need good doctors

659
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,650
who are smart,

660
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:15,900
determined,

661
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,250
and selfless.

662
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:19,820
I want to be that kind of doctor.

663
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:36,290
Ling.

664
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:38,900
Xiu.

665
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:40,860
Xiu.

666
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,770
Don't cry.

667
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,690
He's a scum.

668
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,690
Don't cry.

669
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:50,730
Doctor.

670
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:56,020
Are you sure about my sister's surgery?

671
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,020
It's hard,

672
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,770
but it's worth a try.

673
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,170
OK.

674
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,900
Then do it. I'll sign.

675
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,500
Xiu, don't be afraid.

676
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,920
They could even

677
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,170
save me,

678
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,690
so you'll be fine.

679
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,380
Be strong.

680
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,170
Dr. Zheng.

681
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,340
I'd like to talk to them alone.

682
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,210
OK.

683
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,020
Hi.

684
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,900
You are...?

685
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,340
I'm the anesthesiologist
who operated on you.

686
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,210
During the surgery,

687
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,290
I made a few

688
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,460
intubation errors...

689
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,540
I heard about that.

690
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,250
I'm sorry.

691
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,020
You saved my life

692
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,650
because you wanted me to live

693
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,820
while some others

694
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,900
wanted me to die.

695
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,860
I didn't want to live,

696
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,540
but I had to keep my sister alive

697
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,400
and help her get through the surgery

698
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,730
so she could grow up

699
00:36:58,730 --> 00:36:59,460
like any other kid.

700
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,500
And I can't leave her alone

701
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,980

702
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,340

703
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,020
Thank you.

704
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:28,380
Thank you doctors for saving me.

705
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,540
I should be thanking you.

706
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,290
Really.

707
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,500
Thank you.

708
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:36,770
Thank you.

He's essential.

712
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:12,900
I was afraid the hospital

713
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,940
would suspend him for a year.

714
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,170
After this,

00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,280
it'll be hard for him

her father will continue
to blackmail us for money

731
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,020

Medicine is not a gamble.

00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,770
In my opinion, it is.

743
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,090

00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,820
My sister...

761
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:45,240
[Don't give up.
Rest well and take care of your health]

762
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,130
My sister is ready for surgery.

763
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,820
Don't worry about me.

764
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,820
The most painful thing in this world

765
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,730
is not being disabled,

766
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,510
[Work hard and don't give up]

767
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,820
sick,

768
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,550
[What's going on? Don't give up.]

769
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:03,020
or poor,

770
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,360
[Are you feeling better?]

771
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,500
but having no hope of living.

772
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,060
But now,

773
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,900
[Consent for Surgery]
I have it.

774
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,860
My sister

775
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,610
is my hope to live.

776
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,860
I'll live a good life from now on

777
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,420
and walk bravely

778
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,570
with my sister towards that hope.

779
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,130
Hua.

780
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,190
So you thought

781
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,570
of giving them the surgery for free?

782
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,770
For the same amount of money,

783
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,340
giving it to her father

784
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,090
will be tantamount to admitting
that we failed the surgery

785
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,020
and are incompetent,

786
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:07,860
but if we give it to the sisters,

787
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,090
we will be able
to save the hospital's reputation

788
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,730
and prove the doctor's competence,

789
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,060
so why should I choose the former?

790
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,130
Patient first.
