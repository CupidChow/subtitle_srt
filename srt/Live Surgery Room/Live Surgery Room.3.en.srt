They're so light

As they grow older

448

It'll be harder to separate them then.

449
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,920
Hence, their surgery

450

If we plan to do this,

453
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,230
it will need multiple departments

00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,200

had a separation surgery before.

572
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,830
Chang Feng's consumables

573
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,390
the next time you undertake

574
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,520
a late liver intervention embolization.

575
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,080
I'll leave you to it.

576
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,240
Yun.

577
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,920
I was just chatting with Dr. Zheng.

578
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,000
I was admiring how smooth...

579
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,200
Ouch...

580
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,160
Oh, you know of pain.

581
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:49,600
I do.

582
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:50,830
If I find out

583
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,160
you're promoting
medical equipment suppliers again.

584
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,390
I'll make sure you never get
to be an anesthetist again.

585
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:53,870
Don't believe me?

586
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:54,750
I do...

587
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,680
Let go.

588
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:56,340
Wait.

589
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,280
I'm sorry, okay?

590
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:57,940
Yun.

591
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:02,000
There's no need for that, Yun.

592
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:04,830
He isn't a bad anesthetist.

593
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,120
But his heart's in the wrong place.

594
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:11,950
Don't even think about it.

595
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,520
Got it?

596
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:14,950
Why are you here?

597
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,310
Conjoined twins separation surgery.

598
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,430
Interested?

599
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:46,910
Well?

600
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:50,680
Why show me this?

601
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,240
There's more.

602
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,560
Here.

603
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:54,600
Look at this.

604
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,160
They're in our hospital?

605
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:07,950
I'll give three more points.

606
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:09,200
One,

607
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,120
Hua wants Haicheng Hospital

608
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:11,790
to do this surgery.

609
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,470
Two,

610
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:13,910
it's a very difficult surgery.

611
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,200
Other than pediatric cardiac surgery
and general surgery,

612
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,350
the other treatments are

613
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,720
for their circulation,

614
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:18,870
organs, blood vessels, and more.

615
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,270
Three,

616
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,200
the surgery fees are shockingly high.

617
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,720
Are you willing

618
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,600
to help out again

619
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,200
for no pay?

620
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,210
I am.

621
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,790
I can separate their livers.

622
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,430
You'll have to help me.

623
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,640
How?

624
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,000
Help me persuade Hua.

625
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,270
Didn't you say she wants us

626
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,160
to master this surgery?

627
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,750
That's why I need your help.

628
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,200
Miss Su,

629
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,680
I want to operate on the conjoined twins
separation surgery.

630
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:49,270
Hua,

631
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:50,830
didn't you want

632
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:51,950
Haicheng Hospital to master this

633
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:52,910
and build up our reputation?

634
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,200
Hurry and find the volunteers

635
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,040
for our team.

636
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,720
I've already given up.

637
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:01,750
- Why?
- Why?

638
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,560
The upfront costs are too high

639
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,790
while the profit is low.

640
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,000
I've asked Pan.

641
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,390
The virtual surgery theater guidance

642
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,200
for a surgery of this difficulty

643
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,270
is at least in the seven figures.

644
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,350
We might only use it once,

645
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,870
and it'll require a lot of time wasted

646
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,000
on the simulation.

647
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:18,680
One team would require

648
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,720
around 20 doctors at least.

649
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,000
If we have the time,

650
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:21,750
isn't it better

651
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,470
to focus on late liver
intervention embolization?

652
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,040
I've already received

653
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,240
applications

654
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,270
from dozens
of late-stage liver cancer patients

655
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,040
from all over the country.

656
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:30,470
Zheng Ren,

657
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,790
how many surgeries
do you think you can do in a day?

658
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,120
Shall I reserve

659
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,350
an operating theater just for you?

660
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:36,910
Miss Su,

661
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:37,720
have you ever wondered

662
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,600
why so many late-stage
liver cancer patients

663
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:39,910
would come to our hospital?

664
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:40,910
It is

665
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,350
because we are good
at late liver intervention embolization.

666
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,520
Everyone is here
because they heard of us.

667
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:44,350
Then, how much profit and glory

668
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,720
would we bring

669
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,870
to the hospital

670
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:47,640
if we succeed

671
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:48,910
at a conjoined twins separation surgery

672
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,000
that not many all over the world

673
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,200
have done before?

674
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,640
I hope you'll say yes.

675
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:03,520
Come...

676
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,640
Let's sit down first.

677
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,160
Sit...

678
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,950
Hua, look at this.

679
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,660
[16-year-old girl dies
when saving drowning child]

680
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,310
[Parents tried to commit suicide]

681
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,260
This couple

682
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,750
used to have a daughter called Yin.

683
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,120
Last year,

684
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,330
she unfortunately passed away

685
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,750
when saving a drowning boy.

686
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,480
As they were despairing,

687
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:28,680
Mrs. Chen found herself

688
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,310
accidentally pregnant.

689
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,750
They thought

690
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,120
the babies were Yin's reincarnation.

691
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,680
That's why,

692
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,270
even though she knew

693
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,120
it was a high-risk birth,

694
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,230
she persisted

695
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,390
in keeping the children.

696
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,230
I know this surgery

697
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,480
has high costs, high risks,

698
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:42,520
and low success rates.

699
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,160
However, Hua,

700
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,080
private hospitals are still hospitals.

701
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:47,910
The greatest difference

702
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:48,830
between hospitals and companies

703
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,870
is that lives aren't products.

704
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,120
I want to work

705
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:05,780
