he still has wages to deduct?

such as edema and anuria.

162
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:19,960
Moreover,

163
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,120
Syncope isn't the main mode

164
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:21,880
of kidney failure either.

165
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,150

166
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,080
Maybe I should read it.

167
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,350
Diagnosed as an ionic disorder.

168

2.2 milli (millimoles per liter)

170
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,080
Should we treat him

171
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,680
with potassium ion supplementation?

172
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,230
- No need.
- No need.

173
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,350
Low potassium has nothing

174
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,000
to do with syncope.

175
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,590
Do you usually have violent vomiting

176
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,520
or diarrhea?

177
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,520
I've had occasional diarrhea
for over a year.

178
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,880
But no vomiting.

179
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,120
Are you eating properly?

180
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,910
Kind of normal, I suppose.

181
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,680
There's still a lot of tests to be done.

182
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:49,910

183
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,680
Why? Just do it here.

184
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,560
Can I not stay in the hospital?

185
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,470
Not possible.

186
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,960
The cause is still unknown.

187
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,150
But ionic disorders

188
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,350
are serious enough to kill.

189
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,120
Tianshui,

190
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,390
then I think you should listen

191

Male patient, 38 years old,

385

I've read the medical records.

396

M-W syndrome is dominated

397
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,960
by diarrhea plus renal failure

00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,510
wasn't severe.

401
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,310
So is it possible

402
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,240
that the judgment of the condition

403
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,680
is not rigorous enough?

Although the diarrhea is mild,

407
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,030
it is considered to be related

408
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,230
to the patient's personal constitution

00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,600
that the clinical symptoms
of M-W syndrome

There's a hospital

468
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,270

469
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,550

are publishing papers every year

00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,920
Bear with it.

570
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:22,840
A little more.

571
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,440
It hurts!

572
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,360
Be gentle.

573
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,070
Kid.

574
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,470
Ever seen a light bulb?

575
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,510
I got stuck with it.

576
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,310
The old light bulb

577
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,750
was the size of a fist.

578
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:47,550
Seen that before?

579
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,600
I put it in my mouth

580
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,790
and it wouldn't come out.

581
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,640
I thought to myself, what I could do?

582
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,790
Find a doctor.

583
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,710
Yeah, you're smart.

584
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,630
And I

585
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,400
went and got a hammer

586
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,960
and tried to break it.

587
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,550
But then I thought,

588
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,310
if I broke it

589
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,920
and got it in my mouth,

590
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,200
I'd have hurt my face.

591
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,960
If my classmates asked about it...

592
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:20,710
Look,

593
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,160
the scars on our faces

594
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,920
are from fights.

595
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,360
We're courageous and brave.

596
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:26,880
Look at you.

597
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,750
And you swallowed a light bulb!

598
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,920
Then I thought,

599
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,990
why didn't I just

600
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,510
swallow the bulb?

601
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:38,880
Alright, done.

602
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,070
Feel it.

603
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:41,640
Does it still hurt?

604
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,070
So, did you swallow it?

605
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,750
No.

606
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,270
I found a doctor too.

607
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,030
Give me an anesthetic and I was fine.

608
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,030
Dai Qiangqiang!

609
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:53,790
Grandma!

610
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,160
Grandma!

611
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:55,990
You've grown up.

612
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,030
How did you get a bottle

613
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,120
in your mouth?

614
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,070
Someone else

615
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,120
left this drink on a chair.

616
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,550
I've never had one.

617
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,160
I just wanted to try it.

618
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:05,920
Then...

619
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,600
Thanks, Doctor!

620
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,440
You're welcome.

621
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,160

622
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,070
Relief of swollen tongue
with prohormones.

623
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:11,790
Alright.

624
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,680
Does he need to stay?

625
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,270
No need.

626
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:13,990
Remember.

627
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,070
If the swelling doesn't go down

628
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,400
tomorrow morning,

629
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,030
come to the hospital right away.

630
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,400
Okay.

631
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,200
Thank you, Doctor.

632
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,470
Come on, thank the doctor.

633
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,190
Thank you, Doctor.

634
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:22,750
Thank you.

635
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,070
What's this drink?

636
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,470
Is it that good?

637
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,160
No.

638
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,960
Grandma.

639
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,750
I won't drink it anymore.

640
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,600
Really that bad?

641
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,910
I'll buy a bottle tomorrow

642
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,990
and see how bad it tastes.

643
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,990
Let's go and get the medicine.

644
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,120
Alright. Thanks.

645
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,840
Good work.

646
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:52,990
What's wrong? What's on your mind?

647
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,970
You're seldom forbearing

648
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,310
with a patient.

649
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:57,880
I thought this kid

650
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,860
was smart.

651
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,710
And he knew to come to the hospital

652
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,400
for help.

653
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,840
Is it true that you swallowed
a light bulb?

654
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,230
What do you think?

655
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,710
It's real.

656
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:22,400
Hello.

657
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,230

Why didn't you answer the phone?]

[Younger brother]
Where are you, bro?

660
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,710
Why didn't you answer the phone?

661
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,230
I'm paying back more

662
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,270
this month than last.

663
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:41,920
Bro.

664
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,510
You can't just leave me alone.

665
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:44,880
If we wait, the loan collectors

666
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,030
will come to the school again.

667
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,120
Sir, are you going to pay the bill?

668
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,310
There's a queue behind you.

669
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,750
Sir.

670
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,680
I'm not paying it yet.

671
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,400
Sorry about that.

672
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,270
Brother.

673
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,600
You finally picked up the phone.

674
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,200
I thought you'd leave me alone.

675
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,070
I was in such a panic.

676
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,440
No, I've been too busy
these past two days.

677
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,360
Um...

678
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,310
About that, brother.

679
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,160
When will you send me the money?

680
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,440

Can you hold off on this issue?

684
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:28,840
For how long?

685
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,750
Just a month.

686

Brother.

687
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,070
I've been overdue

for almost half a month.

689
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,920
I really can't put it off any longer.

690
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,200
If this keeps up,

691
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,750
it's going to hurt my credit.

Why aren't you talking?

695
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,750
Do you still want to abandon me, right?

696
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,360
Everyone in the family hates me.

697
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,710
You don't like me too, am I right?

698

I'll transfer it to you in a minute.

Thank you, brother.

705

Where is Fan Tianshui?

709
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,880
I don't know.

710
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:40,750
He was just there.

711
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:42,990
He got away just like that?

712
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:43,880
How did you look after him?

713
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,160
Where are you going?

714
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,230
I'll check the address he registered

715
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:47,960
when he was hospitalized.

716
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,920
Then? He has no money.

717
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:49,790
You're paying for his surgery?

718
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,640
People from Chang Feng said

719
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,470
if we use their consumables,

720
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,310
they will provide the surgical fee.

721
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,270
Do you think your father

722
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:53,840
would approve of this?

723
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,920
As long as the president agrees.

724
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:55,840
Hua will not agree to it.

725
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,400
Then take it out of my paycheck.

trying to find out
what was wrong with you,

732
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,640
and you just left like that?

733
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,920
That's not very nice, is it?

734
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,790
I'm sorry.

If the operation is successful,

740
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,070
you'll pay the hospital back

741
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,230
in installments like Yu Yunxia.

Why are you not in the observation room?

748
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,400
What's there to observe?

749
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,750
I'm not a gastroenterologist.

750
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,790
Besides, I couldn't do it

751
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,880

757
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,400
It's useless.

the treatment method is different,

00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,320
but I was one myself.

950
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,470
My dad was just like you.

951
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,720
For three years, we didn't

952
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,760
speak to each other because of this.

953
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,880
If you don't want to make
the same mistake my dad did,

954
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,280
just give her more respect

955
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,400
and understanding.

956
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,070
What happened then?

957
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,190
How did you and your father

958
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,760
talk again?

959
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:28,960
He had an acute heart attack.

960
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,400
And when he was taken to the hospital,

961
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,360
he was already delirious.

962
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,070
His eyes were cloudy,

963
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,240
and he was still looking around.

964
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:41,840
So I asked him,

965
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,990
"Dad, what are you looking at?"

966
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,280
He said,

967
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,550
"Don't cry."

968
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:00,670
That was

969
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:01,960
the last conversation we had.

970
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,110
Where's my necklace?

971
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,070
