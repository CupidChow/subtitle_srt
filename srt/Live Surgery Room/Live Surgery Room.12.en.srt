5
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,440
Xue.

6
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,670
What are you doing, Dong?

7
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:44,910
What are you doing?

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,800
Why are you messing around

9
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,670
like this at night?

10
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:47,310
Xue.

11
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,670
You're here now.

12
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:49,600
It's serious

13
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,920
that you swallowed the necklace.

14
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,160
I said I didn't.

15
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,720
Ancient people committed suicide
by swallowing gold.

16
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,640
That could kill you.

17
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,860
Isn't it normal for necklaces

18
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,720
to be thrown into nooks and crannies?

19
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,190
I'll go back.

20
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:58,720
You have been here.

21
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,270
Hi.

22
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,110
Hi.

23
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,550
Can I help you?

24
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,150
Hello, Doctor.

25
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,400
She swallowed the necklace.

26
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,190
No, Doctor.

27
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,880
It's just that I had a dream.

28
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,390
I swallowed my necklace in my dream.

29
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,320
When I woke up,

30
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,040
I couldn't find the necklace.

31
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,520
He insisted
that I swallowed the necklace.

32
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,550
She really did.

33
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,620
I didn't.

34
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,230
She did, Doctor.

35
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:15,900
I didn't.

36
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,550
She did.

37
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,320
I didn't.

38
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,430
- She did.
- How could I?

39
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:18,920
Guys.

40
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,240
Come with me.

41
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,640
Do you think it's okay
to follow this protocol

42
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,430
for the conjoined twins
separation surgery?

43
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,520
Let me finish reading.

44
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,080
Come in.

45
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,390
It's so late...

46
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,870
Come in.

47
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,240
Hello, Doctor.

48
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:38,920
Hello.

49
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,640
Yun, Zheng.

50
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,200
This man says

51
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,320
this woman accidentally
swallowed a necklace

52
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,430
during a dream.

53
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,590
Sit down.

54
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,670
Come on.

55
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,830
I'm not a fool.

56
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,360
How could I swallow a necklace?

57
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,760
We can ask doctors

58
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,870
about this.

59
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,830
How big is the necklace?

60
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,480
Like this.

61
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,830
Like this.

62
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,520
It's OK then.

63
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,590
It'll come out with the bowel movement
in a couple of days.

64
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,240
Go back.

65
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,650
What?

66
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,240
How can you say that?

67
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,900
You didn't
prescribe any medicine or scan.

68
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,320
What if it gets worse?

69
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,780
Don't be angry.

70
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:09,800
Dr. Su is always sympathetic

71
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,130
to his patients.

72
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,480
There are some tests that can be saved.

73
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,990
- He's just helping you save money.
- I don't want to save money.

74
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,390
I want her to see a doctor.

75
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,710
If you do it,

76
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,550
I'll file a complaint.

77
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,400
Complain about what?

78
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,650
The doctor said it's fine.

79
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,480
Let's go.

80
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,270
No. Since we're here...

81
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,590
Tell me the details.

82
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,320
I've told you everything.

83
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,430
I just had a dream.

84
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,390
A very scary dream.

85
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,710
I dreamt that something

86
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,430
was chasing me like crazy.

87
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,360
And I ran like crazy.

88
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,040
I ran,

89
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,850
and he chased me.

90
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,690
He beat me,

91
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,370
pushed me down,

92
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,040
tickled me,

93
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,200
yanked my necklace off,

94
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,040
and shoved it in my mouth.

95
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,010
That was our

96
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,200
love token.

97
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,090
Dong.

98
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,130
Xue.

99
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,810
- It is lost.
- It is lost.

100
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,480
What to do?

101
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,440
- What to do?
- It is lost.

102
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,690
But, Doctor.

103
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,810
I was dreaming. I didn't swallow it.

104
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,440
Have you ever had an experience

105
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,280
like this before?

106
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,370
No.

107
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,520
Think it over.

108
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,880
Have you ever swallowed

109
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,730
anything else before?

110
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,200
No.

111
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,610
Doctor.

112
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,960
Why do you ask that?

113
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,320
Sleep swallowing

114
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,130
usually occurs in children.

115
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,730
It's rare in adults.

116
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,130
Without identifying the cause,

117
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,730
we can't be sure of the condition.

118
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,130
Mr. Zheng.

119
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,730
Swallowing a necklace is a disease?

120
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,200
I doubt this is not the first time

121
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,080
she swallowed in her sleep.

122
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,370
She didn't.

123
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,640
Zhou.

124
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,880
Take her to get a scan.

125
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,370
Okay, this way.

126
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:15,930
Sir, you stay.

127
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,280
Sit down.

128
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,880
Xue, just go alone.

129
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,130
What are you hiding?

130
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,200
I'm not hiding anything.

131
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,730
Call the police.

132
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,810
No.

133
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,200
Why would you call the police?

134
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,170
I have reason to suspect

135
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,440
that you drugged the patient

136
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,080
and did something unusual

137
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,200
while the patient was unconscious.

138
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,200
Su Yun.

139
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:46,880
Call the police.

140
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,400
No.

141
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
Don't call the police.

142
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,570
Don't call the police.

143
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,490
Then tell me the truth.

144
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,640
This time, she ate the necklace.

145
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,880
Next time, she'll probably
eat something else.

146
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,170
If it's needles, glass, or chemicals,

147
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,640
can you afford to take the blame?

148
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:24,960
Doctor.

149
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,010
Don't call the police.

150
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,130
Xue doesn't know anything.

151
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,840
Actually,

152
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,250
she's a werewolf.

153
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,050
What?

154
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:39,880
Werewolf?

155
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,840
If everyone knew,

156
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,320
I'd lose her.

157
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,490
She's a werewolf?

158
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,810
Yeah, a werewolf.

159
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,930
It's NSRED.

160
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,320
Have you ever seen her get up

161
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,440
in the middle of the night to eat?

162
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,370
Taylor Swift

163
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,730
gets NSRED, too.

164
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:56,810
She often gets up

165
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,440
in the middle of the night.

166
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,280
She's a werewolf too?

167
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,910
Oh no.

168
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,320
How could there be a werewolf?

169
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,490
Of course there is.

170
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,130
Look at it.

171
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,790
It's on camera?

172
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,280
Look at it.

173
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,250
Actually,

174
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,130
this is the first night

175
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,010
I stayed with Xue.

176
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,490
I heard something at night

177
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,010
and thought a burglar was coming.

178
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,730
I rushed to the kitchen

179
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,320
and found the refrigerator door open.

180
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,960
She was crouching on the floor.

181
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,440
And guess what?

182
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,960
She was eating raw meat.

183
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,370
Raw meat.

184
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,840
I asked her indirectly

185
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,400
the next day.

186
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,320
She said she didn't know anything.

187
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,010
I decided

188
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,010
to keep her secret.

189
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,060
Then I looked it up on the Internet.

190
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,610
She has werewolf blood.

191
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,170
If you knew she was a werewolf,

192
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,440
why didn't you run?

193
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,930
I love her.

194
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,170
I've had a sterilization operation.

195
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,250
I think

196
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,170
as long as we don't give birth
to a little werewolf,

197
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,640
she won't be discovered by others.

198
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,250
A great lover.

199
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,250
Because of love.

200
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,320
Then,

201
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,570
I'd buy a fresh piece of meat

202
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,520
every day and put it in the fridge.

203
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,080
Why don't you cook it?

204
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,280
Cook it?

205
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,730
Have you ever seen a wolf
eat cooked meat?

206
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,010
Then,

207
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,370
does she have any
physical abnormalities?

208
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,880
Like concentration problems

209
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,010
or weight loss?

210
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,760
Xue was on a diet.

211
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,250
She threw out all the food in the house.

212
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,080
That's right.

213
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,610
People with NSRED

214
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,610
love everything high in calories

215
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,760
like ice cream and chocolate sauce.

216
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,130
During weight loss,

217
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,210
she has nothing to eat,

218
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,640
so she has to eat raw meat.

219
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,800
So, in that case,

220
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,970
Xue she's not a werewolf?

221
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,330
NSRED was officially recognized

222
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,490
as a disease in 1991.

223
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,450
About 0.5% to 1.5%

224
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,160
of the world's population

225
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,970
suffers from it.

226
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,880
That's inaccurate.

227
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,210
It should be one in a million.

228
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,880
There is no effective treatment

229
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,970
for NSRED.

230
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,800
We recommend seeing a psychiatrist.

231
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:00,800
Go in.

232
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,090
Yun, Zheng.

233
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,450
I've got the spot X-ray.

234
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,090
Do you see it?

235
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,280
It's this big.

236
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,280
I told you.

237
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,730
It'll be out with the stool
in a couple of days.

238
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:13,760
It's not a big deal.

239
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:15,760
So,

240
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:16,920
still want to file a complaint?

241
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,040
But you didn't see

242
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,250
that Xue suffered from NSRED.

243
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,850
NSRED?

244
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,760
Baby, don't cry.

245
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,090
The doctor said you just

246
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,850
have to stop losing weight

247
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,490
and get that necklace out.

248
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,600
But...

249
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,160
But I sleepwalk

250
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,010
and eat something.

251
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,730
I'm sick.

252
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,520
You are sick,

253
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,490
but the doctor said

254
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,150
you could see a psychiatrist.

255
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,760
Taylor Swift, the big star,

256
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,920
also has this disease.

257
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,090
It's a disease for beautiful women.

258
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,250
You're a beautiful woman.

259
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,850
Beauty,

260
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,490
let me hug you.

261
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,370
Let's go.

262
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,490
You don't need to lose weight.

263
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,490
Thank you, Doctor.

264
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,040
Let's go, beauty!

265
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,280
Let's go.

266
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,850
It's so rare.

267
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,640
I don't envy people

268
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,760
with girlfriends anymore.

269
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,370
Today,

270
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,990
we bumped into an NSRED patient.

271
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,490
Yue.

272
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,490
The two of them

273
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,880
said she had eaten a necklace

274
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,010
and then said she hadn't.

275
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,040
That kind of intimacy

276
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,640
made me...

277
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,610
Su Yun.

278
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,520
I think you should take your patients

279
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,680
more seriously.

280
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,330
I've heard that it's
the Emergency Department's practice

281
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,490
to send patients

282
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,280
to other departments

283
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,730
or even send them home early.

284
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,850
That's very irresponsible behavior.

285
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,920
Every disease has a cause.

286
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,800
Tracing the cause

287
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,370
is the only way to solve the problem.

288
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,610
Am I causing any harm?

289
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,490
Be serious.

290
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,160
The necklace will be excreted
in the feces, right?

291
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,800
So there's nothing wrong

292
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,650
with the way I handled it.

293
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,530
Indeed,

294
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,210
you saw that the patient had NSRED.

295
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:55,850
And then what?

296
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,640
You send her

297
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,520
to a psychiatric clinic, right?

298
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,850
Did it help?

299
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,610
I don't think so.

300
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:00,800
So the result is the same.

301
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,450
Yue.

302
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,090
Stop them.

303
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,800
I don't care.

304
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,610
It's not.

305
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,010
The patient's stress comes
from losing weight.

306
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,360
As soon as she stops losing weight,

307
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,110
the symptoms will be relieved.

308
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,040
It's impossible for you

309
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,550
to ask a girl

310
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,730
to stop losing weight.

311
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,850
Even Chang Yue couldn't do it.

312
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,640
I'm not losing weight.

313
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,560
You're on a keto these days.

314
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,640
Don't think I didn't notice.

315
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,640
I just love meat.

316
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,160
Then why don't you eat some carbs?

317
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,970
I told you

318
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:26,610
people get stupid

319
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,760
if they don't eat carbs.

320
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,680
As a doctor,

321
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,920
you should have used
more accurate terms.

322
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,040
Skipping carbs can lead to hypoglycemia.

323
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,300
Hypoglycemia leads
to insufficient blood supply

324
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:34,920
to brain cells.

325
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,920
And the damage that can't be repaired,

326
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,310
which leads to slow reaction time

327
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,060
and memory loss.

328
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,880
Does it mean getting stupid?

329
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,960
I did not get stupid.

330
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,320
If you ask a drunk person

331
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,000
if she's drunk,

332
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,990
she will always say she's not.

333
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:45,970
Isn't that the same thing?

334
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,640
You...

335
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,970
Stop it.

336
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,730
Let's get back

337
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,680
to discussing

338
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,450
conjoined twins separation surgery.

339
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,760
You have a new plan?

340
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,130
Here's the current data
on the conjoined twins.

341
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,640
After the NICU

342
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,880
adjusted the feeding formula,

343
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,970
the younger one

344
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:06,850
still weighs less than 1.5 kilos

345
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,330
while the older one is better.

346
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,800
Other than her pericardium
being attached to her sister's

347
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,010
and the left half of her liver
being intermingled with her sister's,

348
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,210
no other abnormalities have been found.

349
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,010
As for the younger one,

350
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,970
other than

351
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,970
those two problems,

352
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,130
she has congenital heart disease.

353
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,800
[Conjoined twins separation surgery]
But luckily,

354
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,680
both sisters

355
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,250
have their own visceral systems.

356
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,450
We did an evaluation.

357
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,490
They can be separated,

358
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,400
but the surgery is very complicated.

359
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,640
When's the best time

360
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,450
to operate?

361
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,570
When the younger one reaches 1.5 kilos.

362
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,560
If her heart function

363
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,330
holds up then,

364
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,560
it's best if she gets to two kilos.

365
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,520
Are all the organs

366
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,450
of the conjoined twins separate?

367
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,850
Is there hidden

368
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:38,560
metabolic coexistence?

369
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,760
The organs are all independent.

370
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,560
We'll need to do further testing

371
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,560
to see

372
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,160
if there
is covert metabolic coexistence.

373
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,450
Is there

374
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,160
a preliminary surgical plan already?

375
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,640
The isolation surgery will be performed

376
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,130
by Dr. Zheng and me.

377
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,730
Cardiothoracic Surgery
will take care of the heart,

378
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,090
and Dr. Zheng, the liver.

379
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,040
Then Plastic Surgery Department

380
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,040
will, on their chest and abdomen,

381
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,330
perform diaphragm molding,

382
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,520
repair of abdominal defects,

383
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,250
and repositioning of the umbilicus.

384
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,160
Due to the special characteristics

385

of face-to-face conjoined twins,

386
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,970

are interconnected,

391
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,450
so the entire procedure

392
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,210
is the most challenging
for the anesthesiologist.

00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,040

in this position.

574
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,800
Feet above the head.

575
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,210
Now.

576
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:31,930
Okay, let's do it!

577
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,120
Now.

578
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,760
Excuse me.

579
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,760
The puncture point

580
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,840
is in the subclavian thoracic triangle.

581
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:44,410
Yes.

582
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,120
Subclavian,

583
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,520
which is the lateral aspect
of the midclavicular line.

584
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,320
Take any point away from the subclavian.

585
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,760
Take a good look at it.

586
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,120
Easy. Yes.

587
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,560
The time.

588
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,270
Minus the time it takes
to get him into position.

589
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,960
45 seconds.

590
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,970
Get the IV on. Use Methylene Blue.

591
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:31,470
OK.

592
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,760
Administer the drip

593
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,520
at the maximum drip-rate.

594
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,490
Once the infusion is complete,

595
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,120
continue to give them the sugar water
for the gastric lavage.

596
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,520
OK.

597
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,800
Can you do that?

598
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,800
- Sure.
- No problem.

599
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,970
Then let's do it this way.

600
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:43,650
Be quick.

601
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,210
- OK.
- OK.

602
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:45,730
Zhou, come here.

603
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,970
Get the medicine for us.

604
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,520
Give me this.

605
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,040
The medicine.

606
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,320
Doctor.

607
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,840
Give me a new bottle. Hurry up.

608
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,750
This is enough. I'll get it.

609
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,320
Now.

610
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:01,930
Get some more.

611
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,600
Yes.

612
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,650
We need two more bottles.

613
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,490
In a minute.

614
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:06,930
We need more.

615
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,040
OK.

616
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,960
Bed 2 needs help.

617
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,320
Now.

618
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:09,930
I'm coming.

619
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,650
Doctor.

620
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,120
Help me.

621
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,210
Now.

622
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,650
Yun, take it easy.

623
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,970
This difficult puncture

624
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:18,840
requires us to try and look for it

625
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,490
again and again.

626
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,730
Sometimes, you have to be lucky.

627
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,450
I'm not you.

628
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,650
I was wrong.

629
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,650
Have you got it?

630
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,120
Give me one more year.

631
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,690
The car is there.

632
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,520
I'm coming!

633
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,760
And here.

634
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:51,890
OK.

635
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,040
Behind the car.

636
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,600
Be careful when you lift him.

637
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,120
Come on, there's another one behind us.

638
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,210
Now.

639
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,250
Now. There.

640
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,080
Now.

641
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:11,640
Can somebody come here?

642
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,560
Come on, over there!

643
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,650
The door won't open! Help with it!

644
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,350
- Help!
- Push the car.

645
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,030
Now.

646
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,730
Three, two, one!

647
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,320
Mom!

648
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,970
Somebody help me!

649
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,650
I need to take my mom to the hospital.

650
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,840
Can you help me?

651
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,160
The barf bag.

652
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,890
Watch out for foreign objects.

653
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,170
Here.

654
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,210
Help him, Doctor!

655
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,080
How much longer?

656
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,690
Huangya.

657
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,970
We're dealing with a mass incident.

658
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,040
If you want to see a doctor,
go somewhere else.

659
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,010
I'm here

660
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:51,760
as a caretaker.

661
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,360
Caretaker?

662
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,410
Working for a living.

663
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,650
I still owe the hospital money.

664
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,450
Really.

665
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,200
Wait a minute.

666
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,760
Really.

667
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,280
Zhou, it's me who asked him to come.

668
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,120
Give me that.

669
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,520
You're in charge of it.

670
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:02,970
OK.

671
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,170
I'll leave this to you.

672
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,080
Send it to the patients.

673
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,760
OK.

674
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,560
Patients' families, come on.

675
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,890
Xie Yiren, come and help.

676
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,650
I'm coming.

677
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,560
Puke here.

678
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,250
OK.

679
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,410
How long can you hold out?

680
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,280
I'll try my best.

681
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,930
Keep it steady.

682
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,040
Get me another guy.

683
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,360
We need Methylene Blue on Bed 8.

684
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:56,840
Come on, help me open it.

685
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:57,970
Open it.

686
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,250
Clean up and use Methylene Blue.

687
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,800
Hey.

688
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,320
One more guy.

689
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,040
We urgently need a doctor

690
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,040
in the operating room.

691
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:32,970
Man'ou's girl.

692
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,690
You go.

693
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:35,930
I'm not finished here.

694
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,120
Go where you're most effective.

695
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,120
I'll take it from here.

696
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,520
When will they arrive?

697
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,560
I'm here.

698
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,560
Why you?

699
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,760
It requires strength.

700
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,990
This rebar

701
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,170
is over five kilograms.

702
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,040
Even a man can't handle it.

703
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,410
Can you do it?

704
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,280
Are you looking down on me?

705
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,170
I'll do it.

706
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,270
Why look at me?

707
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,280
Stitch it up now.

708
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,320
For every centimeter you stitch,

709
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,490
I'll pull out a centimeter.

710
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,120
Take your time.

711
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,170
There's still time.

712
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,450
We're out of Methylene Blue.

713
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,560
I'll get that.

714
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,840
We need Methylene Blue.

715
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,840
- Come on.
- On my way.

716
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,520
We also need that.

717
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,360
How many do you need?

718
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,040
I'll get them.

719
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,360
Infusion completed.

720
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,930
I need four bottles of Methylene Blue.

721
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,360
Give them to me.

722
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,800
Doctor.

723
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,360
[Patient First]

724
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,450
Yes, Methylene Blue.

725
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,760
The more the merrier. Now.

726
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,280
We don't have time.

727
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,470
Do something!

728
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,170
Please.

729
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,170
Okay, I'll wait for your letter.

730
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,170
Ms. Su.

731
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,250
I've called

732
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,400
the neighboring hospitals.

733
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,520
They're taking patients, too.

734
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:46,690
There's not enough Methylene Blue.

735
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:48,840
Ms. Su.

736
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,170
There's no more Methylene Blue.

737
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,360
I got it.

738
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,650
Get to work.

739
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,170
Can you treat patients?

740
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,730
When will the medicine arrive?

741
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:59,170
If it's too late,
send us to other hospitals.

742
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,600
When will it be delivered?

743
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,010
Quiet, everyone!

744
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:11,970
Please listen to me.

745
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,470
Doctor, take a look.

746
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,510
Please be quiet.

747
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,890
I'm the president of this hospital.

748
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,650
Listen to me, everyone.

749
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,840
I'm the president of this hospital.

750
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,280
Here's the thing.

751
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,800
It's true that the Methylene Blue

752
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,360
from the pharmaceutical company
couldn't be delivered right away

753
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,560
because of the long distance

754
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,800
and the traffic jam,

755
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,450
but

756
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,250
I've just called

757
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,090
the nearby hospitals.

758
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,740
They will immediately
send some Methylene Blue

759
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,280
to help us,

760
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:37,900
so,

761
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,840
there will be no shortage
of Methylene Blue.

762
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,650
Please don't worry,

763
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,210
OK?

764
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,680
We're still competing

765
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,930

766
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,970
so please focus on the treatment,

767
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,800

Don't worry.

00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,690
If the medicine

777
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,560
hasn't arrived yet,

778
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,010
arrange for the transfer
of the latter patients

779
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,360

That's great. Thank you.

Is your hand stiff?

799
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:12,930
Do some stretching.

Aspirate.

803
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,490
OK.

804
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,250
It's a deep wound.

805
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,930
We need a drain.

806
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:39,970
Give it to me.

807
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,120
We can suture the abdomen.

808
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,280
I'll do it.

809
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,280
Haicheng Hospital doesn't even have

810
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,600
an automatic red blood cell

811
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,760

warming the blood manually so far.

In terms of this,

we're no match for Man'ou,

814
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:17,730
but

815
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,210
we were able to revive him.

816
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,560
That's because I was there in time.

817
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:24,930

My hands aren't flexible,

820
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,600
so I use the Rubik's Cube

821
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,490
for intensive training.

822
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,120

[Medical Utility Room]

835
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,040
I'm sorry.

836
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,490
You wanted to be a doctor
since you were a kid.

837
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,810
Even when you were playing house,

838
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,850
you were giving shots to dolls.

839
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,680
I was so happy.

840
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,120
I thought I had a successor.

841
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,120
Until...

842
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,330
Until I hurt my hand.

843
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,600
At that moment,

844
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,490
you have no idea how much guilt

845
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,290
and remorse I felt.

846
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,680
Medicine is different
from other disciplines.

847
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,370
Being a doctor requires you

848
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:10,930
to hold knives,

849
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,080
needles, saws,

850
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,160
and whatnot.

851
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,010
Doctors deal with germs every day

852
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,680
with the highest chance of infection.

853
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,640
I felt like God

854
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,450
was giving me a reminder

855
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,410
or warning that day.

856
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,560
It told me

857
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,330
not to allow my daughter

858
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,720
to study medicine.

859
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:35,930
Besides,

860
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,240
having been a doctor for so many years,

861
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,850
I know how hard this profession is.

862
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,720
It's too hard and tiring.

863
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,560
So I said to myself,

864
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:46,640
"Lin,

865
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,410
you need to make life easier

866
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,560
for your daughter."

867
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,410
That was really what I thought.

868
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,810
But how stubborn you were.

869
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,850
You always did things

870
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,040
we wouldn't allow

871
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,410
and even secretly enrolled

872
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,600
in medical school

873
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,640
without me and your mom knowing.

874
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,240
But you found out about it

875
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,970
and then changed my application
without permission.

876
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,120
If my teacher

877
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,040
hadn't double-checked with me,

878
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,450
my life would have been ruined.

879
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:36,560
We changed your application,

880
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,160
prevented you from going abroad,

881
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,970
constantly suppressed and satirized you,

882
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,200
and said so many things

883
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,040
we shouldn't have said.

884
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,720
I'm so sorry.

886
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,290
I just

887
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,080
want to say something

888
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,200
to you today.

889
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:08,930
Dr. Lin.

890
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:12,970
You're really great.

891
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,640
Even if you say so,

892
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,850
I'm still not happy.

893
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,770
I've been alone for ten years.

894
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,120
Ten years.

895
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,810
I'm just proving myself

896
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,720
and the fact

897
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,010
that I can be the best surgeon.

898
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,850
But you need a chance

899
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,680
to prove yourself.

you were admitted
to Harvard Medical School.

906
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,600
During your doctoral program,
you were invited

907
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,640
to intern at Man'ou
because of your excellent grades.

908
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,600
You have extensive experience in liver

909
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,810
and kidney transplants.

910
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:02,960
I am going to perform

911
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,850

00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,330
and need a surgeon

913
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,290
to separate the liver at the same time.

914
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,490
It's a very difficult surgery,

915
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,370
but I think you can do it,

916
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,080
so

917
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,850
would you like to join my team?

918
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,080

919
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,850
You can think about it.

920
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:33,930
I will.
