142
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,340
This means

143
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,390
that when I join the team,

144
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,220
the old surgeries are gone

145
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,850

Of course,

00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,110
if the team itself attracts

150

No.

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,100
Then you are still doing it?

157
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,660
Of course.

158
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,250
We must.

159
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,600
For the sake of research

160
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,700
and saving lives.

161
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,100
We don't have the money at this stage,

162
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,140

163
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,290
He.

164
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,050
We've done some budgeting.

165
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,630
The cost of upgrading

167
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,420

Ms. Su.

169
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:45,940
Yun.

170
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,940
Zheng.

171
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,650

Thank you.

173
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,010
Am I right?

174
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,370
He's not going to join.

175
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,580
He's the most cash-strapped

176
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,770
out of all people at the hospital.

177
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,250
But I checked his file.

178
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,770
He's been in clinical anesthesia
for 15 years.

179
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,180
He's really good

180
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,610
and shouldn't stop there.

181
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,820
It's cruel to oppress people
who are short of money

182
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,700
with dreams.

183
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,160

But for a surgery like this,

there should be a lot of foundations

00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,010
[Ultrasound report]
of a woman

295
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,820
at the age of 39

296
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,070
revealed that the fetus

297
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,140
may have

298
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,130
congenital aortic stenosis.

299
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,100
The fetus was 24 weeks old
at the time.

300
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,220
Fetal congenital aortic stenosis
can be seen

301
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,820
when the fetus
is just twenty-four weeks old.

302
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,320
Which doctor is so amazing?

303
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,980
Dr. Wang.

She's really good.

307
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,130
Dr. Wang suggested inducing labor.

310

and heart failure,

312
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,650
resulting in hypoplastic

left heart syndrome.

314
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,010
Even if the patient gives birth
to the baby alive,

315
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,770
she'll still be in a lot of trouble.

316
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,530
But the pregnant woman
refused to be induced

317
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,700
and expected a miracle.

318
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,390
And then?

319
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,460
When she came
for an obstetric examination just now,

320
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,370
Dr. Wang found

321
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,700
that the condition
of the fetus was deteriorating.

322
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,340
The ratio of the left and right ventricles
is gradually abnormal.

323
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,370
Fetal pericardial effusion

324
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,610
and mitral regurgitation

325
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,530
appear one after another.

326
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,480
The GYN has two other options.

327
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:38,940
One.

328
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,700
Close observation
and conservative treatment,

329
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,250
but with the current condition
of the fetus,

330
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,610
it will not last for natural delivery.

331
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,180
Two, prepare for cesarean section.

332
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,400
After delivery,

333
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,680
the baby will be taken
to another operating table

334
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,530
to be treated with extracardiac therapy.

335
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,730
Wait a minute.

336
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,140
Pediatric cardiac surgery
should be Chang Yue's job.

337
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,150
What does that have to do with you?

338
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,730
Dr. Wang and I talked about it
over dinner.

339
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,530
I don't think the surgery is difficult,

340
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,530
but the risks are huge,

341
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,100
and it's hard for the patient
to recover afterward,

342
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,770
so I proposed a third option.

343
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,650
Let me guess.

344
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,220
You came to Fish-head

345
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,250
for intervention.

346
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,850
You wanted an intrauterine intervention?

347
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,340
Yes.

348
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,300
It sounds wonderful.

349
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,650
So it's feasible, right?

350
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,340
Please note.

351
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,940
It just sounds wonderful.

352
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,820
There are

353
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,100
over 200 clinical cases internationally.

354
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,180
The success rate
of the technique is over 50%.

355
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:18,940
In other words,

356
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,220
the mortality rate is over 40 percent.

357
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,340
Nearly 50%.

358
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,820
But for cardiothoracic surgery

359
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,980
after a cesarean section,

360
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,630
I think this approach

361
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,580
has the lowest risk.

362
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,650
Your second option

363
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:27,580
won't hurt the pregnant woman.

364
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,980
If you choose
the intrauterine interventional procedure,

365
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,120
the pregnant woman will share

366
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,890
half the risk of the fetus.

367
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,820
It's possible that both will live,

368
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,850
or both will die.

369
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,370
What do you think?

370
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,700
It doesn't matter what I think.

371
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,770
It's the patient's choice.

372
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,010
Yes.

373
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,730
Medicine is difficult,

374
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,460
but it's no match for human nature.

375
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,940
Why don't you check that first?

376
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:54,890
OK.

Don't talk about it.

381
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,290
I won't agree no matter what you say.

382
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:19,620
The second one.

383
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,690
I want an intrauterine intervention.

384
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,770
It's harmful to you.

385
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,290
I'd rather not have the baby.

386
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,770
But I want the baby.

387
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,690
For years,

388
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,570
I've wanted a baby.

389
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,890
It's finally here.

390
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,050
Honey.

391
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,170
If something happens to you,

392
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,810
our child will have no mother

393
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:44,740
even if he survives.

394
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,500
Have you thought about him?

395
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,860
Is this fair to him?

396
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:54,570
Stop crying.

397
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,770
It's okay.

398
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:58,860
Stop crying.

399
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,050
Baby and mom.

400
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,610
It's such a hard choice.

401
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,050
When my mom was pregnant with me,

402
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,700
she had gestational hypertension.

403
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,290
My dad didn't hesitate to ask

404
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,570
for the pregnancy termination,

405
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,850
but my mom insisted

406
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,610
and suffered a lot

407
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,940
before giving birth to me.

408
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,020
Zheng Ren.

409
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,470
Interventional surgery

410
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,900
for congenital aortic stenosis

411
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,850
can open the stenosis
as early as possible

412
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,460
to improve blood flow to the aorta.

413
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,370
If the procedure is successful,

414
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,020
the fetus can continue to grow
in the mother's womb

415
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,570
until it is delivered naturally

416
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,370
between the 38th and 40th weeks.

417
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,130
He's saying you can be saved.

418
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,090
Both.

419
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,020
Sheng.

420
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,260
Did you hear that?

421
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,050
Both of us can be saved.

422
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:05,610
By the way,

423
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,180
what's the success rate?

424
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:09,980
10%.

425
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:10,980
What?

426
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,660
Just 10%?

427
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,180
It's better than waiting for death.

428
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,180
Honey.

429
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,020
How about this?

430
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,770
Let's give birth to the baby
by cesarean.

431
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,660
He's lucky to be alive.

432
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,530
If not,

433
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,500
let's have another baby.

434
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,700
This is the worst

435
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,850
and most tiring time for me.

436
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,660
I don't want rationality

437
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,130
or meaningless motivational quotes.

438
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,850
I just want you

439
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,020
to support me.

440
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,220
Support me.

441
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,420
Zheng Ren, are you giving up?

442
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,370
Intrauterine intervention
is the crown jewel

443
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,420
of interventional surgery.

444
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,290
There are hundreds
of successful cases abroad,

445
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,460
but only a handful in China.

446
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,570
Are you willing to give up, Zheng Ren?

447
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,640
He doesn't do well with provocation.

448
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,370
Shut up.

449
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,570
I won't give up.

450
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,570
I've seen these surgeries.

451
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,740
I don't think you're worse than them.

452
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,810
It's about time

453
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,900
Haicheng Hospital takes this jewel off.

454
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,370
I won't give up either.

455
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,570
This surgery only has a 10% chance

456
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,290
of success,

457
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,810
but as doctors,

458
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,570
we still have to do everything we can

459
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,530
to save the child's life.

460
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,130
The National Stocktaking Report

461
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,180
on Birth Defect Prevention states

462
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,570
that there are 130,000 cases

463
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:01,700
of congenital heart disease every year

464
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,180
and the number

465
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,370
keeps increasing.

466
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,850
It would be very significant

467
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,460
if we could use interventional therapy.

468
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,370
So...

469
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,290
So we'll take it.

470
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,180
Of course.

471
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,980
Please, Zheng Ren.

472
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,370
Take care of this.

473
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,180
This surgery

474
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,740
will help us to better understand

475
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,700
the baby's structure

476
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,330
and will be very helpful

477
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,850

Thank you.

She's 32 weeks pregnant,

481
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,530
so the diameter of the umbilical vessels

482
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,500
[Blood vessel]
should be three to four millimeters.

483
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,220
Right?

484
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,220
OK.

485
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,220
But it's only about 1.8 millimeters

486
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,130
on the image.

487
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,740
Almost half the diameter.

488
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:05,980

490
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,180
I'll adjust the position for you.

491
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,220
It's an ideal position,

492
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,660
but it's a simulation.

493
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,500
In practice,

494
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,740
we don't always get such a position.

495
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,080

he can do it?

00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,780
And the hospital

572
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,410
doesn't have to take such a risk.

Ms. Su.

574
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,300
The patient is in her 32nd week
of pregnancy,

575
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,720
which is the last time

576
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,820
for intervention.

Dr. Wang.

578
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:15,970
I think it is possible

579
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,650
to give the child
the intrauterine treatment

580
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,890
with an interventional procedure.

581
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,650
No matter how difficult it is,

582
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,370
it can at least
give the clinician an idea

583
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,450
instead of making them
give up right away.

old people like me,

588

but how long can it hold on?

589
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,970
It's time for new ideas
and new techniques.

590
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,100
Of course,

591
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,820
the risks of this surgery are very high,

592
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:49,820
so it's important

593
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,540
to make sure the mother
and her family's wishes

594
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,060

What are you looking at?

612

Don't talk to me.

613

I won't change my mind.

I was a pregnant woman once,

but unfortunately. I lost my baby.

616
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,610
Maybe it's because I've had

617
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:09,930
and lost it

618
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,340
that I realize

619
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,780
we have to take responsibility
for lives.

I don't know

called "Hana's Miso Soup".

623
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,970
A mother with cancer

624
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,890
risked her life to give birth
to a daughter,

625
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,610
but unfortunately,

626
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,130
her breast cancer came back,

627
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,170
so

628
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,540
she taught her daughter to cook,

629
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:38,860
but

630
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,350
what did a four-year-old

631
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,690
do wrong?

632
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,740
She had to take care of not only herself

633
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,970
but also her alcoholic father.

634
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:48,820
While other kids

635
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,370
were being fed by their moms,

636
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,370
she had to chop,

637
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,500
light the fire, and cook

638
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,340
with her own little hands.

Everyone praises her for her thoughtful,

640
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,370
but no one says she's happy.

641
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,650
I don't think you would

642
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,500
want the baby in your tummy

643
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,260
to be like Hana in the future.

644
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,060
I've seen that movie,

645

but my situation is different.

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,860
and I'm not.

648
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,820
Hana is not sick,

649
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,860
but my baby is.

650
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,970
A sick child needs

651
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,780
more than just being born.

652
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,830
It needs ten or even a hundred times

653
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,090
more parental effort

654
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,890
to take care of him than anyone else.

655
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,060
We need to make trips to the hospital,

If that's the case,

660
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:08,890
why can't my baby have the surgery done

661
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,340
while he was in my belly?

662
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,300

but

666
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,370
the surgery is.

667
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,500

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,410
what about your lover?

671
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,970

672
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,130

673
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,340
I looked it up on the internet.

674
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:58,020
I found dozens of successful cases
of this surgery.

681
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,260
this surgery would be possible

682
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,970

the mother will jump in

686

without a second thought.

00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,570
for the fetus' heart?

763
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,140
The fetus isn't in a good position.

764
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,300
So we have to wait.

765
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,620
When there's a good position,

766
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,740
the anesthesiologist will give the drug.

767
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,040
I've heard that sometimes

768
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,080
when we have a 4D ultrasound,

769
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,180
we have to wait for an hour or two

770
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,340
just to wait for the fetus to roll over.

771
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,240
If the fetus

772
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,260
never rolls over,

773
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,860
we have to wait for the next time.

774
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,140
So will this surgery

775
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,300
be done today?

776
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,410
Doomsayer.

777
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,300
The fetus's heart is too small,

778
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,740
just a little bit bigger than an almond.

779
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,410
That's not even a surgical space.

780
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,830
We have to use the thinnest guidewire

781
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,700
to find the position of the aortic valve

782
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,130
and then dilate the narrowest position

783
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,700
in the lower balloon.

784
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:14,490
Ms. Su,

785
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,490
it's not too late to give up.

786
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:17,740
Shut up.

787
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,450
Mr. Zhao.

788
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,700
You're also a doomsayer.

789
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,370
It's moving.

790
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:24,890
We can start the anesthesia.

791
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:26,970
Anesthetize now.

792
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:27,660
OK.

793
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:33,930
Got it.

794
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,370
No wonder it had to be He.

795
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,970
He's really good at this.

796
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,050
Anesthesia is done.

797
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,140
It's the key point, right?

798
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:33,780
Yes.

799
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,050
Balloon dilation
is the most important step.

800
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,450
There's no theory or data

801
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,450
to support it.

802
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:39,680
It can only be accomplished

803
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,860
by the surgeon's experience.

804
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,870
It's a very delicate

805
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:58,490
but very dangerous operation.

806
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,500
Aortic differential pressure

807
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,140
has dropped from 88 to 83.

808
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,340
81.

809
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,340
It's the most dangerous time.

810
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,860
If there's a contraction

811
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,450
or the baby stops beating,

812
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,660
we'll have to do a C-section.

813
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,490
Then be it.

814
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,570
75.

815
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,370
64.

816
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,180
Why isn't it stopping?

817
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,600
He should stop

818
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,660
dilating the balloon

819
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,700
at this point.

820
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:34,700
Yes.

821
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,950
Even if the fetus has a little problem,

822
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,300
he can still grow up.

823
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,490
Wouldn't it be better

824
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,760
to do the open heart surgery

825
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,370
after he's five?

826
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,890
Even when he's two, three,

827
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:43,740
or a few months old.

828
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,340
It's much less risky

829
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,370
to do the surgery then

830
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,570
than now.

831
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:54,860
49.

832
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,180
Zheng, you can do it.

833
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,260
34.

834
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,410
For a fetus,
it's usually between 22 and 25.

835
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:36,970
34 is acceptable.

836
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,740
This fetus is different from the others.

837
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,260
34 is just right.

838
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,410
Oh, I forgot about that.

839
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:45,820
The operation was a success.

840
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:52,090
OK.

841
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,340
Unbelievable.

842
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,700
Unbelievable.

843
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:59,570
Bravo.

844
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,260
This way.

846
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:23,950
Congratulations.

847
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,090
The intrauterine intervention
was a success.

848

Thank you.

849
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,570
I should thank you.

851

Your surgery.

852
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:35,740
Great.

853
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,410
Congratulations.

No.

856
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,220
It's 17 minutes and 23 seconds.

863
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:49,740
Oh, okay, okay.

864
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:50,450
Doctor,

865
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,300
speak English, please.

866
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:56,570
I witnessed your

prostate intervening symbolization,

868
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,700
and it was... It was perfection.

869
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:04,450
I would like to invite you
to come with me to Germany

870
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,220
for an intellectual exchange
and symposium.

If you're interested,

I will establish a charter in our names
for a laboratory

continuing this kind of research.

What do you say?

No, thanks.

879
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,450
Consider it.

intrauterine balloon dilatation
will be difficult.

an intrauterine
intervention embolization.
