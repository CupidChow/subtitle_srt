Mom.

7
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,660
Mom, don't leave me alone!

8
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,460
Mom.

9
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,410
Sir, aren't you a doctor?

10
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,210
You have to save my mom.

11
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,340
Sir.

12
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:05,790
Mom.

13
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:06,980
Oh, no.

14
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,920
Mom.

15
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,910
Sir, save my mom!

16
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,600
Sir, save my mom!

17
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,180
Sir.

18

Bai Yang.

21
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:28,910
Listen carefully.

22
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,190
I'm going to do a c-section

23
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,300
on your mom now.

24
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,180
Don't be afraid.

25
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:33,930
Don't be afraid.

26
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,140

Sir, what's wrong?

29
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,460
I'm fine.

No.

35
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,270
Su Yun,

36
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,180
the conjoined twins

37
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,340
Are you ready?

38
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:51,930
No.

39
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,530
Su Yun.

40
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:53,850
I need you.

41
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,060
Are you ready?

42
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,690
No.

43
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,240
Su Yun.

44

No.

47
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,560

- The world's number-one...

48
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,250

No.

51

I need you.

52
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:02,930
No.

53
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,070
What's wrong with him?

54
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,480
He can't do the surgery.

55
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,040
He's been like this

56
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,900
since Professor Wu's accident.

57
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:13,800
Then what to do?

58
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,760
I told you he couldn't do it.

59
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,800
Couldn't do it.

60
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,710
Professor Wu's hand is ruined

61
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,420
Because of him.

62
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,010
He was the one
who broke Professor Wu's hand.

63
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:21,860
It was him.

64
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,330
Couldn't do it.

65
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,830
It was him.

66
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,250
Couldn't do it.

67
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:26,960
He doesn't deserve it.

68
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,100
Su Yun,

69
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,220
remember

70
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,620
when I first

71
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,060
took you to surgery?

72
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,130
Take it easy.

73
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,660
I'm here.

74
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,010
Sir.

75
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,810
Are you ready?

76
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,640
Lift!

77
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,960
Lift!

78
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,960
One, two, come on.

79
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,100
Push forward.

80
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,180
Su Yun.

81
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,660
Su Yun.

82
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,220
Su Yun.

83
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,300
This is his white cote.

84
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,010
Su Yun is inside.

85
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,990
Come on.

86
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,110
Don't!

87
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,130
What are you doing?

88
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:43,840
You can't jump down.

89
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,570
The aftershocks destroyed the terrain.

90
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,220
We don't know

91
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,060
what's down there yet.

92
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,470
It's very dangerous for you
to go down like this.

93
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,000
That's right.

94
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,130
Since we're sure

95
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:50,960
Dr. Su is here,

96
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,980
there's still hope.

97
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,880
We have to think of another way

98
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,180
to rescue him.

99
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,180
You're here to save people.

100
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,810
Searching is my duty.

101
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,220
Be careful.

102
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,540
Be quiet.

103
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,660
It's in there.

104
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,210
Is it a boy or a girl?

105
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:12,780
Boy.

106
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,570
That's great.

107
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,450
My brother

108
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,380
can change my mom's water container

109
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,850
someday.

110
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,730
Your brother is very brave,

111
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,900
and so are you.

112
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,610
Hang in there.

113
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,780
One, two, go!

114
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,380
- One, two.
- Be careful for structural changes.

115
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:35,970
Pry it open.

116
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,300
Let go!

117
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,570
He's alive.

118
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,810
Found him.

119
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,060
Dr. Su.

120
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,020
Don't talk yet.

121
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,780
He's in surgery.

122
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,260
Keep quiet.

123
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,080
The ladder.

124
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,330
- Prepare to rescue him.
- Yes, sir.

125
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,970
Su Yun

126
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,810
can actually hold a scalpel.

127
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,540
Was the surgery a success?

128
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,930
Of course.

130

We're saved.

132
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,260
How's my brother?

133
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,930
Very well.

134
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,500
Your family will be together again.

135
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,300
I'm sure Dad will be very happy.

136
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,540
Where's your dad?

137
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,180
My dad fell asleep
with the national flag on his body.

138
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,060
Mom said

139
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,180
he was a big hero.

140
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,210
Sir.

141
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,730
There's a rainbow bridge in Mexico,
right?

142
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,140
Bridge?

143
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,450
The cartoon said there was.

144
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,260
That's right.

145

146

I'll take you there

149
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,850
if we have the chance.

150
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,380
Okay.

151
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,300
It's a deal.

152
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,930
Come on.

153

Yang.

154

Yang.

155

Yang.

156
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,540
Talk to me, Yang.

157
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,180
No.

158
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,860
You were just fine.

162
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:07,980
Help her.

163
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,210
Please, help her.

164
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,540
Please, help her.

165
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,730
Yang, get up.

166
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,420
We're finally saved.

167
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,970
Hang in there.

168
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,930
You said you were going

169
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,850
to the Rainbow Bridge.

Her father is a cop.

She says she wants to be a cop
when she grows up.

Zheng Ren.

175
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,690
It's my fault.

176
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,330
I didn't check on her first.

177
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,090
I didn't know she was hurt so badly.

178
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,810
She sat...

179
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,540
She sat there for so long.

180
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,020
Why didn't I look at her?

181
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,120
Why didn't I?

182
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,080
Why?

183

her brother wouldn't have survived,

187
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,020

00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,940
I'm afraid she'll lose more than

197
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,980
half of the part beneath her thigh.

198
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,170
The plane hasn't come back yet.

199
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,170
If we wait any longer,

200
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,890
even if we get her to Hexi Province,

201
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,020
we won't be able to save her.

202
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,500
Why don't we just amputate the leg now?

203
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,650
Yang.

204
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,980
Yang.

205
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,850
Where's Yang?

206
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,610
Have you seen my daughter?

207
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,980
Yang.

208
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,700
Yang.

209
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,090
We saw your son.

210
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,540
Son?

211
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,570
He's safe for now,

212
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,740
so you need to get better

Get an orthopedic surgeon here.
Amputate the leg now.

216
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,220
Don't amputate yet.

217
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,090
I'll intervene to remove the clot.

218
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,130
It still won't prevent the amputation,

219
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,030
but at least,

220
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,170
it'll lower the amputation point.

221
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,850
It'll be easier to

222
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:08,610
put in a prosthesis after the surgery.

223
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,740
It can also improve her quality of life.

224
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,060
If you start with the thigh,

225
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,500
she'll need a prosthesis

226
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,740
at the knee and ankle.

227
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,060
If I intervene to remove the clots,

228
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,130
she'll only have to have
her lower leg amputated.

229
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,540
She'll only need a prosthesis

230
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,540

Even if you have to operate,

233
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,410
there are no machines here.

234
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,650
There's only one hospital
in Nanyang town.

235
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,260
As you can see,

236
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,020
half of it was collapsed.

237
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,170
Normally, the walls
of a hospital's Radiology

238
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,410
are made of lead plates.

239
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,370
They're strong.

240
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,260
It may not have collapsed.

241
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,300
We can see if there's

242
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,780
a gastrointestinal machine available.

243
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,460

stop us from saving the lives of others.

Where are you going?

To find a gastrointestinal machine.

Gastrointestinal machine?

262
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,330
You want to use a gastrointestinal machine
to intervene to remove a clot?

263
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,540
Vascular intervention
is a bit of an obscurity.

264
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,060
It's normal
for you not to know about it.

265
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,700
I'm assuming

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,330
that the number

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,220
due to clot removal

271
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,370
will decrease.

272
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,020
Just pay more attention.

00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:33,940
As for kidney failure,

274
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,780
it's a matter of choice.

275
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,370
Ten centimeters less amputation.

276
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,460
Ten more days of dialysis after surgery.

277
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,980
Which one do you choose?

278
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:43,890
Definitely the former.

you don't have the consumables.
