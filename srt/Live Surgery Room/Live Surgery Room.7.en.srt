00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,040
I'm fine.

193
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,680
Don't you all have something to say?

194
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,410
- Hurry.
- Yes.

195
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,040
Mr. Lin, I know

196
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,590
that the hospital has invested a lot

197
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,400
to operate on the children.

198
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,750
Dr. Zheng said

199
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,230
we don't need to pay first,

200
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,320
but if this leads to him being fired,

201
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,200
who will operate then?

202
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,870
Yeah.

203
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,590
Yeah.

204
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,910
Oh, right.

205
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,800
We've decided

206
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,590
to give our place to the hospital.

207
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,200
Please don't chase Dr. Zheng away.

208
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,400
I'm begging you.

209
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,160
Please?

210
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,110
I'm begging you.

211
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,230
I'm begging you.

212
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:29,750
I'm begging you.

213
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,600
I'm begging you.

214
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,160
Dr. He,

215
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,720
I'm sorry.

216
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,020
I complained

217
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,350
that you accepted bribes,

218
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,200
but later I realized

219
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,900
there was an extra line

220
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,200
in the hospitalization bill.

221
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,160
It's only then that I realized

222
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,960
you had used all the money

223
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,230
I had given you

224
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,560
to pay for some of the bills.

225
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,680
I'm really sorry.

226
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,520
I had wrongly accused you.

227
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,160
It's my duty.

228
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,150
We're sorry. We...

229
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,870
Ms. Su,

230
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,080
I'm begging you.

231
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,160
Please don't fire Dr. He.

232
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,200
He really is

233
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,800
a rare and good doctor.

234
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,520
Miss Su,

235
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,950
they're all good men.

236
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:03,920
Yes, Miss Su.

237
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,920
This isn't fair to the doctors.

238
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,110
I pledge myself
to the medical profession

239
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,230
and uphold the ethics of the profession.

240
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,560
- Mr. Pan.
- Mr. Pan.

241
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,200
Mr. Pan.

242
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,560
Didn't you

243
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,110
just go through

244
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,830
the TIPS procedure?

245
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,470
This is...

246
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,870
Lin,

247
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,800
do you remember

248
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,950
the oath you swore as a doctor

249
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,630
back then?

250
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,350
I do.

251
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,800
Recite it.

252
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,800
I will practice medicine

253
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,280
with integrity and dignity.

254
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,200
I shall put my patients' health

255
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,750
as the first priority.

256
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,320
Since you haven't forgotten it,

257
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,470
then why...

258
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,470
Why do all of you

259
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,320
make your patients wait outside

260
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,630
the operating room for you?

261
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,870
You.

262
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,110
You.

263
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,520
You all...

264
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,920
How powerful of you.

265
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,280
Mr. Pan, don't be angry.

266
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:45,750
Yes.

267
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,080
We'll go wash up now.

268
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,710
We'll go right now.

269
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,320
Right away.

270
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,920
We'll go.

271
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,470
Let's all go.

272
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,080
Let's go.

273
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,590
Right away.

274
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,870
Go.

275
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,750
Everyone, please return.

276
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,350
Everyone, please follow me.

277
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,200
Thank you.

278
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,520
Please step out for a while.

279
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,960
Okay. Let's go.

280
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,800
I'm sorry.

281
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,630
Thank you.

282
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,080
Thank you.

283
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,280
Thank you.

284
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,520
Lin,

285
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,590
are you leaving still?

286
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,710
No.

287
00:14:59,320 --> 00:14:59,830
Still,

288
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,200
I won't accept this.

289
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,320
Okay.

290
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,400
Summon Zheng Ren.

291
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:26,990
Okay.

292
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,710
There are currently 1,200 beds

293
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,750
in Haicheng Hospital.

294
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,520
Have a guess

295
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,080
at how many beds we had

296
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,920
back when we started.

297
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:21,920
200 beds.

298
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,950
One bed.

299
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,520
Impossible.

300
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,040
When I first met Bu,

301
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,040
he showed me the hospital's map.

302
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,350
There were 200 beds.

303
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,800
What he talked about

304
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,110
was after Haicheng Hospital
has been established.

305
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,350
I meant all the way at the start

306
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,990
with one tent,

307
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,520
one bed,

308
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,680
and three doctors.

309
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,830
Bu,

310
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,560
Chen Miao,

311
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,750
and me.

312
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,400
They were my students.

313
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,950
In the Great Floods of 1998,

314
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,390
the three of us met in Haicheng.

315
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,870
We rushed off

316
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,280
to help with the floods.

317
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,800
The tent was the hospital.

318
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,390
The stretcher was our operating table.

319
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,870
Back then,

320
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,280
we wanted to build a hospital.

321
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,480
That's why the hospital's logo

322
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,110
is a tent.

323
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,280
Do those three lines

324
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,870
represent the three of you?

325
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,240
No.

326
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,830
The first line

327
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,670
represents medical skills.

328
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,000
Medical skills
are the foundation of medicine.

329
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,480
The improvement of our skills

330
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,870
means society, this big machine,

331
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,760
will work better,

332
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,150
driving forward humanity's development.

333
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,910
The second line

334
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,240
represents medical ethics.

335
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,910
The danger of doctors without ethics

336
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,240
is greater than any illness.

337
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,080
Like just now.

338
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,830
If the patients lost their lives,

339
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,630
it wouldn't be due to their illness,

340
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,150
but due to the doctors

341
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:27,480
who intentionally delayed operating.

342
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,800
Skills, ethics,

343
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,480
and what's the last one?

344
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,040
The doctors and patients.

345
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:45,960
The doctors and patients.

346
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,800
Listen to that phrase.

347
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,150
Doctors are in front,

348
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:51,830
with the patients coming after.

349
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,720
It's illogical.

350
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,190
You must have patients
before you have doctors.

351
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,080
In my opinion,

352
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,830
it should represent
patients and doctors.

353
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,960
Doctors who don't see patients

354
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,350
aren't real doctors.

355
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,480
Doctors have to look at the illness

356
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,670
and the patient.

357
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,720
It's only when we have a clear view

358
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,800
of who the patients are

359
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,320
can we better treat them.

360
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,870
But we don't have a lot of time

361
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,190
to get to know our patients.

362
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,280
Yes.

363
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,150
Our careers are so short,

364
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,630
but the patients we treat

365
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,800
are infinite in number.

366
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,320
That is a fact,

367
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,080
but it can't be the reason

368
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,960
we run away from reality

369
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,830
instead of changing it.

370
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,080
Patient-doctor relations
will never improve then.

371
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,760
Still, an individual

372
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,390
has limits.

373
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,320
That's right.

374
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,630
If you want to make a change,

375
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,350
you can't rely on the individual.

376
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,000
It relies on the policy.

377
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,560
Su Li,

378
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,150
you want a reform.

379
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You want to create

380
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,670
a better Haicheng Hospital.

381
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,040
However,

382
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,390
have you considered this?

383
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,480
Look.

384
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,830
You've imitated the revenue model

385
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,830
and operating model of Man'ou Clinic,

386
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,320
but you have neglected

387
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:49,110
its core concept used
to manage hospitals.

388
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,320
What is the core concept?

389
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,280
Patients first.

390
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,870
Patients first.

391
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,040
A united team.

392
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,080
These three lines,

393
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,110
us three doctors,

394
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,430
and three different concepts.

395
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,630
Work in solidarity

396
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,830
and march forward together.

397
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,590
Yes.

398
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,830
Our generation

399
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,910
of Haicheng Hospital

400
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,000
has become history.

401
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,910
Haicheng Hospital

402
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,560
is now in your hands.

403
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,280
You need to be united.

404
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:18,350
It's only Haicheng when you're united.

405
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,150
That is the future.

406
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,430
Lin,

407
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:32,910
I watched you grow

408
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,480
in our hospital.

409
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,870
You were so young back then,

410
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,040
so handsome.

411
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,150
Right now,

412
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,760
your hair is gray.

413
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:51,520
I recommended you as vice president.

414
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,960
I'm not here to blame

415
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,870
or criticize you.

416
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,430
I just want to remind you

417
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:03,910
that all these years,

418
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,830
you've been the doctor

419
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,080
with the highest patient satisfaction

420
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,960
in Haicheng Hospital.

421
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,000
Look at how many of your patients

422
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,590
have become VIPs

423
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,350
in Haicheng Hospital.

424
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,080
What are VIPs?

425
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:22,910
Are they rich people?

426
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:25,480
No.

427
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,350
They are people who come to us

428
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,670
for treatment.

429
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,240
They only come to us

430
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,390
for you, Dr. Lin Ge,

431
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,150
to treat them.

432
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,430
I'm sorry, Mr. Pan.

433
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,480
We can't forget our original intentions.

434
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,670
Lin.

435
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,670
You don't have an operation today.

436
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,150
Head home.

437
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:07,830
Rest for a while.

438
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,110
Come back
once you've reoriented yourself.

439
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:26,760
Alright.

440
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,720
Let's take a break.

441
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,760
Su Yun,

442
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,040
push me to my room.

443
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,350
Mr. Pan,

444
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,000
we have something to tell you.

445
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,480
Speak.

446
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,800
Zheng Ren,

447
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,080
why have you never told us

448
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,910
about your relationship

449
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,080
with Chen Miao?

450
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:13,430
What did you say?

451
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:15,480
Chen...

452
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,080
Chen Miao?

453
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,080
What's his relationship with Chen Miao?

454
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,000
I'm Chen Miao's son.

455
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,720
You are...

456
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,000
That day, I went to visit my dad
at the hospital,

457
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,430
but then I saw that.

458
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,000
All these years,

459
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,910
I've always wondered

460
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,350
if my dad saw me then,

461
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,190
would he change his mind?

462
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,320
We went to your home

463
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,080
many times,

464
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,110
but we never found you.

465
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,910
My grandparents took me away.

466
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,480
I told myself

467
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,670
I had to find out the truth

468
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,910
and clear my father's name.

469
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,670
At that time, I was already enrolled

470
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,190
in medical school.

471
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,240
My grandmother passed away
five years ago.

472
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,040
I thought it was time

473
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,190
to investigate the incident.

474
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,390
You were assigned to South University,

475
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,110
so I signed up

476
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,240
to study interventional therapy there.

477
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,720
No wonder.

478
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,190
You were doing well in neurosurgery,

479
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,870
but you insisted
on studying interventional therapy.

480
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,040
You kept asking

481
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,110
about Haicheng.

482
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,630
You're very tight-lipped,

483
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,150
and you never mention the past.

484
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,080
When the year was up,

485
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,040
I had to head back
to Nanhai No. 3 Hospital.

486
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,630
Until this year,

487
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,150
when I was diagnosed with a carcinoma
of the head of the pancreas.

488
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,190
You suggested operating

489
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,110
for me,

490
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,240
and you even wanted

491
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,110
to continue working here.

492
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,280
Yes.

493
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,320
I did all that on purpose.

494
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:14,830
Thus,

495
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,720
you're in Haicheng Hospital

496
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:18,720
to investigate the truth

497
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,800
of what happened.

498
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,480
Yes.

499
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,000
In the archive room,

500
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,280
I looked through the day's record
of surgeries.

501
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,190
Indeed,

502
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,520
Li Aifang, Huangya's mom,

503
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,240
was at the hospital first.

504
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:29,670
My father had given her

505
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,430
emergency treatment,

506
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:31,910
but just then,

507
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:32,590
there was a girl

508
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,830
with an injured spine.

509
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,760
My father chose to save the girl.

510
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,390
My dad did nothing wrong.

511
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,190
He was not wrong,

512
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,080
yet the world thought

513
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,590
he only treated the rich
and abandoned the poor.

514
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:49,870
Yes.

515
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,080
Your dad did nothing wrong,

516
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,000
but

517
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,800
when faced with an unreasonable

518
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:54,480
and bad person...

519
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,390
The problem was

520
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,000
why did no one operate

521
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,720
on Li Aifang?

522
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:58,630
Why must you wait

523
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,150
until the girl is saved
before saving Li Aifang?

524
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:03,910
Why?

525
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,760
We'll be done soon.

526
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:16,720
How many more patients?

527
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,830
About 40 to 50.

528
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:18,430
So many.

529
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,280
Coming.

530
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,320
Have you contacted Dr. Pan
and Chen Miao?

531
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,800
Dr. Chen is rushing over.

532
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,480
Dr. Pan hasn't answered his phone.

533
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,280
Bu,

534
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:26,910
what's the situation?

535
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,830
It's very complicated.

536
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Just go help.

537
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:29,630
Okay.

538
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,020
[Emergency]

539
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,000
Sixteen years ago,

540
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,110
there was a high-speed car crash.

541
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,440
As we were the closest,

542
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,680
we were their first point of call.

543
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,440
We were just a small hospital then.

544
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,240
We had never gone
through something this major before.

545
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,520
Everyone was panicking.

546
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,240
- Doctor!
- Doctor!

547
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,480
Doctor!

548
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,550
It's a rib fracture.

549
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,590
Send him to Operating Room Three.

550
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,550
Have Dr. Lin operate.

551
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,240
Doctor!

552
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,310
Doctor, save my mom!

553
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:05,830
Come.

554
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,350
- Save my mom.
- Slowly.

555
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,150
Put her down slowly.

556
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,550
Mom.

557
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,370
Gone!

558
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,790
Her lower leg is necrotic.

559
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,110
Ready the operating room.

560
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:18,830
I'll operate on her.

561
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,720
Dr. Chen, hurry!

562
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,390
Dr. Chen.

563
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,630
We have a child.

564
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,870
Doctor.

565
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,920
Didn't you say

566
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,590
you would treat my mom?

567
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,150
The operating room is being readied.

568
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,120
Coming.

569
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,810
Over here.

570
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,250
Hemostat.

571
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,520
Do we have any more nurses?

572
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,990
Shoot.

573
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:46,550
The child

574
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,720
has a cervical fracture.

575
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,110
If the spine shifts,

576
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,240
she might be fully paralyzed

577
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,240
or die.

578
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:53,830
Get her to the operating room

579
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,590
Hurry.

580
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,070
Okay.

581
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,350
Doctor.

582
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,310
Didn't you say you're going

583
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,240
to operate on my mom?

584
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,920
Your mom isn't in danger now.

585
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,110
If we don't save the girl now,
she'll die.

586
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:01,590
Dr. Chen,

587
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,480
the child is going.

588
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,350
To the operating room!

589
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,200
For what reason?

590
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,590
We were here first.

591
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,550
We were here first.

592
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,480
Why not treat us?

593
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,480
Do you know how long

594
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,590
- my mom has been under there?
- Listen to me.

595
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,280
Your mom is not in danger of dying.

596
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,150
If we don't save the girl now,
she'll die.

597
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:14,920
Do you know?

598
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,920
Your father insisted

599
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,480
on operating on the girl first

600
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,310
before amputating Li Aifang.

601
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,000
Afterward,

602
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,520
Huangya heard

603
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,870
that the girl came from a rich family,

604
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,310
so he told the media

605
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,200
that your father only treats the rich

606
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,720
and abandons the poor,

607
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,200
crippling his mom for life.

608
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,590
What about you?

609
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,680
Where were you?

610
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,830
You were in Haicheng Hospital,

611
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,440
right?

612
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,280
I was.

613
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,350
Why were there no records

614
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,440
of your surgeries that day?

615
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,760
Aren't you a demon of surgeries?

616
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,920
The top orthopedic surgeon
in the region?

617
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,790
I'll be direct.

618
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,480
You were there.

619
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,440
Li Aifang's surgery

620
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,310
was done by you,

621
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,350
but you failed.

622
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,630
You pushed the blame to my father,

623
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,480
didn't you?

624
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:49,870
No.

625
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,480
No.

626
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,280
Nothing like that happened.

627
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,110
No?

628
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,680
He's the star of Haicheng Hospital.

629
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,960
To protect him,

630
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,240
you used my father as a scapegoat.

631
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,870
He was your student.

632
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,960
He wouldn't dare go against you!

633
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,440
The families criticize him.

634
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,760
The public opinion was against him.

635
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,000
You set him up.

636
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,680
He only chose to kill himself

637
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,350
because he couldn't stand the stress.

638
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,150
Now,

639
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,110
I want you to tell me.

640
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,350
On that day,

641
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,200
did you ever

642
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,200
enter Li Aifang's operating room?

643
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,280
I did.

644
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,550
He said you were the mentor

645
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,760
he respected the most.

646
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,110
You were his best friend.

647
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,350
His most respected mentor

648
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40,480
and his best friend

649
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,720
pushed him to death.

650
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,440
It's not like that.

651
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,590
Mr. Pan did

652
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,480
enter the operating room,

653
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,390
but he could not operate.

654
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,350
Why not?

655
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,800
Because I had alcohol.

656
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,710
On that day,

657
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,630
it was a gathering of comrades.

658
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,960
Why isn't Dr. Pan here?

659
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,070
Dr. Pan.

660
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:33,800
I'm here.

661
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,670
- You're finally here.
- Dr. Pan.

662
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,630
I received the notice,

663
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,750
rushed to the hospital,

664
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,400
and even entered the operating room,

665
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:45,150
but when I stood at the operating table,

666
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,590
I...

667
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,800
I could not operate.

668
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,840
I was drunk.

669
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:55,880
Dr. Pan.

670
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,150
My hands were shaking.

671
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,800
The patients before me

672
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,400
were all blurry.

673
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:10,360
I knew I could not operate.

674
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,590
It's the biggest regret of my life.

675
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,110
If I had not been drunk,

676
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,750
Li Aifang's operation

677
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,320
should have been mine.

678
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,320
The one Huangya went after

679
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,550
should have been me.

680
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:43,190
The one attacked by public opinion

681
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,230
should also have been me.

682
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,150
Yes.

683
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,400
You're right.

684
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,880
Your father

685
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,190
took the blame

686
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,270
for me.

687
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,920
The hospital was inexperienced.

688
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,710
When it came to mass emergencies,

689
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,800
it was chaos.

690
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,550
Combined with Huangya's scandal,

691
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,960
the later operations

692
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,400
were all delayed.

693
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,110
We were specifically criticized later,

694
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,070
and the media kept reporting on us.

695
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,110
With all that pressure,

696
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,320
Bu asked your father to leave,

697
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,150
to resign.

698
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,360
He wanted your dad to lay low.

699
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,840
Mr. Pan blamed himself for it.

700
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,480
He thought it was his fault.

701
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,710
He went to the authorities

702
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:11,960
to clarify the story.

703
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,670
But then...

704
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:19,960
Your father...

705
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,230
Your father...

706
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,040
It's the biggest regret

707
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,000
of Bu's life.

708
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,840
From then on,

709
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,230
he'd been plagued

710
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,440
with nightmares.

711
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,710
Your father

712
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,440
is the student

713
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,150
I'm the proudest of.

714
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,840
He's very talented,

715
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,520
very professional and ethical.

716
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,440
He had two catchphrases.

717
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,150
As long as the operation

718
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:15,040
has a one percent success rate,

719
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,190
then we must give it our 100%

720
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,360
to complete it.

721
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,070
Another catchphrase is

722
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,550
the patient

723
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:32,590
always comes first.

724
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,110
I've always wanted to apologize

725
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,750
to your father,

726
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,590
but he would never ever

727
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,230
be able to hear it.

728
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,000
You are his son.

729
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,590
Today,

730
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,480
let me say it to you.

731
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,230
I'm sorry.

732
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,670
Chen Miao's son

733
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,670
is also a doctor.

734
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,270
You have great skills and a great heart.

735
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,590
Good.

736
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,190
Good.

737
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,590
This counts

738
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,270
as the end of a lifelong regret.

739
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:44,920
Mr. Pan.

740
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,400
Mr. Pan.

741
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,670

742
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,520

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
