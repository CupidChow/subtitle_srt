00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,190
After examination,

194
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:38,830
we think it's most likely to be

195
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,920
Abdominal Cocoon Syndrome.

196
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,120
Probably due to tubal infections

197
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,350
and autoimmune reactions.

198
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,950
Can it be cured?

199
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,400
Since it's been a long time,

200
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,760
the usual conservative treatments

201
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,670
are no longer useful.

202
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,000
So the recommendation is surgery.

203
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,920
But since

204
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,430
it's a rare disease,

205
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,830
there's no guarantee of success.

206
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,640
For the past few months,

207
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,430
I've been treating it conservatively.

208
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,000
On the one hand,

209
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,120
I can't go far away from home.

210
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,310
I need to take care of my kid.

211
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,640
On the other hand,

212
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,850
I thought if I took my time,

213
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,040
I'd be cured.

214
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,830
Doctor.

215
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,950
I have one wish.

216
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,830
Let me hold out

217
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,470
for another six months.

218
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,760
I want to see

219
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,280
my daughter go to the primary school.

220
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,430
I beg you.

221
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,670
Please.

222
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,950
Please.

223
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,160
I'll do my best.

224
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,670
I want to see

225
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,160
my daughter go to the primary school.

226
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:52,890
I beg you.

227
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,710
Can you save my mom?

228
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,400
Don't let her die!

229
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,070
I beg you!

230
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,950
Happy birthday, baby.

231
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:05,830
Thank you, Mom.

232
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,150
Make a wish.

233
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,670
Here, open it.

234
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,590
Thanks, Dad.

235
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,310
Open it up.

236
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,070
Yeah.

237
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,310
Happy birthday to you.

238
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,590
Happy birthday to you.

239
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,390
Happy birthday to you.

240
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:37,120
Happy birthday to you.

241
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,470
Mom.

242
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,520
Mom!

243
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,990
You're scaring me, Mom.

244
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,950
Mom, get up.

245
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,430
Mom!

246
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,950
Mom!

247
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,070
Mom!

248
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,880
Mom!

249
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,380
[Operating]

250
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,600
I'll open it up first.

251
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,240
If it's difficult,

252
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,030
we need to work with the gynecologist.

253
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,480
They have been informed.

254
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,720
They'll be right here.

255
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,080
Scalpel.

256
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,480
That's a big incision.

257
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,550
Are you sure, Ren?

258
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,550
What is that?

259
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,000
It's worse than expected.

260
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,390
The bowel in the operative area

261
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,720
is completely encapsulated

262
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,390
The white connective tissue of

263
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,670
common Abdominal Cocoon Syndrome

264
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,120
looks like an eggshell.

265
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,510
It encompasses part of the intestine

266
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,710
and the periphery of the intestine.

267
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,670
But she

268
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,100
doesn't fall into either category.

269
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,150
Her case is too special.

270
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,180
You could make

271
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,360
a case study out of it.

272
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,720
It's a very difficult operation.

273
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,670
Sleepy?

274
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,200
Do you want to watch

275
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,430
a cartoon?

276
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,360
Take a nap if you're sleepy.

277
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,000
When you wake up,

278
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,240
your mom's surgery will be over.

279
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,240
Did you

280
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,080
get in touch with my dad?

281
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,760
He's on the earliest flight.

282
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,030
He'll be here at dawn.

283
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,630
Dawn?

284
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,790
The peritoneal protection is strong.

285
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,390
No wonder he needs such a big incision.

286
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,120
Yun.

287
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,120
Oh, no.

288
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,030
A tender bean curd.

289
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm afraid we'll have to
close the belly.

290
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,880
Why close the belly?

291
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,120
You've seen tender bean curd, right?

292
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,630
Her intestinal wall is like

293
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,670
a piece of tender bean curd.

294
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,240
It breaks

295
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,520
at the slightest touch.

296
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,780
There's no way to sew it up because...

297
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,980
And by asking why,

298
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,200
I mean why it was broken.

299
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,030
I told you.

300
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,390
It's a tender bean curd.

301
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,240
It's tough, isn't it?

302
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,360
When your loved one is in the
operating room,

303
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,790
it's the hardest time of all.

304
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,480
When my mom passed away,

305
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,150
my dad was drunk,

306
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,080
and my brother was away at college.

307
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,880
For registration,

308
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,670
standing in line
and waiting for the surgery,

309
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,000
I had to do it all by myself.

310
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,790
My situation was just
a little better than yours.

311
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,480
I was a grown-up, eighteen years old.

312
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,240
My mom went into the surgery room

313
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,670
but it didn't succeed.

314
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,550
My dad went into the surgery room

315
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,200
but it didn't succeed, either.

316
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,790
Then, I was thinking

317
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,390
about how important hospitals were.

318
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,670
I would marry a man who ran a hospital.

319
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,360
But although I married a hospital owner,

320
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,110
I couldn't save my brother and his wife.

321
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,120
And I couldn't save

322
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,510
their unborn child, either.

323
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,680
The only one who made it out

324
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,440
of surgery alive

325
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,680
was my husband.

326
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,200
But he became my ex-husband.

327
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,240
Hospitals

328
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,550
really are a turning point

329
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,030
in one's destiny.

330
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,200
I hope you're luckier than me.

331
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,270
Dr. Zheng, what should we do?

332
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,870
Don't worry. Just take it easy.

333
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,550
Just follow the inner lining's
outer side

334
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,790
of the connective tissue
to do the liberation.

335
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,310
Don't touch the outer lining of the gut.

336
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,310
Free the inner lining's
outer side of the connective tissue,

337
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,920
that is, the part adherent
to the intestine.

338
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,400
The side near the connective tissue.

339
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,350
You're not freeing the intestines.

340
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,030
You're breaking down the callus.

341
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,510
That's right.

342
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,440
Separating the callus rather than
freeing the gut.

343
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,110
In that way, it won't break.

344
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,590
It's the best way to deal with

345
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,480
tender bean curd.

346
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,440
That's a bold move.

347
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,160
He's still young.

348
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:52,920
Dr. Zheng.

349
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,270
How long do you think it'll take?

350
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,720
About four hours.

351
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:56,750
Keep the drugs coming.

352
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,400
Alright.

353
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,160
Have the gynecologist come up

354
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,310
and cut out the ovaries afterwards.

355
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,720
Gynecologist's ready.

356
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,960
Ready to do the surgery.

357
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,510
Dr. Zheng.

358
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,830
I'm fine.

359
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,030
Dr. Zheng.

360
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,270
Do you need to take a break?

361
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,240
No.

362
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,920
The intestines are soon free.

363
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,270
Separation completed.

364
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,870
Good work, Dr. Zheng.

365
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,790
The gynecologist can come now.

366
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,480
Alright.

367
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,080
- Dr. Zheng!
- Dr. Zheng!

368
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,000
Dr. Zheng!

369
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:11,990
Dr. Zheng!

370
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,250
- Dr. Zheng!
- Dr. Zheng!

371
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,160
Dr. Zheng!

372
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,190
Dr. Zheng!

373
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,720
- Dr. Zheng!
- Dr. Zheng!

374
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,480
- Dr. Zheng!
- Dr. Zheng!

375
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,030
Heartless doctor!

376
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,470
Shady hospital!

377
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,830
Heartless doctor!

378
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,590
Heartless doctor!

379
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:40,590
Are you okay?

380
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,030
Do you know you have a fever?

381
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,590
You're really something.

382
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,240
You're worried about the patient's life,

383
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,790
but what about yours?

384
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:01,680
Don't worry.

385
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,310
The operation was a success.

386
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:04,590
What's wrong?

387
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,480
I dreamed of a botched surgery.

388
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,590
Come on.

389
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,510
Tell me.

390
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,160
What's the problem?

391
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,590
I'm a bit of a psychologist.

392
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,550
I'll give you a free consultation.

393
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,510
I'll reward

394
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,030
a person's kindness.

395
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,640
I'll tell you what.

396
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,030
The life of a medical student
is very short.

397
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,550
Five years
for a bachelor's degree.

398
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
Three years for a master's degree.

399
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,160
Four years for a doctorate.

400
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,680
And then the postdoctoral study.

401
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,830
Even starting work as a bachelor,

402
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,000
you'll have to do three years of
internship.

403
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,240
Start by sewing the skin.

404
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,270
We'll be in the thirties

405
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,590
by the time we really get started.

406
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,640
As time goes by,

407
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,680
the body starts to decline.

408
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,000
A doctor's golden years

409
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,480
are just a decade or so.

410
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,310
That's the extent

411
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,200
of our careers.

412
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,480
Besides, you do intervention

413
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,000
wearing a few dozen pounds of lead
to soak up radiation.

414
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,590
Have you thought about the future?

415
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,550
Cure more illnesses.

416
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,270
Save more people.

417
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,760
Those are my future.

418
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,110
Just that?

419
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,030
Don't you have a life plan

420
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,830
for being

421
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,030
a human being?

422
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,640
I'm talking about a human being.

423
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,790
Human.

424
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,070
Let me give you an example.

425
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,240
Take Zhou as an example.

426
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,310
He's always thinking
of marrying a woman.

427
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,350
And He wants

428
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,680
to earn money to support his family.

429
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:37,960
Hua

430
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,030
wants a successful career

431
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,270
to show off to his ex-husband.

432
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:41,680
What about you?

433
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,240
Why did you stop doing surgeries?

434
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,500
[Name: Lin Xiuying
Diagnosis: Abdominal Cocoon Syndrome]

435
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,280
Are you tired?

436
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,000
Do you want to take a break?

437
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,150
I want to be with my mom.

438
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,110
Are you hungry?

439
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,830
I will buy you something nice to eat.

440
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,440
Nurse.

441
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,800
Open the door, nurse.

442
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,100
Open the door.

443
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:15,960
Dad.

444
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,800
Open the door, nurse.

445
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,080
Nurse!

446
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,240
Let me in!

447
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,560
I want in, nurse!

448
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,350
Open it.

449
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,150
Sir, you need to be quiet.

450
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,110
There are patients in here.

451
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,350
Mr. Peng.

452
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:27,830
Mr. Peng.

453
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,600
Sir.

454
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,200
Sir.

455
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:29,870
Dad.

456
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,040
Mr. Peng.

457
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,620
Why didn't you go to the hospital?

458
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,380
If you are sick, you must
see a doctor immediately.

459
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,960
Why didn't you go to the hospital?

460
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,300
Why didn't she go to the hospital?

461
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,180
Didn't go to the hospital?

462
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:39,870
Get out!

463
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:40,730
You're all useless.

464
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,800
Call security.

465
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,520
Alright.

466
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,390
Mr. Peng.

467
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,630
You deserved it!

468
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,590
You deserved it!

469
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,280
Mr. Peng.

470
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,540
Mom's not at fault.

471
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,680
She did see the doctor.

472
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,870
But she had to take care of me.

473
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,200
She could only see the nearest doctor.

474
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,880
Call me then!

475
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,280
Why didn't you call me?

476
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,120
- Mr. Peng!
- Mr. Peng!

477
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,510
Why didn't you call me?

478
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,310
Mr. Peng!

479
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,070
You hadn't been home for days.

480
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,520
Could we get to you?

481
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,520
I called you

482
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,830
and you kept saying you were busy!

483
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,560
You're not my good father anymore!

484
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,200
You're a bad father!

485
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,450
- Mr. Peng!
- Mr. Peng!

486
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,070
Let go!

487
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,440
I am...

488
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,550
I am a good father!

489
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,920
- Let go of the kid!
- Sir.

490
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:12,890
Please calm down.

491
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:13,840
Let go!

492
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,520
Calm down.

493
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,660
It's alright.

494
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:20,960
It's alright.

495
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:22,960
It's alright.

496
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,280
Don't be scared.

497
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,280
Sir.

498
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,390
What's wrong with dad?

499
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,950
- Is it because of me?
- Sir.

500
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,870
No.

501
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,040
He's sick.

502
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:31,870
Look.

503
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:32,560
They are

504
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,600
checking him out.

505
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,240
Don't cry.

506
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,590
Dad.

507
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,500
[Haicheng Hospital]

508
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,680
Zheng.

509
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,960
What should we do?

510
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,480
Let's take a blood sample.

511
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,720
Let him stay for observation.

512
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,440
So what do we follow up with?

513
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,030
Blood tests.

514
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,680
Ionization.

515
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:11,790
Blood sugar. Kidney tests.

516
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,400
Alright.

517
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,920
His daughter is so young.

518
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:16,870
How could this happen?

519
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,750
Could it be the result of some

520
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,000
underlying condition in the past?

521
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,280
Wait for the test results.

522
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,310
Keep an eye on him.

523
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,350
Call me if you need anything.

524
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:29,830
This is a bucket.

525
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,000
How is she?

526
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,310
She's good.

527
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,030
How's he doing?

528
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,830
We're waiting for the results.

529
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,840
Why don't you play with him

530
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,440
for a while?

531
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,640
Yun, take care of her.

532
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,030
Zheng,

533
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,400
let's talk.

534
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,070
Your dad's fine.

535
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,640
We're waiting for the results.

536
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,030
Do you know what you did wrong?

537
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,550
Wrong?

538
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,510
What is it?

539
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,640
This surgery

540
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,070
had a low success rate.

541
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,750
And you were hiding the fact

542
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,720
that you had a fever,

543
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,830
and you did it anyway.

544
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,720
I didn't know I had a fever.

545
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,790
You have your own way
of looking at others' illnesses.

546
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,270
But what about you?

547
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,830
Haicheng has a regulation.

548
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:37,760
It's written like this.

549
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,620
Doctors exist

550
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,470
to save patients.

551
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:41,870
And hospitals exist

552
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,920
to save everyone.

553
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,630
The limitations of technology

554
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,270
mean that many diseases can't be cured.

555
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,680
Many surgeries are doomed to fail.

556
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,960
Doctors' attempts and efforts

557
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,920
sometimes

558
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,790
kill the patients instead.

559
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,270
You saw it, too.

560
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,440
In the face of serious illness,

561
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:00,870
couples, fathers and daughters

562
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,160
blame each other.

563
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,920
Not to mention doctors and patients.

564
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,310
And you know what

565
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,030
the scariest thing is?

566
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,440
It's not your surgery alone.

567
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,960
If something happens,

568
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,680
you're not solely

569
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,560
responsible.

570
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,930
The medical staff who were

571
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,440
doing the surgery with you

572
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,110

766
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,160
He's so handsome.

767
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,080
That's what I thought.

768
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,160
Handsome and talented.

769
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,080
How can anyone be so handsome?

770
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:33,860
[Zheng Ren Star Doctor]

771
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,080
Mr. Lin.

772
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,600
Guest of honor, Mr. Zhang

773
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:41,950
is waiting for you in the ward.

774
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:42,720
Okay, I got it.

775
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:44,040
I'll be right there.

776
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,080
It's okay. Don't worry.

777
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,870
Mr. Lin will be here in a minute.

778
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,080
Alright. Thanks.

779
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,040
Are you thirsty?

780
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,640
Mr. Lin

781
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,830
Mr. Zhang must have

782
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,240
eaten too much on his

783
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,950
90th birthday.

784
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,520
He had abdominal pain,

785
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,430
nausea, vomiting

786
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,310
and fever that night.

787
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,350
We've done a check-up

788
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,720
and liver and gallbladder ultrasound.

789
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,430
[Biochemical Test Report]
The diagnosis is cholecystitis.

790
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,390
Gallbladder calculus.

791
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,230
Enough time for fasting
and water retention?

792
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,430
Why? Do you want a surgery?

793
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:21,950
The patient has had several episodes

794
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,870
of cholecystitis.

795
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,120
This is an acute episode.

796
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,200
If you're conservative,

797
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:27,600
it's too long

798
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,640
to administer antibiotics.

799
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:29,680
And most likely there will be

800
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,990
conditions of dysbiosis.

801
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:32,470
Let's do the surgery.

802
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,350
Settle it once and for all.

803
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:34,720
The surgery...

804
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:35,390
Don't worry.

805
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:37,390
Mr. Lin has done hundreds of

806
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,790
laparoscopic cholecystectomies.

807
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,790
He even did it

808
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,350
on an 84-year-old man last year.

809
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,790
He stood up
the first day after the surgery.

810
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,080
Thank you, doctors.

811
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,350
- Thank you.
- Please do.

812
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,270
There's no way to do this
laparoscopically.

813
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,560
Severe agglutination.

814
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,720
Too many calculi.

815
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:36,990
To be on the safe side,

816
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,310
forgo the lumpectomy.

817
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,520
Change to open surgical treatment.

818
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,240
Alright.

819
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,040
The organs are all stuck together.

820
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,340
I can barely see the greater omentum

821
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,600
and transverse colon.

822
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,240
I can't see the gallbladder at all.

823
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,470
Why is it so bad?

824
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:01,470
Separation first.

825
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:02,870
But,

826
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:04,800
the oedema of the intestinal tubes
is so severe.

827
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:05,720
If it breaks,

828
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,040
it'll be hard to sew up.

829
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,060
The old man is in his nineties.

830
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,950
These calculi are so hard.

831
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,760
If you try to take it out,

832
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,640
the end of the common bile duct

833
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,470
might be severely damaged.

834
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,950
A choledochoscope can break up

835
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,080
the stone and take it out.

836
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,200
Capable of removing stones

837
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,870
reaching secondary bile ducts.

838
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,430
No need.

839
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,790
This one doesn't work. Get another.

840
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,830
Get another.

841
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,430
Get another.

Dr. Zheng.

843
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,240
In response to your request,

844
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,200
the hospital has introduced
this new machine.

845
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,430
The fully digital large flatbed FD20.

846
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,120
1,125 milliamp

847
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,790
digital subtraction angiograph.

848
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:01,520
It's expensive.

849
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:03,760
Even changing a tube ball
costs thousands.

850
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:04,950
The hospital

851
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:05,720
has gone to great lengths

852
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,600
for our Interventional Department

853
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,200
Are you satisfied, Dr. Zheng?
