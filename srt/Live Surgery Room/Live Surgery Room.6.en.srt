00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,950
You're the most data-oriented person.

194
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,830
He came in first place

195
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,070
in anesthesiology

196
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,500
on that list you made.

197
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,520
Do you really need to fire him

198
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,520
for taking a ride?

199
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,560
And for bribery.

200
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,450
What, Mr. Lin?

201
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:50,880
Do you have proof?

202
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,120
Prove it,

203
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,550
and we'll deal with it
according to the rules.

204
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,950
I won't sign

205
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,950
without proof.

206
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,810
Mr. Lin.

207
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,230
Go wash your face.

208
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,710
Don't let the youngsters laugh at you.

209
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,800
Go prepare for the operation. I'm here.

210
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:13,710
Stop.

211
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:20,880
Mr. Lin.

212
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,160
Are you going to protect him?

213
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,430
Yes.

214
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,120
What if I decided to fire him?

215
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:27,880
We'll go together.

216
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,550
Please don't.

217
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,230
As Vice President,

218
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,430
if I can't dissuade

219
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,350
the President's insistence,

220
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,160
defend my colleagues'

221
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,280
legitimate rights and interests,

222
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,190
or call a halt

223
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,430
to the existing

224
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,520
absurd reforms,

225
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,000
what's the point of me

226
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,400
being the Vice President?

227
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:45,830
Good.

228
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,950
Present your resignation letter

229
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,710
with his.

230
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,070
Ms. Su.

231
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:56,830
Ms. Su.

232
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:02,920
Mr. Lin.

233
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,190
I'm not worth

234
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,160
all this.

235
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:11,950
She'll regret it.

236
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,080
What's going on?

237
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,120
The patient was vomiting at home.

238
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,000
He's getting a blood transfusion.

239
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:26,830
Mr. Pan?

240
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,160
Mr. Pan vomited blood in the afternoon.

241
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,000
C.T. shows

242
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,470
that it's due to cirrhosis of the liver.

243
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,830
I'm afraid of making a mistake,

244
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,680
so I asked you to come over.

245
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,520
Hemorrhagic shock.

246
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,230
Hepatitis B-related
decompensated cirrhosis.

247
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,120
Yes.

248
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,950
Also persistent ascites, pleural fluid,

249
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,120
and electrolyte metabolism disorder.

250
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,160
I saw he's had

251
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,040
a splenectomy

252
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,230
and portal vein dissection.

253
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:53,920
Yes.

254
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,400
In the ambulance,

255
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,950
we're going conservative.

256
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,070
Three sets
of intravenous hemostatic drugs

257
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,310
and oral ortho-renal ice saline.

258
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,590
Three sets of hemostatic drugs.

259
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,840
That's a lot.

260
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,680
They didn't dare to add more.

261
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,080
Not only may it be ineffective,

262
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,600
but it will also be even more difficult

263
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,430
if there are complications

264
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,320
such as cerebral

265
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,360
or cardiac infarction.

266
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,990
What else can we do now?

267
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,510
There are only two treatments.

268
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,120
One is splenectomy.

269
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,560
Mr. Pan has already had it.

270
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:18,710
The other one

271
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:19,360
is

272
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:19,790
TIPS.

273
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,080
TIPS?

274
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,920
It's an interventional operation.

275
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,470
Call Zheng Ren.

276
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,190
You're here.

277
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,560
Have a seat.

278
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,650
Start with the information.

279
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:49,880
The patient is Pan Shihai.

280
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,080
He vomited blood this morning.

281
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,680
Hepatitis B-related
decompensated cirrhosis.

282
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,880
He's had a splenectomy

283
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,120
and portal vein dissection.

284
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,950
[Hospitalization Records]

285
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,470
We are

286
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,230
recommending TIPS.

287
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,560
His cirrhosis

288
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,400
was caused by drinking.

289
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,230
Yes.

290
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,190
Dad,

291
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,920
why did you

292
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,080
pick cactus?

293
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,920
Because cactus

294
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,870
relieves me of stress.

295
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,120
Doctors

296
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,790
are very stressed.

297
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,750
We need to have all kinds
of ways to de-stress.

298
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,120
Some choose alcohol.

299
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,190
Some choose cigarettes.

300
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,470
Like Dad's teacher.

301
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,920
He loved wine.

302
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,320
When he was young,

303
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
he was a hard worker.

304
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,400
He operated every day and never rested.

305
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,400
Let me ask you one question.

306
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,160
Was Pan Shihai there

307
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,710
when Li Aifang was operated?

308
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,510
Yes.

309
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,920
What do you think, Zheng Ren?

310
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,560
Can you do this surgery?

311
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,320
For this surgery,

312
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,320
you'll be my assistant.

313
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:58,950
Me?

314
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,160
Why?

315
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,710
I guide you.

316
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:02,680
Try to learn something.

317
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:03,840
What?

318
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,120
Haven't you been

319
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,950
practicing interventions?

320
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:08,920
Who said that?

321
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,750
The computer records

322
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,680
in the virtual operating room.

323
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,230
What?

324
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,790
You dare to challenge yourself
on the computer

325
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,560
but not in the real world?

326
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,230
Why don't I dare?

327
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,790
I'll show you

328
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,640
that Su Yun is better

329
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:25,430
than Lin Ge

330
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,120
and that any surgery can be done

331
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:27,640
after I watch it once.

332
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,080
OK.

333
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,120
Prepare for the operation.

334
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,520
Yun.

335
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:42,860
Wait a minute.

336
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,330
What?

337
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,470
Are you really going to operate?

338
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,880
Are you afraid I won't make it?

339
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,360
I may not be able to use a scalpel,

340
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,690
but micro guidewire is not a problem.

341
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,710
Are you transferring
to the Interventional Department too?

342
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,990
I just want to do the surgery.

343
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,570
You know that.

344
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,600
I've always wanted to do surgery.

345
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,160
Okay.

346
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,360
Then just do it.

347
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,230
Zheng Ren is there for you.

348
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,620
Hua.

349
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,250
No wonder Lin Ge is angry with you.

350
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,510
Do you know

351
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,120
how humiliating your words are

352
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,120
for a doctor?

353
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,030
He feels humiliated

354
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,400
because he doesn't care
about the patients.

355
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,270
When the patient saved

356
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,510
by Zheng Ren is Mr. Pan,

357
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,600
will you still feel humiliated?

358
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,840
You'll only be grateful

359
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,030
and glad that he's here.

360
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,160
During TIPS,

361
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,840
once a patient

362
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,880
inhales vomited blood,

363
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,190
it can be fatal.

364
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,510
Let's be careful.

365
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,750
Jugular vein puncture.

366
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,750
Catheterization.

367
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,880
You can do it, right?

368
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,180
Don't worry.

369
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,320
I've done it many times.

370
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,300
His cirrhosis

371
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,160
was caused by drinking.

372
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,840
Yes.

373
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,410
Doctors

374
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,030
are stressed.

375
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,270
We need to have all kinds
of ways to de-stress.

376
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,640
Like Dad's teacher.

377
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,790
He loved wine.

378
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,750
He didn't have many good friends

379
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,470
or teachers.

380
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,880
We didn't deserve it.

381
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:20,320
Done.

382
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,370
Puncture needle.

383
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,550
I read about this procedure

384
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,720
in a textbook.

385
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,950

your father's retired

577
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,790
and doesn't care.

578
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,310
You're not here, either.

579
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,670
Haicheng Hospital has changed.

580
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,050
It's good that you're not here.

581
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,750
I'd be embarrassed

582
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,520
if you were here.

583
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,190
Bye.

584
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,680
Bu.

585
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,270
Hello, Ms. Su.

586
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:02,880
Hello.

587
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,700
Hua.

588
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,410
I heard that a dozen directors

589
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:09,910
along with Lin Ge

590
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:10,740
are pressurizing you.

591
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,520
What are you going to do now?

592
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:13,310
Don't worry.

593
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,080
Different emperors
have different ministers.

594
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,180
I'm prepared for this.

595
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,040
I've looked out

596
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,920
for good doctors before.

597
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,960
I just need to recruit new people.

598
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,810
But Lin Ge

599
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,150
has a lot of VIP clients.

600
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:21,920
So what?

601
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,150
Every hospital

602
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,230
has its own niche.

603
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,600
Since Mr. Pan retired,

604
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,400
Haicheng Hospital's orthopedics department
has been going down.

605
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,350
It's because it

606
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,480
doesn't have the unique skills anymore.

607
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,760
But now,

608
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,210
We have
late liver intervention embolization,

609
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:32,600
as well

610
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:32,960
as TIPS.

611
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,830
From now on, Haicheng Hospital

612
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,720
is going to be known
for its famous doctors.

613
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,120
Does Zheng Ren give you confidence?

614
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:38,870
Yes.

615
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,930
That's why

616
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:41,920
the Star Doctor Team exists.

617
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,660
[Resignation list]

618
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,710
I can talk to them.

619
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,870
Not all of them may stay,

620
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:14,740
- but at least...
- No need.

621
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,480
Just stall for a while.

622
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:18,670
Stall?

623
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,400
They quit a little early.

624
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:21,670
I haven't found

625
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,400
other candidates yet.

626
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,000
So,

627
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,350
stall for a while.

628
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,560
You want to fire them all?

629
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,870
That's not what I had in mind.

630
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,830
I've racked my brain

631
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,640
and referenced national
and international success stories

632
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,350
to make them competitive

633
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,830
instead of relying on their past credits

634
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,870
and waiting to retire.

635
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,230
This is the age

636
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,270
of transparent information
about applications.

637
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,230
If we don't keep up with the times

638
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,790
or make changes,

639
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,310
we are doomed to be out.

640
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,270
You're right.

641
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,670
So

642
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,440
I gave them a chance,

643
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,520
but they didn't appreciate it

644
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,830
and questioned my training of Zheng Ren.

645
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,810
Is Zheng Ren the one
they want to get rid of?

646
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,230
No.

647
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,230
It's me.

648
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,560
You still

649
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:31,920
won't give up on the hospital?

650
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,680
I'm not someone

651
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,750
who runs away from things.

652
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,440
From the day I decided to reform,

653
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,230
I knew

654
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,670
these old staff would cause trouble.

655
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,440
I trained Zheng Ren

656
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,190
and fully supported
the Interventional Department

657
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,190
for this day.

658
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,270
As long as Zheng Ren is here,

659
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,350
I'm not afraid of them making trouble

660
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,310
or leaving.

661
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,670
Speaking of which,

662
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,150
I'd like to thank you

663
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:03,600
for giving me

664
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,520
such a good student.

665
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:16,440
Hua.

666
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,190
Zheng Ren is Chen Miao's son.

667
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,080
