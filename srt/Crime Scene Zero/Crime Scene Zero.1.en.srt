00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:25,900
YEONJIDOL VILLAGE, MADVILLE TOWN
LUNACY DISTRICT, MANIAC PROVINCE

3
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,288
Seriously?

4
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,249
There's a psychiatric hospital
in a place like this?

5
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:46,212
It's supposed to be somewhere
near Yeonjidol Mountain,

6
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,007
-so it should be around… Hey!
-What?

7
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,550
Over there.

8
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,510
Oh, I see it.

9
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,221
Dang.

10
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,432
I think that's it.

11
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,060
Hey! What's that?

12
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,269
What is this?

13
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,774
What on earth?

14
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,067
Isn't that for a shamanic rite?

15
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,569
What's that doing here?

16
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,154
It's kind of creepy.

17
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,448
Hey, this doesn't feel right.

18
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,741
Let's just take a look.

19
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,242
Are you sure?

20
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,119
DO NOT ENTER

21
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,412
Hey, you open it.

22
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,581
Oh man.

23
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,423
Looks like it's been closed for ages.

24
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,008
Everything looks so worn down.

25
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,261
-What if it's really haunted?
-Don't say stuff like that.

26
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,014
Hey, what's that?

27
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,183
-What now? What is it?
-Look.

28
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:42,769
It's a ghost!

29
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,562
-That's really a ghost, no?
-Wait.

30
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,856
No, that's a real person!

31
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,447
There's been a murder.

32
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,033
This is Crime Scene.

33
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,953
One detective

34
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:02,580
and five suspects.

35
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,668
Everyone takes on a role and an alibi

36
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,295
in this role-playing deduction game.

37
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:15,009
The real culprit is the only suspect
who can lie.

38
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,930
To clear their names

39
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,015
and to find the real culprit,

40
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,977
everyone must become
both suspect and detective

41
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,396
at the same time.

42
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,483
The clues point to the truth

43
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,902
and unexpected twists.

44
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:38,366
Will they succeed in catching the culprit?

45
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:45,999

YEONJIDOL AND BANJIDOL BECOME ONE AGAIN!
THE HERO OF YEONJIDOL, PARK VILLAGE HEAD!

50
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,983
Wow.

51
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,777
Man, the trip over here…

52
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,363
YEONJIDOL VILLAGE CODE OF CONDUCT

53
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,657
…was really rough.

54
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,910
Why did they build

55
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:25,496
such a big psychiatric hospital
in the middle of nowhere?

56
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,333
Gosh, it looks creepy.

57
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,085
Oh dear.

58
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,172
Wait.

59
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,673
What's that?

60
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:42,138
How did a body end up
on the power lines outside the building?

61
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,103
A BODY HANGING FROM THE POWER LINES
OUTSIDE AN ABANDONED HOSPITAL

62
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:56,152
MURDER IN THE ABANDONED HOSPITAL I

63
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,571
I saw the crime scene photos
before coming here,

64
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,157
but it's so much worse in person.

65
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:06,454
So this place used to be a hospital,

66
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,165
-but now it's totally shut down.
-Jang Detective.

67
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,083
Hello.

68
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,168
-Hey!
-I'm Kang Minhee, the assistant detective.

69
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,419
ASSISTANT DETECTIVE
KANG MINHEE

70
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,004
-The assistant detective.
-Yes.

71
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:15,964
The AD.

72
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,925
-Yes, the AD.
-Great to meet you.

73
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:22,762
Looks like our very first case together
is going to be a tough one.

74
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,555
-Are you up for the challenge?
-Of course.

75
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,225
-I have nerves of steel.
-I see.

76
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,227
-I'll take your word for it.
-Thank you.

77
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,438
Now, I need an overview of today's case.

78
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,524
-I've compiled everything for you.
-Okay.

79
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,692
CASE FILE DELIVERED

80
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,193
All right, then.

81
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,697
Let's start by interviewing
all the suspects.

82
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,283
-I'll bring everyone here.
-Okay. Thanks.

83
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:49,080
The victim is Jang Je-in,
a 46-year-old female.

84
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:52,417
She was the director
of Yeonjidol Psychiatric Hospital,

85
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,710
which opened in 2006.

86
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:57,797
She disappeared in 2013
when the hospital shut down

87
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,968
and was found dead this evening,
hanging by the hospital's exterior wall.

88
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,554
The cause of death is severe blood loss.

89
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:10,226
The estimated time of death
is between 10:20 p.m. and 11:30 p.m.

90
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,771
The report came in at 11:35 p.m.

91
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,483
-What the heck is that?
-What on earth happened?

92
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,568
What is that?

93
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:23,072
How could something like this
happen in our village?

94
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,240
What the heck?

95
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,702
-Je-in.
-How distasteful.

96
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,537
-Could this be…
-The gods have been angered.

97
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,039
-Je-in.
-Oh dear.

98
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,708
Who could've done such a terrible thing?

99
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,836
What a mess. I don't have time for this.

100
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:45,136
-What's the matter with this guy?
-Why is he…

101
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,512
Je-in.

102
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,513
WHAT IS HIS CONNECTION TO THE VICTIM?

103
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,265
-Do you know him?
-All right.

104
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,977
I know this must be
a lot to take in for all of you,

105
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,521
not to mention the shock.

106
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,275
But as you can see,

107
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,944
there's been a murder,

108
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,448
and the five of you here

109
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:09,619
-have been identified as suspects.
-The Goddess of Birth is furious.

110
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,246
Her spirit will never be at peace.

111
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,331
ONE OF THEM IS THE MURDERER

112
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,333
As you can see,

113
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,086
this scene of the murder
is quite grotesque.

114
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:21,506
-We can't help but wonder
-How did she get up there?

115
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:25,218
why the murder took place up there,
of all places.

116
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:28,471
Let's go over the details together.

117
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,847
Please come with me.

118
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,141
RELOCATING FOR QUESTIONING

119
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,353
Hey, AD! Bring that body down.

120
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,729
This way, please.

121
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,524
-Oh my, I'm in Park Village Head's room.
-Thank you for having us.

122
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:40,900
DIGGING INTO THE SUSPECTS

123
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:43,277
First suspect, Park Village Head.

124
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,071
A 60-year-old male.

125
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,073
The head of Yeonjidol Village.

126
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,409
Second suspect, Jang Cousin.

127
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,577
A 51-year-old male.

128
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,831
The victim's cousin
and owner of a mannequin factory.

129
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,958
Third suspect, Kim Handsome.

130
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,960
A 32-year-old male.

131
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,087
A medical sales rep.

132
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,047
Fourth suspect, An Doctor.

133
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,841
A 46-year-old female.

134
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,426
A house call physician.

135
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,928
Fifth suspect, Park Shaman.

136
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,763
A 46-year-old female.

137
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,390
The village shaman.

138
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,518
I was driving over here,

139
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:19,730
thinking it was some backwoods village,
but then I realized it was Yeonjidol.

140
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:23,109
-This place is known for honey, right?
-That's right.

141
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,527
All thanks to our Village Head.

142
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,988
-Of course.
-We owe it all to him.

143
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:30,783
I also saw those big banners
on the way here.

144
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,453
Is there some event happening?

145
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,539
Our village is expanding tomorrow

146
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:40,251
by officially merging
with Banjidol Village.

147
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,795
It's a doubly special day

148
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,255
because Park Village Head

149
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:47,508
will be announced
as the first head of the joint village.

150
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,635
He may be the first,

151
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,305
-but he'll likely serve for life.
-Oh, stop it.

152
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:53,723
What a suck-up.

153
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,058
Okay.

154
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,310
Why are you crying?

155
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,811
Now, then.

156
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,022
Let's start with you,
Mr. Park Village Head.

157
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,649
What's the nature of your relationship
with the victim, Jang Je-in?

158
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:08,112
Ms. Jang built the psychiatric hospital
and she was the director.

159
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,157
She should've taken responsibility
and seen things through,

160
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,951
but she disappeared five years ago.

161
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,120
-And now…
-It's been in ruins for a while.

162
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,497
-Outsiders think it's haunted,
-Right.

163
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,543
-so they've been coming to check it out.
-It's true that ghosts roam those halls.

164
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:26,380
Our Mr. Village Head has been
so stressed over that.

165
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,424
He's always working

166
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,427
incredibly hard for our village,

167
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,471
and that's why he's getting
those circles under his eyes.

168
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,932
Are you the deputy head, then?

169
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:40,645
Oh, no. Well, I'm the cousin of Je-in,

170
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,689
-the poor girl who's hanging up there.
-Is that so?

171
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,316
What do you do for a living?

172
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,361
Well, at the moment,

173
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:52,365
-I just run a small mannequin factory.
-A mannequin factory?

174
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,491
I see.

175
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,201
Next up… Oh boy.

176
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,495
That outfit's too much.
Let me come back to you.

177
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,580
-Sorry?
-An Doctor, is it?

178
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,582
Oh, well…

179
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,710
As you can tell by the name, I'm a doctor.

180
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:08,047
I mainly make house calls
for VIP patients.

181
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,841
-I've never seen her around.
-Me neither.

182
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,261
I'm guessing you're not from around here.

183
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,470
Yes, she's an outsider.

184
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,431
Wait, that thing on your wrist

185
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,517
doesn't look like your typical jewelry.

186
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,977
My wrist? Oh, this.

187
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,311
Do you mean this?

188
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,729
-Yes.
-She has a tattoo too?

189
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,315
Do you know what "savior" means?

190
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,400
Did you say "swiper"?

191
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,776
What is she on about?

192
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,653
You mean you swiped the bracelet?

193
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,198
"Savior" means someone who saves others.

194
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,285
That's what my patients call me.

195
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,745
They call me their savior.

196
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,832
Then what's the nature
of your relationship with the victim?

197
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,875
Why did you end up becoming a suspect?

198
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,212
I'm not entirely sure why I'm here either,

199
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,882
but we were colleagues
back when we worked in Seoul.

200
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,468
Oh, so you two worked
in the medical field together?

201
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,845
I see. Well noted.

202
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,600
My hunch says
there was long-standing resentment

203
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,394
from bullying or workplace harassment

204
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,354
that eventually turned
into a fatal grudge.

205
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:10,318
Okay, then.
Jeez, that outfit really is bothersome.

206
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,445
One wrong move and you'll get possessed.

207
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,196
I thought so too. I'm on my guard.

208
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,573
-Ms. Park Shaman?
-Yes.

209
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:19,452
I'm Park Shaman, serving the gods
and spirits as the shaman of this village.

210
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,078
Since you're here…

211
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,374
If you need anything resolved…

212
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,335
I thought it was a talisman,
not a business card.

213
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:31,505
Connections here in the mortal realm
are formed for a reason.

214
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,258
What was your relationship
with the victim?

215
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,677
We went to high school together.

216
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,638
-High school?
-You know,

217
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:43,142
this is a small village, so basically
everyone attended Yeonjidol High School.

218
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,268
I see.

219
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,646
To be honest, you're one of the people

220
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,815
I felt that didn't quite belong
in this village, Mr. Kim Handsome.

221
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,068
Could you introduce yourself?

222
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,570
Oh dear. He seems to be
beside himself with grief.

223
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,447
Are you really sad?

224
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,240
You're not laughing, are you?

225
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,241
I'm…

226
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,703
-I'm actually Je-in's boyfriend.
-What?

227
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,330
-Her boyfriend?
-What?

228
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,790
-Boyfriend?
-She sure got around.

229
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,542
I'm her cousin and even I had no idea.

230
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,796
We were in love with each other
for a very long time.

231
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:15,633
Now that I'm faced with
such an unexpected, horrible event,

232
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,426
I don't know what to do.

233
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,303
What do you do for a living?

234
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:23,140
Well, I'm a medical sales rep.

235
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,101
-Medical sales?
-I see.

236
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,145
Is that how you met the victim?
Through work?

237
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:32,191
-I guess, but not exactly.
-While you were selling your products?

238
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:35,569
What sort of medical equipment
would a psychiatric hospital have needed?

239
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,948
Not much, I'm guessing.
There's probably more to it than that.

240
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,659
The victim was 46 years old.

241
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:44,704
-If you don't mind, how old are you?
-I'm 32.

242
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:45,913
-What?
-What?

243
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,124
-You're 32?
-See what I mean?

244
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,667
-Why is everyone so shocked?
-Goodness.

245
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,836
-You're just a baby.
-He clearly had ulterior motives.

246
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,296
Arrest him now, Mr. Detective!

247
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,924
Age is nothing but a number
when it comes to love.

248
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,468
What matters is how the couple
feels about each other.

249
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,137
I don't trust outsiders.

250
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,141
No one who lives
in a small village like this

251
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,227
would be capable of anything like murder.

252
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,520
We're all gentle folks.

253
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:13,065
-Exactly.
-The killer must be one of the outsiders.

254
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,234
Of course,
Mr. Village Head is absolutely right!

255
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:19,155
That kind of unsavory business
would never happen in our village!

256
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,615
With that being said,
stagnant water tends to rot.

257
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,952
What the hell does that mean?

258
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,622
What's gotten into you, Mole-rye?

259
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,833
Come on, Cousin.

260
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,710
-"Mole-rye"?
-Who's Mole-rye?

261
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,421
-What's with the old-fashioned nickname?
-Who is that?

262
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:40,593
-Is that what she's called when possessed?
-We all grew up together, you know.

263
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,053
-It's just a nickname I gave her.
-Right.

264
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,680
-We were never that close.
-All right.

265
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:49,393
So is it true that Ms. Jang came back here
for the first time in five years?

266
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,979
-Why'd she suddenly come back?
-Five years sounds about right.

267
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,607
-Did you all know she was back?
-Did you know, Cousin?

268
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,777
I think I heard that she was coming back
or that she had come back to the village.

269
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,321
I knew such rumors
were flying around, that's all.

270
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,324
-Talks that someone had seen her.
-I heard she was back after five years

271
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,576
from one of my regular clients,
the manager of Yeonjidol Hotel.

272
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,206
I heard the day before
that she was staying there.

273
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,793
What about you, Mr. Kim Handsome?

274
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,377
-Did you stay with her?
-Were you perhaps…

275
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,837
He must have!

276
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,048
No, I hadn't seen her
for a long time either.

277
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,886
-What kind of boyfriend is that?
-We both missed each other desperately,

278
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:27,640
but life got in the way at every turn,

279
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,433
so it had been a while.

280
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,812
All right, so the time of death

281
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:36,982
is estimated to be
between 10:20 p.m. and 11:30 p.m.

282
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,653
Please tell me what you were doing
and where you were during that time.

283
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:41,737
Mr. Kim Handsome?

284
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,948
Doing some murdering, no doubt!

285
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,951
What are you talking about?
I was at the hotel.

286
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,995
I only got here around 11:40 p.m.,

287
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,208
which is when I first heard the news
and broke into pieces.

288
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,377
Why are you staring at me?

289
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,755
-You've been bothering me, Ms. An Doctor.
-Have I?

290
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,967
Stop trying to seduce me.
Move your leg over to that side.

291
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,093
This is not okay.

292
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,220
-Hang on, Mr. Kim Handsome.
-Please move your leg.

293
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:09,139
I should perform a rite for him.
That's like a disease, you know.

294
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,726
Okay, I feel a lot better now.
Do you know how uncomfortable I was?

295
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,687
-All right, just keep talking.
-Women. How typical.

296
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,648
I keep getting the feeling
he might've been a patient here.

297
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,278
-Okay, next is Ms. Park… Park Shaman.
-Park Shaman, yes.

298
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,864
Where would a servant of the gods be?

299
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,908
-I was praying at the shrine.
-All right.

300
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,743
What about you, Mr. Jang Cousin?

301
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:34,039
I was just at home,
having some soju with kimchi.

302
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,624
How come?

303
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,918
Why were you home
when we had the eve festival going on?

304
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,880
-I don't really like crowds, and--
-But you said you were my right-hand man.

305
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,006
How strange.

306
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,340
You said so yourself.

307
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,967
And you, Ms. An Doctor?

308
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,177
I was tending to a VIP patient.

309
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,263
-A regular patient, I'm guessing?
-Yes.

310
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,765
-What about you, Mr. Park Village Head?
-Today was the eve festival,

311
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,934
-and tomorrow's the inauguration.
-Of course.

312
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,812
There was a singing contest
and everything,

313
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,856
so I was very busy
running around everywhere.

314
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,524
I can't even recall what I did.

315
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:05,404
The four of you told me
the specific location you were in,

316
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:09,825
-but Mr. Village Head's the only one who…
-Yes, I have a clear alibi.

317
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,703
-Unclear, you mean.
-Not clear. Unclear.

318
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,705
If our Mr. Village Head says it's clear,
it's clear!

319
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,124
"Running around everywhere"
doesn't sound so clear.

320
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,376
Jeez.

321
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,630
You are all suspects in a murder case,

322
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,716
so you have to find out
who the real culprit is

323
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,636
if you want to clear your names.

324
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:33,307
First, we'll spend some time in pairs

325
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,685
to examine the crime scene.

326
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,397
There's so much
to unpack and dig into here.

327
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,816
Now, let's begin.

328
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,068
Let's go.

329
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:51,367

00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,364
Ms. Park, could I ask you a favor?

345
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,782
You want me to perform a rite for you?

346
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,450
No, no matter what happens,

347
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,285
please don't fall for me.

348
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,539
Have you lost your mind? Unbelievable.

349
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,290
Look at you, all excited.

350
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,918
We don't have much time. Hurry.

351
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,086
Goodness.

352
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,671
TEAM 3: JANG DETECTIVE & PARK VILLAGE HEAD

353
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,214
I must say, this is a lovely village.

354
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,091
VILLAGE ENTRANCE

355
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,261
The village had an eerie vibe.

356
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:57,349
There were a couple of big banners
about an upcoming event.

357
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,269
You know how some villages
have something like a motto?

358
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,564
They're usually simple,
like, "Live righteously."

359
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:07,609
But theirs was more like, "You need to
do this if you want to live here."

360
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,863
Such a code could make the village
more hostile and wary

361
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,906
of anyone and anything
coming from the outside.

362
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,116
DO NOT TRUST ANYONE

363
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,286
Finally, she's down.

364
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,290
My Je-in,
you must've been in so much pain.

365
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,751
-Let's see. Oh gosh.
-Goodness gracious.

366
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,837
What the heck?
She's been completely butchered.

367
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,424
Jeez, seriously.
Who did this to you, Je-in?

368
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:33,052
Oh my. Hang on, is that a stab wound?

369
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:36,180
There's a deep cut
right here in the middle.

370
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,682
Doesn't look like a knife wound.

371
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,017
Oh jeez.

372
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,145
The killer really did a number on her.

373
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,023
My goodness, what's this?

374
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:49,610
Did she get struck in the head?
Or was this from a fall?

375
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,446
Wait a minute,
there's a cut on her arm too.

376
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,241
-Her left arm is almost cut off.
-Just one arm.

377
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,452
How did the body end up there though?

378
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,247
Could she have fallen from the rooftop
after a struggle with her killer

379
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,083
and ended up getting caught
on those wires?

380
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,876
Up there, you know?

381
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,003
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

382
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,048
I'm going to catch this heartless killer,
no matter what.

383
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,927
Je-in couldn't have done something
so terrible to deserve that.

384
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,388
I'm sure someone
just got the wrong idea about her.

385
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,517
Maybe I'll find evidence
of any misunderstandings in her office.

386
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,853
This place is caked with dust.

387
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,232
SIGNS OF ABANDONMENT
FOUND EVERYWHERE IN THE BUILDING

388
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,239
An envelope.

389
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,243
"Notice of Termination."

390
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,912
She was fired
from the department of psychiatry

391
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,580
in April 2005?

392
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,749
For incompatible values?

393
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,459
Oh, she was fired
from Illyu University Hospital.

394
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,669
HOW DARE THE LIKES OF YOU FIRE ME?

395
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,171
JANG JE-IN WAS FIRED
FROM ILLYU UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL?

396
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,132
Je-in must've been mad about that.

397
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,300
What's this?

398
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,219
JANG JE-IN'S WEDDING PHOTO

399
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,596
Oh, is this the guy
she divorced back then?

400
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,890
Oh, paperwork.

401
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:09,189
"Subject of investigation, Park Shaman.
Occupation, shaman."

402
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,525
"Family includes Park Father,
a free spirit,

403
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,318
Na Mother, and Park Brother."

404
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,736
So she has a younger brother.

405
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,197
NAME: PARK BROTHER
MEDICAL CONDITION: CONGENITAL BLINDNESS

406
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,497
"An Doctor, orthopedics."

407
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,332
She applied for a job here?

408
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,794
"Podunk Middle School, Podunk High School,
Podunk Medical School."

409
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,923
Employment agreement
between Jang Je-in and An Doctor.

410
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,844
"Must obey all orders
of Director Jang Je-in."

411
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,013
"Forbidden from going out about
in the village."

412
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:44,558
A monthly salary of only 1.6 million won?
She's a totally broke doctor.

413
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,768
NURSES' STATION

414
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:47,978
Wait, what?

415
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:53,275
An Doctor used to work here? What?

416
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:57,070
There's a nameplate with An Doctor's name
in the nurses' station!

417
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,114
Did she work here?

418
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,200
An Doctor.

419
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,829
"Treatment Log."

420
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:09,625
"Applied dressing, bruising, antibiotic,
put a cast, faking illness."

421
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:14,630
She doesn't seem successful enough
to be wearing all that Gucci.

422
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,009
Let's look at the charts.

423
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,677
ADMISSION AND DISCHARGE LOG

424
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,346

What? Kim Handsome was here too.

430
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,149
NAME: KIM HANDSOME
DEPARTMENT: PSYCHIATRY

431
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,485
5TH FLOOR
ROOM 501, ROOM 502

432
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:40,113
Something about this place
always brings me to tears.

433
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,198
ROOM 501

434
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:45,077
My heart started to ache

435
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,871
the moment I went up to the fifth floor.

436
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,082
I couldn't stay there for long.

437
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,670
WHAT IS HIS TEAR-JERKING STORY?

438
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,799
How did the culprit
get up and down the hospital?

439
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,593
There's a flight of stairs.

440
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,595
Oh, there's an elevator too.

441
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,138
ELEVATOR

442
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,183
Does this elevator work?

443
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,061
It should work when I press this.

444
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,896
THE ELEVATOR IS NOT WORKING

445
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,315
The doors don't even open.

446
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,569
SIDE OF THE HOSPITAL BUILDING

447
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,573

YEONJIDOL GAS STATION
SELF-SERVICE

451
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,386
Ms. Shaman, you set this up, right?

452
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,972
Yes, with my blood, sweat, and tears.

453
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,932
What kind of rite was it for?

454
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,727
Would you even know if I told you?

455
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,521
I can just feel
there's something suspicious here.

456
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:59,609
I've never seen this car around here.
She drove a Mercedes, did she?

457
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,153
It's open.

458
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,821
AN DOCTOR'S CAR
PARKED IN FRONT OF THE HOSPITAL

459
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,949
Isn't this a Botte bag?
These are expensive.

460
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,453
INSIDE THE LUXURY DESIGNER BAG

461
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,541

AN DOCTOR'S PHONE

464
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,011
What's this?

465
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,846
A PLAYLIST OF SONGS?

466
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:30,974
"Five-minute Meditation"?

467
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:34,895
You are the best.

468
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,731
You have the hands of a god.

469
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,442
You are your patients' salvation.

470
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,362
This is something only you can do.

471
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,073
You are their savior.

472
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,326
"Savior"?

473
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,123
What's this?

474
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,125
"Jang Je-in." What's this doing in here?

475
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,126
JANG JE-IN'S EMPLOYEE ID

476
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,128
Having the victim's item in possession

477
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,798
makes you the prime suspect.

478
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,677
Jang Je-in's ID found in An Doctor's car.

479
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,054

A MYSTERY VIP?

486
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,532
-I'M RUNNING LATE DUE TO THE LANDSLIDE.
-UNDERSTOOD.

487
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,908
I happened to find

488
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,619
a key piece of evidence.

489
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,748

495
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,595

00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,256
-Detective!
-Yes?

504
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,049
Can you come here for a second?

505
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,052
-I'm useless with computers!
-Sure.

506
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:34,139
-Man, this lady…
-Yes?

507
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,932
-She's… You know.
-What is it?

508
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,476
DID HE FIND SOMETHING BIG?

509
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,393

00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,042
What's this? A tripod?

519
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,127
A tripod.

520
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,337
IV POLE

521
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,172
I think I've dug up
everything there is on An Doctor.

522
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,215
PROUD

523
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,591
Just you wait.

524
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,176
I'm going to end you.

525
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,345
I'll just…

526
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:16,223
YEONJIDOL HOTEL

527
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,475
So this is the front desk.

528
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:19,643
YEONJIDOL HOTEL LOBBY

529
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,939
HOTEL GUEST LIST, ROOM KEYS

530
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,440
JANG JE-IN'S HOTEL ROOM
HANDSOME'S HOTEL ROOM

531
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,235
I find Kim Handsome suspicious.

532
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,278
He's too young to be saying

533
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,782
he's experienced love so deep
that no one would understand.

534
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,492
And he was so empathic about it.

535
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,953
In cases like this, it's always
the boyfriend that's most suspicious.

536
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,958
Handsome is way too suspicious.

537
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,835
A Killer's Mind.

538
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,630
That's when I got the feeling,

539
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,216
"He's someone who'd kill her
if he can't have her."

540
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,802
"TILL DEATH DO US PART"
TRUE LOVE OVERCOMES SUCH LIMITS

541
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:54,886
He's the worst.

542
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,305
Was he planning to confess his love?

543
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,727
Oh jeez, that scared me. What's that?

544
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,397
Who carries around a medical saw?

545
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,111
Oh, medical supplies.

546
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,362
MEDICAL SUPPLY BAG

547
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:13,905
Ethanol,

548
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,407
hydrogen peroxide,

549
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,576
formalin.

550
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,123
Formalin? I've heard of it before.

551
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,293
KIM HANDSOME'S WALLET FOUND

552
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,128
JANG JE-IN, KIM HANDSOME

553
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,379
My goodness, what a romantic.

554
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,755
There's a photo.

555
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,174
What's this?

556
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,594
There's something here.

557
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,971
A MYSTERIOUS SELFIE?

558
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,224
What's this?

559
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,185
YEONJIDOL HOTEL RECEIPTS

560
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,563
Dating back to 2014, 2015, 2017,

561
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,398
and 2018.

562
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:52,319
This guy's a total lunatic.

563
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:56,239
Those receipts were actually
from when Je-in was gone.

564
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,700
Why was he here when she wasn't?

565
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,954
KIM HANDSOME'S SUITCASE

566
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,500
Was he in the hospital?

567
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:08,918
SELFIES TAKEN IN THE HOSPITAL

568
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,337
Looks like a hospital.

569
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:14,924
What's this?

570
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,676
"Seoul District Court Ruling"?

571
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,345
"Kim Handsome, unlawful confinement."

572
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,679
Oh jeez.

573
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:22,307
What's this now?

574
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,354
SCRAPBOOK

575
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,688
"April 1, 2009."

576
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:29,814
I MET HER FOR THE FIRST TIME

577
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:30,899
THE KISS SHE LEFT ME, MWAH♡

578
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,192
That's so creepy.

579
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,277
What's this?

580
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,322
"The moment I met you, I was born again."

581
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,742
He did seem a bit stalkerish.

582
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,410
THE SWEETNESS OF OUR LOVE
WILL LAST FOREVER

583
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,037
I think this love was one-sided.

584
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,873
Was Handsome really her boyfriend?

585
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,334
WERE THEY REALLY IN A RELATIONSHIP?

586
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,255
What? There's no ring in this box.

587
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,347
Oh my gosh!

588
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,433
Oh my gosh!

589
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,811
What's wrong with you?

590
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:12,482
You opened the door yourself, didn't you?
Why act all scared?

591
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,859
I can't do this anymore.

592
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,445
That's too much!

593
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,989
That freaked me out.

594
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,910
IN THE CLOSET

595
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:27,330
IS A MYSTERIOUS MANNEQUIN

596
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:31,167
For goodness' sake. I hate this.

597
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,713
Wait, what's this?

598
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,883
SITE OF EVE FESTIVAL IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL

599
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:40,593
What's this?

600
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,763
It's Village Head's phone.

601
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,975
"Kim Village, youth association leader"?

602
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,769
"Mr. Village Head, where did you go?"

603
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,439
He didn't stick around?
Where was he off to?

604
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,691
Where did he go?

605
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:57,318
Park Village Head was the one person

606
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,613
I had implicit trust in
among my fellow villagers.

607
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:04,492
But this time, I'll have to
take a look in his place.

608
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,327
THE HEAD OF A VILLAGE KNOWN FOR ITS HONEY

609
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,037
BEEKEEPING SUPPLIES

610
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,416
I just knew
there was something fishy about him.

611
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:14,085
He still has these at his house?

612
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,628
SIGNS USED TO PROTEST
AGAINST THE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

613
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,547
Why was he so against it?

614
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,882
THE NEWS IS MAKING MY FISTS SHAKE!

615
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:22,927
Well, looks like Park Village Head
owns plenty of sharp things too.

616
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,262
A SMORGASBORD OF WEAPONS

617
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:26,973
Let's check out his room.

618
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,643
Beekeeping, honey,

619
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,854
several awards of appreciation.

620
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:33,897
AWARD OF MERIT

621
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,023
AWARD OF APPRECIATION

622
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,817
PARK VILLAGE HEAD'S BEEKEEPING BUSINESS
CONTRIBUTED TO THE GROWTH OF THE VILLAGE

623
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,527
AWARD OF APPRECIATION

624
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,363
This must be his mother.

625
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,073
A PHOTO WITH HIS MOTHER WHEN HE WAS YOUNG?

626
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,784
Is there something more to this too?

627
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:46,785
YEONJIDOL NEWS

628
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,661
He was suspicious from the start,

629
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,872
going on and on
about fairness and whatnot.

630
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,499
"EVERYONE WILL BE EQUALLY PROSPEROUS
IN MY VILLAGE."

631
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,256
A NEW ITEM DISCOVERED IN THE CLOSET

632
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,382
What's this?

633
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,384
This guy went to college?

634
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,803
ILLYU UNIVERSITY VARSITY JACKET

635
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:13,019
What kind of college graduate
spells "coming soon" as "comeing sun"?

636
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,521
ENGLISH SKILLS OF A GRADUATE OF ILLYU,
A TOP-TIER UNIVERSITY?

637
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:15,730
"Comeing sun"?

638
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,528
-What are you up to?
-It's none of your business, okay?

639
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,154
I'm heading to the mannequin factory.

640
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,572
What for?

641
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,032
Why would you go there?

642
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,826
MANNEQUIN FACTORY

643
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,912
MANNEQUIN FACTORY RUN BY JANG COUSIN

644
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:36,084
Is he making mannequins in this factory
or breaking them apart?

645
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,128
Who even uses mannequins these days?

646
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:43,800
Why would he insist on running
that mannequin factory in this village

647
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,678
right in front of the abandoned hospital?

648
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,349
He could've easily killed her with these.

649
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,226
(WHAM)

650
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,523
"Sales ledger by year."

651
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,191
YEAR, REVENUE, EXPENSES, NET PROFIT

652
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,694
I see he was about to
go out of business, huh?

653
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,404
SHOULD I SHUT IT DOWN…?

654
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,157
"Payment Past Due Letter."

655
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,077
20 MILLION WON OVERDUE

656
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,370
He was drowning in debt.

657
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,083
ANOTHER ITEM FOUND IN ANOTHER DRAWER

658
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,252
"Leak Test Report."

659
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,046
So the mannequin factory…

660
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,633
It seems there was a leak

661
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,760
in the hospital.

662
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,889
So there was a leak in the hospital.

663
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,141
What's this?

664
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,728
"Real Estate Sales Agreement."

665
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:39,147
I see he was trying to buy the hospital.

666
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,942
NAME OF THE SELLER: ?
NAME OF PURCHASER: JANG COUSIN

667
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,781
Oh jeez! That scared me.

668
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,658
INSIDE THE MANNEQUIN'S HEAD

669
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,743
What's this?

670
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,912
"Viagura."

671
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,580
Why are they all wet?

672
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,123
THE PILLS ARE WET FOR SOME REASON?

673
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,959
OTHER SIDE OF THE FACTORY

674
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,253
JANG COUSIN'S TINY ROOM

675
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,130
So he did scarf down some kimchi.

676
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,758
DOES THIS MATCH HIS ALIBI TESTIMONY?

677
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,469
JANG COUSIN'S PHONE

678
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,638
"Don't contact me. You piss me off."

679
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:12,805
JANG JE-IN

680
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:16,726
He didn't say anything about
exchanging texts with her.

681
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:19,187
That's right, Je-in's family
was really well-off.

682
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,272
JANG JE-IN'S HOUSE
JANG COUSIN'S HOUSE

683
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:23,983
JANG COUSIN'S FATHER
JANG TROUBLEMAKER

684
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,944
He looks just like his father.

685
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:30,073
Family and Inheritance Law? What's this?

686
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,660
"Will."

687
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,662
A WILL?

688
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:40,625
His father didn't get any inheritance
because he was disowned.

689
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,836
I found a goldmine of clues.

690
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,051
AN EXPERIENCED INVESTIGATOR
IMMEDIATELY CHECKS THE CUSHION

691
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,805
"Waiver."

692
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,684
"If I can't repay the money…"

693
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,769
What's this about both eyes and kidneys?

694
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,814
He pledges to compensate
by forfeiting body parts?

695
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,607
He must've been under a lot of stress.

696
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,526
SHAMAN'S SHRINE, SHAMAN'S ROOM

697
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:09,946
I should go through Shaman's room too.

698
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:13,074
So this is a real shrine. Goodness.

699
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:16,869
She's worshipping every god there is,
from Buddha to the Great Jade Emperor.

700
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,496
ALL SORTS OF GODS IN ONE PLACE

701
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,123
Oh boy.

702
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,625
PARK SHAMAN'S SHRINE

703
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,960
People usually hide things in…

704
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,586
Oh, look. There's a safe.

705
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,964
SAFE

706
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:30,967
This safe is… Wait, 1991?

707
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:34,220
COULD THAT BE THE PASSCODE?

708
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:36,806
Hey, it's open.

709
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,016
SAFE OPEN

710
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,726
I opened the safe.

711
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:44,063
-Hey, Ms. Park Shaman.
-Yes?

712
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,149
I opened your safe.

713
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,443
What? How did you figure out the passcode?

714
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,111
You have a lot of gold bars in here.

715
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:53,156
-Hey! Don't touch my money!
-Oh my.

716
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:54,657
What's this, a ledger?

717
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,617
PARK SHAMAN'S LEDGER

718
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,244
I see it has her clients' information.

719
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:02,206
Why did the total amount go down
from 500 million won to 300?

720
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:08,463
What's this? "First eye transplant surgery
including optic nerve

721
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,214
successfully performed in the US"?

722
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,800
JOHNS HOPKANGS UNIV.'S SUCCESS
IN EYE AND OPTIC NERVE TRANSPLANT SURGERY

723
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,762
"Huge waiting list
despite a 500-million-won price tag."

724
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,560
This is…

725
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:27,440
AN EARTHENWARE POT
IN FRONT OF THE BUDDHA STATUE

726
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,821
What's this supposed to be?

727
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,450
These are earphones.

728
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,993
Jeez. What's this now?

729
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,161
WORN CLOTHING

730
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,287
Seriously, what is this?

731
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,371
PARK SHAMAN'S ROOM

732
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,040
This lady, I swear…

733
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,170
Wait.

734
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,631
What's this photo?

735
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:54,092
There's a kid who's visually impaired.

736
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,676
A VISUALLY IMPAIRED CHILD?

737
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,601
Go High Shaman's Secret Book of Rites.

738
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:08,523
I guess shamans have to
learn their trade from books too.

739
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,566
They have an instruction manual of sorts.

740
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,819
That's quite amusing.

741
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:17,031
INSIDE PARK SHAMAN'S CLOSET

742
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,574
Oh jeez, what's this?

743
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,326
A BOX WITH A KNIFE STUCK ON IT

744
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,452
What's this?

745
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,748
I see what it is.

746
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,792
Judging by the knife on the box,

747
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,752
she must've cursed someone.

748
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,337
Wait, who's this?

749
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,421
PARK SHAMAN

750
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,881
"E-Ryu University School of Medicine."

751
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,217
Her boyfriend must've been a doctor.
Who is he?

752
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,137
HE LOOKS FAMILIAR

753
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,472
IN THE ENVELOPE

754
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,475
"Notice of Education Committee Ruling."

755
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,561
She slipped a mouse
in her friend's backpack.

756
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,020
That got her expelled?

757
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,690
"Jang Je-in"? So my Je-in sued you!

758
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,483
"My Je-in"?

759
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,404
-Examination time is over.
-All right, I got it.

760
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,239
-What do you mean?
-You have to leave now.

761
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,199
But I need to catch the dang killer!

762
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,492
-You have to leave.
-To where?

763
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,077
-This way, please.
-This is my village!

764
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,621
-Sir, please don't.
-I was born and raised here.

765
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:08,207
-Not right now. Your 15 minutes are up.
-Got that?

766
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,213
COMBINE THE CLUES

767
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,591
Now, you must've examined the scene

768
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,759
you found most suspicious.

769
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,219
A BRIEFING BASED ON CLUES FOUND

770
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,805
Jeez, stop crying.
It's messing up your face.

771
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:23,931
SOAKING WET

772
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,057
You're overreacting.

773
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,643
The truth's going to come out now.

774
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,897
I was hoping to ask you to go first,
Mr. Kim Handsome.

775
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,065
-Are you up for it?
-Have you collected yourself?

776
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:36,611
-Why wouldn't he be?
-I can go first.

777
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,281
I have to say one thing first.

778
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,366
-I'm just so heartbroken, you see.
-Yes?

779
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:47,163
So I'd like us all to have
a moment of silence in honor of Je-in.

780
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,625
A moment of silence for Je-in.

781
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,211
O gods of heaven and earth…

782
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:57,632
ONE OF THEM IS SUPPOSEDLY HONORING
THE PERSON THEY KILLED

783
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,761
He's a complete nutjob.

784
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,305
All right.

785
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:10,102
I first went to see how my Je-in looked
in her final moments.

786
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,771
But it looked like

787
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:15,274
she was stabbed more than a dozen times.

788
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,318
She was punctured on both shoulders,

789
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,237
shanked in the thigh,

790
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,988
shanked in the shin,

791
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,782
and shanked in the chest too.

792
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,784
-Do you have to say "shanked"?
-Sorry.

793
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:27,203
Which butcher sells these shanks
you speak of?

794
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,205
-Say "stabbed."
-Okay, "stabbed."

795
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,457
Anyway, she had a lot of stab wounds

796
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,876
and also a massive wound
on the back of her head.

797
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,088
And it didn't look like the killer
finished her off instantly.

798
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,798
-Here's what I think.
-Please go on.

799
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:43,719
The victim must've ended up on the roof
one way or another.

800
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,055
-Agreed.
-For the killer

801
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:50,184
to take her up there without a struggle,
she must've been unconscious.

802
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,852
If she wasn't drugged,

803
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,146
that blow to the back of the head
could've done it.

804
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,441
-But wouldn't that have left bloodstains?
-Right, there should be bloodstains.

805
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,152
-I went up to the roof myself.
-Okay.

806
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,238
Yes, you're the only one
who went up there.

807
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,865
-How did you go up there?
-There's a door off to the side.

808
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,201
-I see.
-Does that door not lock?

809
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,745
-Is it always unlocked?
-It's unlocked, yes.

810
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,956
So this is the way to the roof. All right.

811
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:16,085
I went up the roof,
and I figured with such wounds,

812
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:18,170
the roof would be a bloody mess.

813
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,756
But when I got there…

814
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,258
What the heck?

815
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,802
Did they not fight here?

816
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,262
It was clean.

817
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,180
Squeaky clean.

818
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,016
Not even a single drop of blood.

819
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:33,519
Okay, then let's go check there later
and figure out what happened.

820
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,437
Sure.

821
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,690
So then I went to the director's office

822
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:40,651
-where my Je-in used to work.
-Right.

823
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,403
I looked through the drawers

824
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,406
-and found that she'd hired someone.
-Hired someone?

825
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,826
Yes, to dig up information on someone,
who turned out to be…

826
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:50,953
Ms. Park Shaman.

827
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,414
It has all the details about your life.

828
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,166
-She dug up my information?
-What?

829
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:58,336
It says your hobby
is doing 24-hour rite challenges.

830
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,880
It even covers what your ideal type is.

831
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,215
My ideal type? Even I don't know that.

832
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,508
You're just being shy.

833
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:09,638
Your ideal type is a man
who's 180 cm tall with long hair.

834
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,475
-No way.
-Oh, is that so?

835
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,268
WHO COULD IT BE?

836
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,853
Let me tell you once again.

837
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:19,315
-Please don't fall for me.
-I hate this.

838
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:22,151
Anyway, it had information
about Park Shaman and her family,

839
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:25,821
including Park Father, Na Mother,
and even her younger brother.

840
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:28,199
-Why would she do that?
-But she had no reason to do that.

841
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,659
-So that's why I went to the shrine.
-Okay.

842
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:31,744
I found a box

843
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:35,414
in her closet with a knife
stuck on top of it.

844
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,083
I opened it up

845
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,918
and found dolls like these inside.

846
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:43,047
Now, I couldn't help but wonder
who she cursed with these voodoo dolls.

847
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,549
-Well, there were photos.
-Really?

848
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:46,884
There was a man

849
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:50,846
-who looked very familiar in those photos.
-Right.

850
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:55,267
I thought back
and remembered the wedding photo

851
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,019
-in Je-in's office.
-The wedding photo.

852
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,063
It was the same man.

853
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:03,401
You know,
as the youngsters say these days,

854
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,027
there was an "overlap."

855
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,822
-Sort of like monkey branching?
-He left me for her, okay?

856
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,157
What else was I supposed to do?
I had to curse them.

857
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,576
-I couldn't just sit back and watch.
-My goodness.

858
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,370
You cursed him because he left you?

859
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,664
I also found a document in there.

860
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,375
It was about her expulsion
from high school.

861
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:22,253
She apparently slipped a mouse
in her friend's backpack,

862
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,380
almost giving the friend a heart attack.

863
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:25,464
So she got expelled.

864
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,175
I basically got kicked out
because of Je-in.

865
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,593
-Right.
-Yeah.

866
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:33,722
That must've started
the bad blood between them.

867
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:38,394
There must've been a backstory
as to why she slipped that mouse in.

868
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:43,065
She must've resented Je-in
for losing the man she loved to her.

869
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:48,237
But then again, Je-in also ran
a background check on Park Shaman.

870
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,366
So I'm pretty sure they've had
some sort of grudge against each other.

871
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,704
Then I remembered what I saw
in the background check report

872
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,247
and looked through it.

873
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:02,209
It turns out her younger brother
is visually impaired.

874
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,921
Her brother is blind,

875
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:09,383
but he had a chance to get the surgery
for 500 million won.

876
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:13,762
So she performed rites and sold talismans
to save up 500 million won,

877
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,348
but something must've gone wrong.

878
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:19,894
So I was wondering
what that could've been,

879
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,979
and then found out that my Je-in sued her.

880
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:22,897
What?

881
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,399
"Jang Je-in"? So my Je-in sued you!

882
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,067
ANOTHER DOCUMENT IN THE CURSE BOX

883
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,903
"You're sentenced to pay
170 million won in taxes,

884
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,988
30 million in fines,
and a 2-month business suspension."

885
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,531
THE RULING

886
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,158
She must've performed a rite
by the hospital

887
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,160
and disrupted the business.

888
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:39,121
So all the taxes and fines

889
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,874
-amounted to exactly 200 million won.
-200 million won.

890
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:47,588
She worked so hard to earn money
to pay for her brother's eye surgery,

891
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:52,384
but she lost 200 million of that money
because my Je-in sued her.

892
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:53,469
That's motive for sure.

893
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,930
-She loves her brother dearly.
-Oh dear.

894
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,557
So you decided to go all in on me, huh?

895
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,976
Yes, unfortunately for you.

896
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,061
SORRY, BUT YES

897
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:04,772
-I'm afraid that's the case.
-Have a seat, Mr. Kim Handsome.

898
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,525
Now, since you were attacked so much,

899
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,653
-it should be your turn, Park Shaman.
-Shall I begin my rite?

900
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,571
Are you going to attack me now?

901
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:15,658
Are you ready to be cursed?

902
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,869
Let me load up on some tears first.

903
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:23,874
-We have this thing called intuition, no?
-Sure.

904
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,459
-It can be important.
-I was walking along

905
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,337
and it led me to Mr. Kim Handsome's room
at the hotel.

906
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,507
-Now, there's a matchup.
-A counterpunch, I see.

907
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:36,053
I went where the spirits guided me,
and what did I find?

908
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,265
A hint suggesting
he didn't get to tell her how he felt.

909
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,808
A ring box.

910
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,393
-A ring box?
-That's right.

911
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:45,354
But it was empty.
Where could this ring have gone?

912
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:50,317
And there were wine glasses
left untouched on the table.

913
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,362
So it was all just for himself.
A one-sided love.

914
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:55,739
-But--
-Alone in love

915
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,784
-You know that song, right?
-That's enough of that.

916
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:01,203
-What's that ring?
-Let me apologize.

917
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,663
Did you give her the ring?

918
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,957
-I did.
-You did?

919
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,042
Did she have a ring on her finger?

920
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,335
No, she didn't.

921
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,046
I'm pretty sure she tossed the ring.

922
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:15,593
The ring is probably somewhere
around the crime scene.

923
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,971
We have to find the engagement ring
that she tossed.

924
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:21,223
Then, I looked through his wallet

925
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,475
and found hotel receipts.

926
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,977
-Hotel receipts?
-Receipts…

927
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,937
But then, I noticed something strange.

928
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,982
For five straight years

929
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,400
from July 31, 2014,

930
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:35,529
he stayed at this hotel
every year on July 31st.

931
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:38,866
-July 31st?
-Suspicious indeed.

932
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,201
Why did he stay there?

933
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,203
You know,

934
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,164
no matter how many
shamanic rites I perform,

935
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:47,041
I'm never spooked.

936
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:50,586
That was until I opened
Mr. Kim Handsome's closet.

937
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:51,545
There's something else?

938
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,714
-A mannequin.
-What?

939
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,133
There was a mannequin
wearing a white dress.

940
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,886
-A mannequin?
-I saw that mannequin too.

941
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,013
Didn't it look like my Je-in?

942
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:04,099
-That's why it's creepy.
-I'm the mannequin expert here.

943
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,726
Be honest. What were your plans?

944
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:06,894
-Something perverted?
-Explain.

945
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,103
You want me to be honest?

946
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,105
I was going to take commemorative photos.

947
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:11,899
-For photoshopping?
-What photos?

948
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,693
-Commemorative photos.
-Maybe he practiced stabbing it?

949
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,612
REHEARSING THE CRIME WITH THE MANNEQUIN?

950
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:19,365
A rehearsal for murder?

951
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:22,076
Were the two of them
even in a real relationship?

952
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,953
Where did you meet Ms. Jang Je-in?

953
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,706
You met as a doctor and a patient,
didn't you?

954
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,959
To be completely honest,

955
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:35,089
I received some treatment a while back

956
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,549
for alcohol addiction.

957
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:40,386
See? They started off on the wrong foot.

958
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:41,720
What's so wrong about it?

959
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,847
Why can't a patient
and a doctor be in love?

960
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,141
Did you love her, or did you stalk her?
Be honest.

961
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,559
We were in love.

962
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,645
But here's the conclusive evidence

963
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,397
-that Mr. Kim Handsome
-There's more?

964
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,108
is a perverted nutjob.

965
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,275
What's this?

966
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,861
"Seoul District Court Ruling"?

967
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,406
"Kim Handsome, unlawful confinement."
Oh jeez.

968
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:02,950
He's already a criminal.

969
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,619
You served three years for kidnapping
and unlawful confinement, right?

970
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,037
Who did you kidnap?

971
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,206
-Who do you think?
-I didn't kidnap her.

972
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:11,458
Je-in and I just had an argument…

973
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,253
If you were her boyfriend,
she wouldn't have reported you.

974
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:17,381
We were in a relationship,
but I lost my head a little, so--

975
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:18,465
Did you hit her?

976
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:22,219
How could you say that?
I would never do something like that.

977
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:25,222
I only held a pair of scissors
that happened to be next to me

978
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:26,724
as I talked to her.

979
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,559
It was a petty argument between a couple,

980
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:30,436
but people misunderstood it

981
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:33,105
and made it out to be more serious
than it really was.

982
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:34,523
So it was perverse confinement.

983
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:35,941
Well…

984
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:39,361
I don't think I need to
explain myself any further.

985
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,572
People mistook my love
for something else all my life.

986
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:44,116
I WAS WAITING FOR BEAUTY AND HER
COLLEAGUES STARTED PICKING A FIGHT…

987
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,951
KIM HANDSOME'S PAST DIARY

988
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:50,330
Since then, I always approached love
thinking that we can overcome anything

989
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:54,543
as long as my feelings
and the other person's feelings are true.

990
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:58,672
Other people's misunderstandings
are nothing new to me.

991
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,341
You could say I've gotten used to it.

992
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:07,639
But unlike Mr. Kim Handsome here,

993
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,058
I don't just go after one person.

994
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,604
-Oh dear.
-An Doctor?

995
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,898
-Yes?
-You drove a white Mercedes here, right?

996
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,566
-Yes, it's mine.
-It's your car, correct?

997
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,860
You sound so proud and insufferable.

998
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,654
-It's not much, but it's mine.
-Did you get it on a payment plan?

999
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:25,365
-No, I paid upfront with cash.
-At once and in cash?

1000
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,409
Good for you.
Anyway, I found these in the back seat.

1001
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,870
Since you're a medical professional,

1002
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:32,998
you could easily kill someone you hate
with these drugs.

1003
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:35,042
-In her car?
-Why did you bring those?

1004
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:38,045
I always make house calls,
so I need to carry certain drugs--

1005
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,839
You took the Hippocratic Oath
as a doctor, right?

1006
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:44,760
-I did, yes.
-Can these drugs kill a person if misused?

1007
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:48,388
Well, excessive use of any drugs
can be dangerous.

1008
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,140
So you admit one can die
from excessive use of these?

1009
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,642
But consider the body.

1010
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:54,520
-The cause of death can't be drugs.
-It's possible.

1011
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:57,606
In order to make that happen as a woman,

1012
00:46:57,689 --> 00:46:59,775
you'd first have to
make the victim unconscious.

1013
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:01,735
Come on, Mr. Kim Handsome.
This isn't your first rodeo.

1014
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,196
I wouldn't know
since I haven't killed anyone yet.

1015
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,239
THE SPIRITS ARE CLUCKING IN DISAPPROVAL

1016
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,407
-That's all from me.
-All right.

1017
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,867
-Got it.
-Good work.

1018
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:10,661
-Let's move on to An Doctor.
-Sure.

1019
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:13,622
Your outfit is so flashy.

1020
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:14,957
It's making my eyes sting.

1021
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,792
This is what success looks like.

1022
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,961
I found quite a lot of evidence.

1023
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:21,338
-Just how many pictures did you take?
-Oh my.

1024
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,715
She brought a whole photo album.

1025
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:27,344
First off,
I looked into Mr. Kim Handsome too.

1026
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:28,887
-Me?
-That's right.

1027
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,640
-It's Handsome again.
-I'm sorry, but…

1028
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:34,643
I'd appreciate it if you stopped
showing so much interest in me.

1029
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:35,853
Be quiet.

1030
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:39,273
Before I talk about Mr. Handsome,
let's discuss the corpse first.

1031
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,525
It's true that she was slashed,

1032
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,443
but I focused on the wound on her wrist.

1033
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:47,447
It looked like the killer
tried to cut her hand off.

1034
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,158
It was cut halfway through,
leaving her wrist dangling.

1035
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,743
-Her left hand?
-Yes, the left hand,

1036
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:54,496
the hand you usually
wear a wedding ring on.

1037
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:58,917
But I also noticed something
about the mannequin earlier.

1038
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:01,003
-You just took note of itself, didn't you?
-Yes.

1039
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,631
-The mannequin's left hand was cut off.
-Are you serious?

1040
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,133
No way.

1041
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,677
Was he trying to swap it
with Je-in's left hand?

1042
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,929
-Exactly.
-Because she wasn't wearing the ring!

1043
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,057
What? It's missing a hand.

1044
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:16,602
What's this?

1045
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:21,523
Why did he cut the hand off?

1046
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:22,733
A HANDLESS MANNEQUIN ON THE WALL

1047
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:25,861
THE VICTIM'S PARTLY CUT LEFT HAND
AND THE MANNEQUIN'S CUT LEFT HAND?

1048
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,029
Why cut off a hand?

1049
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,324
-Why did you cut this hand?
-What a lunatic.

1050
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,160
Why did you cut it off?

1051
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,287
He practiced cutting it on that mannequin.

1052
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:38,081
I was thinking
that since Ms. Jang tossed the ring,

1053
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,876
maybe he wanted to take her hand
to put the ring on it

1054
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,377
-and keep it forever.
-So he practiced.

1055
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,504
That's an excellent deduction.

1056
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:48,550
It's not nearly as serious as you think.

1057
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:51,720
-It was just another minor argument.
-It's serious.

1058
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:53,722
Did you cut it off
because she wouldn't take your ring?

1059
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:57,059
Well, I did put my ring

1060
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,561
-on Je-in's finger.
-On her hand?

1061
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,897
But she just took it off
and tossed it away,

1062
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,399
so I got upset.

1063
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,777
You took out your anger on the mannequin?

1064
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,028
That's what happened.

1065
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:11,114
But I'm not the kind of person
who would hurt someone.

1066
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:14,576
-It might be better if you were.
-Just curse them instead or something.

1067
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,912
Why'd you even bring
a mannequin to a hotel?

1068
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:20,999
I may run a mannequin factory,
but mannequins are basically humans.

1069
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,502
-What the heck are you saying?
-What's that supposed to mean?

1070
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:26,588
-There's more on Mr. Handsome.
-Please stop.

1071
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:29,424
I noticed something in the photos
you carry in your wallet.

1072
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:32,094
There was a photo
where your eyelids were red and swollen

1073
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:35,305
-like you just had double eyelid surgery.
-That's true.

1074
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,890
Did you get surgery?

1075
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,225
No, not at all.

1076
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,726
That photo was taken

1077
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,563
after Je-in and I Netflix and chilled
five years ago.

1078
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,857
-Oh, really?
-Must we really know that?

1079
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:47,859
-Sorry for oversharing.
-That's too much information.

1080
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:51,238
-Anyhow, so?
-We were drinking wine together

1081
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,614
and I blacked out at some point.

1082
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:56,493
When I woke up the next day, my whole body
was aching with bruises everywhere,

1083
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,787
and my clothes were all messed up.

1084
00:49:58,870 --> 00:49:59,997
-Whose?
-Mine.

1085
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:03,083
I couldn't remember anything,

1086
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:06,336
but I figured I spent
a passionate night with Je-in.

1087
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,922
-So I took a selfie to document pure joy.
-Unbelievable.

1088
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:12,592
Am I speaking another language?
What's "Netflix and chill"?

1089
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,302
-You don't…
-What does it mean?

1090
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,221
You don't know what it means?

1091
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:18,807
-So what, you spent the night together?
-It's what the kids say these days.

1092
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,017
It means--

1093
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,935
No, not that.

1094
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,730
-They were hitting each other?
-What the heck are you talking about?

1095
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:27,566
-What?
-Goodness, hitting's involved?

1096
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:29,693
I told you, I'm not a pervert!

1097
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:32,195
But why were both your eyes bruised
like you got double eyelid surgery?

1098
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,781
I don't know because I blacked out.

1099
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:39,536
I guess it got really passionate,
and we got a little rough with each other.

1100
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,329
-So gross.
-If that's your idea of passion,

1101
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:44,249
-you should take up martial arts.
-This will surely anger the gods.

1102
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:47,085
All right then.
Thanks for your testimony, Mr. Handsome.

1103
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,378
Next up…

1104
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:50,964
Jang Cousin!

1105
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,716
-That came out of nowhere.
-Me?

1106
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:56,011
It's rare to have someone yell like that
and no one in the room be startled.

1107
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,429
It's you, Jang Cousin!

1108
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:58,847
Just humor her. Try again.

1109
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,098
-Jang Cousin!
-Oh jeez!

1110
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,349
What do you want?

1111
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:05,103
-First, let's look at his roots.
-I have nothing to hide.

1112
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:07,314
I saw his family photo.

1113
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,232
If you see here, there's a clear contrast.

1114
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:13,487
You must've grown up feeling jealous
of your cousin's wealth and resented her.

1115
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:16,239
Then, I found Jang Grandpa's will.

1116
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,407
According to it,

1117
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:20,243
Jang Cousin's dad was disowned,

1118
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,912
so he couldn't get any inheritance.

1119
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:25,415
So that's why only his family was so poor.

1120
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:26,917
Surely he had an inferiority complex.

1121
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,629
-Come on, that's not true.
-He must've been so jealous and angry.

1122
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:34,341
He even had books
on family and inheritance law.

1123
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:39,012
It looks like he's very interested in laws
related to getting inheritance.

1124
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:41,848
-Are you serious?
-Those were my father's books.

1125
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,350
But what's even more suspicious

1126
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,393
is that there's a leak test report.

1127
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:49,189
And where's the source of that leak?
Jang Je-in's hospital.

1128
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:52,400
I kept getting water leaks in my factory,

1129
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:56,404
so I tested it and found out it was
coming from the hospital, that's all.

1130
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,365
An ill-fated relationship, indeed.

1131
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:01,660
And what got wet in the mannequin factory?

1132
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,120
-Can you tell me?
-Got wet?

1133
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,038
My eyes, obviously.

1134
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,499
I teared up big time,
reminiscing the good old days.

1135
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:12,712
I mean, if there was a leak,
something must've gotten wet.

1136
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:16,007
It wasn't just the mannequins
that got wet in the factory.

1137
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,634
Inside those mannequins

1138
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:21,471
-were Viagura pills--
-Who told you to look through that stuff?!

1139
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,515
-Jeez, you scared me.
-You dirty old man!

1140
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:25,308
-Wait, Viagura?
-Goodness.

1141
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:29,729
-Gosh, it's hot in here.
-But the Viagura wasn't for himself.

1142
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:33,483
-Was he selling them?
-There was a huge supply of it.

1143
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:34,776
-He had way too much.
-I see it now.

1144
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,319
-So he's a smuggler.
-I never understood

1145
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,864
why you ran a mannequin factory
in the middle of nowhere.

1146
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:40,782
-Fine, I'll just come clean,
-How gross.

1147
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,868
since we have Jang Detective here and all.

1148
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:47,622
At first, I ran an honest business
with my mannequin factory.

1149
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:51,126
The business was good
with all the shopping malls in Dongdaemun

1150
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,210
all those years ago.

1151
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:54,629
But those places started to die out

1152
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,965
-so my sales took a hit.
-And only guys like him buy mannequins.

1153
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:58,133
Exactly.

1154
00:52:58,216 --> 00:52:59,426
My one and only customer.

1155
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,303
Then…

1156
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,763
Was it five years ago?

1157
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,224
A friend came up to me and asked

1158
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,518
if I'd be interested in a side gig.

1159
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:11,271
He said it was smuggling and that
I only had to hide stuff in my mannequins

1160
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:13,023
and transport them.

1161
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,233
That's all there is.

1162
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,152
You didn't take them yourself?

1163
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:19,321
-But I did find…
-What good would it do me?

1164
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:21,573
-I found a pill on your desk.
-How revolting.

1165
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,159
It was for a clinical trial!

1166
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,954
I can't just send them out to my clients
without testing them!

1167
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,206
That's not how I do business.

1168
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:32,792
-Gosh, it's hot.
-All right.

1169
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,127
Okay, I get it.

1170
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,837
I have another question.

1171
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:39,216
I saw that you were looking to buy
Ms. Jang's land for 500 million won.

1172
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,635
Why would I buy from her
if I wanted to kill her?

1173
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:42,719
I could've just killed her.

1174
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:45,013
-But--
-I bet she turned down your offer.

1175
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:47,057
-Correct. He asked…
-She really is a shaman.

1176
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,100
-Of course, I am.
-You really are.

1177
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:52,145
He asked and she said,
"Family? Please. Don't contact me."

1178
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,064
You know nothing!

1179
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:57,400
That was the text Ms. Jang Je-in sent.

1180
00:53:57,484 --> 00:54:00,862
I don't think they were close enough
to even be called family.

1181
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:04,991
He probably texted her to get her to sign
the real estate sales agreement.

1182
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:08,995
But Jang Cousin doesn't have the money
to buy the land in the first place.

1183
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:12,457
The mannequin factory
wasn't doing great at all,

1184
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,917
and because of the leak,

1185
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,420
he now had to sign over his organs
unless he could pay back his creditors.

1186
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:20,548
So why did he want to
buy this land so much?

1187
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:23,426
Perhaps he needs that land

1188
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,470
because there's something buried there.

1189
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:30,308
A lot of you will regret it
once I start talking.

1190
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:32,394
I wonder if you're prepared for that.

1191
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:38,191
We've been doing this for over a decade,
and his character hasn't changed a bit.

1192
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,444
Too much change means it's time to die.

1193
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,407
So… Wait a minute.

1194
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:48,576
Since you're a doctor,
let me ask you something.

1195
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,247
I heard there's a disorder called…
What was it again?

1196
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:54,708
Erotic…

1197
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,127
-What? Erotic?
-Erotic?

1198
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,336
Erotic maniac?

1199
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,880
It was erotic…

1200
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,342
It was something like that.

1201
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:08,013
I won't know
unless you tell me the exact name.

1202
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:10,015
Erotic…

1203
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,183
Erotic…

1204
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:14,602
-Stop saying that, you pervert!
-Erotic what?

1205
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:16,855
It's the name of the disorder.

1206
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:18,857
-Excuse me?
-What was it again? It was six syllables.

1207
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,941
Oh, I got it!

1208
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:23,111
It was "erotomania."

1209
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:24,446
"Erotomania"?

1210
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:28,033
Yes, erotomania.
You'd know since you're a doctor, right?

1211
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:31,036
Actually, I'm an orthopedist.

1212
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,746
ONLY ORTHOPEDICS FOR ME

1213
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:38,585
Sure, I suppose it's possible
for a doctor not to know it.

1214
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:42,922
So what is this erotomania, you ask?

1215
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,509
"You're looking at me."

1216
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,178
What? Me?

1217
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,513
"Are you that attracted to me?"

1218
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:51,890
What a crazy bastard.

1219
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:56,811
-That's what erotomania is!
-Wow, okay.

1220
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:57,896
That's completely nuts.

1221
00:55:57,979 --> 00:55:59,105
It's him!

1222
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:02,650
He told me earlier to move my leg
and stop seducing him.

1223
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,194
He told me not to fall for him.

1224
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:07,364
So I checked to see
why you were like that,

1225
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:09,407
-Handsome.
-I only say those things

1226
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,618
-because women keep falling for me.
-Kim Handsome

1227
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:15,121
was a patient here
at this psychiatric hospital!

1228
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,457
-Erotomania.
-Alcohol addiction?

1229
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,626
-Right.
-That's what he told us.

1230
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:23,713
But he didn't mention his erotomania,
an even more serious disorder!

1231
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:28,593
That's why even if a woman
simply looks at him,

1232
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:31,054
he thinks that she likes him.

1233
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:33,390
If a woman merely asks if he's okay,

1234
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:35,767
he immediately thinks
that she cares about him.

1235
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,686
He lives his life
trapped in that delusion.

1236
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:39,938
What are you taking notes for?

1237
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:42,273
Stop writing about me, ladies.

1238
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:44,317
You can't have Shaman!

1239
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:48,154
-What was that for?
-That came out of nowhere.

1240
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,657
-I just wanted to try something.
-For goodness' sake.

1241
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:54,160
-You can have her.
-I'm so sick of this.

1242
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:58,790
Let me ask this. Who do we have
to thank for our village's growth

1243
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:00,834
and the comfortable life we enjoy?

1244
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,919
Who do we owe it to?

1245
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:07,215
Why, the Great Park Village Head,
of course.

1246
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:08,967
Sounds like "the Great Leader Comrade."

1247
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:11,302
Everyone, give him a round of applause.

1248
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:13,805
-Why should I? I'm not from here.
-Everyone who lives here

1249
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:15,515
should applaud him.

1250
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:19,602
-She's the only other resident here.
-I agree, but we shouldn't worship him.

1251
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:22,564
However, this is the last time

1252
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:24,357
I'll be clapping for him.

1253
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:28,903
-You told us to clap, and now it's over?
-What a twist.

1254
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:31,364
-Unbelievable.
-Let's see.

1255
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,867
Mr. Village Head,
did you attend university?

1256
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:36,703
-What?
-Did you attend university?

1257
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:38,371
-No, I didn't.
-You didn't?

1258
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:42,333
That can't be.
I found a varsity jacket in your closet.

1259
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:45,170
Didn't you attend Illyu University?

1260
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,796
Having a varsity jacket
doesn't mean you went there.

1261
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,340
Come to think of it,

1262
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:53,094
Je-in is the only one in this village
who went to that prestigious university.

1263
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,388
-Is that Je-in's jacket?
-You're right.

1264
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,432
-Exactly!
-No, well…

1265
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:59,017
Je-in worked at Illyu University Hospital.

1266
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,894
I'm a shaman, okay?

1267
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:03,104
-The gods are truly with you.
-Look here.

1268
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:06,024
I'm 187 cm.
You think a woman's jacket would fit me?

1269
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:09,652
So you're saying
this varsity jacket isn't yours?

1270
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,696
It wasn't mine back then.

1271
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,656
Wait, Mr. Jang Cousin.

1272
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,493
As for the Illyu varsity jacket…

1273
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:20,622
Well, to be honest,

1274
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,624
I just got it a while ago

1275
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,209
from someone.

1276
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:27,670
I don't really remember how I got it,

1277
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,506
but I did.

1278
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:34,010
I was wondering
why a guy who went to Illyu

1279
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:36,513
wouldn't know how to spell "coming soon."

1280
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:38,389
He wrote "comeing sun" instead.

1281
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,433
I wanted the sun to come, okay?

1282
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,937
-Oh, I can see that.
-That makes sense too.

1283
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,772
-Let's not be too prejudicial.
-All right.

1284
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:49,943
I apologize for not understanding
our great and wonderful Mr. Village Head.

1285
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,653
That's what you thought I'd say, huh?

1286
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,030
You won't be able to deny this!

1287
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,448
He has anger issues.

1288
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,116
-Try me!
-What is it?

1289
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,994
-I looked through his phone.
-You see…

1290
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,412
-Oh dear.
-Goodness.

1291
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,331
It's Village Head's phone.

1292
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:07,335
"Mr. Village Head…" That came at 8:50 p.m.

1293
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:11,256
"Where did you go? You have to be here
before the opening ceremony."

1294
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,924
What? Where did he go?

1295
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:15,635
Where were you and what were you doing?

1296
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,804
-The psychiatric hospital?
-Where were you on the eve festival?

1297
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,431
I had kimchi and soju in my room.

1298
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:23,393
I was busy going around
from place to place.

1299
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:25,728
I even went up the mountain a few times.

1300
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:29,023
When the youth association leader
was waiting for you to give the speech?

1301
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:32,026
I swung by my place
to take care of some business as well.

1302
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,486
That's all. Why?

1303
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,029
Oh, is that so?

1304
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,698
If you ask why,
I don't know how to answer--

1305
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,825
Come at me. Bring it on.

1306
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:40,952
-That's terrifying.
-I can't do that.

1307
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:43,496
-That's hilarious.
-I was nearly a goner there.

1308
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:49,919
Normally, I may seem like
a total brown-noser to that Village Head,

1309
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,004
but I'm more than that!

1310
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:54,507
He says he went home
and to the mountain and whatnot,

1311
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:57,844
but why would he do all that
when the eve festival was going on?

1312
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:01,055
It's probably because he had to
grab something from home

1313
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,766
to hide something up in the mountains.

1314
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:09,230
Village Head has a secret
that he can't tell other people.

1315
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:12,442
When I went to his room earlier

1316
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:16,821
and saw the map of the merging villages
that said "comeing sun,"

1317
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:20,908
I thought, "Is he trying to build
a kingdom of his own?"

1318
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:22,452
That thought just came to me.

1319
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:26,456
But the only person who left the village
to study and experience the outside world

1320
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:29,250
was Je-in, you know?

1321
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:33,421
So it got me thinking that maybe
she brought something new to this place

1322
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:35,798
that prevented him
from creating his kingdom.

1323
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:39,719
You know how this village
is all about fairness and equality.

1324
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,179
YEONJIDOL VILLAGE CODE OF CONDUCT

1325
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:43,181
-And that--
-Hey!

1326
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:46,476
I stopped Yeonjidol's former village head

1327
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,770
when he embezzled all that money!

1328
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:52,523
And I built this place into what it is now
with my beekeeping business for ten years!

1329
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,692
I even made
the merger with Banjidol happen.

1330
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:57,528
That's why I have these bags
under my eyes!

1331
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,364
-Yes, you're absolutely right.
-Right?

1332
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:00,615
-I'm so sorry.
-How dare you?

1333
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:05,119
Just seeing how furious he got
at the thought of any harm

1334
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:08,289
coming to the village he's the head of,

1335
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:12,794
it really felt like he saw this place
as his own kingdom.

1336
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:15,755
So if Jang Je-in had done anything

1337
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:19,467
to tarnish his great legacy,

1338
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:22,720
cause serious harm to it,

1339
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:25,014
or something along those lines,

1340
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:27,475
he might've experienced emotional turmoil

1341
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:29,769
that would've been enough motive
to commit murder.

1342
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:33,064
First of all,

1343
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:34,899
I also went all in on one person.

1344
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:36,609
-On whom?
-I'm scared.

1345
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,361
-It's…
-Not me, right?

1346
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:39,529
An Doctor.

1347
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:42,657
-Thank the gods of heaven and earth.
-I knew it.

1348
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,201
-She seemed fishy.
-Why me?

1349
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:47,328
-I saw An Doctor's résumé.
-What of it?

1350
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:49,580
She doesn't look like it,
but she's from the countryside too.

1351
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:50,665
What?

1352
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:52,750
-She was born in the country.
-Got a new identity?

1353
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:55,336
The first hospital she worked at
was Samryu University Hospital.

1354
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:59,841
Isn't that the place
where you can only leave inside a coffin?

1355
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:03,219
-She first worked at Samryu,
-It's not like that.

1356
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:05,930
-but then worked at the prestigious Illyu.
-A transfer?

1357
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:09,308
-From 2002 to 2012,
-She's very ambitious.

1358
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,977
you worked at Illyu University Hospital.

1359
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,186
How did that happen?

1360
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:14,856
Well…

1361
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:16,858
A hospital director that I know
got me a job there

1362
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:19,318
in exchange for prescribing
whatever drugs they wanted--

1363
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,903
And who was that director?

1364
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,530
One of my acquaintances.

1365
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:23,614
-Just someone you know?
-Yes.

1366
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:26,075
Is that where you first met her?

1367
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,285
-I mean Jang Je-in.
-Yes.

1368
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:28,703
How long did you work together?

1369
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:31,372
-Exactly three years, right?
-Yes, that sounds about right.

1370
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:33,416
After that, Jang Je-in got fired.

1371
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:35,251
But then, out of the blue,

1372
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:38,504
you quit your job
at Illyu University Hospital in 2013

1373
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,923
and came to work
at Yeonjidol Psychiatric Hospital.

1374
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,008
Why was that?

1375
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:43,676
Why did you come here?

1376
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,972
Well, for reasons of her own,
Je-in invited me here to work together.

1377
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:49,056
I know.

1378
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:52,435
-That's why.
-You got kicked out of Illyu

1379
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:53,561
because of malpractice.

1380
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:55,354
COURT FINDS DOCTOR NEGLIGENT
AFTER A 9-MONTH TRIAL

1381
01:02:55,438 --> 01:03:01,194
-Malpractice, huh? Unbelievable.
-That left her no choice whatsoever.

1382
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:04,155
Was your medical license
revoked back then?

1383
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,616
-No, it wasn't.
-Okay.

1384
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:09,076
But it was a huge scandal
and even made it on the news.

1385
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,703
I read an article about it.

1386
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,663
I was blacklisted.

1387
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:15,792
How do you have the gall
to walk around so shamelessly?

1388
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:18,211
-Did your patient die?
-I have something to say about that.

1389
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:21,297
I feel so wronged,
so I have to tell you this.

1390
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,801
As you heard, I'm from the sticks,

1391
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:28,137
so no one treated me
like an equal at Illyu.

1392
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:32,892
The patient was already dead
by the time they went under,

1393
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:35,186
but the hospital just made me
the scapegoat.

1394
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:38,231
So you think they threw you under the bus
because you were from the countryside?

1395
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:42,151
That's why they asked me to the OR.
It's not that I'm a bad doctor.

1396
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,654
-It's just so unfair.
-A rite will help you feel better.

1397
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:47,156
-Thank you.
-Give me a call sometime.

1398
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,325
But you see,

1399
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:52,078
I saw two emails on your laptop

1400
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:54,997
exchanged between Jang Je-in
and someone named Park Colleague.

1401
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:56,874
Here's their conversation.

1402
01:03:56,958 --> 01:04:01,003
It reads, "I need a stand-in.
Who'd be a good fit?"

1403
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:03,673
"How about that girl
who worked at Illyu University Hospital?"

1404
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:05,967
"Isn't she perfect for a stand-in?"

1405
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:08,803
And then Je-in writes,

1406
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:12,390
"The stand-in is too dumb.
I'll have to fire her."

1407
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:15,059
Are you the dumb stand-in?

1408
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:16,519
-What's that?
-Nod if it's true.

1409
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:18,062
Come on, An Stand-in.

1410
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:20,064
I knew it.

1411
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:24,026
-So she was the stand-in.
-But Je-in sent records

1412
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,487
-of these email exchanges to An Doctor.
-To An Doctor?

1413
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:28,823
Why did she do that?

1414
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:30,783
-I was the one who sent it.
-What?

1415
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,077
I sent it to myself using Je-in's laptop.

1416
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,204
-Of course.
-So I could sue her.

1417
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:37,832
-To have as evidence of them conspiring?
-To sue her?

1418
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:40,126
-You secretly peeped in on her laptop?
-Yes.

1419
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:42,003
-I forwarded it to myself.
-After killing her?

1420
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:44,380
-No, of course not.
-I see, all right.

1421
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:47,508
I also found her employment agreement.

1422
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,594
-Her monthly pay
-Yes?

1423
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:52,471
-was a measly 1.6 million won.
-What?

1424
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:55,558
She had to sleep
and eat at the hospital too.

1425
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:59,061
And her treatment log
was filled with only minor tasks.

1426
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:02,189
Her self-esteem probably took a big hit
because of that.

1427
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:04,442
Then five years later,

1428
01:05:04,525 --> 01:05:06,444
she becomes a completely different woman.

1429
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:09,363
This stand-in doctor who got paid pennies

1430
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:12,783
now lives a luxurious life,
driving around in a Mercedes.

1431
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:16,120
What happened in those five years?

1432
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,665
It's not that something happened.

1433
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:23,294
-People began to realize my capabilities.
-You can't find employment elsewhere.

1434
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:25,212
People just realized
what a good doctor I was.

1435
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:28,841
Do you remember texting a VIP
on August 1st?

1436
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:30,927
-I do.
-Do you always

1437
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:32,637
meet your VIP clients that late?

1438
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,473
They're VIPs, after all,
so I go whenever they need me.

1439
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:39,518
I'm dying to know
what An Doctor does with a VIP patient.

1440
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,520
The most important part

1441
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:46,025
is that I found the bank book
of a patient named Na Terminal.

1442
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:48,945
-This is…
-And I actually found it hidden

1443
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:51,614
in the seatback pocket
of the passenger seat.

1444
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:54,533
-Of course, I hid it. It's money.
-Did you embezzle your patients' money?

1445
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,744
Why would you hide it
when it's not your money?

1446
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:59,622
The same amount of money
was withdrawn every time, until July 30th,

1447
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:01,248
when 180 million won
was withdrawn at once.

1448
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:02,166
At once?

1449
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:05,962
-O spirits, where is Na Terminal now?
-How shameless.

1450
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:07,046
And another thing.

1451
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:09,423
This is what I'm most curious about.

1452
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:13,010
At 9:55 p.m., she fills up her car
at Yeonjidol Gas Station.

1453
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:15,721
She drives a Mercedes,
yet she only got 10,000 won worth of fuel.

1454
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:16,889
-Just 10,000 won?
-Yeah.

1455
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,391
She must be flat broke.

1456
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:20,935
-Can't you see what I'm wearing?
-Either she's broke,

1457
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:23,604
or her next stop was a very short drive.

1458
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:26,565
So I looked at her GPS app,

1459
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:29,986
and she entered Yeonjidol Lake
as a destination at 11:15 p.m.

1460
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:33,447
and then Yeonjidol Hospital at 11:40 p.m.

1461
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,449
That fits within the window
of the time of death.

1462
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:37,702
-Between 10:20 p.m. and 11:30 p.m.
-Oh, to dump the body?

1463
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:39,620
-That's likely.
-But she failed.

1464
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:41,831
She went to the lake,
but for whatever reason,

1465
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:44,041
she couldn't dump it there.

1466
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:45,918
We have a lot to question her on.

1467
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,586
Who is her VIP patient?

1468
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,171
Why did she go to the lake?

1469
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:52,174
Why did she only get 10,000 won worth
of fuel when she drives a Mercedes?

1470
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:55,094
And what kind of orthopedic
makes house calls?

1471
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:58,222
Anyway, I'm going to
keep questioning An Doctor

1472
01:06:58,305 --> 01:07:01,017
since she can't lie about the facts.

1473
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,019
Wait, no, she can do that

1474
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:04,395
if she's the culprit!

1475
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:06,313
Man, what do I do?

1476
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:10,026
So, Park Shaman.

1477
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:12,820
I guess it was your younger brother
in that photo.

1478
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:16,157
Then this may be a delicate subject,

1479
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,826
but where is your brother now?

1480
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:23,831
Actually, it's been a few years

1481
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:26,500
-since my brother went missing.
-What?

1482
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:28,377
-Missing?
-That's right.

1483
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:32,214
-It was absolute chaos.
-So he went missing, huh?

1484
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:34,592
Especially given that
he's visually impaired.

1485
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:36,552
Inside your earthenware pot,

1486
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:40,931
I found a T-shirt, a paper doll,

1487
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,683
and earphones.

1488
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:44,143
-Earphones?
-Earphones?

1489
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:45,352
What are these for?

1490
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:47,188
Oh, those.

1491
01:07:47,271 --> 01:07:50,066
In my line of work, I'm often asked
to pray for the dead to reach paradise.

1492
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:53,903
Some items are from my clients,
and some are of my own.

1493
01:07:53,986 --> 01:07:56,197
I just store all of them in that pot.

1494
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,364
So you keep the stuff in there,

1495
01:07:57,448 --> 01:08:00,951
-including the paper doll and earphones?
-Yes, I just keep them in there.

1496
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:02,912
And which one of those is Je-in's?

1497
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:04,121
What?

1498
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:05,247
Her stuff isn't in there.

1499
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:07,625
-Why would it be?
-But Je-in's things--

1500
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:09,835
She's not naive enough
to fall for questions like that.

1501
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:11,754
Don't play cheap tricks on her.

1502
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,964
Okay, I see.

1503
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:16,425
-Nice try though.
-Let's move on.

1504
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:19,762
I was more drawn to the corpse,
so I examined it with Mr. Village Head.

1505
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:23,808
How do you think the killer
brought the victim upstairs?

1506
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:25,392
-There are stairs and an elevator.
-If you ask me,

1507
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:27,061
I don't think she was carried up there.

1508
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:29,105
I think they went up together.

1509
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:30,940
That's one possibility.

1510
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:34,360
I noticed a wheelchair
in the other corner of the hospital.

1511
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:35,903
Did anyone else see one?

1512
01:08:35,986 --> 01:08:37,905
-It was in the yard.
-There was one, yes.

1513
01:08:37,988 --> 01:08:39,198
And what about the elevator?

1514
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:42,368
-I saw it.
-But it's out of service.

1515
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:44,328
-Right?
-Yes, it wasn't working.

1516
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:47,081
But the killer could've cut the power
after killing the victim.

1517
01:08:47,164 --> 01:08:48,874
-The building's abandoned, so…
-So the power's out?

1518
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,543
-It hasn't worked for ages.
-Okay.

1519
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:52,044
But the cause of death

1520
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:54,004
is severe blood loss.

1521
01:08:55,172 --> 01:08:57,842
The victim bled to death

1522
01:08:57,925 --> 01:09:00,427
while she was caught in the wires.

1523
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:02,221
The blood loss killed her.

1524
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:05,850
But I don't think
that's how the killer wanted her to die.

1525
01:09:06,433 --> 01:09:09,061
Which made me wonder,

1526
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:13,816
"What kind of finale
was the killer picturing?"

1527
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:15,568
That wasn't part of the plan.

1528
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:17,570
But here,

1529
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:21,907
let's think about the container
with 10,000 won worth of fuel.

1530
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:24,368
-Huh?
-What?

1531
01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:26,453
-I found the container
-I got chills.

1532
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:29,039
by the hospital building.
I was so shocked by it.

1533
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:32,710
So she didn't fill up her car.
She just bought a container of fuel.

1534
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:34,170
-The container, yes.
-Right.

1535
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:37,840
Okay, let me tell you why I only filled up
10,000 won worth of fuel in my car.

1536
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:39,800
As I'm sure you know from my text,

1537
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:41,969
I only went to the gas station
after texting

1538
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:43,846
that the landslide was making me run late.

1539
01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:46,182
I didn't have much time to begin with.

1540
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:49,351
How could I stand there
and fill up 150,000 won worth of fuel

1541
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:52,062
when I was already running late
for my VIP patient?

1542
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:54,190
I'm not so shameless as that.

1543
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:56,192
-My VIP patient was waiting.
-But if you drive a Mercedes,

1544
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:58,277
you'd fill up more than that
because it doesn't get you far.

1545
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,653
-Have you driven a Mercedes?
-You know?

1546
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:00,988
-Sorry?
-Do you own one?

1547
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:02,865
-No, I don't.
-Well, I do.

1548
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:04,450
And I only fill up 10,000 won.

1549
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:07,411
Has any of you driven a Mercedes?
I doubt it. You're all country bumpkins.

1550
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,289
-Have you ever even been to Seoul?
-I have!

1551
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:12,583
-I did my initiation rite in Seoul, okay?
-I've been there!

1552
01:10:12,666 --> 01:10:16,462
-Stop talking about things you don't know.
-You'd better remember that.

1553
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:18,589
I only got 10,000 won worth of fuel
because I was in a hurry.

1554
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:21,091
Have you seen someone in a hurry
take their time to fill up the tank?

1555
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:22,051
I have!

1556
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:23,636
-Where?
-In a movie.

1557
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:25,429
-Exactly.
-Jeez.

1558
01:10:25,512 --> 01:10:27,806
-This is so frustrating.
-She's finally showing her true colors.

1559
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:31,227
-Everybody finds their voice in this room.
-So the loudest person wins here, huh?

1560
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:33,020
-I'm so frustrated.
-It's a magical room.

1561
01:10:33,103 --> 01:10:35,981
In any case, I think we need to
think about an explanation

1562
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,067
for why that fuel container is here.

1563
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:39,902
WHO LEFT THIS CONTAINER HERE AND WHY?

1564
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:42,905
I'll place my vote at this point.

1565
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:45,074
-On the most suspicious person right now?
-Yes.

1566
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:47,993
Why do you keep looking at me?
Do you have a thing for me too?

1567
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:50,955
-Jeez, you need a beating.
-He's gender-blind.

1568
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:53,082
THE DETECTIVE CASTS 2 VOTES TOTAL,
1 OF WHICH IS CAST AFTER THE BRIEFING

1569
01:10:53,165 --> 01:10:54,541
-What's that?
-Okay, the first one.

1570
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,298
TA-DA

1571
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:02,925
-Wow.
-What's that?

1572
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:05,010
That was really cool.

1573
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:06,804
WHO WILL GET THE DETECTIVE'S FIRST VOTE?

1574
01:11:06,887 --> 01:11:08,138
All right.

1575
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:12,101
At this moment,

1576
01:11:12,184 --> 01:11:16,981
the person I suspect
of being the culprit is…

1577
01:11:25,155 --> 01:11:26,198
-Really?
-Seriously?

1578
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:29,034
PARK SHAMAN

1579
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:30,119
-Really?
-Seriously?

1580
01:11:30,202 --> 01:11:31,996
-Park Shaman?
-That was unexpected.

1581
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:35,040
Don't vote for me
because I have a tragic family history.

1582
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:37,751
This is so infuriating.

1583
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:39,461
She claims her younger brother is missing,

1584
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:44,883
but this is someone who scraped together
500 million won to restore his sight.

1585
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:46,010
If he really were missing,

1586
01:11:46,093 --> 01:11:48,512
she'd be out there
looking for him right now.

1587
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:49,722
WHY IS SHE NOT LOOKING FOR HIM?

1588
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:53,851
I felt her answer was a bit too vague,
so we need to uncover the truth.

1589
01:11:53,934 --> 01:11:56,562
There's so much more we need to find out.

1590
01:11:56,645 --> 01:12:00,024
The scene of the murder itself
is especially too complex.

1591
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:02,151
Let's go find the truth.

1592
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:03,819
-All right.
-Let's go catch the culprit!

1593
01:12:03,902 --> 01:12:05,404
-Let's go.
-Back at it again.

1594
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:06,822
We have to get them!

1595
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:11,327
THE SCENE OF THE CRIME
WILL REVEAL THE CULPRIT

1596
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:13,162
Please check Mr. Village Head's room,
Detective.

1597
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:14,830
-Got it.
-We didn't find much from there.

1598
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:16,081
Okay, I will.

1599
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,584
-Wait, everyone. Let's do this.
-Starting with Mr. Village Head?

1600
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:21,545
Let's take turns
checking each other's cell phones.

1601
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:23,297
-Look at this text here.
-Okay.

1602
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:26,091
-It's from the youth association leader.
-Let me walk over this imaginary wall.

1603
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:28,469
Kim Handsome.

1604
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:30,721
-Can you see me?
-I can't.

1605
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:36,185
-I didn't see the mannequin earlier.
-Wait, hang on.

1606
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:38,062
What's this?

1607
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:40,105
-Wait, what is that?
-It's not what I think it is, is it?

1608
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,440
-It can't be.
-No way.

1609
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:44,735
-Isn't this just a strap for the bed?
-Oh, is it?

1610
01:12:44,818 --> 01:12:46,320
But why is it sticking out like this?

1611
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:49,573
-Just lift it up then.
-Oh gosh.

1612
01:12:50,282 --> 01:12:51,575
-Wow, you're so strong.
-Is that…

1613
01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:53,702
What is that?

1614
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:55,913
-What's wrong?
-What is this?

1615
01:12:55,996 --> 01:12:57,164
What is it?

1616
01:12:57,247 --> 01:12:59,625
-Oh jeez.
-The ring!

1617
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:02,086
-Take that out.
-Hurry, get it out.

1618
01:13:02,169 --> 01:13:03,253
Whose is this?

1619
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:05,672
-I thought it was blood.
-Kim Handsome's!

1620
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:06,757
Close that.

1621
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,467
-You bastard.
-I said close that!

1622
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:10,386
"Embalming a corpse"?

1623
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:12,429
-Hang on.
-Is he actually crazy?

1624
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:14,640
-This is just textbook--
-That nutjob.

1625
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:15,766
Let's set it down.

1626
01:13:15,849 --> 01:13:17,810
-Don't come in here!
-We found the ring!

1627
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:19,186
You got it all wrong.

1628
01:13:19,269 --> 01:13:21,480
"Wash and disinfect the entire body."

1629
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:23,982
-It's not what you think.
-"Drain the blood while injecting…"

1630
01:13:24,691 --> 01:13:27,194
He was planning to do
something like taxidermy.

1631
01:13:27,277 --> 01:13:28,570
-A wax figure!
-Wax figure!

1632
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:29,655
Did he plan to keep her here?

1633
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:32,574
"Sew the mouth shut"?
It says to sew the mouth!

1634
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:34,576
Was he trying to take her organs out?

1635
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:36,787
-It says you have to empty the body.
-That sounds likely.

1636
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:39,039
-Look at the blood. How awful is that?
-Oh, you scared me!

1637
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:41,583
I read up on it, but I was too horrified
to go through with it.

1638
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:42,668
So I gave it up.

1639
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:45,462
-But you did go through with it!
-Then why did you keep all this?

1640
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:48,173
To tell you the truth,

1641
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:50,467
today's a special day for me and Je-in.

1642
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:53,137
It's the five-year anniversary
of our Netflix-and-chill night.

1643
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:56,390
Every year since then,
I come back to stay in this hotel

1644
01:13:56,473 --> 01:13:58,267
and visit the hospital too.

1645
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:00,936
-Wait, you did the deed in the hospital?
-Of course.

1646
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:01,854
Gross!

1647
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:05,315
-He's insane.
-Anyway, I came here to see Je-in,

1648
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:09,403
and I ran into her in the hotel lobby
even though we didn't arrange it.

1649
01:14:09,486 --> 01:14:12,948
-I was so happy that I hugged her.
-Please don't say more about that night.

1650
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:16,869
-And I told her I'd missed her and all.
-She must've been terrified.

1651
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:18,829
Then I slipped the ring on her finger.

1652
01:14:18,912 --> 01:14:20,998
Just like that?
When you haven't seen her for five years?

1653
01:14:21,081 --> 01:14:23,417
But I guess Je-in was surprised,

1654
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:26,336
because she took the ring off,
tossed it, and told me off.

1655
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:28,172
-Tell you off how?
-What did she say?

1656
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:30,424
She said, "I'm so sick of this.
The nutjob is back."

1657
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:33,594
-That's understandable.
-So I grabbed this and came up to my room.

1658
01:14:33,677 --> 01:14:35,429
Overwhelmed by my impulses,

1659
01:14:35,512 --> 01:14:37,764
I was wondering what to do next.

1660
01:14:37,848 --> 01:14:39,683
So your love was one-sided.

1661
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:41,226
I was really hurt.

1662
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,687
That Netflix-and-chill night
might not have happened.

1663
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:45,439
But seriously, think about it.

1664
01:14:45,522 --> 01:14:47,107
Why would his eyes get so swollen?

1665
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:48,442
-Look at that photo.
-July 31st…

1666
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:51,487
-Look at his eyes.
-What happened to them?

1667
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:52,529
Who is this?

1668
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:53,822
-It's Handsome.
-Handsome.

1669
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:55,365
-Oh jeez.
-Goodness gracious!

1670
01:14:56,241 --> 01:14:57,659
-Oh jeez.
-Goodness gracious!

1671
01:14:57,743 --> 01:14:59,661
My Je-in has gotten pretty tall.

1672
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:00,787
He's the worst.

1673
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:04,041
-That lunatic.
-She was about 165 cm tall 5 years ago,

1674
01:15:04,124 --> 01:15:05,709
but she's around 175 cm now.

1675
01:15:05,792 --> 01:15:07,461
-How did that happen?
-Why is she so tall?

1676
01:15:07,544 --> 01:15:09,463
-We need to perform a rite for this.
-She grew so much.

1677
01:15:09,546 --> 01:15:10,547
Shoo!

1678
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,424
Begone!

1679
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:14,635
-The gods are angry too.
-It looks like he put makeup on himself.

1680
01:15:14,718 --> 01:15:17,179
-Tell me about it.
-I just drank wine with her.

1681
01:15:17,262 --> 01:15:19,223
-Look at the wine glasses.
-I see the wine.

1682
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:21,725
-Only Mr. Handsome drank it.
-Je-in didn't drink any.

1683
01:15:21,808 --> 01:15:23,936
-She must've put something in the wine.
-She drugged him!

1684
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:28,524
-So Director Jang did something to him.
-She did something to her inpatients.

1685
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:29,983
Did she experiment on them?

1686
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:32,486
-She did all that to drug you.
-That's right.

1687
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:33,820
-That's nonsense.
-She tricked you.

1688
01:15:33,904 --> 01:15:36,740
-She fooled you. Wake up.
-An alcoholic would go nuts for drinks.

1689
01:15:36,823 --> 01:15:37,824
But first,

1690
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:40,536
-how about you go in there too?
-Good idea.

1691
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:42,246
-Or just lie down here.
-Yeah, you creep us out.

1692
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:43,914
-Lie down with the mannequin.
-Here.

1693
01:15:43,997 --> 01:15:46,583
I'll put the roses here
so you can Netflix and chill now.

1694
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:47,793
I'll just take a little break.

1695
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:50,170
-Don't wander around.
-This is pretty tough.

1696
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:51,838
Just stay with her.

1697
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:56,301
-I had a look at Mr. Village Head's phone.
-Okay.

1698
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:58,303
Look at this text.

1699
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:00,472
It looks like the victim,

1700
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:04,017
Jang Je-in, was out of the country.

1701
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:05,435
-My Je-in?
-Oh jeez.

1702
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:07,354
-No, just stay there.
-Stay there.

1703
01:16:07,437 --> 01:16:10,440
-My Je-in was abroad?
-Shoo, shoo! Begone, begone!

1704
01:16:10,524 --> 01:16:11,692
-I want to know too.
-Look.

1705
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:13,652
Some reporter texted him and said,

1706
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:16,280
"She's flying back to Korea
to hold a press conference."

1707
01:16:16,363 --> 01:16:17,614
"Do you know anything?"

1708
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:19,741
Our Mr. Village Head would've met her

1709
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:21,660
-and heard about it!
-He must've found out!

1710
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:24,454
-That must be why he killed her!
-He must've heard!

1711
01:16:25,122 --> 01:16:26,540
Did you meet my Je-in?

1712
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:28,584
-No.
-Did you meet my Je-in?

1713
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:30,544
-He must have. For sure.
-When did you meet her?

1714
01:16:30,627 --> 01:16:33,755
-You have something. Grab him, Handsome!
-Hey, frisk him!

1715
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:37,009
-Let's see your pocket.
-I only have my wallet here.

1716
01:16:37,092 --> 01:16:39,469
-Hand me that.
-I can't frisk him, so someone else do it.

1717
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:41,847
How many pockets does this have?
One, two, three, four, jeez.

1718
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:43,098
There are way too many pockets.

1719
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:47,185
-I think there's something in here.
-Hey, watch where you're touching!

1720
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:49,438
-The name on his ID is different.
-What?

1721
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:50,647
PARK REAL SON

1722
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:52,899
His name here
shouldn't be "Park Real Son."

1723
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:54,568
-He's not Park Village Head.
-The photo!

1724
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:56,737
-Let's see the photo.
-Did he assume a new identity?

1725
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:59,865
-Wait, that's our village's--
-Wait, what?

1726
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:00,824
His identity!

1727
01:17:00,907 --> 01:17:02,409
Who changes their identity like this?

1728
01:17:02,492 --> 01:17:04,328
-This is such a sloppy way to do it.
-Unbelievable.

1729
01:17:04,411 --> 01:17:06,580
-He's grabbing something!
-You just changed the photo!

1730
01:17:06,663 --> 01:17:09,082
-He's grabbing something!
-You just changed the photo!

1731
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:11,293
-He's grabbing something!
-You just changed the photo!

1732
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,465
-You'll anger the gods!
-Hang on.

1733
01:17:17,257 --> 01:17:18,592
I'll come clean.

1734
01:17:19,217 --> 01:17:20,260
I…

1735
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:23,865
