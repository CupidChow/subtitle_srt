1
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:12,220
-What's this?
-They look the same. See that fat belly?

2
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:13,763
Look at the shoulder, head, and the blood.

3
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,140
MURDER OF THE CASINO BOSS II

4
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:16,766
I admit that's my drawing.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,393
-Then explain why
-They're identical.

6
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:22,063
the body looks exactly like your drawing,
down to the gunshot wound in the shoulder.

7
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,065
Okay, I'll explain.

8
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:29,529
When Kim Bong-cheon
brought me to the casino,

9
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,156
I couldn't cook at all.

10
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,450
How could I? I was a doctor.

11
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,245
Still, I was excellent at human anatomy,
even back in my med school days.

12
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:38,747
-But--
-You were good with the knife.

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,250
He's the one who suggested
I cook with human meat.

14
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,419
-I knew it.
-There's no way.

15
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:47,547
The players who came to gamble
and ended up heavily in debt

16
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,508
were sent to me as ingredients.

17
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:55,346
-He made you cook with human meat?
-Who ate the dishes you prepared?

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,681
The VVIPs.

19
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,100
They went nuts over what I made.

20
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,269
Why haven't I tried it before?

21
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,688
Why didn't I get any
when I'm also a VVIP client?

22
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,899
The dishes were served upon request.

23
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:08,485
So that's the dish mentioned
in the staff appreciation cards.

24
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:12,322
The victim texted him yesterday,
ordering him to prepare a special meal.

25
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,865
Did he mean a meal made with human meat?

26
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,867
-Did he end up as an ingredient himself?
-For the steak?

27
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,120
Not at all.
There's no correlation there, whatsoever.

28
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,288
I just hold a lot of resentment

29
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:23,374
because he's the reason
why my life fell apart,

30
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:27,629
so I came up with that recipe
to vent my anger at him.

31
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:31,216
There was a drawing
in Jang Chef's recipe book

32
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:35,470
that looked identical to how the victim
was displayed on the stage.

33
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:38,223
So when he said
he'd prepare a special dish,

34
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,767
maybe he meant he'd kill him
in a special way.

35
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,771
I'm thinking that maybe
he put his murder plan into action.

36
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:47,857
In any case, this murder was premeditated.

37
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:52,654
The killer must've placed the body there

38
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,447
for a reason.

39
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,493
SEARCHING JANG MONKFISH'S ROOM

40
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,622
OFFICER HYEON'S INVESTIGATION NOTEBOOK

41
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,629
Officer Hyeon's notebook

42
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,548
had mentions of Jeon Four Terms

43
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,591
and Kim Bong-cheon.

44
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,386
He wrote "City Hall Records Archive"
at the bottom of the page,

45
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,513
hinting that something might be there.

46
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:19,597
If that's the case…

47
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,015
WHAT WAS HE LOOKING FOR
IN THE RECORDS ARCHIVE?

48
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,268
-Let's get digging.
-Let's see what's in here.

49
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,602
What's with all these files?

50
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,272
Let's go through them all.

51
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:33,236
Won't it be the early 2000s
since the incident occurred in 2002?

52
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,867
Jeez, that's a lot of files.

53
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,955
-What is it?
-Hold on.

54
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,666
2002 DOWNFALL TOWN RELOCATION PLAN

55
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:47,876
"Downfall Town."

56
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,419
We have a file on Downfall Town.

57
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,713
RELOCATION CONSENT SHEET

58
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:52,922
Check this out.

59
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,591
Look at what I found.

60
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,634
HEOYOUNG INDUSTRIAL CITY
ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS REPORT

61
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,596
This is what An Jeweler had a copy of.

62
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,681
It mentions mass fish deaths
and other issues.

63
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,475
Some of the people
listed on this consent sheet

64
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,769
have gone missing.

65
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,522
Those whose names are crossed out in red
have gone missing.

66
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,900
People who didn't consent
have gone missing.

67
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,861
The others didn't disappear
because they had given consent.

68
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,196
"Park Determined, Han Objection."

69
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,031
THE NEXT PAGE
OF THE RELOCATION CONSENT SHEET

70
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,493
-Jang Monkfish?
-Monkfish?

71
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,079
They must be married,
seeing that they share the same address.

72
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,831
It says Jang Monkfish is missing.

73
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,167
The fact that they're both missing
must mean something.

74
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,793
Wait. Hear me out.

75
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,963
What if this wasn't just avenging
Officer Hyeon's death?

76
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,466
Would you forgive the man
if he had hurt your wife?

77
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,051
-I'd kill him.
-Exactly.

78
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:43,056
This doesn't look
like a typical consent form.

79
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,433
-Don't you think Jeweler
-She had them buried.

80
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:48,561
was involved in this
when she was still a public servant?

81
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,897
-Right. Remember the deal she made?
-She was on board.

82
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,066
-All right.
-Everyone.

83
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,484
-Mr. Monkfish.
-Did you find something?

84
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,654
-Mr. Monkfish, we need to talk.
-Mr. Monkfish, please come here.

85
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,240
-You can examine the body later.
-What now?

86
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,324
Mr. Monkfish.

87
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,328
Were you married back in 2002?

88
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,413
-Were you married?
-Married?

89
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,748
-Is that not allowed?
-He was married?

90
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,375
Where's your wife?

91
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,669
How am I supposed to answer that

92
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,671
when she's no longer of this world?

93
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,964
How did she pass away?

94
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,176
-What are you even asking?
-Tell me what happened to her.

95
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,761
-She died.
-When?

96
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:23,596
Maybe he killed her.

97
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,350
Oh, come on. Not this again.

98
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,726
He's at it again.

99
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,937
-Come on, Monkfish.
-What happened to her?

100
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,814
She went missing in May 2002, didn't she?

101
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,609
Her name was Lim Wife,
and she lived at 79-1 Downfall Town.

102
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,696
-Wasn't that your address?
-It was.

103
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,698
-How did you come back in one piece?
-Tell us.

104
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:46,119
Your wife went missing and died,
so how did you make it out alive?

105
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,204
You see…

106
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,419
Back then, we were told to relocate
in exchange for compensation.

107
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,797
That's what your father
told people, right?

108
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:04,762
However, what they presented
as compensation was outrageous.

109
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,265
How was a million won per household
supposed to be enough?

110
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,142
-That's an outrageous amount.
-That's true.

111
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,436
That's why my wife and I…

112
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,104
-I'm sorry.
-We decided

113
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:16,816
to remain in Downfall Town and held out.

114
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,111
-But then one night,
-What happened then?

115
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,280
some men broke into our house

116
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:26,117
and beat the crap out of my wife and me.

117
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:27,994
Is that how you got that scar?

118
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,662
Yes.

119
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,706
-You didn't get it while gambling?
-Don't be silly.

120
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,417
Maybe you scratched yourself
while you were asleep.

121
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,421
-Read the room, will you?
-Would you like a scar on your face?

122
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,716
-Read the room.
-Anyway,

123
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,177
I came to and found myself

124
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,137
buried in the landfill.

125
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,472
Oh my.

126
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,933
UNDER JEON FOUR TERMS' ORDERS,

127
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,728
KIM BONG-CHEON BURIED THE NON-CONSENTERS
AND REPORTED THEM MISSING

128
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,689
When I barely regained consciousness,

129
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:01,194
I saw my wife next to me,
covered in blood.

130
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:04,781
I was trying to wake her up and said,
"No, wake up. You can't die like this!"

131
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,575
And then, I passed out again.

132
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,453
The next thing I knew,
I was in a hospital.

133
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,998
I asked for my wife
and begged people to help me find her,

134
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,126
but it turned out
that she had already died.

135
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:21,214
Officer Hyeon was the one
who dug me out of the hole.

136
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,715
THE LATE OFFICER HYEON

137
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:27,470
You were driven by revenge
not only for your mentor's death

138
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,930
-but also your wife's death.
-Right.

139
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,390
That's double the motive.

140
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,682
-Detective, please take a look.
-True.

141
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,769
It turns out my parents
had signed the consent sheet as well.

142
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,230
Kim Singer's Father

143
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,232
and Kim Singer's Mother.

144
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:42,610
There's something I should tell you
about Singer's family.

145
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,446
Back when I first started as a fisherman,

146
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,448
-I barely caught any fish.
-He's right.

147
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,950
-How did you get better?
-Exactly.

148
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,660
Then one day,

149
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,538
I noticed the water was full of fish.

150
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:54,622
Precisely.

151
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:57,542
I caught them all, thinking I was lucky--

152
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,002
-Those were dead fish.
-Yes, they were all dead fish.

153
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,922
It never crossed my mind

154
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:06,134
that the fish had died
from heavy metal poisoning.

155
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,218
I never charged full price.

156
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:11,305
I sold them at a cheap price
since they were already dead.

157
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,016
-You shouldn't have sold them.
-They were contaminated.

158
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,602
I honestly didn't know!

159
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:20,398
What happened to your parents
after they relocated?

160
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,233
Did they pass away
after slowly wasting away?

161
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,235
Yes, both my parents passed away.

162
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,737
Now that I think about it,

163
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,489
I think the reason all the fish died

164
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,659
was because I turned a blind eye
to the waste dumping.

165
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,078
The landfill was most likely
contaminated by heavy metals,

166
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,414
-which led to the mass fish deaths.
-Sounds like it.

167
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,249
You had a hand in this as well!

168
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:41,919
I may have paid the people less,
but I never buried them.

169
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,754
Did you actively take part in this?

170
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,257
-I didn't.
-Did you know people were being buried?

171
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,341
I had no idea.

172
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,553
We need to get to the bottom of this.

173
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,390
Everyone is connected
to the landfill in some way.

174
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,101
It seems crucial

175
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,896
to uncover the connection

176
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:04,275
between Kim Bong-cheon,
the landfill, and the suspects.

177
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,819
Jang Monkfish

178
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,947
must've been devastated
and enraged by his wife's death.

179
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:14,911
And his mentor, Officer Hyeon,
also ended up passing away.

180
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:19,373
Now imagine him coming across
Officer Hyeon's notebook

181
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,375
and seeing notes
about the forced relocation plan,

182
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:26,088
Kim Bong-cheon,
and the City Hall Records Archive.

183
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,592
Wouldn't he have launched
his own investigation into the matter?

184
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,678
I should look into that possibility.

185
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,681
FOCUSING ON JANG MONKFISH'S ROOM

186
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,608
INSIDE THE TRASH CAN

187
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,988
"Goodbye Asthma"? Inhalation solution.

188
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:52,823
It's for asthma patients.

189
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,368
"Use a nebulizer
to inhale for about ten minutes."

190
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,706
Why did he throw this out
when there's still some left?

191
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:02,959
Oh gosh!

192
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,170
BUSTED BY THE ROOM'S OWNER

193
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,465
I have asthma,
and that's the medicine for it.

194
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,009
-Look.
-Do you put this in there?

195
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,135
Yes, just like this.

196
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,304
There's some left in this one.

197
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,389
STILL HALF FULL

198
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,807
-There is?
-Yes.

199
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,521
-I didn't know. Where did you find it?
-There's some left.

200
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,730
In the trash can.

201
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,733
Really? I guess I missed that.

202
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,530
CONTINUES SEARCHING JANG MONKFISH'S ROOM

203
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,579
A BOX OF HIS LATE WIFE'S BELONGINGS

204
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,917
What's this?

205
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,255
"Medical report, Lim Wife"

206
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,799
"A common cold."

207
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,885
"White blood cell count."

208
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,055
There has to be
a recording of his voice somewhere.

209
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,267
-Mister.
-Yes?

210
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,893
-What's this?
-What do you mean?

211
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,897
That's my wife's medical report.

212
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:07,982
Why was it hidden?

213
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,068
-Should I have laid it out on the bed?
-You hid it in the box.

214
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,904
Why did you hide this?

215
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,573
What is it?

216
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,867
-That was your wife's.
-Of course.

217
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,828
It's all coming back to me now.

218
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,705
-What is?
-Detective.

219
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,165
I remember now.

220
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,125
That was his wife's.

221
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,003
Before my wife died,

222
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:33,591
-she went to see a doctor.
-I knew it.

223
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,926
-Get over here.
-This guy is the most suspicious.

224
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,845
Who prescribed Dylenol?

225
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,472
Hold on a second.

226
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,141
-Look.
-Her doctor was Jang Chef.

227
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:45,478
I knew his name sounded familiar,
and this was why.

228
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,606
-I haven't seen this in a while.
-"Samryu University, Neurosurgery."

229
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:52,318
This was in April 2002,
before the May relocation applications.

230
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,696
"Patient complained of ongoing limb pain,
so blood tests were performed."

231
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,573
"Diagnosed as a common cold
and prescribed Dylenol."

232
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,618
-Hey, mister.
-Hang on.

233
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,286
-Take your shot at killing the man.
-Wait.

234
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,537
The man responsible for your wife's death.

235
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:07,291
He must've acted on request
from Jeon Four Terms

236
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,211
and purposely misdiagnosed his patients.

237
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,254
He was paid three billion won

238
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,091
for misdiagnosing his patients
during this time.

239
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,760
No, you have it all wrong.

240
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,471
What are we getting wrong
when the evidence is clear?

241
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:21,555
It's not what you think.

242
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,808
I didn't receive any requests from anyone.

243
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,310
-Then are you a quack?
-Yet you misdiagnosed patients?

244
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,311
It's not that.

245
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,814
I made the misdiagnoses first.

246
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,148
-For no reason?
-Yes.

247
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,317
Did you misdiagnose patients
and then ask for money?

248
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,860
After giving the false diagnoses,

249
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,531
I took the medical reports to her father

250
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,199
and offered my solution to his troubles.

251
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,575
I see.

252
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,369
What do you mean, "I see"?

253
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,790
So, we're in this together
whether you like it or not.

254
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,834
I've never seen you before today.

255
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,961
It all traces back
to when your father was in office.

256
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:56,674
-To weather a storm, it's best to--
-Let me show you how people catch colds.

257
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:57,758
-Oh my gosh.
-Hold on.

258
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,720
-Let me show you how people catch colds.
-Hold on.

259
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,972
I'll show you how you can catch a cold.

260
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,682
-Sure, take a shot at him.
-Hold on.

261
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:05,766
-All right.
-Wait.

262
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,852
-Wait.
-Her father was in on it too.

263
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,562
You can all witness

264
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,273
how a perfectly healthy grown man
can catch a cold!

265
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,191
I'll show you!

266
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,861
-Everyone, I…
-I'll show you!

267
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,489
Dear citizens, I apologize
on behalf of my father's actions.

268
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,369
I'd like to…

269
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,370
TOTAL MAYHEM…

270
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,248
-What a mess.
-It's a dumpster fire.

271
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,250
I apologize on behalf of my father.

272
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,877
However, should I become president…

273
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,712
However, should I become president,

274
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,797
-Seriously?
-such history won't repeat itself.

275
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,758
How can you still dream
of becoming president?

276
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,052
Man, this is a pure dumpster fire.

277
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:46,432
Anyway, by selling the contaminated fish,

278
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,393
Jang Monkfish exposed people
to heavy metals.

279
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:53,314
In the end, his actions
endangered his wife's life as well.

280
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,610
If multiple cases
of heavy metal poisoning had surfaced,

281
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:02,698
the mayor at the time
would've lost his political career.

282
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,992
To cover it up,

283
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:08,120
he paid off a doctor named Jang Chef
to mitigate the situation.

284
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,665
The evidence made that pretty clear.

285
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:17,296
-Where's Ms. Mayor's phone?
-Her phone's nowhere to be found.

286
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,923
-You have one, don't you?
-I do.

287
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,174
-Hand it over.
-Give it here.

288
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,384
Are we not allowed to look at your phone?

289
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,803
You are. Have at it.

290
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,137
Are there lots of secrets on it?

291
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,848
No, there aren't. But I don't appreciate

292
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,767
-the tone you've been using.
-What do you mean?

293
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,644
Singer and Monkfish.

294
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,938
Do you think being mayor
gives you any footing here?

295
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,440
You're hardly the kind of people
I'd associate with.

296
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,359
I'm not someone you can treat like this.

297
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,902
You want to be thrown into jail?

298
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,780
-She's finally showing her true colors.
-She's done holding back.

299
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,824
Do you want to go to jail?
Do you know who I am?

300
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,993
-Are you the mayor or a cop?
-Who would want to go to prison?

301
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,829
Hold it.

302
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,039
-This is Kim Bong-cheon.
-There we have it.

303
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,708
-This is Kim Bong-cheon.
-There we have it.

304
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,502
JEON MAYOR'S PHONE

305
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,212
CALL RECORDING

306
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,588
Hold it.

307
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,882
-This is Kim Bong-cheon.
-There we have it.

308
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,093
You want to build a main stadium
on the casino site?

309
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,303
You should've discussed it with me first.

310
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,305
-We can open the vault with that.
-He's pissed.

311
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:10,724
Discuss it with you?

312
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,727
Don't you know the land
is the city's property?

313
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,647
-Let me hear it too.
-Quit whining and move your casino.

314
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,190
I'm hanging up!

315
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,235
ARRIVED AT THE SECRET VAULT

316
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,779
-Ms. Mayor.
-Will that actually work?

317
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,698
This is Kim Bong-cheon.

318
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,492
It unlocked.

319
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,077
This is Kim Bong-cheon.

320
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,997
IT UNLOCKED!

321
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,374
-It unlocked.
-That worked?

322
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,458
-It actually worked?
-I knew it!

323
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,960
-It worked.
-Who's the culprit?

324
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,587
-That worked? It actually worked?
-I knew it!

325
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,797
THE SECRET VAULT

326
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,425
-We're on to you, culprit.
-We're finally in the vault.

327
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,509
What's all this?

328
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,052
I didn't expect that to unlock the door.

329
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,179
-Look!
-Jeez, you startled me.

330
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,848
-It's a ricochet mark.
-It's a ricochet mark.

331
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,808
A RICOCHET MARK FROM A BULLET?

332
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,894
-There's another one here.
-What?

333
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,353
-I see it.
-From the shot to the head.

334
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,773
This is from the bullet
that went through his head.

335
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:00,941
Nicely spotted.

336
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,360
That came from the head shot,
and this came from the shoulder shot.

337
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,987
-Bang.
-Yeah, there are two shots.

338
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,614
There are two bullet marks.

339
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,408
-Guys, I see blood.
-There's blood here.

340
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,912
-His head must've been here.
-Exactly.

341
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,872
-Hold on a second.
-What is it?

342
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:18,375
-There used to be a rug in here.
-What?

343
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,919
There was a rug when I was here.

344
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,588
The killer must've dragged
the body out on the rug!

345
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,965
No wonder.

346
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,176
They dragged the rug out
with the body on it?

347
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,428
-Even a woman could've done that.
-Easily.

348
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,264
-Even if you fire a gun in here…
-The vault is soundproof.

349
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,599
Yeah, exactly.

350
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,768
Anywhere else,
people would've heard the shots.

351
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,728
Lady, good for you for remembering.

352
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:40,147
Isn't she the only person
who had access to this place?

353
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,025
-I didn't have access.
-She's the only one.

354
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,151
How could I come in here?

355
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:47,029
We just entered
using the recording on your phone!

356
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,906
-How could I have come in here?
-Please, everyone.

357
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,492
How could I have known
the recording could unlock the door?

358
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,826
As if you didn't know.

359
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,789
Who would've guessed the vault
would open at some lame recording?

360
00:15:56,872 --> 00:16:01,418
The screen outside clearly says
the lock is voice-activated.

361
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:06,632
Whether it was Ms. Mayor or Ms. Jeweler,
someone moved the body from the vault.

362
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:10,302
Either way, you're here today
because someone emailed you

363
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,096
-an invite.
-That's right.

364
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,474
That email was sent
after his estimated time of death,

365
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,725
and here…

366
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,521
Let's review the records
of the sent emails.

367
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,356
-Were they scheduled to send?
-I got mine at 7 a.m.

368
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,774
-Check the scheduled emails.
-"Scheduled emails."

369
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,317
That should give us something.

370
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,112
Emails were scheduled to be sent
to An Jeweler, Jeon Mayor,

371
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,155
Jang Monkfish, Jang Chef, and Kim Singer.

372
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,741
-They were scheduled on the 7th.
-Scheduled on the 7th.

373
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,243
That confirms it. The killer sent them.

374
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,788
-The killer scheduled these.
-They were scheduled on this laptop.

375
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,708
They also sent a notice of the date change

376
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,836
-to those who were originally invited.
-To April 15th.

377
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,588
After murdering the victim,

378
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:50,426
the killer sent them the update
to stop them from showing up.

379
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,386
Here's what was sent to the guests.

380
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,222
This is the original invitation.

381
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,849
They weren't offered 100 million won.

382
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,851
We received a coupon of that amount.

383
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:03,105
The invitation we received
said we could cash in the coupon.

384
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,024
Who wouldn't come after reading that?

385
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,277
-Even I, someone who doesn't gamble…
-You'd still be intrigued.

386
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,738
Of course. Why would anyone miss
a free 100 million won?

387
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,073
I was baffled when I first saw that.

388
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,702
I wondered if the boss
was offering me a bonus,

389
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,412
and I got pretty excited about it.

390
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,997
So the killer arranged it

391
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,833
so that the five of you would receive
the email at 7 a.m. this morning.

392
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,877
-The murder was put on display.
-You got that right.

393
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,629
-Since we all had a story to tell,
-To show us?

394
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,923
the killer wanted to display it for us.

395
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:34,887
That means the killer gathered everyone
who had a grudge against Kim Bong-cheon.

396
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,681
That's right. It has to be someone

397
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,601
-who knows how we're connected to him.
-That's for sure.

398
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,936
-But I--
-What now?

399
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,647
-I had no idea.
-You had the relocation agreement.

400
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,401
Look, you knew his parents

401
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,154
-I didn't have the sheet.
-and this guy's family had to relocate.

402
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,782
I could've known if I had the sheet,
but I didn't have it.

403
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,784
-Lady.
-Yes?

404
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:01,789
-You have the means to figure it out.
-Ms. Mayor has the most information.

405
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,582
Hear me out.

406
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,000
Let's say she became the president.

407
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,211
What if all this came to light then?

408
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,963
It's like she performed a cleansing ritual
to put this behind her.

409
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:14,676
What did the killer stand to gain
by bringing us all here

410
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,595
to see the body displayed like that?

411
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,555
What was the killer trying to say?

412
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:22,101
Could it be something like this?

413
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,812
-"I got revenge for all of you."
-That may be it.

414
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,816
Are you saying the killer took revenge
on behalf of all of us?

415
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,526
Why else was the body
displayed on the stage?

416
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,945
But who would commit
such a selfless murder?

417
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,157
-I wonder why they did this.
-The key lies in the stage.

418
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,077
What's up with the lips?

419
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,745
I'm curious about the lips.

420
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,581
-I wonder what it is.
-Let's check it out.

421
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:48,085
Can we examine the chairman's body
and figure out what that is?

422
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,336
-Yes, let's check the lips.
-Okay.

423
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,420
I've been curious about them.

424
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,799
You clearly have no self-respect
to still refer to him as the chairman.

425
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,677
Then what do I refer to him as?
Department manager?

426
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,220
-My gosh!
-What was that?

427
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,430
-My gosh!
-What was that?

428
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,683
-My gosh!
-What was that?

429
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:03,809
What the heck?

430
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:04,726
Department manager?

431
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,603
-My gosh!
-What was that?

432
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,729
What the heck?

433
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,287
-My gosh!
-What was that?

434
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,413
What the heck?

435
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,249
That got me good.

436
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,251
-What was that?
-It exploded.

437
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,502
What exploded?

438
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,297
-The body suddenly exploded.
-Did his belly burst?

439
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,715
-His belly?
-My goodness.

440
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,384
-His belly burst?
-It just…

441
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,845
It just popped like a frog would.

442
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,430
Why did he suddenly explode?

443
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,390
-His flesh is everywhere.
-His belly burst?

444
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:46,226
-What the hell? That's gross!
-We were warned about animals exploding.

445
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,979
His flesh is everywhere. It's a mess.

446
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,773
Who made the body laugh?
That's why it burst.

447
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,442
-It stinks.
-Jeez, it reeks.

448
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,360
-What's that stench?
-Does something smell?

449
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,528
-What is it?
-What is it?

450
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,615
This smells like the methane
I used to smell in my old neighborhood.

451
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,200
Right, that's the smell of methane.

452
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,577
We shouldn't be smelling this.
It's bad for us.

453
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,495
-Man, this is just…
-What the hell?

454
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,956
Maybe the body was placed here
to show us this explosion.

455
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,460
Hold on. Normally,
the gas leak detector would've gone off.

456
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,629
WAS DISABLING THE GAS LEAK DETECTOR
PART OF THE KILLER'S PLAN?

457
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,174
-Maybe it was Singer.
-First, let's check the lips.

458
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,342
That's so gross. Jeez.

459
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,178
The smell is too much.

460
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,222
His mouth is slightly open.

461
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,890
-What… Oh jeez.
-Can you open it up more?

462
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,475
Leave it alone, or it might burst again.

463
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,143
The smell is nauseating.

464
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:31,897
He has an underbite.

465
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,190
-What is that?
-His lips…

466
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,317
-There's something in his mouth.
-As expected from Mr. Chef.

467
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,110
-He knows his way around dead bodies.
-What are you doing?

468
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,528
-Goodness gracious.
-This guy's not normal.

469
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,613
The smell is unbearable.

470
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,114
Something was put in there.

471
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,699
-So gross!
-What on earth?

472
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:43,909
-What is that?
-It reeks.

473
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,410
Something was put in there.

474
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,162
-So gross!
-What on earth?

475
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,372
-What is that?
-It reeks.

476
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,457
-Is that a matryoshka doll?
-That's a penguin!

477
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,085
-It's a penguin.
-He was given penguin lips, remember?

478
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,211
What for?

479
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:57,339
-That's the Russian doll.
-Yes, the Russian doll.

480
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,675
Let's count how many there are.
Try opening it.

481
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,009
One.

482
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,177
Two.

483
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,137
Three.

484
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,430
-Four.
-Four.

485
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,600
-And five.
-There are five.

486
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,603
-Five in total?
-Yes, five.

487
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,188
Why are there five of them?

488
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,315
-Why five?
-There are five of us.

489
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,693
He's right. There are five suspects.

490
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,321
-Judging by his lips…
-Look at his lips.

491
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,865
-The chairman is supposed to be one too.
-Can they somehow…

492
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:24,950
Exactly.

493
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,995
The killer made him a penguin,
so he counts as one.

494
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,621
-That brings us to six.
-Right.

495
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,458
Apart from me, there are six people,
including the victim.

496
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,960
There are also six penguins.

497
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,837
Why are there six of them?

498
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,006
Why six penguins, including the victim?

499
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,883
You'd have to be crazy
to paint his lips like that

500
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,386
and shove a doll in his mouth.

501
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,347
The killer designed one hell of a show.

502
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:53,061
How did the killer make the belly explode
at just the right moment?

503
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,938
That's… Hold on.

504
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:56,606
It must've been planned out.

505
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,442
-Yeah, it seems planned.
-This was planned.

506
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,861
It's kind of hot here
because of the lights.

507
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,780
The spotlight was used
to make the stomach burst.

508
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,490
THE SPOTLIGHT AIMED AT THE BODY'S STOMACH

509
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,035
Remember what was written
as part of the cleaning instructions?

510
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:11,705
-Carcasses could explode when left to rot.
-Old carcasses.

511
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:15,250
The killer planned this
based on that fact.

512
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,295
The light was directed at the body
to increase its temperature.

513
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,130
That sped up decomposition.

514
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,548
Otherwise, it'd take forever

515
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,842
for a fresh corpse
to build up methane and explode.

516
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,720
That's why the killer needed 24 hours.

517
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,764
It was for the body to decompose.

518
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:33,518
The killer had an elaborate plan.

519
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,897
The casino's first anniversary event
was the perfect reason

520
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,815
to bring everyone to the casino.

521
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,610
Since the killer knew the vault
would be opened that day,

522
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,780
they knew where to commit the murder.

523
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,783
They then placed the body on stage

524
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:51,536
and knew it would burst
in a hot environment

525
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,413
and directed the light on it.

526
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,500
The killer would've done the math

527
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,960
so that the body would explode

528
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,630
when everyone was gathered near the stage.

529
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:06,635
It was obviously set up as a show
for all to see,

530
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,845
featuring a big explosion.

531
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:13,141
That begs the question.
"Why did the killer prepare this show?"

532
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:18,522
Everyone, we need to look
for more traces the killer left behind.

533
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,565
Please spread out and look for more clues.

534
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:24,152
I'm going to kill whoever did it.

535
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,906
THE OLD LADY OF THE GROUP
IS FUMING OVER THE STENCH

536
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,326
SEARCHING JEON MAYOR'S OFFICE

537
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,831
Did you find something?

538
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,792
The readings bug me.

539
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,755
She was told to be prepared
to blow up the grave at any moment.

540
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,299
Remember the flower she grew

541
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,009
-after being told to?
-That's what they discussed

542
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,803
in the email back in 2021.

543
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,972
We should look through the sent emails.

544
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:54,474
-Let's see.
-"Jeon Mayor."

545
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,184
EMAILS EXCHANGED
BETWEEN JEON MAYOR AND KIM BONG-CHEON

546
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,436
What's this?

547
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,604
FIND A WAY TO BLOW UP
THE CASINO AND ITS SITE JUST IN CASE

548
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:04,151
"Capture methane, leak, boom, and done.
How's that?"

549
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,403
That means she knew the risks of methane.

550
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:07,654
She did.

551
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,615
-Methane or not, she wanted to blow it up.
-She wanted a means to destroy it.

552
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,869
Once that's done,
she'd build a larger flower with a stadium

553
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,037
to become "the king," as in the president.

554
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,708
Ms. Mayor, you're really aiming
for the presidency, aren't you?

555
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,501
Of course. It's been my lifelong dream.

556
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,337
When were you planning
to blow this casino up?

557
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,590
You seem to be mistaken
about blowing the casino up.

558
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:31,011
I only looked for a way
in case I needed to follow the reading.

559
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:33,346
Suppose you needed methane.

560
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,682
Then you'd need a facility for it

561
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:37,642
to always be prepared
to blow the casino up.

562
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,228
You have it all wrong. Here's what I know.

563
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,730
-A landfill like this
-Yes?

564
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:45,150
must be equipped with a machine
that captures the methane

565
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,319
to have its site used for other purposes.

566
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,945
Such a device must be installed to…

567
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,864
-To collect the methane?
-That's right.

568
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:55,452
That device must be installed
for construction to be approved.

569
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,536
That's all I know.

570
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,246
-Are you saying a methane-capturing device
-Was it installed here?

571
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,707
-is installed here on the premises?
-I wouldn't know.

572
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,210
Probably, since this casino
was built on a landfill.

573
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,337
You don't know where,
but the device is here somewhere.

574
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,257
Blowing up that device
could bring the whole casino down.

575
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,594
Normally, 30 years must pass

576
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,680
before a landfill site
can be used commercially,

577
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,808
but the casino
was built on it before then.

578
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:22,979
Imagine how much methane
is being produced beneath the casino.

579
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:28,401
I assumed there's a good chance
an on-site facility is collecting it.

580
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,822
At any rate, everything in this case

581
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:33,949
leads back to the landfill.

582
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,284
It's clear

583
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,663
that a highly secretive business
has been happening here.

584
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,873
All right.

585
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,917
What do you think is worth noting

586
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,546
from all the clues you've found so far?

587
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,881
Anything that deserves another look

588
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,675
or that seems to imply…

589
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:54,010
-What the heck?
-I can still smell the gas.

590
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:57,013
-Where is it coming from?
-The methane is still leaking.

591
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,307
We might all die at this rate.

592
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,976
-I can't take it.
-What the hell?

593
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,103
What if we all suffocate to death?

594
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,604
You've got to be kidding me.

595
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,106
Shouldn't we get off the premises?

596
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,108
The gas is still leaking.

597
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:15,115
Wait. What if we all end up
coughing as badly as Singer?

598
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,033
I might just pass out.

599
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:22,706
It seems that methane
is leaking from somewhere.

600
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,292
Why don't we check over there?

601
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,876
IS THERE A METHANE LEAK SOMEWHERE?

602
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,504
-Isn't this where it's coming from?
-Right.

603
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,672
See what's in there.

604
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:35,969
We need to search quickly.
We're all going to die otherwise.

605
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,722
-Hurry and find the source.
-This one isn't it.

606
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,849
-It's not here.
-Is this how it ends for us?

607
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,976
It has to be coming from somewhere.

608
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,186
Pull the curtains wide open.

609
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,356
-Find anything?
-There's something here.

610
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,816
-Really?
-I knew it. Open it.

611
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,486
-Really?
-I knew it. Open it.

612
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,238
IT OPENS?

613
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,406
Are you kidding me?

614
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,662
GAS CONTROL ROOM

615
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:06,124
THE OTHER VALVES ARE SHUT

616
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,709
Are you kidding me?

617
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,086
-The valve was left open!
-So there was one after all.

618
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,546
-Check this out.
-What's that?

619
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,798
-Close the valve!
-Methane is leaking!

620
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,717
This is the gas capture unit.

621
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,427
Methane was leaking.

622
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,720
-Unbelievable.
-My head hurts.

623
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:22,015
The killer released the methane
for it to build up and cause a scene.

624
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:25,268
-Right, then they knew about this place.
-The killer knew about this room.

625
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,145
The killer knew.

626
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,396
Hey, Singer.

627
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,107
I knew you'd be suspicious of me.

628
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:35,445
-Don't you perform on that stage?
-I do, but I've never been back here.

629
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,988
I'm not a staff member.

630
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,199
There are other gases, such as oxygen.

631
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,284
Can't we release some phytoncides?

632
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,953
They set up a timer
for the methane to be released.

633
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,539
-The methane valve was opened.
-It was planned.

634
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,917
The killer planned it
so the show would start

635
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,670
exactly 24 hours after the murder.

636
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,714
-This…
-How thorough.

637
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,257
-I mean…
-It's too meticulous.

638
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,344
For anyone to be this calculating…

639
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:02,430
There's something we've been overlooking.

640
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,100
This wasn't only about his death.

641
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:08,311
-You were all supposed to die too.
-They meant to kill us all.

642
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,854
-The methane…
-There are no windows here,

643
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,022
and the gas kept leaking.

644
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,774
You were all supposed to die as well.

645
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,611
Who would've wanted all of you dead?

646
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,488
Was the killer planning a suicide?

647
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,490
-A murder-suicide?
-Or maybe…

648
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,409
Someone dreamed of a new world.

649
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,035
-Who was it again?
-Jang Chef.

650
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,454
He said we needed a new world.

651
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,332
-Were we meant to be human sacrifices?
-Come on, not again.

652
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,126
-Goodness, the Messianian Church.
-Including me?

653
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,378
Five people were gathered at the casino.

654
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:36,631
If you add the dead body,
you get six penguins.

655
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,217
What could that number mean?

656
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,970
Six was the total count,

657
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,390
including the dead body and the killer.

658
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:48,143
"I've orchestrated death,

659
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,437
selected those to join me,

660
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,939
and we will leave this earth together."

661
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:58,236
All the cards
have been placed on the table.

662
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,073
We must catch the killer
as if we're playing a game of cards.

663
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:05,160
I believe there are still some clues
we have yet to lay out.

664
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,204
That being said,
I'd like to pat you all down.

665
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,749
-Ms. Mayor, could you stand up for me?
-Yes?

666
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,292
ALL THE SUSPECTS WILL BE FRISKED

667
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,878
There's nothing hidden up your sleeves.

668
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,882
Your pockets are empty as well.

669
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,009
-Your turn.
-Just a second.

670
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,011
-What's the matter?
-I'll show you what I have.

671
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,637
-What do you mean?
-I'm rather shy.

672
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,847
-Come on.
-One second.

673
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,265
I bet that's no ordinary necklace.

674
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,728
THE NECKLACE SHE WORE CLOSE TO HER HEART

675
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,480
Jeez, what now?

676
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,899
This symbolizes my conviction.

677
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,109
I was hoping
I wouldn't have to show you this.

678
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,779
Are you sure that's everything?

679
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,072
-What is it?
-What did Jeweler have?

680
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,158
What is it?

681
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:48,787
-"Upright, I'm sorry."
-She's sorry?

682
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,623
"I'll ask for forgiveness
when we meet again."

683
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:54,542
A NECKLACE ENGRAVED
WITH HER SISTER'S FACE AND A MESSAGE

684
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,377
-That's right.
-"Ask for forgiveness when we meet again."

685
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,463
-Were you planning on taking your life?
-But her older sister's dead!

686
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,089
-Were you?
-A reunion and an apology?

687
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:03,343
But she's dead!

688
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,553
So?

689
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,223
What if she's willing to lay down her life
for her older sister?

690
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,390
The killer…

691
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,226
-They planned a murder-suicide.
-And they failed.

692
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:14,062
-They were unable to die.
-Exactly.

693
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,814
-Right.
-You've got to be kidding me.

694
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,524
They're still clearly grieving.

695
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,234
"I'll ask for forgiveness
when we meet again."

696
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,362
When did she hope they would reunite,
and what did she want to apologize for?

697
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,072
I'll tell you about the necklace.

698
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,741
As you know,
I tried to live a righteous life

699
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,077
as my sister had taught me.

700
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,372
However, with her life at stake,

701
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,791
I had no choice but to embezzle

702
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,918
and sell knock-offs for money.

703
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,921
Still, as a reminder
of what she taught me,

704
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,298
I had this necklace made and wore it.

705
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:46,261
This just happened to be revealed
while we were discussing

706
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:49,639
how the killer might've
also wanted to take their own life.

707
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,808
I'm not registering
a single thing you're saying.

708
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,227
Pay closer attention.

709
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,230
Lady, don't be mean to him!

710
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,357
What now?

711
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,150
-You poor guy.
-What's wrong?

712
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,652
-What is it?
-What's going on?

713
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,321
I found this in Singer's back pocket.

714
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,739
-Did you find something?
-What is it?

715
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,492
EARLIER DURING THE FRISK

716
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,329
HE FOUND SOMETHING?

717
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,958
MEDICAL REPORT

718
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,296
NAME: KIM SINGER

719
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:25,550
He has terminal lung cancer!

720
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,302
Singer…

721
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,307
Are you kidding me?

722
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,351
KIM SINGER WAS COUGHING SO HARD ALL DAY

723
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,857
BECAUSE HE HAS TERMINAL LUNG CANCER

724
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,651
Look at this blood.

725
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,653
HE'S EVEN COUGHING UP BLOOD!

726
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,363
Isn't this contagious?

727
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,948
Come on, how can you be so heartless?

728
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,617
-Ms. Mayor.
-Let's bury her.

729
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,493
Lung cancer isn't contagious.

730
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,248
"Even though family members
passed of the same illness,

731
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,875
it's unlikely to be inherited."

732
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,377
"Ongoing exposure to chemicals
seems to be the cause."

733
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,879
"Incurable, inoperable,

734
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,714
with an average life expectancy
of eight months."

735
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,758
He lost his family to lung cancer,

736
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,718
and now he's going to die soon too.

737
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,803
-That could motivate a murder-suicide.
-Sure.

738
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,055
Absolutely.

739
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,473
You could want others to die as well.

740
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,642
No. I want to live
even if it's just one more day.

741
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,852
-All right. Well noted.
-I can still debut in the US.

742
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,605
-You could always be lying.
-He said he wants to live

743
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,231
even if it's just one more day

744
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,484
because he wants to fulfill his dream
of performing in the US.

745
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,653
-However, that dream was shattered.
-Exactly.

746
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,447
So, what about Mr. Monkfish?

747
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,283
Given that he was a fisherman,

748
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,619
it's safe to assume
he ate contaminated fish,

749
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,871
which would explain his asthma,

750
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,291
a known aftereffect
of heavy metal poisoning.

751
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:44,337
He wouldn't regret passing on
to be with his wife in the afterlife.

752
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,880
-Additionally--
-Why wouldn't I regret it?

753
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,549
-Are you saying you'd regret dying?
-Of course.

754
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,968
Even though you'd be reunited
with your wife?

755
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,844
My wife would want me to keep living.

756
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,513
-Is that so?
-Of course.

757
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:54,639
Noted.

758
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:58,393
Let's consider the possibility
of Jang Chef being the culprit.

759
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,560
Wait Patiently for That Day.

760
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,771
Do you think it's plausible
that his religious belief

761
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,481
drove him to plan a murder this grand?

762
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:07,360
-I think it is. That's how cults are.
-It's expected of a devoted cult follower.

763
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:11,114
Why did the killer
want to kill all five of us at once?

764
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:14,283
Why did it have to be the five of us?

765
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:18,079
They targeted a specific group of people,
so we must figure out why we were chosen.

766
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,206
It had to be the five of you,

767
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,417
which is why the killer
kept other guests from coming

768
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,877
while ensuring you'd attend the event.

769
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,338
This all began

770
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,590
with the landfill.

771
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:35,138
In 2000, my father built the landfill
to secure government funding

772
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:38,975
and cover the city's financial shortfall.

773
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,102
Desperate for money,

774
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:44,188
Kim Singer actively participated
in illegal waste dumping.

775
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:47,650
Let's not forget that Mr. Monkfish
contributed to the problem as well.

776
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,319
You're not innocent victims.
Each of you had a role in this.

777
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,946
Remember what Mr. Monkfish did?

778
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,198
-I sold contaminated fish.
-Precisely,

779
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:57,368
which caused many people
to consume them at restaurants

780
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,870
and be exposed to heavy metals.

781
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:01,372
You were all part of the chain reaction.

782
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,251
In 2002, when the World Ball was held,

783
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,545
rumors of an epidemic
would've kept everyone away,

784
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:08,963
which would've been disastrous.

785
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:13,551
Jang Chef gave false diagnoses
and prevented the truth from getting out.

786
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:18,014
Who covered up
the environmental analysis report,

787
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:21,642
pushed for relocation,
and took a cut of the money?

788
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,436
It was An Jeweler.

789
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,104
-Right, An Jeweler.
-A civil servant at the time.

790
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:28,066
Your sister may have been a victim,
but you're the opposite.

791
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,985
To collect his offerings,

792
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,363
Jeon Four Terms ordered to bury all those
who didn't sign the consent form.

793
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,575
Just like her father,
Jeon Mayor blindly believed the readings

794
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,368
and planted a flower on the landfill.

795
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,496
That's why the casino
was shaped like a flower.

796
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:45,541
That being said, what's the common link
between these people?

797
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,628
Whether intentional or not,

798
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,588
they contributed to this tragedy.

799
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:53,424
They all had blood on their hands.

800
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,011
And who set everything in motion?

801
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:01,682
It was Jeon Mayor's father,
former mayor Jeon Four Terms.

802
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,602
Since he's dead
and can't be held accountable,

803
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,312
the killer
went after his daughter instead.

804
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,606
Jeweler speaks openly
about how she felt about it.

805
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,441
-In her diary?
-Yes.

806
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,110
"July 2, 2019."

807
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,694
"Jeon Four Terms is dead."

808
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,489
"The bastard's daughter is set to be
the next mayor of Heoyoung City."

809
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,032
"How can the world be like this?"

810
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,659
"I guess justice
really doesn't exist, Upright."

811
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,744
"Jeon Mayor was actually elected
mayor of Heoyoung City."

812
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,497
"I'm going to donate money
to her fund every year."

813
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,332
"I'm hoping to use
the daughter of our nemesis

814
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,626
to find out more about your death

815
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:34,048
and the shady acts
she's carrying on after her father."

816
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,260
So, just like how she deposited
70 billion won

817
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:40,012
to get close to the chairman,

818
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,931
she donated to the mayor's political fund

819
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,183
-to dig up her dirty secrets.
-She was prying into my life.

820
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,518
-That's right.
-Right.

821
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:49,730
She wouldn't have minded getting blown up
along with her 70 billion won.

822
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,274
If anyone's willing to burn
all that money,

823
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,860
-they've lost the will to live.
-She had no will to live.

824
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,862
Why would I lack the will to live?

825
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,864
I don't. I want to keep living.

826
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:02,410
But to know that all of you
are perpetrators,

827
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,162
the killer who orchestrated this murder

828
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:07,248
-had to know your stories inside and out.
-They had to know our personal history.

829
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,958
-They must.
-There has to be a connection.

830
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:12,670
How did the killer manage to get
all your information?

831
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:16,090
For the killer to know that each suspect

832
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,426
was responsible
for the deaths in some way,

833
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:24,473
they had to be familiar with
the environmental analysis report.

834
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:27,185
The analysis report outlines every cause.

835
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:31,689
The possibility that it started with
pollution from heavy metal disposal,

836
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:34,150
consuming contaminated meat,

837
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:37,236
and covering it up with false diagnoses.

838
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,655
Each of us is tied to these causes
in one way or another.

839
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,909
Someone who knew about this report
and our involvement

840
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,161
must've gathered us here today.

841
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,581
If you look
at how the crime scene was staged,

842
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:53,669
the killer delivered their message
by making Chairman Kim's stomach explode.

843
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:57,131
The killer was essentially declaring
that they were all responsible.

844
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:01,469
Everyone responsible for this tragedy

845
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,554
was to be punished in this murder-suicide.

846
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,640
-We're all going to die otherwise.
-That was the plan.

847
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,143
-Someone who knew about these documents.
-Someone who had access to them.

848
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,813
As the mayor,
Ms. Mayor had access to these files.

849
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,358
These reports were found
in the archive next to her office.

850
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,026
Right, she could've easily accessed them.

851
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,110
-You could've.
-Is that so?

852
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,279
-These are from the Records Archive.
-Really?

853
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:23,157
-They were from the cabinet labeled 2000s.
-So much for being hard at work.

854
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,367
Also…

855
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,370
-There's Ms. Jeweler.
-She knew about the relocation plan.

856
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:31,374
She could've easily copied these
before leaving her job at the office.

857
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:36,212
Ms. Jeweler had a copy
of the environmental analysis report.

858
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:40,091
She had easy access to this information
and a strong motive to kill.

859
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,803
I'm sorry for accusing you,

860
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:46,555
but all the evidence points to you.

861
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,057
I must ask though.

862
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,726
I don't get why I've become
the prime suspect.

863
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,144
What's the logic behind it?

864
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,229
Simply put,

865
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,731
we're all responsible for what happened.

866
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,733
Yes, including you.

867
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,861
But since your sister died
as a result of it,

868
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,488
your guilt would be the greatest.

869
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:04,740
What did I do to hurt people?

870
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:07,326
-The relocation plan.
-What about it?

871
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,869
I'm only guilty of embezzling money.

872
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,997
You were a civil servant at the time.

873
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,624
-The agreement--
-Bong-cheon collected these signatures.

874
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:14,917
Collecting them caused harm.

875
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,294
But that wasn't my doing.

876
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,421
All I did was embezzle money.

877
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:19,922
All right.

878
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,258
I can't argue back
since I don't get why I'm being accused.

879
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,884
Why do you want to
apologize to your sister?

880
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:27,722
For not leading a righteous life,
not specifically for what I've done.

881
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,598
And we're assuming
that the unrighteous act

882
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:33,686
-is related to the relocation plan.
-But how can that make me the culprit?

883
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:34,937
Why does that make me the culprit?

884
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,983
I want you to provide evidence,
not theories.

885
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,067
-Evidence.
-Evidence?

886
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,944
Solid evidence, not just assumptions.

887
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:45,197
The people gathered here are the evidence.

888
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,907
-How so?
-You had access to the files

889
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:50,536
and took part in the relocation plan.

890
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:53,164
Who actually goes through
the details of such forms?

891
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:56,417
-Either way, you had access to them.
-Sure.

892
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,294
The same goes for Jeon Mayor.

893
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:02,131
That's why we accused you both,
but only one of you is livid

894
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:04,383
while the other looks out of sorts.

895
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:07,094
To me,
that's what sets the two of you apart.

896
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:12,099
Ms. Jeweler
likely carried deep regret and guilt

897
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,227
for betraying her sister's
environmental ideals

898
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,521
through her poor decisions.

899
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:22,276
Her plan had always been to reunite
with her sister and ask for forgiveness,

900
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:28,574
which likely drove her
to kill everyone along with herself.

901
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:32,620
For argument's sake,
let's say Ms. Mayor is the killer.

902
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:36,374
She had the voice recording,
which gave her access to the vault.

903
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,625
This is Kim Bong-cheon.

904
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,960
JEON MAYOR HAD A VOICE RECORDING
THAT COULD UNLOCK THE VAULT DOOR

905
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,713
She also knew methane
was highly flammable.

906
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,924
She received an email
describing how explosive it was.

907
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,592
This is all I needed.

908
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,177
My sole goal was to get this.

909
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,847
-I meant to take this and destroy it.
-One quick question.

910
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,391
-He blackmailed you with this.
-Right.

911
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,893
When did you return
to your office with this?

912
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,395
-On the evening of the 7th--
-You stole it.

913
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,479
-I did.
-When, exactly?

914
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:02,733
I knew he'd be handling payouts
at 11 p.m.,

915
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,277
so I figured I could slip in
and take this.

916
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,655
It was around 11:50 p.m.

917
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:10,533
-Did you say 11:50 p.m.?
-That's right.

918
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,159
-That's…
-That's the latest time-wise.

919
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,328
That's almost the time of the murder.

920
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,997
The chairman's office
was empty at the time.

921
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,458
So I slipped in,
assuming he was handling payouts.

922
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,253
-Then, I left with this notebook.
-At 11:50 p.m.?

923
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,546
I left at midnight.

924
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,131
She might not have seen the killer.

925
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,883
-The vault is soundproof after all.
-The killer could've been there.

926
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:31,011
Let's turn our attention
back to the gas leak.

927
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,638
This was her shot
at blowing up the casino.

928
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:37,560
She could've finally acted
on the reading from her shaman.

929
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,103
She knew that the vault

930
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:41,814
could shield her from the explosion too.

931
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:45,276
Okay, that's the direction
our deduction is heading right now.

932
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,653
After killing everyone
tied to the landfill incident,

933
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:50,531
-she'd emerge as the survivor.
-Exactly.

934
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:54,785
We all had a motive to kill Kim Bong-cheon

935
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:58,998
and each had our own reasons
to end our lives, except Ms. Mayor.

936
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,750
-I don't want to die.
-I don't think it was her.

937
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,127
No, it can't be her.

938
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:07,256
If it's based on that narrative,
Jeon Mayor is cleared as a suspect.

939
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,091
One more thing.

940
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,969
We shouldn't rule out
Mr. Monkfish entirely just yet.

941
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,512
Remember Officer Hyeon?

942
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,639
-He was digging into the landfill.
-Right.

943
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,601
It's possible that Officer Hyeon

944
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:21,604
passed all his findings
to Jang Monkfish before he passed.

945
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:25,357
He could have the same level of access
to the information as the other two.

946
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:28,569
What exactly happened
to your wife back then?

947
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,155
Was her death
a direct result of the lynching?

948
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,657
That's what I believed at first.

949
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,743
-After all, she was badly beaten.
-Of course.

950
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:40,498
Her medical report was in the box
where I stored her belongings.

951
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,957
Then, a few months ago,

952
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:46,003
I met Jang Chef
when he started working here.

953
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:49,715
His name struck me as unusual,

954
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,842
and that's when it all came back to me.

955
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,594
Did you dig out the medical report?

956
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,638
That's right. Actually, no.
I only saw it again earlier.

957
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,681
I knew his name sounded familiar,

958
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:01,060
and it hit me
when I read her medical report earlier.

959
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:03,145
That's when I realized.

960
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:07,066
Before my wife passed,
she saw a doctor for her pain.

961
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:10,069
We didn't think much of it
because it was diagnosed as a cold.

962
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:13,322
Just to be clear,
until you saw this medical report

963
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:15,115
issued by Jang Chef,

964
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,743
you believed your wife
had died from the lynching

965
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,870
rather than from heavy metal poisoning.

966
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,705
I wasn't aware of that
at the time of her death.

967
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:22,790
It never crossed my mind.

968
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,793
After all, I barely escaped death
from the brutal beating.

969
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,045
We established this earlier

970
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:30,339
that Monkfish's wife died

971
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:33,133
after consuming the fish
he had caught and sold.

972
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,928
A key point

973
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,222
in our deduction

974
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:43,102
is determining who wanted to die
after killing everyone else here.

975
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:46,146
Let's think about the crimes

976
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,899
that led to these tragic deaths.

977
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,277
Who took part knowingly like me?

978
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:54,321
THE THREE PEOPLE
WHO KNOWINGLY COMMITTED CRIMES

979
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,408
-I do feel bad for Monkfish though.
-His actions were unintentional.

980
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:58,784
He didn't know.

981
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:00,828
-That he was selling contaminated fish?
-That's right.

982
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,665
That's why I believe his guilt
is greater than anyone else's here.

983
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,835
Imagine how he must've felt
when he eventually realized

984
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,296
he caused his wife's death.

985
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:13,465
-You'd want to die.
-The guilt would've been unbearable.

986
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:14,800
Hear me out.

987
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:16,427
As for the heavy metal poisoning,

988
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:20,139
I only learned about it
after the boss's death.

989
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:23,267
It wasn't until today
that I found out the truth

990
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,061
about what happened
in my old neighborhood.

991
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,146
The medical report

992
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:30,274
clearly shows a high concentration
of heavy metals in her blood.

993
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:33,360
That alone could've easily prompted him
to dig deeper.

994
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,279
I believe he could've known.

995
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:38,282
Claiming he didn't know
about heavy metal poisoning

996
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:41,327
sounded like a lie the killer might tell.

997
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,954
There's something
I've been meaning to ask.

998
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,831
Let's go back to your asthma medication.

999
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,541
Why did you throw it out?

1000
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,252
Wouldn't you die without it?

1001
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,964
He no longer has the need
for asthma medication.

1002
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,341
-I never threw it away.
-Are you cured?

1003
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,885
-It was in the trash.
-Then why was it in the trash?

1004
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:01,180
-Two bottles were empty, but one wasn't.
-One still had some left.

1005
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:03,974
I get that it wasn't empty,
but I had no idea.

1006
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,601
How much of it was left?

1007
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,269
-It was half full.
-Quite a lot, actually.

1008
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,897
-Why did you throw it out?
-It's because he no longer needs it.

1009
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,983
-I'm--
-He no longer needs his asthma medication.

1010
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:16,570
I'm equally suspicious
of Mr. Monkfish and Ms. Jeweler.

1011
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,782
I'm sure there's more to find,
so we have to keep digging.

1012
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:20,949
All right, everyone.

1013
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:23,243
-It's time to get moving.
-Sure.

1014
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,871
I wonder why he threw away his medication.

1015
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,542
WILL THEY UNCOVER EVIDENCE
THAT PROVIDES ANSWERS?

1016
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:31,752
Let's see.

1017
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,839
There has to be something more.

1018
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,303
Let's see.

1019
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,263
This is for marking.

1020
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,598
JANG MONKFISH'S FLORESCENT CREAM

1021
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,059
What's this?

1022
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,270
Oh, so that's what it's for.

1023
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:53,899
-How does it work again?
-This is how he marks cards.

1024
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,363
-Why go to such lengths?
-Listen, Detective.

1025
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:02,241
There are two possible intentions.

1026
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:05,953
Either to show us the murder
or to kill us all.

1027
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,956
The key is which one matters more.

1028
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,667
-Displaying the murder--
-Here's what I think.

1029
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,628
The killer wanted everyone here to realize
what they had done before dying.

1030
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,798
Could he have smeared this somewhere?

1031
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,801
-Maybe he left a trail.
-What do you mean?

1032
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,431
Something might show up
if I shine this UV light.

1033
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,891
-Like what?
-The timer, for example.

1034
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,977
The cream from the cards
could've passed onto his hands.

1035
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,020
Even after he died,

1036
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,857
the gas had to be released with a delay.

1037
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,817
The killer wanted to
give us time to reflect.

1038
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,570
And to know the crimes you were dying for.
That must've been their intent.

1039
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:42,364
-They were sending a message for sure.
-Absolutely.

1040
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,616
But at the cost of their own life?

1041
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:50,456
Can I see your hands?

1042
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:56,420
EXAMINING JANG MONKFISH'S HANDS

1043
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:00,632
-This?
-You need the glasses to see that.

1044
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:04,636
It's the cream card sharks use
to mark cards when we cheat.

1045
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,514
Look at the crucial evidence we have.

1046
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,016
May I?

1047
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,184
Go ahead.

1048
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:16,607
COULD THIS BE?

1049
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,651
Sorry about that.

1050
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,073
Like the trigger.

1051
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,617
CHECKING THE GAS CONTROL ROOM

1052
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:27,910
We all touched it, but still.

1053
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,079
The gun.

1054
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:33,665
It's only visible with special glasses.

1055
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,793
It shows up under this light as well.

1056
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,878
-Where's the gun?
-You can see it on my hand.

1057
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,422
It showed up with this light.

1058
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:43,217
-What did you touch?
-I mark cards with that cream

1059
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,302
-I did touch the cream.
-to frame others at the table.

1060
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,846
We were both at the same table last night.

1061
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,057
Let's say you applied it with your hands.

1062
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,185
If you were the culprit, it would show up
on the things you touched.

1063
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:54,812
-Let's check.
-He might've left a trace.

1064
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:56,855
You never know.

1065
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,649
EXAMINING THE MURDER WEAPON

1066
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,571
Should we do this in the dark?

1067
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,572
NO TRACE FOUND

1068
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:06,782
Go ahead.

1069
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:09,493
INSPECTING THE VALVE TIMER

1070
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,746
Do you see anything?

1071
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,498
You're barking up the wrong tree.

1072
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,752
THE RUSSIAN DOLLS

1073
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,129
Nothing's on them.

1074
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,256
Unbelievable.

1075
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,511
Wait.

1076
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:29,471
Let's say An Jeweler did it.

1077
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,933
Didn't she come inside this vault?
You think she killed him then?

1078
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,476
AN JEWELER WAS IN THE VAULT
WITH KIM BONG-CHEON

1079
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:39,147
-We can't tell from what she said.
-That's what she said.

1080
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,316
-Then it's possible.
-Kim Bong-cheon invited her in.

1081
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,401
What time was that?

1082
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:45,279
That was past 10 p.m.

1083
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:49,324
And the person who came here at 11 p.m.
couldn't have known who was in the vault.

1084
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,744
I went to his office at 10:10 p.m.

1085
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:56,415
But then he suddenly told me
to go into the vault as well.

1086
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:59,084
I couldn't sneak up on him anymore.

1087
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:01,795
So I gave up
and left his office at 10:30 p.m.

1088
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,547
It wasn't your day either.

1089
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,466
From 10:30 p.m. to 11:10 p.m.,

1090
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,219
the chairman was nowhere to be found.

1091
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,638
If he had already been dead by then,

1092
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,432
it would've given Ms. Jeweler

1093
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:16,977
more than enough time to commit the murder

1094
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:20,814
and access to the vault.

1095
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:25,694
Okay, we have to piece
the story together in our minds

1096
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,654
to point to the killer.

1097
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,323
Even if your theory may not be flawless,

1098
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:32,034
please be clear
and explain why you believe

1099
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,827
the person you have in mind is the killer.

1100
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,580
Ms. Jeweler was at the top of my list,

1101
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:39,458
but now I'm completely split.

1102
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:40,542
Here's why.

1103
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,002
In Monkfish's case,

1104
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:45,714
his ignorance ruined his life
and cost him his beloved wife's life.

1105
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:48,675
Given that, his motive

1106
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:52,346
for wanting to take us all out
seems more plausible.

1107
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:55,933
Assuming Mr. Monkfish is the killer,

1108
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:58,435
how would he have gotten into the vault?

1109
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:00,312
That's where the murder took place.

1110
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:04,441
HOW DID JANG MONKFISH GET INTO THE VAULT?

1111
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,321
That reminds me.

1112
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:10,948
Mr. Monkfish

1113
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:16,244
always accompanied Chairman Kim
when he delivered the payout.

1114
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:17,996
-Mr. Monkfish?
-They came together?

1115
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,500
-He always came with?
-I've seen him once or twice.

1116
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:22,668
Where did you meet?

1117
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,461
-In my office on the 8th.
-I see.

1118
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:25,921
But it occurred to me

1119
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:30,258
that he could've had easy access
to the vault compared to others.

1120
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,094
After all, Chairman Kim trusted him.

1121
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:35,097
He could've lowered his guard.

1122
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:38,350
She said Monkfish always
accompanied Bong-cheon to City Hall

1123
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:40,143
when he delivered the payouts.

1124
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:44,731
Anyone with a government official ID card
can access the City Hall Records Archive.

1125
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,401
Monkfish has nimble hands.

1126
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:50,821
He's a master of bottom dealing
and an expert in disguise.

1127
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,239
That means he could've easily

1128
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,866
stolen an ID card from someone

1129
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:59,371
and regularly gone to City Hall
to read the files.

1130
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:09,339
I can't help
but suspect Ms. Jeweler the most.

1131
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:15,470
The killer was someone who had a reason
to plan such an intricate murder.

1132
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:18,724
To them, all of this was symbolic.

1133
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:23,353
The killer had a reason
for bringing us here to kill us.

1134
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,564
Whose motive
seems strongest in comparison?

1135
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:28,775
Hers.

1136
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,445
All right, that'll be all.

1137
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,239
Using motive, evidence,

1138
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:38,201
circumstances, vault access,
and alibis as your basis,

1139
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:41,872
I want you to vote
for who you suspect most.

1140
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:46,168
-I'm still on the fence.
-I'm completely clueless.

1141
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,713
WHY DID IT HAVE TO HAPPEN TODAY
AT THIS PLACE WITH THEM IN ATTENDANCE?

1142
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:55,302
WHO WAS BENT ON SEVERING THE CHAIN
THAT BOUND THEM SO LONG?

1143
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,264
WHO IS THE TRUE CULPRIT?

1144
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:00,932
You villains.

1145
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:05,145
At this rate,
I'll die before we catch the culprit.

1146
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,354
CAST YOUR VOTE BASED ON THE CLUES

1147
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,898
I'll trust my instincts.

1148
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:13,111
This was really tough.

1149
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,280
My mind was flooded
with theories and possibilities.

1150
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:19,826
Everything that happened

1151
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,203
traces back to the landfill.

1152
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:24,581
That landfill later became the site
of Heoyoung Casino.

1153
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:26,124
Jang Monkfish

1154
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:29,586
got a job at the casino,
cultivated ties with Kim Bong-cheon,

1155
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:32,464
lived on-site, and learned its workings.

1156
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:36,009
From the chairman's vault
to the hidden gas control room,

1157
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:40,680
he must've studied and learned
how to navigate those secret spaces.

1158
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:43,892
My vote goes to Jang Monkfish.

1159
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:49,606
JEON MAYOR CHOSE JANG MONKFISH

1160
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,361
I hope I'm right.

1161
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:55,445
AN JEWELER: 1, JANG MONKFISH: 1

1162
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:56,530
Please let me be right.

1163
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:05,539
This seems like a crime

1164
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,792
carrying a bold environmental message.

1165
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:11,753
The environmental analysis report

1166
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:14,422
was submitted by An Upright,
An Jeweler's older sister

1167
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,466
and representative of a citizens' group,

1168
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,136
on April 8, 2002
to request a fair analysis.

1169
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,554
It was on this date in 2002.

1170
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:25,392
The person who tempted her
into the deal she'd regret for life

1171
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,311
was none other than casino boss,
Chairman Kim Bong-cheon.

1172
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:33,150
"Upright, how can I live without you?"

1173
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,318
"I'm going to make them pay."

1174
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,530
"Being upright didn't get me so far."

1175
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:41,116
"I felt guilty,
but I had no other choice."

1176
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,993
"I'm sorry, Upright,

1177
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:44,953
for failing to live as upright
as you taught me."

1178
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:49,833
An Upright sacrificed her life

1179
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:52,752
for a noble and righteous cause.

1180
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:56,923
Think of how Jeweler must've felt
upon finding out about it later.

1181
00:52:57,007 --> 00:53:01,261
To save her sister's life,
Jeweler did what she despised the most.

1182
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:03,513
The remorse and the guilt
would've been overwhelming,

1183
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:06,683
and that could've eaten away at her.

1184
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,477
A former civil servant

1185
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,438
went on to earn 100 billion won.

1186
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:15,442
Her revenge was 20 years in the making.

1187
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,944
That alone shows her resolve.

1188
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,989
After killing Kim Bong-cheon,

1189
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:24,201
she staged an explosion
for those involved to witness

1190
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:28,163
and released methane to suffocate them.

1191
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:31,249
In doing so, she could alert the public
to the dangers of methane

1192
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,419
while also uncovering the corruption.

1193
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:38,673
She could then spread
her sister's message,

1194
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:41,801
end her own life, and reunite
with her older sister to apologize.

1195
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,471
That seems to be
the heartbreaking picture she painted.

1196
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,139
MAYBE SHE DREAMED
OF THEIR OWN ETERNAL HAPPINESS…

1197
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,560
I'm afraid you'll have to be
put behind bars today.

1198
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:52,562
JANG MONKFISH

1199
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:55,941
AND KIM SINGER CHOSE AN JEWELER

1200
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,609
What can I do when you're the killer?

1201
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:06,034
AN JEWELER: 3, JANG MONKFISH: 1

1202
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:10,497
I can't shake off my suspicion
about this UV light.

1203
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,918
Let's take a look at where Monkfish
dropped his jacket button.

1204
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,712
If the person I suspect
really is the killer,

1205
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:20,590
he moved the body onto the stage

1206
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:24,010
and returned the bullets to the gun box,

1207
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,513
as though he wanted to
leave the scene in order.

1208
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,182
This is driving me insane.

1209
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,810
Is there really nothing here?

1210
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:34,729
If I read him correctly,
he might've wiped everything down

1211
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,231
to remove the fluorescent cream.

1212
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,693
Maybe that's why nothing showed up.

1213
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,449
It's you.

1214
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,786
AN JEWELER CHOSE JANG MONKFISH

1215
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:54,916
AN JEWELER: 3, JANG MONKFISH: 2

1216
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,626
The killer

1217
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,713
is someone responsible for
the tragedy surrounding the landfill.

1218
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,840
In repentance,

1219
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:05,802
they were prepared to die as well.

1220
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:09,347
What he did in ignorance

1221
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:12,434
led to the tragedy
that claimed his wife's life.

1222
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,019
He must've believed himself unforgivable

1223
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:18,064
so that he felt the need to go
to his late wife to seek her forgiveness.

1224
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,442
I believe that's why he planned this.

1225
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:22,819
He likely killed Kim Bong-cheon

1226
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:25,030
to take revenge for his mentor's death.

1227
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:28,533
He then gathered everyone
tied to the landfill pollution

1228
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:29,909
and decided to end his life.

1229
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:35,165
That's why he threw out
his asthma medication.

1230
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:40,670
Monkfish had already given up
on living the remainder of his life.

1231
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:43,757
Hats off to you.

1232
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:48,219
JANG CHEF CHOSE JANG MONKFISH

1233
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:51,348
AN JEWELER: 3, JANG MONKFISH: 3

1234
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,484
Both suspects had a strong motive.

1235
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:05,987
They also had access to the vault,
as they were close to Chairman Kim

1236
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,822
than anyone else.

1237
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:12,869
Moreover, only those two knew there was
a gun and where it was kept.

1238
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:16,498
What swayed me at the very end was…

1239
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:22,337
FINAL VOTE COMPLETE

1240
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:27,592
The fifth episode of the deduction game,
Crime Scene Zero.

1241
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:30,720
The results of the nail-biting
deduction game to find the culprit

1242
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,806
of the murder of the casino boss.

1243
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:38,061
Let's see who received the most votes
as the real culprit.

1244
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:41,731
We will now announce the results.

1245
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:45,693
I'll at least get to die
knowing who the killer is.

1246
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:49,656
The ultimate deduction game,
Crime Scene Zero.

1247
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:54,160
First, we will announce who was excluded
from the final list of suspects.

1248
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,622
The results of the final vote
to determine the culprit are as follows.

1249
00:56:57,705 --> 00:57:00,083
With zero votes,

1250
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,251
Kim Singer,

1251
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:03,503
Jang Chef,

1252
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:06,005
and Jeon Mayor,
you are excluded from the final lineup.

1253
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,675
-What on earth did you people do?
-As expected.

1254
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,429
-You're crazy.
-Mr. Monkfish.

1255
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:15,432
And so, those identified as suspects

1256
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:19,310
were Jang Monkfish and An Jeweler.

1257
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:22,272
I can completely understand
why either of you did it.

1258
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:24,274
They both have my sympathy.

1259
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:25,775
I can understand too.

1260
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,611
The ultimate deduction game,
Crime Scene Zero.

1261
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:32,532
The results of the final vote
of the murder of the casino boss.

1262
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,452
The player who was ultimately identified
as the culprit is…

1263
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,123
In a four to three split…

1264
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:41,458
-No way.
-A four to three split?

1265
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,042
A four to three split?

1266
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,712
With four votes…

1267
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:53,178
it's Jang Monkfish.

1268
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,763
FINAL SUSPECT: JANG MONKFISH

1269
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:56,890
Are you serious?

1270
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:58,975
What the heck?

1271
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:01,644
Jang Monkfish, you've been identified
as the final suspect.

1272
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,688
-Are you serious?
-Please enter the jail.

1273
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:05,899
Drop the act and get in there.

1274
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:08,693
Should I be opening the door myself?

1275
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:12,197
-Get in there and lock it.
-Who was it? Some idiots botched this.

1276
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,865
The players who voted for Jang Monkfish,

1277
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:18,119
An Jeweler, Jeon Mayor,
Detective Park, and Jang Chef,

1278
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:19,704
please step forward.

1279
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:22,123
-That idiot.
-I can't believe him.

1280
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,209
What's going on?

1281
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:25,668
What did you do?

1282
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,462
Am I the class idiot again?

1283
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:30,173
If Jang Monkfish is the real culprit,

1284
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:32,926
An Jeweler, Jeon Mayor, and Jang Chef

1285
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,802
will each win two million won,

1286
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:39,307
and Detective Park
will win one million won.

1287
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,519
If Jang Monkfish is not the culprit,

1288
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:45,730
the real killer will claim the prize money
of all other players,

1289
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:47,982
a total of ten million won.

1290
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:50,026
This has to be a joke.

1291
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,110
The fifth episode

1292
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:54,239
of the ultimate deduction game,
Crime Scene Zero.

1293
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,658
Jang Monkfish has been voted

1294
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:59,327
as the culprit
in the murder of the casino boss.

1295
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:04,207
Is he really the culprit
who killed Kim Bong-cheon?

1296
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,168
Mr. Jang Monkfish.

1297
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,087
Are you

1298
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:13,007
Kim Bong-cheon's killer?

1299
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:19,514
Yes or no?

1300
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:21,391
Are you kidding me?

1301
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:22,684
Yes or no?

1302
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:25,520
-Are you kidding me?
-Come on!

1303
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:28,147
My heart almost jumped out of my chest.
I'm a newbie, please don't do this.

1304
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:29,232
Ma'am, please.

1305
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:31,192
I'm going to get stomach cramps.

1306
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:33,152
-I'm so nervous.
-It's a parting gift.

1307
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,404
This is nerve-racking.

1308
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,614
Mr. Jang Monkfish.

1309
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:38,366
Are you

1310
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:41,828
Kim Bong-cheon's killer?

1311
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:42,912
It can't be.

1312
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:55,800
Yes, he is!

1313
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:58,011
Yes, he is!

1314
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:00,263
I can't believe I guessed right.

1315
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,225
-It wasn't you?
-No, it wasn't.

1316
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,645
I was so close.

1317
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,480
I almost had you!

1318
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:13,192
Chime this in your cell.
It'll help you calm down.

1319
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,444
Is this my prison food?

1320
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:19,907
Wait, who else voted for An Jeweler?

1321
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:22,118
-You.
-Who else?

1322
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:24,495
-She got my first vote.
-The detective's first vote.

1323
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:26,706
-Mr. Monkfish also voted for me.
-And the killer?

1324
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:30,001
-I'm the class idiot.
-They came close to tying because of you.

1325
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:32,545
-I was on the fence too.
-Maybe I should just die.

1326
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:35,173
Bang!

1327
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,508
The embarrassment is killing me.

1328
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:42,263
I should've killed you all.

1329
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:45,391
-I should've killed you all.
-You should've.

1330
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:49,270
We'll now announce
the key piece of evidence you missed.

1331
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:50,897
What was it?

1332
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:53,650
-The UV light!
-Try turning it on.

1333
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:57,070
I knew that was connected to something.

1334
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:59,781
-Life isn't worth living anymore.
-Where are we supposed to use it?

1335
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:03,701
-His handkerchief.
-His handkerchief.

1336
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:06,079
IF YOU SHINE THE UV LIGHT
ON THE HANDKERCHIEF

1337
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,413
-What is it?
-My gosh!

1338
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,791
There's so much cream on it.

1339
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:12,502
-He used that to wipe his hands clean.
-Is that what he did?

1340
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:14,128
Did you wipe your hands with this?

1341
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:15,463
I used this

1342
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:19,384
to wipe the fluorescent cream
off my hands.

1343
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,844
-You're quite thorough, aren't you?
-He tried to cover his tracks.

1344
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:25,139
Didn't you pull out
his handkerchief earlier?

1345
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:28,059
I did, but it never occurred to me
to check it with the UV light.

1346
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:32,146
(HIS HANDS WERE ALREADY WIPED CLEAN)

1347
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,774
It's the cream card sharks use
to mark cards when we cheat.

1348
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:36,651
Look at the crucial evidence we have.

1349
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:37,777
May I?

1350
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:39,654
Go ahead.

1351
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:47,704
-Sorry about that.
-It's only visible with special glasses.

1352
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:50,998
HE NARROWLY ESCAPED AN ARREST

1353
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:54,502
I could've deceived every last one of you.

1354
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:55,837
And with that,

1355
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,506
all cases of the ultimate deduction game,

1356
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:01,467
Crime Scene Zero, have come to an end.

1357
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,721
Well done, players.

1358
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:05,847
Thank you.

1359
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:08,891
-Good job, guys.
-Thank you.

1360
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:11,269
-I'm glad we caught the killer.
-I know, what a relief.

1361
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:15,356
If only there were
two more idiots like Kim Singer.

1362
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:23,281
THE FULL STORY BEHIND
THE MURDER OF THE CASINO BOSS

1363
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:25,366
Jang Monkfish was a struggling fisherman

1364
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:27,702
from Downfall Town
in Heoyoung Industrial City.

1365
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:30,705
He took out a hefty loan
to purchase a fishing boat,

1366
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:34,333
but he only sank deeper into debt
as his catch did not improve.

1367
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:37,712
One day, he found
a large number of dead fish.

1368
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:40,006
Believing it was not an issue,

1369
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:44,635
he sold them for a good profit.

1370
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:47,847
Around that time, Jeon Four Terms,
the mayor of Heoyoung Industrial City,

1371
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,974
won the country's bid
to co-host the World Ball with Japan,

1372
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:52,518
announced plans to redevelop
the decaying Downfall Town,

1373
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:56,314
and pushed residents
to move with resettlement funds

1374
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:58,566
that were far from adequate.

1375
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:01,235
Jang Monkfish and his wife were resisting,

1376
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:04,947
refusing to move
for less than fair compensation.

1377
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:06,365
One late night,

1378
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:10,077
Kim Bong-cheon and his hired thugs
stormed into the couple's home.

1379
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:13,164
Knocked unconscious
from the brutal beating,

1380
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:15,249
Jang Monkfish later came to,
dazed and disoriented,

1381
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:17,418
at a nearby landfill.

1382
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:20,421
When he saw his wife buried next to him,

1383
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:23,508
he tried to free her
but blacked out again.

1384
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:25,802
The next time he woke up,
he was in a hospital,

1385
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:29,722
where he was told that he had almost
suffocated from the landfill's methane

1386
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:34,268
and that his wife had died
from heavy metal poisoning.

1387
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:38,272
Homeless and widowed,
he lost everything he held dear

1388
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:40,441
and considered ending his life.

1389
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:43,861
But then, he was offered a new way of life
from the card shark Officer Hyeon

1390
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:46,739
who had saved him and his wife
and brought them to the hospital.

1391
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,449
Officer Hyeon took him under his wings,

1392
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:51,702
and under his mentorship,
Monkfish became a card shark himself.

1393
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:56,123
The two of them then began clearing out
gambling dens across the country.

1394
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:58,000
But then one day,

1395
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:59,544
Officer Hyeon

1396
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:01,838
left for Heoyoung Industrial City
for a high-stakes game

1397
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:04,549
only to be found brutally murdered.

1398
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:09,011
The suspected killer
turned out to be Kim Bong-cheon,

1399
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:12,223
the former thug who had risen to become
the kingpin in the gambling world.

1400
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:14,684
From Officer Hyeon's notebook,

1401
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:16,727
Jang Monkfish learned
that the former police officer

1402
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:21,482
had been investigating the corruption
of Jeon Four Terms and Kim Bong-cheon.

1403
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:23,442
Learning that Kim Bong-cheon
had taken not only his wife's

1404
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:27,321
but also his mentor's life
filled him with rage.

1405
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:28,364
To get his revenge,

1406
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:31,409
he sharpened his card shark skills
and mastered the art of disguise,

1407
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:35,162
eventually leading
Kim Bong-cheon to take him in.

1408
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:38,624
As Heoyoung Land's house player,

1409
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,794
he waited for
the perfect moment to strike.

1410
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:45,548
While at Heoyoung Land, he ran into
Jang Chef and recognized his name.

1411
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:48,593
While revisiting his memories,
he came to check his wife's medical record

1412
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:52,430
and discovered that Jang Chef
was her former doctor.

1413
01:04:52,513 --> 01:04:54,724
Her medical report
listed only a common cold

1414
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:58,561
despite the high level
of heavy metals in her blood.

1415
01:04:58,644 --> 01:05:01,606
This meant his wife
had been exposed to heavy metals

1416
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:04,775
long before she was buried
in the landfill.

1417
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:07,153
That was when Jang Monkfish remembered

1418
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:10,239
the note he had read
in Officer Hyeon's notebook.

1419
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:15,620
Convinced the answers were hidden
in the City Hall Records Archive,

1420
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:19,498
he joined Kim Bong-cheon as his aide
during a meeting with Jeon Mayor

1421
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,083
at Heoyoung Special City Hall.

1422
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:24,003
Using his nimble hands,
he swiped a government official ID card,

1423
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:26,464
slipped into the archive,

1424
01:05:26,547 --> 01:05:29,091
and discovered
the environmental analysis report

1425
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:30,384
on Heoyoung Industrial City.

1426
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:32,637
His investigation based on the report

1427
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,599
finally unlocked
a chain of shocking truths.

1428
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:39,101
Jeon Four Terms, the former mayor
of Heoyoung Industrial City,

1429
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:42,605
had built a landfill in Downfall Town,
ignoring the ban near residential zones,

1430
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:45,524
so he could use state compensation

1431
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:48,444
to make up for
the city's financial deficit.

1432
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:50,237
Kim Singer took kickbacks

1433
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:52,949
and overlooked industrial waste
being dumped into the landfill,

1434
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:56,535
causing polluted leachate
to flow into the sea.

1435
01:05:56,619 --> 01:06:00,081
The poisoned fish were then caught
and sold by Jang Monkfish,

1436
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:02,375
which led his wife
and the residents of Downfall Town

1437
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:04,669
to fall ill from heavy metal poisoning.

1438
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:06,629
Jang Chef, consumed by ambition,

1439
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:09,674
falsely diagnosed such cases
as a common cold

1440
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:14,512
and informed Jeon Four Terms
to secure generous compensation.

1441
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:16,514
As the Korea-Japan World Ball approached,

1442
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:18,808
Jeon Four Terms sought to quash
any possible scandal

1443
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:21,143
by hiring Kim Bong-cheon as a thug

1444
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:25,064
to forcibly relocate
the residents of Downfall Town.

1445
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:27,942
Meanwhile, An Jeweler and Kim Bong-cheon

1446
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:31,821
embezzled relocation funds by paying
the locals less than they were owed.

1447
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:36,325
Those who refused to move
were buried alive in the landfill

1448
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:38,494
and later filed as missing
by Kim Bong-cheon himself.

1449
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:40,037
Years later,

1450
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:42,540
Jeon Mayor, daughter of Jeon Four Terms,

1451
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:44,917
partnered with Kim Bong-cheon
to build Heoyoung Land

1452
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:48,254
on the very landfill
that had seen so much tragedy,

1453
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:50,381
even before it was approved
for development.

1454
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:54,885
They hid the dark past
beneath the glamour of the casino.

1455
01:06:55,636 --> 01:06:58,848
Jang Monkfish came to see
that he, too, was tied to this ugly truth,

1456
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:00,808
as he had sold the contaminated fish

1457
01:07:00,891 --> 01:07:06,105
that poisoned his wife
and led to her death.

1458
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:09,358
Overcome with grief and anger,
he decided to make those involved

1459
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:14,780
face their role in the truth
and end their lives as well as his.

1460
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:19,410
He chose the first anniversary
of Heoyoung Land to carry out his plan.

1461
01:07:19,493 --> 01:07:22,538
His plan was to release the methane
collected from the landfill below

1462
01:07:22,621 --> 01:07:24,665
to suffocate everyone inside.

1463
01:07:25,249 --> 01:07:26,500
The day before,

1464
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:29,879
his VVIP table game ended
earlier than planned due to An Jeweler,

1465
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:31,797
and he began making preparations

1466
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:35,426
to kill Kim Bong-cheon
and execute a mass murder.

1467
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:38,345
Remembering the fluorescent cream
on his hands from the game,

1468
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:41,640
he quickly wiped them clean
with his handkerchief.

1469
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:44,143
He then entered the gas control room
behind the stage

1470
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:45,853
in the fifth-floor VVIP game room,

1471
01:07:45,936 --> 01:07:49,356
installed a timer on the methane gas valve

1472
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,650
set to trigger in 24 hours,

1473
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:55,196
and removed one of the batteries
from the gas leak detector.

1474
01:07:55,279 --> 01:07:57,656
The 7th, the day before
the first anniversary event,

1475
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,033
was when Kim Bong-cheon

1476
01:07:59,116 --> 01:08:02,703
would sort out the casino's earnings alone
in his vault each month.

1477
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:05,372
Seeing this as his chance,

1478
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:09,168
Jang Monkfish hid in the chairman's office
beforehand, took the hidden gun,

1479
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:14,590
and threatened Kim Bong-cheon
into opening the vault at gunpoint.

1480
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:17,968
Once they were both
inside the soundproof vault,

1481
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:21,347
he confronted Kim Bong-cheon
about his crimes

1482
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:23,265
and shot him twice, killing him.

1483
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:26,852
His next step
was to gather everyone at the event.

1484
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,729
From Kim Bong-cheon's email account,

1485
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:30,731
he scheduled anniversary event invitations

1486
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:34,652
to be sent to five people,
himself included,

1487
01:08:34,735 --> 01:08:40,199
and sent delay notices
to the other VVIP guests.

1488
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:43,536
He collected the bullets fired,
placed them in the box with the gun,

1489
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,788
and returned the box to its hiding spot.

1490
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:49,500
He dragged the rug
with the body on it onto the stage,

1491
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:53,170
repositioned the stage lights
to speed up decomposition,

1492
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:56,382
placed a set of five Russian dolls
in his mouth,

1493
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:59,426
and painted
Kim Bong-cheon's lips bright red

1494
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:02,012
to identify him as the largest one
of the dolls.

1495
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:05,516
On the day of Heoyoung Land's
first anniversary event,

1496
01:09:05,599 --> 01:09:09,228
he planned for Kim Bong-cheon's body
to explode from methane,

1497
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:13,566
forcing the five guests he had invited

1498
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:17,403
to confront the damage they had done

1499
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:23,325
before dying from the methane
he had timed to release.
