1
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:11,136
What?

2
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,388
His name here
shouldn't be "Park Real Son."

3
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:15,432
-He's not Park Village Head.
-Let's see the photo.

4
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,726
-Did he assume a new identity?
-Wait, this is our village's--

5
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,769
-Wait, what?
-No way!

6
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,813
-Wait, what?
-No way!

7
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:23,606
-Wait, that's our village's--
-Wait, what?

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,900
PARK VILLAGE HEAD'S ID IS FAKE?

9
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,694
Who changes their identity like this?

10
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,738
-This is such a sloppy way to do it.
-Unbelievable.

11
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,656
-He's grabbing something!
-You just changed the photo!

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,783
-He's grabbing something!
-You just changed the photo!

13
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:39,205
-You'll anger the gods!
-Hang on.

14
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,458
Come on, man. That's not funny.

15
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,876
Fine, I'll let you live.

16
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,919
-Hurry up and explain this to us.
-He's scary.

17
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,464
-Seriously, what is this?
-I'm scared to go near him.

18
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,216
Why did you stick your photo
on Park Real Son's ID?

19
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,676
He must be dead.

20
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,054
No, I…

21
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,056
If I'm being honest,

22
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,725
when I came to this village,

23
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:01,603
I had to find ways to settle here.

24
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:04,606
I saw there was an old lady
who was living alone,

25
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,566
so I took care of her
as if she were my own mother.

26
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:10,195
I saw her family photo and found out
that her son and I look alike.

27
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,739
She even got us mixed up
and thought I was her real son,

28
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:15,158
so I figured I should act like I was him.

29
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:16,493
And then what?

30
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,370
-So what happened to Park--
-All right. I'll come clean.

31
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:20,997
-Okay.
-I…

32
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:22,791
I…

33
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,668
I have killed someone before.

34
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,129
I have killed someone before.

35
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,841
-What the heck?
-I had no choice.

36
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,843
-When? Who? Park Real Son?
-Who? Park Real Son?

37
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,637
Park Real Son came back.

38
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,472
Of course,
that's typical for identity theft.

39
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,641
That's how it always goes.

40
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,601
-Always.
-But let me make this clear.

41
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,104
I didn't kill Jang Je-in.

42
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,980
Where did you hide Park Real Son's body?

43
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:46,981
Wait a minute.

44
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,067
-Jeez, you scared me. What is it?
-What is it?

45
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,568
Remember that emergency text

46
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,113
-about the landslide at 8:35 p.m.?
-The landslide.

47
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,074
-Let's check out the mountain.
-The mountain?

48
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,160
CAN PARK REAL SON'S BODY BE THERE?

49
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,161
Maybe… Let's go.

50
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,579
-No way!
-Hurry. Let's go!

51
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,540
Shouldn't we let him
finish his story first?

52
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,500
Do you have more to tell us?

53
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,335
Darn it.

54
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,465
-There's something here. It's a pit.
-What's with that rope?

55
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,801
-Maybe he hid it there.
-There's something here.

56
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,219
This is…

57
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,762
I said I didn't kill her!

58
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,223
I said I didn't kill her!

59
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,976
I swear I didn't kill Jang Je-in!

60
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,228
-Are we going up or not? Make a decision.
-I'm terrified!

61
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,438
-Hurry. Let's dig before he gets here.
-Come on!

62
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,565
-Hurry.
-Hurry up!

63
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,441
-He's coming!
-Is there a shovel or something?

64
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,861
Okay, we get it. But you're scaring us,
so don't come up here.

65
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,529
I said I didn't kill Jang Je-in.

66
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,655
-We get it.
-Stay there.

67
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,782
-What about Park Real Son?
-Where is he?

68
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:41,286
-Park Real Son's murder alone is enough…
-He'll get arrested anyway.

69
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,204
I dumped him far away from here.

70
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,914
-Far away?
-Very far away.

71
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,293
Mr. Village Head has been suspicious
of outsiders from the start.

72
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:52,338
The killer must be one of the outsiders.

73
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,841
Of course,
Mr. Village Head is absolutely right!

74
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,427
He's always been hostile
toward outsiders in the village.

75
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,887
But it turns out

76
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,014
he was an outsider himself.

77
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,225
How did he end up in this village?

78
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,769
And who is he, really?

79
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,315
-Far away?
-Okay, since you've decided to come clean…

80
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,192
What kept you busy on the eve festival…

81
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,277
-What kept you busy on the eve festival…
-Who's that?

82
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,653
-Someone's here.
-What?

83
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,655
-The hotel manager is here.
-That's Chong Manager.

84
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,866
The manager must've seen something.

85
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,868
-Hey, Chong Manager.
-Hello, Mr. Manager.

86
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,369
Hey, Chong.

87
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,246
-Yes, hello.
-Hello.

88
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,082
The guest staying in Room 305

89
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,417
is Jang Je-in, right?

90
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,960
-Yes, that's correct.
-Right.

91
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:35,048
-What time did she leave yesterday?
-Well…

92
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,342
She took a cab around 10:20 p.m.

93
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,219
-Around 10:20 p.m.?
-She took a cab?

94
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,220
Around 10:20 p.m.?

95
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,554
That's right. I saw her.

96
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,974
Je-in tossed the ring I gave her

97
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,061
and then she took a cab at 10:20 p.m.
to her hospital.

98
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,979
You knew all that and didn't tell us?

99
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,565
Well, you never asked.

100
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,566
To the hospital?

101
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,401
She said she was meeting
someone important,

102
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,154
but who could be more important than me?

103
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,822
Just go lie over there.

104
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:04,369
Who was the important person
the victim was planning to meet?

105
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:08,456
Our top priority is finding out
why Jang Je-in returned to this village

106
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,291
after five years.

107
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:16,589
Did anyone else come by the hotel
who wasn't a guest?

108
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,050
-Mr. Village Head was here.
-Village Head?

109
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,218
-Well…
-When?

110
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:23,179
He was here
throughout the entire eve festival,

111
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,431
but he did step out twice.

112
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,476
Around 9:20 p.m.,
during the shamanic rite,

113
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,228
-he and the governor of Lunacy District
-Oh, him.

114
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,230
-went into our conference room.
-And?

115
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,608
Oh, and he was there
during the singing contest,

116
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,901
but around 10 p.m.,

117
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,988
he suddenly slipped away.

118
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,739
He looked like he was in a hurry.

119
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:42,824
Around 10 p.m.?

120
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,288
What could've kept him so busy
that he couldn't focus on the event?

121
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,205
WHERE DID YOU GO?

122
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,041
This guy's got a secret for sure.

123
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,502
We have to dig deeper into him.

124
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,715
MEANWHILE, PARK VILLAGE HEAD
IS DIGGING DEEPER INTO PARK SHAMAN

125
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,177
What happened to Shaman's younger brother?

126
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,679
She said he went missing,

127
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:05,930
but she gathered his things

128
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,975
and set them up
like she was mourning for the deceased.

129
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:12,729
His case is being overlooked,
so I'm going to dig into it.

130
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:17,942
What's this?

131
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,458
Over here!

132
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,256
Over here!

133
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,675
Gosh, give me a break.

134
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,761
Over here!

135
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,262
What is it?

136
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,555
Come here, hurry.

137
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,851
Who dared disturb my shrine?

138
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,896
The spirits' fury will be upon you!

139
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,523
My goodness.

140
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,609
-Let's lift it up.
-One, two, three.

141
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,320
Oh shit.

142
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,448
Oh shit.

143
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:07,950
What?

144
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,327
What were you thinking?

145
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,828
What's going on?

146
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:12,914
One, two, three.

147
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,957
Oh shit.

148
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,419
-What?
-What were you thinking?

149
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,088
THERE'S A DEAD BODY
INSIDE THE STATUE OF BUDDHA?

150
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,172
Never seen a mummy before?

151
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,340
MEMORIAL TABLET OF THE DEAD, BROTHER

152
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,551
You may find it shocking
if you don't know much about shamanism.

153
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,887
This is a mummy, that's all.

154
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,099
-"Memorial tablet of the dead, Brother."
-That's right.

155
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,809
So that's your brother?

156
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,602
-You said he's missing.
-It must be him.

157
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,271
-"Memorial tablet of the dead, Brother."
-Well…

158
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,981
Fine, you got me.
That's my younger brother.

159
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,486
But you said he went missing.

160
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,280
I did say that, and he did go missing.

161
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,200
-I never said he was still alive.
-But…

162
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,039
Hey, Handsome!

163
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,625
We found her brother's corpse.

164
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,253
-What?
-We found her brother's corpse.

165
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,629
You found a corpse?

166
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,174
-This is her brother?
-Hey, show some respect for the deceased.

167
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,760
-Man, this is…
-Everyone, please take a step back.

168
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,762
Good heavens!

169
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,140
My goodness.

170
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:15,101
-Jeez, that's scary.
-You murderer.

171
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:20,314
How could she have kept
his skeletonized body in there?

172
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,275
It was truly a shock to my eyes.

173
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,444
What's all this fluid?

174
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,029
Are they parts of his body
that decomposed or something?

175
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,531
TRACES OF FLUID FROM THE MUMMIFICATION

176
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,993
-Why didn't you say he was murdered?
-Explain all this to us.

177
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,412
-Where did you find him?
-Why'd you say he was missing?

178
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,038
After he went missing,

179
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,916
the police and I looked everywhere
but couldn't find him.

180
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,295
But while searching
in that mountain over there,

181
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,714
I finally found his body.

182
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,009
But the body was already
severely mutilated.

183
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:51,220
You can't hold a funeral
when the body is in such a state.

184
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,182
If you do, the soul is cursed
to wander the afterlife forever.

185
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,309
So I preserved the body
and attended to him

186
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,145
-while quietly looking into what happened.
-And that's currently ongoing?

187
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,439
How was the body mutilated?

188
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:04,609
-His organs were missing and whatnot.
-His organs?

189
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:05,735
-His organs were gone?
-Yeah.

190
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,111
When exactly did he go missing?

191
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,071
-Five years ago.
-In 2013?

192
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:09,989
Yeah.

193
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:13,284
You'll see in my ledger that I performed
a huge rite in front of the hospital.

194
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,577
That was worth 100 million won.

195
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,746
-It was for a patient there.
-Okay.

196
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,248
I persuaded them, saying they were
possessed by an evil spirit

197
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,250
and performed a huge rite for them.

198
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,628
Then, Je-in reported me to the police,

199
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,255
claiming I was stealing her patients
by performing rites near her hospital.

200
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,258
Right, she was taken into custody
and questioned for ten days.

201
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,260
Yeah, so I was in lockup,

202
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,929
and that's when my brother disappeared.

203
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,556
But the thing is, that's exactly
when Je-in disappeared too.

204
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,726
And the hospital
has been abandoned since then.

205
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,145
-Something big must've happened back then.
-Exactly.

206
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,272
So how could I not suspect her?

207
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,067
It makes sense that I thought,
"Did this bitch report me to the police

208
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,320
and do something to my brother
while I was gone?"

209
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,738
It's natural to think that, no?

210
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,950
They have history. Quite an intense one.

211
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,536
But if she's blaming Je-in

212
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,121
for her younger brother's death,

213
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:04,043
I think that could be
her motive for murder.

214
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,713
First things first, Park Shaman.
Can we see your phone?

215
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,258
-Of course, you can. Here.
-Great.

216
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,884
-Go ahead and look.
-Okay.

217
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,303
Why are you laughing?

218
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,847
-Hey, I knew it. Look at this here.
-What is it?

219
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:20,226
-Where did Chong Manager go? Get him back.
-Why?

220
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,479
She and Chong Manager are close friends.

221
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,814
-They must be dating.
-That's why…

222
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:25,982
He's my client.

223
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,233
The night before the murder,

224
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,986
"Chong, remember the pre-rite meeting
for the eve festival at eight tomorrow?"

225
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,697
"I'll get there 30 minutes early to do…"

226
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,116
On the day of the murder.
"Shaman, sorry for the late reply."

227
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:39,036
"Director Jang left around 10:20 p.m.
She said she was going to the hospital."

228
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,496
-That's all.
-Why was he reporting all this?

229
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,708
He was the one
who told me Je-in was in town.

230
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,418
So I asked him
to keep me updated about her.

231
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,545
-I wanted to see her and find out
-To go see her?

232
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,298
if she was responsible
for my brother's death.

233
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,217
But he only got back to me
at that late hour.

234
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,927
So you couldn't go see her?

235
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,679
-I was here at 10:20 p.m.
-You were here?

236
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,723
So your alibi still holds.

237
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,810
Sounds like all this mess began in 2013.

238
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,478
The hospital was shut down,

239
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,105
Jang Je-in left,

240
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:09,191
and Handsome kept coming back here
every July 31st for the past five years.

241
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,777
Shaman's younger brother
died that year too.

242
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,863
But then again,

243
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,157
there's another mystery

244
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,908
regarding An Doctor.

245
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:22,246
She became suspiciously wealthy
in those five years.

246
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,123
Just what happened to her?

247
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,917
She never elaborated on that,
to be honest.

248
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:31,839
As for this car…

249
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,635
AN DOCTOR'S IV POLE

250
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,513
Look here!

251
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,099
-What is it?
-Over here!

252
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,434
What is it?

253
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,645
Isn't this An Doctor's?

254
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,729
I don't know.

255
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,314
Look.

256
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,942
There's blood on this!

257
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,194
On the IV pole.

258
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,987
Where? Whose blood is it?

259
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,156
-Is it my Je-in's?
-How should we know?

260
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,491
-Where?
-Here.

261
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,326
-Detective, I have something to tell you.
-Yes?

262
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:03,871
I was quietly praying to the gods earlier.

263
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:08,834
I was praying to them to give me wisdom
to solve the case.

264
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,461
I was ready for possession

265
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:11,837
when it struck me.

266
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,632
I figured out what An Doctor
was doing for her VIP patients.

267
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:15,716
-How?
-What is it?

268
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,802
What was that patient's name?
Something Terminal?

269
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,720
-Na Terminal!
-Yes, Na Terminal.

270
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,097
They were a terminal patient

271
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,182
-who paid An Doctor 180 million.
-And?

272
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:26,060
My patients call me their savior.

273
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,814
"Savior"? How? What makes her a savior?

274
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,066
What kind of salvation
can she give terminal patients?

275
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,568
That's when it hit me.

276
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,237
Assisted dying.

277
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,364
Assisted dying.

278
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,075
-Really?
-She's euthanizing them.

279
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,870
She calls herself an orthopedist
but doesn't carry enough surgical tools

280
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,080
to treat her VIP patients.

281
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:49,917
But she does have syringes,
drugs, and an IV pole.

282
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,586
She's getting paid
to illegally euthanize them.

283
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,673
For those kind of patients,
money isn't the issue.

284
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,508
-Because their condition is critical.
-Exactly.

285
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,052
-They just want to find peace.
-Right, because of the pain.

286
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,971
Give me that bag for a minute.

287
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,431
Let's frisk her!

288
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,932
Don't you dare!

289
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,268
-Why, you little…
-Okay, I get it. Stop.

290
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,477
-Just give me your bag.
-Okay.

291
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,273
CELL PHONE HANDED OVER VOLUNTARILY

292
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,399
-What?
-Hang on.

293
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,652
I don't think that's her phone.

294
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,529
-Wait, then whose is it?
-Whose is it?

295
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,822
An Doctor's phone is here.

296
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,782
-An Doctor's phone is here.
-Right here.

297
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,201
-Isn't that Na Terminal's phone?
-Is it?

298
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,704
This must be the VIP's.

299
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,416
Look. An Doctor wrote,
"I'm running late due to the landslide."

300
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,501
-Then this is the VIP's.
-It must be.

301
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,878
-What?
-Look at this.

302
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,630
ON THE VIP'S CELL PHONE

303
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,091
"Euthanasia live stream"?

304
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,761
See? I told you she performed euthanasia.

305
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,554
You're an amazing shaman.

306
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,140
-It's not Na Terminal's, but the VIP's.
-Truly amazing.

307
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,808
-Here, look at this.
-What is it?

308
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:48,851
There's a video.

309
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,188
A LIVE VIDEO?

310
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,398
Hello.

311
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,025
This is Eat Well and Die Well.

312
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,820
The big day is finally here.

313
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,949
Enjoy the video,

314
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,702
and I hope all of you will succeed

315
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,037
in unaliving yourselves.

316
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,502
Are you ready?

317
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,129
Yes.

318
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,174
Any last words you'd like to say?

319
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,301
-This is An Doctor's voice.
-Yeah, it is.

320
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,637
You're really a doctor, right?

321
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,388
Of course, I am.

322
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,599
I'm Director Jang Je-in.

323
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,476
JANG JE-IN'S EMPLOYEE ID

324
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,727
-What?
-She's talking.

325
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,812
She impersonated her.

326
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,815
Wow, she was pretending to be Je-in.

327
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,691
It's not going to hurt, is it?

328
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,446
Of course not. This is the quick
and relaxing LOVE DIVE consultation.

329
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,406
-"LOVE DIVE"?
-"Quick and relaxing LOVE DIVE"?

330
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,408
-That sounds familiar.
-That website.

331
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,368
JOIN US WHEN DATING GETS TOUGH

332
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:52,998
Five, four, three, two, one.

333
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,586
Jeez, you're gonna croak anyway.
What's with all the bothersome questions?

334
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,381
-Oh my.
-Oh, that's terrifying.

335
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,800
Hold your breath and life die

336
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,971
And that's it
for today's exciting euthanasia!

337
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,310
Huh? What the?

338
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,772
-She said, "Huh? What the?"
-And that part got recorded.

339
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,482
-Everyone.
-What's up?

340
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,192
I discovered the truth behind LOVE DIVE.

341
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,194
-LOVE DIVE!
-What is it?

342
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,281
This looks like an online community
run by An Doctor.

343
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,949
Look, it says "Savior" here.

344
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,662
"Join us when dating gets tough."
It looks like a dating counseling space.

345
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,873
-That's a facade.
-That's how she set it up,

346
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,457
-but actually--
-Over here.

347
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,501
I found an option to switch modes.

348
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,336
Click it, and it turns into dark mode.

349
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,089
"Join us when dating gets tough.
Hold your breath and dive."

350
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:45,175
"Join us when living gets tough.
Hold your breath and life die."

351
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:49,013
-Oh, you're right.
-So in light mode, it's about dating.

352
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:52,600
But when you switch to dark mode,
it's about death consultations.

353
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,894
ANESTHETIC → NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKING AGENT
→ TOXIC SUBSTANCE

354
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,354
THREE DRUGS ADMINISTERED IN ORDER,
QUICK AND PAINLESS DEATH GUARANTEED

355
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,522
DATING COUNSELING, REQUIRED HEARTS

356
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,733
TIME REQUIRED, LEVEL OF PAIN & COST
(♥ X 1 = 10 MILLION WON)

357
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,693
Where the heck
did you euthanize all of them?

358
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:03,861
Euthanasia?

359
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,404
We have all the proof right here.

360
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,864
"Hold your breath and dive."

361
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,199
I didn't euthanize them.

362
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,326
I saved them.

363
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,328
And where did you do that?

364
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,664
In my Je-in's hospital?

365
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,917
In the nurses' station
on the fourth floor.

366
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,209
-Nurses' station.
-Let's go.

367
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,047
Okay, first question.

368
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,341
Did you or did you not impersonate Je-in?

369
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,675
-I did.
-I knew it.

370
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,093
Did you ever get caught?

371
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,178
No, never.

372
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,888
As for the ID card,

373
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,891
I only took it when she threw it out
after shutting down the hospital.

374
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,310
But why did you pretend to be her?

375
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,479
Because this is an abandoned hospital,

376
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,898
and I'm not so well-known as a doctor,

377
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,442
some VIP patients have trouble
putting their faith in me.

378
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,319
So I show them this ID
to get them on board.

379
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,571
-You've done that for five years?
-Yes.

380
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,783
So when did you kill the VIP in the video?

381
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,743
If you consider the timing,

382
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,204
Je-in took a cab at 10:20 p.m.
and came here.

383
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,207
She could've crossed paths with An Doctor
while she was performing the procedure.

384
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,751
-What time did you do it?
-The director's office is right next door.

385
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,920
Something could've easily gone down.

386
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,715
Okay, let me tell you
what I haven't before.

387
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,218
-I did see Je-in here.
-What?

388
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,427
-I told you.
-When?

389
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,679
Around 10:27 p.m.

390
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,681
You mentioned the wheelchair earlier.

391
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,225
So you euthanize your clients,
load them onto a wheelchair,

392
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,810
and dump them in the lake.

393
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,061
That's right.

394
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,147
Then you came back?

395
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,066
-So you came from the lake.
-Normally, I don't.

396
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,652
Oh, so you came back to kill Je-in.

397
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,820
Listen.

398
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,572
I performed the procedure here,
moved the body with a wheelchair,

399
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,367
and then got to the parking lot
where you saw the wheelchair.

400
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,203
I got that far until Je-in came in
out of nowhere.

401
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,121
Right!

402
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,872
So I hid behind the wheelchair.

403
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,250
Then the fireworks started going off.

404
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,670
I took that chance to load the body
in my trunk and then went to the lake.

405
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,588
But because I was impersonating Je-in,

406
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,633
I got worried she might've found out
about my procedures.

407
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,553
So I had to come back to check
and see why Je-in had come back here.

408
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,054
What did you see when you came back?

409
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:57,266
She wasn't here, and then I was
immediately summoned as a suspect.

410
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,227
-No, I think she's lying right now.
-That can't be right.

411
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,270
Listen.

412
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,063
-At the end of that live video,
-Yeah?

413
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,983
the VIP was already dead, right?

414
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,318
But she went, "Huh? What the?"

415
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,653
Huh? What the?

416
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,530
I bet that's when she saw Je-in.

417
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,907
No, I only said that
because I had just found the camera.

418
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:17,494
I'd never seen a VIP client
who streamed their procedure.

419
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,163
There's no proof of that though.

420
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,457
How do we know it wasn't because of Je-in?

421
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,084
If she ran into Je-in
while performing euthanasia,

422
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,795
she could've impulsively murdered her.

423
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,965
Why did she have to come back
to the hospital from the lake?

424
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,508
If there's one thing we know,

425
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,011
it's that the culprit always returns
to the scene of the crime.

426
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,346
Maybe she came back
after dumping the VIP's body

427
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:41,185
to take care of Je-in's body
that was hanging on the wall.

428
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,562
Okay, everyone. Come with me.

429
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,148
Let's continue the conversation over here.

430
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,318
-What's the matter?
-Diesel!

431
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:54,114
This diesel container is identical
to the ones in the Yeonjidol Gas Station.

432
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,533
-You're right.
-It even says "Yeonjidol Gas Station."

433
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,578
This must've been used for something.

434
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,662
Look at this.

435
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,373
This is the fire hydrant box,
and this is the circuit breaker box.

436
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,126
CIRCUIT BREAKER BOX

437
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,420
Wait, hold on.

438
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,714
-"Fuel with diesel"!
-It's fueled with diesel.

439
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,801
"Press the power switch on C,
the control panel."

440
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,677
Shouldn't we turn on the power first?

441
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,929
Power.

442
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,180
Power up, go!

443
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,224
-The power…
-It's not working.

444
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,683
POWER WON'T TURN ON

445
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,228
It says we have to supply A
with sufficient diesel fuel.

446
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,731
A is the fuel tank. This is where
we're supposed to put in the fuel.

447
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,817
-We have to put in the diesel.
-We do?

448
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,235
Let's get some from over there!

449
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,861
Go get it, quick!

450
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,738
-Go get it, quick!
-But I'm the detective.

451
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,740
-Go get it, quick!
-The youngest should go. Go on.

452
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,368
GET A MOVE ON, HANDSOME

453
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,203
-Go fetch it.
-Okay, I'll be right on that!

454
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,330
It's too late for that.

455
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,124
That lazy punk.

456
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,501
-Sir, I'll fetch it.
-Don't worry about it.

457
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,669
I'm the youngest.

458
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,004
So there was diesel fuel right here.

459
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,924
-We just need one, right? Or two?
-I'll take two back just in case.

460
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,553
-Is it really going to work now?
-I bet it's going to work.

461
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,221
-That's incredible.
-Okay, let's go.

462
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,515
-Were you waiting for me, An Doctor?
-No, I wasn't!

463
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,850
I wasn't.

464
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,434
I swear I wasn't.

465
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,937
-Good, you brought it. Let's pour it in.
-Here we go.

466
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,148
FILLING THE FUEL TANK WITH DIESEL

467
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,899
-Is it real fuel?
-Yeah.

468
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,776
Will it actually work?

469
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,319
-For real?
-That's enough.

470
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,946
-Okay, now the power.
-Try it.

471
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,990
Press C. Okay.

472
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,950
Press C. Okay.

473
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,827
WELL?

474
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,496
POWER ON

475
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,790
IT REALLY WORKS

476
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,876
-I just got chills!
-We got it back up!

477
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,715
-This is crazy!
-The elevator!

478
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,842
-Guys, the lights are on!
-The lights are on!

479
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:37,843
That's insane.

480
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,305
-See this?
-The elevator's working!

481
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,807
Let's head up.

482
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,477
It opens!

483
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,564
ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN

484
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,943
FLOOR DIRECTORY

485
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,278
MENTAL WELLNESS PROGRAM

486
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,115
-There may be some hidden clues here.
-Maybe it leads to a rooftop garden.

487
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,035
-Well, I--
-They added a working elevator here?

488
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:06,330
-I can't believe this.
-I actually prefer taking the stairs.

489
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,749
-Get in here.
-Get in, we're a team here.

490
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,292
We're all in the same boat.

491
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,710
We're on the fourth floor, right?

492
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,212
-Yeah, so press five.
-Five.

493
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,047
Wow, this thing actually goes up?

494
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,220
Oh gosh.

495
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,138
I have a bad feeling about this.

496
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,642
I wanted to check the roof,

497
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,353
which is probably the last place
the body was.

498
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,480
This is a must in Crime Scene.

499
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,316
To find out how the murder happened,
we have to go to the roof.

500
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,525
I'm dying to check it out.

501
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,736
We have to use those stairs
to get to the roof.

502
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,155
Oh gosh. Look at this.

503
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,199
The way up looks dangerous.

504
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,201
-I'm so scared.
-I'm scared of the roof.

505
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,327
There's nothing here.

506
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,622
Wait, let's take a close look here.

507
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,457
Where was Je-in's body earlier?

508
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,626
-And how was it hanging?
-Be careful, Mr. Village Head!

509
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,795
Be careful, Mr. Village Head!

510
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,173
Don't go near there, Mr. Village Head.

511
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,550
You need to be here
to throw someone off the roof.

512
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,804
-Please don't.
-No, I don't think she was thrown off.

513
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,639
Are you saying she climbed over

514
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,433
-and went down there?
-Maybe she fell off while running away.

515
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,979
First off, it's not clear how she died.

516
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,189
Did the fall happen on purpose
or was it an accident?

517
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,441
Did she fall while running away
from the murderer?

518
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:21,863
We didn't find any traces of the body
being moved all the way up to the roof.

519
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,700
It doesn't make sense
that there are no traces whatsoever.

520
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,201
How did the killer do it?

521
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,494
I can't figure it out.

522
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,579
How did they manage it?

523
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,291
-Je-in!
-What happened?

524
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,334
What now?

525
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,961
Jang Je-in!

526
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,130
Jeez, you scared me.

527
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,091
Seriously, this is driving me nuts.

528
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,469
SEARCHING ROOM 501

529
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,597
What's this?

530
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,807
MYSTERIOUS MACHINE FOUND

531
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,143
-What's this thing? Know what this is?
-What do you mean?

532
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,644
"Metal detector"?

533
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,438
Oh, I saw that earlier.

534
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,189
There's a metal detector and other stuff.

535
00:21:56,273 --> 00:22:00,319
It looks like someone brought them here
to find something hidden in this building.

536
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,654
-Is that really a metal detector?
-It's a water leak detector.

537
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:07,159
I brought it to look for leaks
and left it here after I finished.

538
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,702
-This one too?
-Yeah.

539
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,539
MEANWHILE, PARK SHAMAN
SEARCHES THE DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

540
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:13,582
Hold on a second.

541
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,209
BIRD'S-EYE VIEW PHOTO OF THE HOSPITAL

542
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,587
Wait. This lot was a site for a house.

543
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,756
Goodness.

544
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,382
DURING THE INITIAL EXAMINATION

545
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,553
THE PHOTO SHE SAW IN JANG COUSIN'S HOUSE

546
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,847
Yeonjidol Hospital.

547
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,435
I compared the bird's-eye view photo
and the photo of Jang Cousin's house

548
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,978
and realized they were on the same lot.

549
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:40,025
So I opened up both frames,
and you won't believe what I found.

550
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,069
FRAMED PHOTO OF JANG COUSIN'S HOUSE

551
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:45,739
What's this?
"Ten gold toads, fifteen gold bars"?

552
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,200
Would you look at that.

553
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:51,411
WHAT'S BEHIND THE BIRD'S-EYE VIEW PHOTO
OF THE HOSPITAL?

554
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,502
IN THE FRAME OF THE BIRD'S-EYE VIEW PHOTO
OF THE HOSPITAL

555
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,504
"Building Permit."

556
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,631
Je-in received a permit

557
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,300
-to build a medical facility, right?
-Yeah.

558
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:10,263
But originally,
Je-in's house was on this land.

559
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,015
Now, look at the back.

560
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,392
-It's marked X.
-Yeah.

561
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,602
That mark is where the hospital is.

562
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:18,188
I think the gold bars are right here.

563
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,481
-Jang Cousin.
-Yeah?

564
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,441
This is where the gold bars are, isn't it?

565
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,779
That's why you wanted to
buy this land from Je-in, isn't it?

566
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:28,532
-Well, actually…
-This isn't just a hospital site, is it?

567
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:33,078
My father kept this photo frame with him
until the day he died,

568
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,122
but I had no idea of its significance.

569
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:39,418
Until one day, I found this note
about gold toads and gold bars here,

570
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,336
-so I figured he buried them here.
-And?

571
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,589
But then she built this hospital
on top of that exact spot.

572
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,133
-See? I told you.
-Exactly.

573
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:50,345
I thought if I bought this land
from her for 500 million won,

574
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,389
I'd be able to dig around for that gold.

575
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,015
So I decided to make an offer,

576
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,976
but then she died
before I could even do so.

577
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,687
-Was the offer made or was it turned down?
-I never made the offer.

578
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,398
I only asked to meet her
but never got the chance.

579
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,444
-Wait.
-Let's see.

580
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,113
-It might not be the hospital.
-I even completed the agreement form.

581
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:09,948
BUILDING PERMIT

582
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:13,160
But the building in this picture
looks a bit different.

583
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,954
Check this out. "Details of the design
are subject to change."

584
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,289
Look closely.

585
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,292
Hang on.

586
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:22,711
It's here.

587
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,255
-That's not it.
-No, wait. Look at this.

588
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,466
-The floor counts don't match.
-Here.

589
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,385
One, two, three, four, five…
It has six floors!

590
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,137
-This building…
-There's no sixth floor!

591
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,598
-This building must have a hidden space.
-There's no sixth floor!

592
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,433
There's no sixth floor!

593
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,684
-I got chills.
-Wait.

594
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,520
There should be another floor here,
but they blocked it off.

595
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,606
They turned a six-story building
into a five-story one.

596
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,692
The elevator will surely
take us to the sixth floor.

597
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:47,652
-Above the fifth floor.
-Hold on.

598
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,573
Hold on, let's see here.

599
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:55,327
-The emergency button?
-I pushed everything, but it didn't work.

600
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,413
-Try pressing the emergency button.
-Try pressing the buttons together.

601
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,415
Maybe something's hidden here.

602
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,500
-What is it?
-What's up?

603
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,126
There must be a button.

604
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,462
Here it is! I found it.

605
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:08,089
Here it is! I found it.

606
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,509
-All the buttons are there?
-Yeah, when you slide it up.

607
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,970
HIDDEN UNDERNEATH THE EMERGENCY BUTTON

608
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,805
IS ANOTHER BUTTON

609
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,015
Sliding it up did it.

610
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,642
This was it!

611
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,144
This was it!

612
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,649
-Hang on.
-Wow, I had no idea.

613
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,734
-Get Mr. Village Head here!
-Mr. Village Head!

614
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,321
Park Village Head is running away!
He's getting away!

615
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,156
-I'm scared.
-I really had no idea.

616
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,700
-Goodness, this is…
-Where are we?

617
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,327
-We're here.
-This must be it.

618
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,370
-Incredible.
-We're here.

619
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,621
-Very impressive.
-This is insane.

620
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,414
I'm sweating. I'm hot.

621
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,375
Anyone who's faint of heart,
stand behind me.

622
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,668
-So brilliant.
-I'm scared.

623
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,086
I bet there's something here.

624
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:49,256
They must've removed body parts
and done all sorts of shady business here.

625
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,549
The lights are on too. My gosh.

626
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,092
Okay, everybody, relax.

627
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,426
Jang Cousin, you lead the way.

628
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:00,725
The sixth floor.

629
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,103
-Sixth floor.
-There's a secret door!

630
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,813
-Unbelievable.
-Oh my goodness.

631
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,027
MEANWHILE, PARK VILLAGE HEAD

632
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,116
Shouldn't we bring
Mr. Village Head up here too?

633
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,200
Exactly.

634
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:18,868
SO THEY BROUGHT HIM

635
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,787
I guess this was the main event.

636
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,415
Wow.

637
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,208
Oh, you got here quickly.

638
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,294
Wow, this is incredible.

639
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,129
Man, this is crazy.

640
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:31,715
What the heck is this place?

641
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,759
-I'll take one for the team and open this.
-My goodness.

642
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,052
So you go in first.

643
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,596
All right!

644
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,312
-Dang it!
-For goodness' sake!

645
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,772
JANG JE-IN'S SECRET
HIDDEN ON THE SIXTH FLOOR

646
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:52,068
SECRET OPERATING ROOM

647
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:04,372
WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS PLACE?

648
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,832
THE BRAIN: CAN'T CONTROL IT? REMOVE IT!

649
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:06,833
OPENING SOON, FRONTAL LOBE ON BLADE

650
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:09,169
-What is all this?
-This is insane.

651
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,379
-What is this?
-Seriously.

652
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,298
This must be where she died.

653
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,091
Yeah, this must be the place.

654
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,219
But where's the exit?

655
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,804
-Just a second!
-How do you get out of here?

656
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,057
-What's that?
-She must've died right here!

657
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,976
Maybe she fell while running out of here.

658
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,436
-There's blood here!
-That makes sense.

659
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:29,230
-So she was running.
-And then she fell from there.

660
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,066
-There are bloodstains.
-She ran and fell.

661
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,610
Look! Maybe the killer
bashed her head in with this.

662
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:35,779
The final blow to the head.

663
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:36,821
SURGICAL HAMMER

664
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,741
This must be what bashed her skull in.

665
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,452
She was running away and got caught.
She didn't fall.

666
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:43,620
-You're right.
-My Je-in's head.

667
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,747
DID SHE DISCOVER SOMETHING ELSE?

668
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,499
-Yeah, that's more like it.
-Look at those!

669
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,335
Wait, this is exactly how I looked too.

670
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:51,419
The eyes.

671
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,047
PATIENT: KIM LABORER
SURGERY RESULTS: FAILED

672
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,131
PATIENT: CHOI INJURY

673
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,925
PATIENT: HAN SURVIVOR
SURGERY RESULTS: SUCCESS

674
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,095
There were people whose eyes
looked exactly like Handsome's did

675
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,346
in his selfie.

676
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:02,514
Wait, so what did she do?

677
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,932
-Experiments?
-I know what this is!

678
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,225
-What is it?
-What is it?

679
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,268
But it's illegal.

680
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,562
-Of course, that's why she did it here.
-So what is it?

681
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,981
It's called psychosurgery,

682
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:15,777
where you use surgical methods to treat
people with psychiatric disorders

683
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,696
to help stabilize them.

684
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:21,116
So she meant to
treat his disorder surgically too?

685
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,576
You flip the patient's eyelids

686
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,328
and shove a pick up there.

687
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,122
Into my eyes?

688
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,207
It's a surgery that cuts the nerves.

689
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,167
Okay, so if you see here,

690
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:34,337
she shocks the anesthetized patient
with electricity to check if they're down.

691
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,714
Next, she lifts the eyelid,

692
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,842
inserts the surgical pick
through the socket,

693
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,885
uses a hammer to drive it in,

694
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:45,056
and then twists the pick
to excise the neural pathways.

695
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:49,227
This is the reason Jang Je-in was fired
from Illyu University Hospital.

696
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,854
Incompatible values.

697
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:53,440
Director Jang Je-in
was a different kind of doctor.

698
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:56,192
Unlike the mainstream approach of treating
psychiatric patients with drugs,

699
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:59,821
she held the radical belief
that frontal lobotomy was the answer,

700
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,532
which is what got her fired
from Illyu University Hospital in the end.

701
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:05,326
But someone like Je-in
would never give up.

702
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,620
That must be why
she came back to the rural Yeonjidol

703
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,372
and opened a psychiatric hospital.

704
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:13,293
She even created an operating room
on the sixth floor for herself

705
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,003
and continued her research in secret,

706
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,130
while believing
she was an exceptional doctor.

707
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,631
Look.

708
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:22,302
All the surgeries failed
except for Han Survivor's.

709
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:25,054
Remember the press conference
she was planning to hold?

710
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,807
Do you think it was related to this?

711
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,559
Park Village Head,
did you put her up to this?

712
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,019
Were you in on this?

713
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,187
No, listen to me, everyone.

714
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,773
-Wait!
-Give me a second!

715
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,024
As for Han Survivor…

716
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,860
I killed him.

717
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,487
I killed him.

718
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,157
-What?
-Well, that came out of nowhere.

719
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,743
-You said you only killed one person.
-You said you killed Park Real Son.

720
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:49,746
-You said you killed one person, not two.
-Just a minute!

721
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:55,251
The important thing right now
is who killed Jang Je-in.

722
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,462
Then when did you kill Han Survivor?

723
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,714
In 2013.

724
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,217
-In 2013?
-So that's it.

725
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,261
So does that mean Village Head
killed the only patient

726
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,263
that Je-in operated on successfully?

727
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,973
-Why did you kill him?
-Yeah, why?

728
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,687
Are you sure it was Han Survivor?
Not Choi Injury or Kim Laborer?

729
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,940
-Are you sure?
-We can confirm it with this.

730
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,609
IN THE DESK DRAWER

731
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,736
-"Transaction log."
-Is Han Survivor on it?

732
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,862
See? "Homeless person."

733
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,614
"Sent to Village Head."

734
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,366
"Village Head began procurement."

735
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:29,244
Only the numbers of people
sent or received were updated.

736
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,037
All entries mentioned Village Head's name,

737
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,915
page after page,
throughout all these years.

738
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,792
PARK VILLAGE HEAD PROCURED
THE HOMELESS FOR JANG JE-IN

739
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,711
She sent them over to Village Head
after they had the surgery.

740
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,047
That must've driven
the village's economic growth.

741
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,592
No wonder your business was successful.
You had plenty of unpaid labor!

742
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,511
Did you use them as beekeeping slaves?

743
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,721
Yes, she and I made a deal.

744
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:52,600
So you and Je-in were basically
in the human trafficking business.

745
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,853
Okay, let's think about this.

746
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,021
Je-in died right here, tonight.

747
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,440
And there's blood here on the hammer.

748
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,734
-The one you're holding, yeah.
-That matches her head wound.

749
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,779
-The size of the wound matches it.
-Yes, that's that.

750
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,907
But her chest wound
is from something else. It's wide.

751
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,617
This right here will explain that wound.

752
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,244
There's an electric saw here.

753
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,829
-Electric saw?
-Yeah.

754
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,664
-So the killer…
-That electric saw

755
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,291
was what slashed her wrist.

756
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,459
-Oh, her wrist.
-Right?

757
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,919
The way I see it,

758
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:23,172
the killer knew Je-in would come in here.

759
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,925
So they hid here, waiting for her.

760
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:30,221
They struck her head as she came in,
so she fell over here.

761
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,765
That's why the blood
is splattered all over here.

762
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,352
She collapsed,
but the killer turned her over

763
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,938
and attacked her chest.

764
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,149
But she wasn't dead yet,

765
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:44,652
so the extreme pain woke her up,
which led to a struggle.

766
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:48,364
Signs of a major scuffle are obvious.
They practically destroyed everything.

767
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,242
One of them ran while the other chased.

768
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,369
Hey, let's take a look here.

769
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:56,039
RECREATING THE CHAIN OF EVENTS
OUT THE WINDOW

770
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,165
From there?

771
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,667
-Let's say the killer stabbed her here.
-She got attacked,

772
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,294
-so she escaped this way.
-Right.

773
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:02,629
-The killer followed.
-And then…

774
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:05,048
She hung from there with this.

775
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,508
-Hey, I see bloodstains there.
-Exactly, wow.

776
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,135
Bloodstains and a bloody handprint.

777
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,262
-The killer closed in.
-She held onto this.

778
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,764
And then she fell from here.

779
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,682
-She couldn't have fallen from the roof.
-You're right.

780
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:15,767
Right?

781
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,353
She tried to grab onto the wires
or something and ended up there.

782
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,854
I doubt she did it on purpose.

783
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,522
Yeah, she probably got attacked here.

784
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,774
This is the exact spot.

785
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:25,151
I think she was cornered
after escaping through the window.

786
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,986
Seeing her hold onto the sign
with her left hand,

787
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,072
the killer must've hacked at her wrist.

788
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:32,492
I believe she fell after that,
got caught on the wires,

789
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:35,787
and died of severe blood loss.

790
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:38,957
What the…

791
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,500
What's that?

792
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,546
Who wore this, then?

793
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,881
Wait a minute.

794
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,299
-This blood is…
-What's this?

795
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,635
-The killer must've worn that.
-Exactly.

796
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:53,137
Could the killer have been someone

797
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,933
capable of performing a medical procedure
alongside the victim?

798
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,059
IS THE CULPRIT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL?

799
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,602
-Search everything.
-Wait!

800
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:00,687
What now?

801
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,023
-Search everything.
-Wait!

802
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,650
What now? What is it?

803
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,487
-This has braille on it!
-Braille!

804
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,701
A BRAILLE NECKLACE

805
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,911
-Braille?
-Your brother!

806
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,204
He must've been here!

807
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,580
My brother was here?

808
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,999
Oh gosh!

809
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,875
-So your brother…
-So she killed him in here?

810
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,837
We don't know if he was killed,
but this necklace was on the floor.

811
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,590
-We were expecting this though.
-Five years ago…

812
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,550
That's true.

813
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:34,679
But my brother has nothing to do
with those experiments.

814
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:38,016
-Did she kill him because it failed?
-Maybe she was going for his organs.

815
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,268
WERE ORGANS HARVESTED HERE TOO?

816
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,103
Okay, think about it.

817
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:45,398
The real question is,
who knew about this room?

818
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,150
-Of course.
-So who knew about it?

819
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,027
Not only did they know about the room,

820
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,654
but they also knew Je-in was coming here.

821
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,573
-The person who…
-They knew all about the experiments.

822
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,825
Okay, I wasn't aware of the surgeries.

823
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,118
But he's been here before.

824
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:00,747
-Chong Manager sent you that text tonight.
-That's right.

825
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,373
-You didn't know about Je-in coming.
-No.

826
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,460
But she was here
and saw Je-in entering the hospital.

827
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,253
Not on this floor.
I saw her at the entrance.

828
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,338
So An Doctor, you didn't know
about this room, right?

829
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,132
-I didn't.
-Same here, then.

830
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,675
-Did you know?
-Of course not.

831
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,678
-Are you sure?
-I really had no idea.

832
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,556
But you knew about the X mark
and the note about the gold.

833
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,892
-But that's buried.
-That clue led us here.

834
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,560
I just have one more question.

835
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,479
Why is there blood over there?

836
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,688
I mean in the freezer.

837
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,148
IN THE MEDICAL FREEZER

838
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,816
There are exploded blood bags.

839
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,151
OLD BLOODSTAINS?

840
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,528
What do you think was in here? Organs?

841
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,655
Let's head back downstairs.

842
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,075
Let's go and piece everything together.

843
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,743
Come on, let's go.

844
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:46,542
We found so many things
in that secret operating room

845
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,377
on the sixth floor.

846
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,505
And now we're confused.

847
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,548
My head's about to explode.

848
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,383
WHAT A HEADACHE…

849
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:03,851
What?

850
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,899
PARK VILLAGE HEAD'S WOODEN BENCH
LOOKS STRANGE

851
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:11,067
-What's wrong?
-Wait.

852
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,194
-Does it lift up too?
-What is it?

853
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,571
Is this bench supposed to come apart?

854
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,365
-No.
-Wait a minute.

855
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,034
-Ease up a bit, man.
-There's something in here!

856
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,203
-Is this bench supposed to open up?
-Wait.

857
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,913
-What is it?
-What is it?

858
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,498
-Hang on.
-Come on.

859
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,583
-What is it?
-Wait a minute.

860
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,919
-Why is this part lifting?
-No, it's not like that!

861
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,129
Hurry up.

862
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:34,966
What's that?

863
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,970
-What's that in the bench?
-Oh, from his past.

864
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,847
It looks like a photo of his gang.

865
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,391
Jeez, there's so much to uncover.

866
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,517
NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS

867
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,811
What's this? Come over here.

868
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:48,521
My goodness.

869
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,731
"Demons Disguised as Humans."

870
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,776
"Bizarre murder spree
targeting the wealthy."

871
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,278
"Dualipa Gang arrested."

872
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,362
-"Dualipa"?
-"Dualipa"?

873
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:59,240
Sounds very Hollywood, doesn't it?

874
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,324
The Dualipa Gang.

875
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,827
Hey, but this wasn't just any old gang.

876
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,288
-It was a gang of brutal murderers.
-Right.

877
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:09,959
"Converted a farmhouse in a remote area
into a murder house."

878
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:13,212
"Young female VIP customers."
So they targeted the rich.

879
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,089
"But Park Enforcer, the gang's enforcer

880
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,841
and the only member
who isn't in custody yet,

881
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:19,051
has been on the run for six months."

882
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:22,597
So his name isn't Park Real Son
or Park Village Head.

883
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,765
It's Park Enforcer, as in a gang enforcer.

884
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:25,808
Right?

885
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,268
DUALIPA GANG'S ENFORCER
PARK ENFORCER

886
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,562
That's enough.

887
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,063
Mr. Park Enforcer.

888
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,107
He told you to stop!

889
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:37,028
So this is why he stole
Park Real Son's identity.

890
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,448
So Park Village Head…

891
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,909
I mean, Park Enforcer
was a member of the Dualipa Gang

892
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,744
that went on murder sprees.

893
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:47,955
He snuck into Yeonjidol Village,
killed Park Real Son,

894
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:51,959
assumed his identity, and has been
living as Park Village Head ever since.

895
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,794
That's horrifying.

896
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:59,467
"A, the sole victim of the Dualipa Gang
to have escaped,

897
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,719
came face-to-face with Park Enforcer."

898
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:05,890
"He is currently suffering from aphasia
due to extreme shock and trauma."

899
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,016
That's Han Survivor.

900
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,311
Survivor was the one who lived?

901
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,939
-He escaped from there.
-Oh, Han Survivor…

902
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:15,691
-So--
-So you met Han Survivor again here?

903
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:16,651
Yeah.

904
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,320
He knew about your past, then.

905
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,530
-Is that why you killed him?
-Yeah.

906
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:26,661
The only person
Je-in successfully operated on

907
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,829
happens to be connected to
Park Village Head.

908
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,541
He also knew Je-in
was planning to hold a press conference.

909
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,753
Jang Je-in, Han Survivor,
and the press conference.

910
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,755
The key to solving this case
could be the connection

911
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:41,759
between these three keywords
and Park Village Head.

912
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:43,636
Okay.

913
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:48,516
We found out that the building
was different from the original design,

914
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,685
and that led us to the secret room.

915
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,562
Now, what we need to focus on is this.

916
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:58,025
Who knew about that secret room?

917
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,945
At the moment,
everyone has denied any knowledge of it.

918
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,029
No one knew about it.

919
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,030
One more thing.

920
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,366
The fuel container.

921
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:09,453
The sixth floor can only be accessed
by powering the elevator with diesel.

922
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:13,207
That means the killer had to get the fuel.

923
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,917
So we need to find proof of purchase.

924
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,336
An Doctor was the only person
who had access to fuel.

925
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,463
You know what?

926
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,716
-I thought long and hard about this.
-Okay.

927
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:26,846
First of all, the killer has to be someone
who knows about that sixth-floor space.

928
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:30,516
Considering how An Doctor
actually worked in that hospital,

929
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,686
you might think that she's the person
who knew about that place.

930
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:35,730
Look at this.

931
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:39,108
We watched it earlier,
but I watched it again closely.

932
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,904
You're really a doctor, right?

933
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,991
-Of course, I am.
-Okay, stop.

934
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,117
Right here.

935
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,660
Do you see it?

936
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,663
This is what she was wearing!

937
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:55,791
It's this.

938
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,418
BLOODSTAINED SURGICAL GOWN

939
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,919
In the video,

940
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:02,340
she was wearing the same surgical cap
and mask found in the room.

941
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,216
And the sleeves in the video

942
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,386
-looked just like this too. It's a match.
-Was it visible on screen?

943
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,431
An Doctor was wearing this very gown!

944
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,475
-But even if I was,
-An Doctor

945
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,643
-all surgery gowns look the same.
-was wearing this.

946
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:15,936
This isn't different from others.

947
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,772
But there was no gown
in the nurses' station.

948
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,358
As I said,
An Doctor was wearing this very gown.

949
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:23,861
I always follow a particular routine.

950
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,905
I go to the nurses' station
on the fourth floor

951
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:29,116
and put on all the surgical gear
including a gown and a mask.

952
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:32,286
After the procedure,
I dump them into the lake with the body.

953
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,121
When did you start
performing these procedures?

954
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:37,375
After Je-in closed up her hospital.

955
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:41,087
So you've been the one using the building
ever since it shut down?

956
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,254
That's right.

957
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,299
Here's what I think.

958
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,636
During the past five years
after the hospital was shut down,

959
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,013
she used that operating room
on the sixth floor

960
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:55,184
to perform euthanasia,
following that routine of hers.

961
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,270
And that's it
for today's exciting euthanasia!

962
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,188
DURING THE PROCEDURE

963
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,275
But then
someone suddenly appeared, uninvited.

964
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,568
Huh? What the?

965
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,987
Namely, Jang Je-in.

966
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:13,202
Perhaps Je-in found out about everything,
including An Doctor impersonating her.

967
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,497
Let's say we all start off
in the same place.

968
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,583
There's no proof that any of us
knew about that room, right?

969
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,545
But I'm still a bit
suspicious of Park Village Head.

970
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:26,173
I wouldn't have suspected him
if it was just a run-of-the-mill gang.

971
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,717
But he's committed brutal murders before.

972
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,887
I don't think anyone without experience
can take another's life so easily.

973
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,556
And he took laborers from Je-in,

974
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,683
so there's no way
he didn't know about her experiments.

975
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,268
She had to have
done them somewhere, right?

976
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:40,396
Even if he didn't know
about the sixth floor,

977
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:43,149
he must've suspected
that there was a secret space.

978
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:46,735
I didn't know about the experiments
or the organ harvesting.

979
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,821
-I only--
-But you secured homeless people for her.

980
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,698
All I did was accept laborers from her.

981
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,658
Then how about this?

982
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:55,619
Let's say Je-in somehow managed
to find out who he really was.

983
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:59,498
She learned about his involvement
in that gang and whatnot,

984
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,208
and she tried to strike
some sort of a deal,

985
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,335
using that information as leverage.

986
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,545
-Then--
-No.

987
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,547
If she had tried that,
I would've killed her.

988
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,258
And you did kill her.

989
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,718
Me?

990
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,098
-Okay, then.
-Yes?

991
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:20,728
It seems the suspicions we shared
are pretty close to our final decision.

992
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:24,273
Now, we all have to look for evidence
to support those claims.

993
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:25,483
-Right?
-The fuel.

994
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,653
I need to look at the fuel.

995
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,239
Come here, look.

996
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,658
-This is the euthanasia video.
-Right.

997
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,410
But… Oh jeez.

998
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,704
-What's that?
-What's going on?

999
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,665
EMERGENCY TEXT

1000
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,417
-What's that?
-What's going on?

1001
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,628
LANDSLIDE OCCURRED ON YEONJIDOL MOUNTAIN,
LUNACY DISTRICT

1002
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,298
-What's that?
-What's going on?

1003
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:52,092
-It's a landslide, isn't it?
-Is it a landslide?

1004
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,429
What's happening?

1005
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,973
-Is it a landslide?
-Is it an earthquake?

1006
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,183
What's going on?

1007
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,729
It's an emergency. A natural disaster.

1008
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:05,147
WARNING
LANDSLIDE PRONE AREA

1009
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,620
-What the heck?
-What's happening?

1010
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,711
What…

1011
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,713
What a tiny landslide.

1012
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:33,050
-So landslides do actually happen here.
-Hang on.

1013
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,635
Let's go. We might find something.

1014
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,053
Why did this landslide happen?

1015
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:38,681
This area is prone to landslides.

1016
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,850
They say this place
is prone to landslides.

1017
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:45,187
Then perhaps there's something
buried in that mountain.

1018
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,857
-We might find something.
-Oh gosh.

1019
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,317
Is there a shovel or something?

1020
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,946
OFF TO FETCH A SHOVEL

1021
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,990
I knew I'd find a shovel here.

1022
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,534
FOUND SHOVELS IN PARK VILLAGE HEAD'S HOME

1023
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:02,121
Move. Let me start digging.

1024
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,928
There's something off about this rock.
-Lift it up.

1025
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,471
A SUSPICIOUS-LOOKING ROCK?

1026
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,518
SUPERHUMAN STRENGTH

1027
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,020
-You're strong.
-Cousin.

1028
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,688
I guess that Viagura you took works.

1029
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:30,733
Yeah, it sure is effective.

1030
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:40,034
-Oh goodness.
-Hey, hold on.

1031
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:43,537
-There's something there.
-Here it comes.

1032
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,039
It's a shovel.

1033
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,165
-A shovel?
-Yeah.

1034
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,625
Someone buried--

1035
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,126
-It's a knife!
-A knife!

1036
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,878
-A shovel and a knife!
-It's a knife!

1037
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:52,588
My goodness.

1038
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:55,049
This looks like a sashimi knife,
doesn't it?

1039
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,301
I guess this is the spot.

1040
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:00,220
There's some kind of a mark here
in the shape of a cross.

1041
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,139
-What's that?
-What is this?

1042
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,267
-What's that?
-What is this?

1043
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:06,685
-It's a skull.
-It's a skull.

1044
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:09,313
It's a skull!

1045
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:11,982
-Let's do a cleansing rite here too.
-Oh dear.

1046
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,651
Where's the rest of the body?

1047
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,819
-The rest is below it.
-Oh my gosh.

1048
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,238
-Oh my.
-There it is.

1049
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,615
What's this person wearing?

1050
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:21,700
-Hospital gown?
-Looks like it.

1051
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,869
-It's a hospital gown. Oh dear.
-Hospital gown?

1052
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:26,038
"Yeonjidol Psychiatric Hospital."

1053
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:27,915
This must be Han Survivor.

1054
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,460
He's wearing the clothes
from the hospital.

1055
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,379
-Han Survivor.
-Oh man.

1056
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:37,633
-But why are his clothes…
-Why is it cut at the chest?

1057
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,176
Why is there a hole in the chest?

1058
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,428
-The chest area is torn apart.
-Hang on.

1059
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,098
-There's a tear in the shape of a cross.
-Why is that?

1060
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,392
Were his organs removed too?

1061
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,104
Well…

1062
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,772
It's a Dualipa Gang thing.

1063
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,774
We always drew a cross
that symbolized fairness.

1064
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:56,652
-Oh, was the gang's symbol a cross?
-We always marked the bodies with a cross.

1065
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,362
Same length, both top and bottom.

1066
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:01,031
So did you do this to mark him
as a victim of the Dualipa Gang?

1067
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,866
I was worried that he might recognize me.

1068
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,285
Of course, he didn't, but then…

1069
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,830
-So his organs weren't harvested?
-What a heinous gang.

1070
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:10,207
-No, it's just a mark on his flesh.
-What a scary bunch.

1071
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,043
-If you mark the flesh…
-We get it.

1072
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,462
Once the flesh is gone,
only the bones remain.

1073
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,588
-We get it.
-Right?

1074
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,966
-Then, those bones--
-Sure, but I'm standing at a cliff here.

1075
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,551
We get it.

1076
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:24,346
Okay, I'll climb down myself
before I'm pushed off the cliff.

1077
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:27,266
-He buried one, why not another?
-Exactly.

1078
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,851
-Go down.
-I should get out of here.

1079
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,604
Why mark the chest of all places?

1080
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,898
The wound on Je-in's chest
wasn't exactly a cross,

1081
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:38,610
but maybe he stopped halfway
before completing the cross.

1082
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,739
It doesn't seem so strange to think

1083
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,615
they were killed the same way.

1084
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:44,867
JANG JE-IN'S ROOM

1085
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,243
Hey, Je-in.

1086
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:47,911
BACK TO SEARCHING FOR CLUES

1087
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:51,415
You need to tell us something now.

1088
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:53,500
Come on, Je-in.

1089
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,836
This is very tricky.

1090
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,296
SHAMAN'S ROOM

1091
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:02,342
Hey, come on.
Treat my brother's photo with respect.

1092
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:04,803
Put it right.

1093
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,144
I bet the sixth floor is the key.

1094
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:17,524
Don't you all know?

1095
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:20,277
The crime scene always speaks for itself.

1096
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,033
That's what we need to find out.

1097
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,788
Why and how…

1098
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:35,542
did they know she'd come in here?

1099
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:38,212
There must be something here.

1100
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:46,804
SOMETHING WAS UNDER THE DESK

1101
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:50,682
"Survivor"?

1102
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,562
As in Han Survivor?

1103
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:59,775
SOMETHING RELATED
TO THE LATE HAN SURVIVOR?

1104
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:01,318
This must be a clue.

1105
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:13,247
Let's see.

1106
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,001
Wait.

1107
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:19,503
What's that?

1108
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,089
What's this?

1109
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,842
JANG JE-IN'S PHONE

1110
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:31,098
Over here, everyone!

1111
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,183
Over here, everyone!

1112
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,893
-Jeez, that scared me.
-What is it now?

1113
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,228
Over here, everyone!

1114
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,189
Up here on the sixth floor!

1115
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,567
-Do we have to go?
-Come up now!

1116
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,277
Can't you bring it down here?

1117
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,736
I can't!

1118
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,409
Why'd you call us up here?

1119
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:53,620
Wait. Hold on, everyone!

1120
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,831
What's gotten into you?

1121
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:59,084
-While searching this room,
-Yeah?

1122
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:01,211
I found a lead underneath the freezer.

1123
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,714
Je-in's phone.

1124
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,049
That's crucial evidence.

1125
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,593
-Let's see it.
-All right.

1126
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:08,552
MESSAGES

1127
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:09,720
Look.

1128
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,388
TEXTS EXCHANGED WITH HAN SURVIVOR

1129
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:13,765
She's been texting Han Survivor
since July 28th.

1130
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,183
That was three days ago.

1131
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,728
"Mr. Survivor. It's me, Jang Je-in."

1132
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:20,105
"Please call me. I need to speak to you."

1133
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:23,609
Then, on the 29th, "Mr. Survivor,
I really need to talk to you."

1134
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:26,403
On the 31st,
"Mr. Survivor, is everything okay?"

1135
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:27,863
"Please let me know."

1136
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,406
Then Han Survivor replied.

1137
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:34,369
"This is Survivor. Something came up,
and I wasn't able to text you back."

1138
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:37,039
"I'll be waiting
at Yeonjidol Hospital at 11 p.m."

1139
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,958
But Survivor's dead.

1140
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,126
I see what happened.

1141
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:43,712
Je-in left the country quite suddenly,

1142
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:46,590
so she had no idea Han Survivor died.

1143
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:47,549
For five years?

1144
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:50,010
When she came back and reached out to him,

1145
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:54,139
someone pretended to be him
to lure Je-in out and hurt her.

1146
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:56,099
-Isn't it likely?
-Yeah.

1147
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,726
But…

1148
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:00,145
I think this other clue
is the conclusive evidence.

1149
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:01,521
CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE?

1150
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:02,481
Look at this.

1151
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:09,112
"I'll be waiting there
at 10:30 p.m. Survivor."

1152
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,575
-At 10:30 p.m. Where's "there"?
-"There."

1153
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:14,993
It must mean this room.

1154
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:17,079
-It's someone who knows about this room.
-Exactly.

1155
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:18,246
But get this.

1156
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,915
This note says 10:30 p.m.,

1157
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,960
but this text says
to meet him at the hospital at 11 p.m.

1158
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:26,546
There's a high chance
Park Village Head sent the text.

1159
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,506
However,

1160
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:32,219
we should note that this other person
made Je-in show up half an hour earlier.

1161
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,096
-Yeah.
-Are you responsible

1162
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,973
-for the text, Village Head?
-That was me. I admit it.

1163
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,517
-Right, this was very likely him.
-You're not lying, are you?

1164
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,894
If I were lying, I'd be the killer.

1165
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,813
I sent the text,
but I didn't write this note.

1166
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:45,148
So whoever wrote the note
is the real killer.

1167
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,359
It's written on paper
from Yeonjidol Hotel.

1168
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:48,360
You're right.

1169
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:49,486
THE KILLER USED A NOTEPAD
FROM YEONJIDOL HOTEL

1170
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:52,489
It's either someone

1171
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,908
who knows the hotel manager
or any other staff member

1172
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,702
or a guest at the hotel.

1173
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,787
KIM HANDSOME IS STAYING AT THE HOTEL

1174
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:01,039
Anyone could've grabbed a piece
from the hotel notepad.

1175
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:07,170
When we asked the hotel manager,

1176
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:11,466
he said Mr. Village Head
dropped by the hotel for an event.

1177
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:15,804
I think he could've grabbed
the piece of paper then.

1178
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:20,350
And also, it's true that he planned
to meet Je-in at 11 p.m. to kill her.

1179
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,938
Then where's Han Survivor's cell phone?

1180
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:28,275
If Village Head sent the text,
it must be in his room, right?

1181
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:31,069
Let's try calling. We can call the number.

1182
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,405
CALL LOG ON JANG JE-IN'S PHONE

1183
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,699
CALLS

1184
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:39,327
HAN SURVIVOR

1185
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,122
Let's look for the phone.

1186
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,457
We should hear it ring.

1187
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:51,173
This way.

1188
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,967
That's Han Survivor's phone.

1189
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,889
RINGING FROM THE MOUNTAIN AREA

1190
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:00,432
What's that?

1191
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,809
I think we should take this too.

1192
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,562
What is it?

1193
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,064
Han Survivor's phone!

1194
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,151
Where is it coming from?

1195
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,196
Where?

1196
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,783
Gosh, I'm so scared.

1197
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,374
-Why was the phone buried here?
-Found it!

1198
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,418
It's Han Survivor's phone.

1199
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,795
What is it?

1200
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:33,340
But why is Han Survivor's phone…

1201
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,425
Check for voicemails.

1202
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:36,843
There are voicemails.

1203
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,470
2 NEW VOICEMAILS FROM DIRECTOR JANG JE-IN

1204
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:40,889
Wait! There are voicemails.

1205
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,057
-What?
-What?

1206
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,475
-Turn up the volume.
-From Je-in?

1207
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:45,352
Je-in left voicemails.

1208
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,187
-Is this it?
-Play the first one.

1209
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:49,481
Mr. Survivor,

1210
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:52,776
I'm planning on holding a press conference
to present my research papers in Korea.

1211
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,444
I see.

1212
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:57,322
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
for me.

1213
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,450
Remember the gang member you mentioned
who's still out there?

1214
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:01,618
I know who he is.

1215
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,288
I want to present it as part of
my groundbreaking research results,

1216
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,040
but I need your permission first.

1217
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,584
But I can't get in touch with you,

1218
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,169
and I'm running out of time.

1219
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:13,421
The doctor-patient confidentiality
can be overridden

1220
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:16,633
if the disclosure of information
greatly benefits the public,

1221
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:19,344
so I'm holding the press conference
tomorrow as planned

1222
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:21,555
and sharing this
with the press and the police.

1223
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:24,975
If you get this message,
please call me back.

1224
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,397
Mr. Survivor,
I've been waiting to hear from you.

1225
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,773
Thanks for reaching out.

1226
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,776
I see you didn't specify where to meet.

1227
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,487
I'll see you at that place
in the hospital later at 11 p.m.

1228
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,906
Where the heck
is "that place in the hospital"?

1229
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:40,907
All right.

1230
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,910
So Je-in didn't know
that Han Survivor was dead at this point.

1231
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:44,828
Seems so.

1232
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:48,206
That's why she planned to present him
as a successful case

1233
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:51,543
-at her press conference.
-That's right.

1234
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:52,878
But then…

1235
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:56,256
She said she found the gang member
the police couldn't find.

1236
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,841
You know, that…

1237
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,011
You know, that…

1238
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:03,805
That's exactly why…

1239
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,599
-Hear me out. It won't take long.
-Oh my gosh.

1240
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,893
-Jeez, you scared me.
-I'll tell you everything.

1241
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,520
I didn't kill her.

1242
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,355
Why, you ask?

1243
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:16,651
There was the eve festival
the night before my inauguration,

1244
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:19,070
so I had to be there.

1245
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,406
You get it? Now, where did it go?

1246
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:23,241
Hang on, can I just go down first?

1247
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:26,161
-So I got this shovel and this knife…
-Darn it.

1248
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,121
-Okay, okay.
-All right.

1249
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,874
-Please don't kill us.
-I didn't have much time,

1250
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:33,376
and since we agreed to meet at 11 p.m.,

1251
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,587
I dug a hole first, okay?

1252
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:39,090
So I could kill her, bury the body,
and then return to the event.

1253
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,217
Kill whom?

1254
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,676
-Jang Je-in.
-Okay.

1255
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,054
She said she'd report me,
and I heard everything.

1256
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:45,388
So you planned to kill her

1257
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,057
-I did.
-and left to meet her at 11.

1258
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:48,683
But then the landslide happened.

1259
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:49,684
LANDSLIDE OCCURRED ON YEONJIDOL MOUNTAIN

1260
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,478
You saw all this stuff buried here.

1261
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:54,189
These were all buried here just today.

1262
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:55,941
-Right.
-You mean the tools?

1263
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,067
Look at this.

1264
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,694
Does it look like this knife
has been buried for five or six years?

1265
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,656
-It doesn't!
-Okay! We get it!

1266
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,199
Why are you pointing it at me?

1267
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:05,533
What I'm saying is…

1268
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:08,119
Okay, okay, we get it.

1269
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:10,413
-I didn't do it!
-All right.

1270
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,873
-Okay.
-You're free to go.

1271
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,458
Here's where I stand.

1272
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:15,585
I happened to have killed a few people,

1273
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:18,088
-but I didn't kill Jang Je-in.
-All right.

1274
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:20,048
Well, in that case,

1275
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:22,217
-can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

1276
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:26,221
When you messaged Je-in
to lure her to meet you at 11 p.m.,

1277
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:29,140
-you wrote you'd wait at the hospital.
-Yeah.

1278
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:32,978
Then, Je-in asked you to come
to "that place in the hospital."

1279
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:34,187
I'll see you at that place…

1280
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,648
"THAT PLACE" = SECRET OPERATING ROOM

1281
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:38,275
But you didn't know
about "that place," right?

1282
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:39,818
Honestly, no.

1283
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:41,486
I'm not Han Survivor,

1284
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:44,864
so I assumed
that she meant the director's office.

1285
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,950
I had no idea about the sixth floor.

1286
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:49,369
-So you just supplied the people.
-I swear…

1287
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,663
-You didn't know about the room?
-I just sent her the homeless.

1288
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:55,750
I had no idea what she did with them
or that the sixth floor even existed.

1289
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,377
We're never going to
solve the case at this rate.

1290
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,337
We'll never find the truth this way.

1291
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,298
-Detective, I have a question too.
-Shoot.

1292
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,800
Why did you keep so many of these
in your drawers, Shaman?

1293
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,802
-These?
-Yeah.

1294
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:09,264
FOUND IN SHAMAN'S SHRINE

1295
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:11,850
-Why are there so many garbage bags here?
-Hang on.

1296
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:13,893
Remember the one up there?

1297
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:18,940
One of these bags
was on the operating room's floor,

1298
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,650
where you don't need these at all.

1299
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,527
A BLACK PLASTIC BAG ON THE SIXTH FLOOR?

1300
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,904
IS IT PARK SHAMAN'S?

1301
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,114
Here's my guess.

1302
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:28,992
She would've brought it there
to carry back her brother's organs

1303
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:31,619
on the off chance she found them.

1304
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:33,371
In a plastic bag?

1305
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,498
-So people wouldn't see them.
-You'd need something to put them in.

1306
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:40,128
Why would I put the organs
in a plastic bag, of all things?

1307
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:41,421
Where else would you put them in?

1308
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:44,215
Some sort of sacred container,
don't you think?

1309
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,592
They're his organs.

1310
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,218
Just tell him he's right!

1311
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:50,347
Okay, fine. You're right.
I suppose I did what you said.

1312
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,223
-It's just that
-Yes?

1313
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:55,185
I saw that one suspicious plastic bag
on the sixth floor.

1314
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:01,316
Why was it there? That kept nagging at me.

1315
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:02,942
WHY WAS THERE A PLASTIC BAG
IN THE SECRET OPERATING ROOM?

1316
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,277
I want to know why.

1317
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,779
THERE MUST BE A REASON

1318
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:10,825
By the way, Ms. Park Shaman,
how did you say your brother died?

1319
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,620
His body was discovered on the mountain.

1320
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:15,455
But what state was his body in?

1321
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,082
Someone had removed all his organs.

1322
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:18,666
-All his organs were removed.
-Yeah.

1323
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,586
Now, look here.

1324
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:23,505
Here, and here too.

1325
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:25,924
-There are these suture marks.
-I see them.

1326
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:27,592
How old is that one?

1327
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,302
-Her chest--
-Isn't this a surgery scar?

1328
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,887
She had thoracic surgery.

1329
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:34,140
-I saw the results of her physical exam.
-What surgery was it?

1330
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,309
-Her echocardiogram numbers were very low.
-Her heart…

1331
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:37,811
Did we look at this?

1332
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:38,895
A LITTLE EARLIER

1333
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,271
"VIP Physical Exam."

1334
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:41,481
JANG JE-IN'S PHYSICAL EXAM RESULTS

1335
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:44,984
Why are her echocardiogram numbers so low?

1336
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,736
-Over here!
-Oh my gosh!

1337
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,030
Come here, hurry.

1338
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,115
One, two, three.

1339
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,784
Oh shit.

1340
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:55,995
THE SHOCKING REVEAL
MADE HER FORGET THE CLUE

1341
00:56:56,746 --> 00:57:00,250
Look. It says 34%.
The normal range is from 50 to 70.

1342
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,960
Look, it says, "echocardiogram."

1343
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,548
The normal range is from 50 to 70,
but hers was 34% in 2011.

1344
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:10,635
But in 2012, it suddenly dropped to 12%.

1345
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:12,720
-Much lower than normal.
-She got worse.

1346
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:13,930
She did. But guess what?

1347
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,474
-The next year, it shot up to 63%
-She improved.

1348
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:18,643
It reached the normal range,
out of the blue, in 2013.

1349
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:21,396
-She must've gotten a heart transplant.
-In 2013…

1350
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:22,439
Oh no!

1351
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,023
Oh no!

1352
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,317
What happened to your brother again?

1353
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,777
Oh, please don't.

1354
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:35,118
I think I know the killer.

1355
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,122
I can tell you what happened.

1356
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:40,582
-How?
-Go ahead.

1357
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:42,792
-Now?
-Yeah.

1358
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,837
We're not going to
find anything new here, are we?

1359
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,173
CLOSING IN ON THE CULPRIT?

1360
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,517
WHAT IS THE TRUTH
JANG DETECTIVE UNCOVERED?

1361
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:03,062
I think I've gotten close to the truth.

1362
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,105
Okay.

1363
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,609
Park Shaman,
let's go over your story again.

1364
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,988
You really are a shaman, correct?

1365
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,199
I am.

1366
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:17,035
You perform rites
and believe in the gods you serve.

1367
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:19,329
Yes. That's why I went so far
as to mummify my brother.

1368
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:20,538
Okay, then.

1369
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:22,540
What's this now?

1370
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:24,209
GO HIGH SHAMAN'S SECRET BOOK OF RITES

1371
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,336
CHAPTER 4. PURIFICATION RITES

1372
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,548
There's a rite
called the purification rite.

1373
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:33,468
…IF ONE'S BODY IS DESECRATED,
THEIR SOUL WANDERS IN THE AFTERLIFE…

1374
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:35,303
It's to send a soul to the afterlife.

1375
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:37,931
Sending a soul to the afterlife.

1376
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,600
Now, there's a particular order

1377
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:42,977
to how this rite is performed.

1378
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,730
An Doctor, please read it out loud.
Start with step one.

1379
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:49,275
"First, perform a sacrificial rite
prior to this rite."

1380
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:52,612
"This is to expel the evil spirit
from where the soul died

1381
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,740
and to seize the body and soul
of those who stole the dead's body."

1382
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:57,909
"Contain the evil spirit
in an animal carcass

1383
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:59,202
and expel it with a curse."

1384
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:00,203
Okay.

1385
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,248
She performed a rite over there
before the murder.

1386
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:06,876
9:20 P.M.
RITE FOR VILLAGE'S WELL-BEING

1387
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,461
IN FRONT OF HOSPITAL

1388
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,046
-And an animal was sacrificed.
-The pig.

1389
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:13,633
-Next.
-But I didn't plan that rite.

1390
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:14,592
Stop! Allow me.

1391
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:18,096
"Second, begin the purification rite."

1392
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:20,515
"Place the hanji doll
made in the person's likeness

1393
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:22,976
and the deceased's belongings
in the spirit container,

1394
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,853
then offer a prayer
to summon the soul of the deceased."

1395
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:29,274
Here, the hanji doll, or paper doll,
in the deceased's likeness.

1396
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:32,068
She put it in the earthenware pot.

1397
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:36,114
PAPER DOLL AND HER BROTHER'S BELONGINGS
KEPT IN THE POT

1398
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:38,074
Okay? She put these in the pot.

1399
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:39,409
-"Third."
-Yes, next.

1400
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:41,536
"Circle the body
while carrying the spirit container,

1401
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:43,204
and offer another heartfelt prayer."

1402
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:46,916
"Now that you've summoned their soul,
collect the parts of the desecrated body

1403
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,335
-and unite them."
-She had to collect the body parts!

1404
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:53,798
She told us all of his organs were gone.

1405
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,802
So she had to find them.

1406
00:59:58,469 --> 01:00:00,763
She had to collect
her dead brother's organs

1407
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,224
and bring them all back.

1408
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:04,851
Man, I'm getting goosebumps.

1409
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,269
And now, the last step.

1410
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:09,814
"Only then can the deceased ascend to
paradise and not become an evil spirit."

1411
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:12,859
She's trying to
send her brother to the afterlife

1412
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:16,112
because she believes that his soul
is still wandering the earth.

1413
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:17,488
-Can I say my piece now?
-Okay.

1414
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:20,575
This isn't anything special.
It's a common cleansing rite.

1415
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:21,701
That rite is just as common.

1416
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:24,621
All shamans do it. I didn't go out
of my way for my brother or anything.

1417
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:27,874
Just because you found this today
doesn't mean I started it today.

1418
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:31,002
I've been preparing for this rite
ever since I found my brother's body

1419
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:33,087
all those years ago.

1420
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:35,048
We're talking about my brother's soul.

1421
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,258
I'm a shaman. This is what I do.

1422
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:40,553
I can't let his soul wander
while I'm helping other souls find peace.

1423
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:44,849
But I would've had to find his organs
to truly complete this rite.

1424
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:46,643
But I haven't.

1425
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:50,229
She doesn't have his heart right now,

1426
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:54,150
but when you apply
the order of that rite from the book

1427
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:58,196
to the crime scene
currently laid out before us,

1428
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:01,240
it fits all too perfectly.

1429
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:05,745
She finally managed to find
her brother's remains on the mountain,

1430
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,789
but his heart was missing.

1431
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:09,457
Then, she probably figured out

1432
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:13,169
that Je-in had it transplanted into her.

1433
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:14,545
It's a possibility.

1434
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:18,049
That's why she couldn't bury him
and just left him like that.

1435
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:20,635
But then she heard
that Je-in was coming back.

1436
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:23,513
Keep in mind, she has to send her
brother's wandering soul to the afterlife.

1437
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:27,225
Then, by the logic of that rite,

1438
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:30,061
she would have to recover
what he had lost.

1439
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:33,022
-By that logic, you're right.
-Just think about it, you know.

1440
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:35,483
But I couldn't have known for sure
that Je-in had his heart

1441
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:37,944
because I had no idea
she had heart surgery.

1442
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:42,448
But you could've known
that she had a weak heart.

1443
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:43,449
-Well, that's…
-You said

1444
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,284
she had to get treatment after your prank

1445
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,912
-in high school.
-She just came back after passing out.

1446
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:51,541
-The report mentioned Je-in's heart.
-It did mention a heart attack.

1447
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:55,461
But I thought she just fainted from shock,
not from a real heart attack.

1448
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:58,339
I never took it that seriously.

1449
01:01:58,423 --> 01:01:59,924
I had no professional knowledge

1450
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:02,385
to be able to figure out
that she had a congenital heart disease

1451
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:04,303
just because she almost
had a heart attack.

1452
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:06,639
The more plausible her excuses are,
the more suspicious she seems.

1453
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,307
But I'm telling the truth here.

1454
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:11,519
Hey.

1455
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:14,439
What about this, then?

1456
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:19,777
"Memorial tablet of the dead, Brother."

1457
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:21,487
MEMORIAL TABLET
FOUND ON HER BROTHER'S REMAINS

1458
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:22,447
"Memorial tablet."

1459
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,744
I just can't seem to

1460
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:31,414
suspect Park Shaman even if I want to.

1461
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:33,583
We've already deduced
that someone intercepted

1462
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:36,461
Je-in's meeting
with Park Village head at 11.

1463
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:41,007
But Park Shaman had no way of knowing
the content of Mr. Village Head's text.

1464
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,926
And there's no evidence
to prove that she did.

1465
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:47,221
How could she intercept a meeting
only the two of them knew about?

1466
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:52,268
-I don't think that's possible.
-You do make a very valid point.

1467
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:56,189
Could any one of us have known about
Park Village Head's text?

1468
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,649
I'm not sure, but I don't think so.

1469
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:00,234
-Right?
-Yeah.

1470
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:02,278
There were voicemails to Han Survivor.

1471
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:03,196
In his voicemail box?

1472
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:04,405
IN HAN SURVIVOR'S VOICEMAIL BOX

1473
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:07,366
I'll see you at that place
in the hospital later at 11 p.m.

1474
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:08,284
JANG JE-IN'S REPLY

1475
01:03:09,994 --> 01:03:11,537
For example,

1476
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:15,041
if she sent that voicemail
while she was at the hotel…

1477
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:16,751
30 MINUTES AGO

1478
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:20,087
-Can I help you?
-Are you aware of Ms. Jang's murder?

1479
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:21,923
I didn't have enough time
to properly look at it,

1480
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:26,677
but someone could've checked

1481
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:29,806
Yeonjidol Hotel's guest list

1482
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:34,352
and found her room number
and other details.

1483
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:35,645
After that,

1484
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:38,773
they could've gone to her room

1485
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:40,858
or approached her

1486
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,527
and overheard something.

1487
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:45,488
Or they could've bugged her room.

1488
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:52,912
-Mr. Village Head…
-Yeah?

1489
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:56,707
He knew Je-in was staying in Room 305.

1490
01:03:58,209 --> 01:03:59,544
-You're right.
-How?

1491
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:01,921
-The reporter.
-The reporter told him.

1492
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:04,966
-Yeah.
-"I heard she was staying in Room 305."

1493
01:04:05,049 --> 01:04:07,677
Then he could've left this note
in Room 305.

1494
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,513
Right, and when I asked
the hotel manager about him earlier,

1495
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:12,390
he said Mr. Village Head
came by the hotel.

1496
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:13,891
-With the governor.
-Yeah.

1497
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,687
What was held at 11 p.m.?

1498
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:21,858
There was a party,
and the closing ceremony was at 11:50 p.m.

1499
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,278
-Were you at the party, Mr. Village Head?
-No, he wasn't.

1500
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,447
-He said he kept stepping out.
-He was gone until 11:30 p.m.

1501
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,408
The youth association leader
was looking for him,

1502
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:31,659
and he replied, "I'm almost there."

1503
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:33,786
Wait, but this is…

1504
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:39,542
Mr. Village Head was supposed
to say a few words at the end, right?

1505
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:43,129
He got a text confirming that the schedule
was moved up to 11:30 p.m.

1506
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:45,298
-It was moved up to 11:30 p.m.?
-It was.

1507
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:47,300
Let's say he met Je-in at 11 p.m.

1508
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:50,428
-He'd be late.
-He wouldn't have made it back in time.

1509
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:53,639
But he received that text
at 10:03 p.m., right?

1510
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,725
If he had read it right away,

1511
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:58,311
-he could've gone up to leave the note.
-And change the time.

1512
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:04,233
If that note was left in front of
or stuck on the door of her hotel room,

1513
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:07,778
Mr. Village Head is the one
most likely to have done it.

1514
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:09,655
He knew her room number

1515
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,991
and his whereabouts that day

1516
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:14,035
gave him access to the hotel notepad.

1517
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:15,953
Me?

1518
01:05:17,663 --> 01:05:20,249
-Suppose someone came here.
-Okay.

1519
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,043
By "someone," I mean this guy.

1520
01:05:22,126 --> 01:05:25,296
If he had asked
where his cousin was staying,

1521
01:05:25,379 --> 01:05:26,881
surely the manager would've told him.

1522
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:29,008
Think about it.

1523
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,676
Jang Cousin received that text.

1524
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,596
"Family? Please." That one.

1525
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:34,972
What's more,

1526
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:37,892
he found three clues in a row at the end.

1527
01:05:37,975 --> 01:05:39,310
Two upstairs

1528
01:05:39,393 --> 01:05:40,937
-and Survivor's phone.
-Right.

1529
01:05:41,562 --> 01:05:43,397
I think that settles it.

1530
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:45,483
In addition to all that,
he started to suspect me.

1531
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:47,068
I don't suspect you.

1532
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:49,278
So that's where I… All right, then.

1533
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:51,280
-I suspect someone else.
-If you say so.

1534
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:53,407
I've never met a character
like Mr. Park Village Head.

1535
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:54,784
HIS UNORTHODOX APPROACH CONFUSES HER

1536
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:56,452
-I can't read him.
-I wouldn't kill someone that way.

1537
01:05:56,535 --> 01:06:01,082
I do have a bit of a gambler's streak.

1538
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,668
I believe if someone falsely accuses me,

1539
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:05,795
they have some skeletons in their closet.

1540
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:09,173
-I'm thinking in terms of this whole game.
-Okay.

1541
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:15,137
Now, we'll have a three-minute session

1542
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:17,765
for a final sweep.

1543
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:20,017
I hope you all find the real culprit.

1544
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:23,020
We haven't been
this split in opinion for a while.

1545
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,480
We must've missed some clues.

1546
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:29,068
Last chance.

1547
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:33,698
Will we find some more clues?

1548
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:34,991
Je-in!

1549
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,869
What could you have possibly done
to deserve such a gruesome death?

1550
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:40,579
CAST YOUR VOTE BASED ON THE CLUES

1551
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:41,747
You know…

1552
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:44,917
this text is too suspicious.

1553
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:50,297
Someone had to leave her that note

1554
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:52,758
to lure her to the hospital.

1555
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,802
Let's think about why they left the note.

1556
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:58,347
It was to move up the meeting.
And why was that?

1557
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,349
Because the closing ceremony was moved up.

1558
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,393
Mr. Village Head
was in too much of a hurry,

1559
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:07,773
which is why he had to leave a note
to meet her 30 minutes earlier.

1560
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:11,235
Then, how did he know
about the sixth floor?

1561
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:14,155
Because he knew
about her secret experiments.

1562
01:07:14,238 --> 01:07:16,198
She was supplying him with free labor.

1563
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:19,410
He said there was nothing more to it,

1564
01:07:19,493 --> 01:07:22,079
but there's no proof to back it up.

1565
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:23,039
Also…

1566
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:26,250
The reporter sent Mr. Village Head a text

1567
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:30,004
regarding which hotel
and what room Je-in is staying in.

1568
01:07:30,087 --> 01:07:33,174
But that wasn't all
that the reporter told him.

1569
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:36,343
They told Mr. Village Head
about her press conference.

1570
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:38,721
What was that press conference about?

1571
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:39,722
Han Survivor.

1572
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:41,182
Who killed Han Survivor?

1573
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:43,100
Park Village Head.

1574
01:07:43,809 --> 01:07:47,521
Je-in said she found out the identity
of the gang member

1575
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:48,981
who evaded police,

1576
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:54,653
and Park Village Head would've known
he was the one she was talking about.

1577
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:57,406
I'm holding the press conference
tomorrow as planned

1578
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,784
and sharing this
with the press and the police.

1579
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:03,120
That day was the day of his inauguration.

1580
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:05,206
He was about to lose

1581
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:09,001
everything he had worked so hard for.

1582
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,628
That might've driven him

1583
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:13,422
to move up the meeting
and kill her right then and there.

1584
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:16,801
To keep his true identity
as Park Enforcer a secret,

1585
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:19,428
he killed Jang Je-in.

1586
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:23,766
AN DOCTOR AND PARK SHAMAN
CHOSE PARK VILLAGE HEAD

1587
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:24,934
PARK VILLAGE HEAD

1588
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:27,436
PARK VILLAGE HEAD: 2, PARK SHAMAN: 1

1589
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,646
At first,

1590
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:31,524
I thought An Doctor was the killer.

1591
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:37,488
But nothing's scarier
than a vengeful family member.

1592
01:08:37,571 --> 01:08:41,075
His father was the eldest,
but the second son got the inheritance.

1593
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:43,244
So he wouldn't have given up
on the hospital building

1594
01:08:43,327 --> 01:08:46,372
because there was gold buried there
that only he knew about.

1595
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:48,582
He probably constantly searched the place,

1596
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:53,045
which makes him the most likely person
to have discovered the sixth floor.

1597
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:55,131
My gambler's heart

1598
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:57,925
tells me to pick Jang Cousin.

1599
01:08:58,592 --> 01:09:02,471
PARK VILLAGE HEAD CHOSE JANG COUSIN

1600
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:15,317
JANG COUSIN

1601
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:19,321
"The crime scene
always speaks for itself."

1602
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:24,410
An Doctor was caught on camera
during that live stream,

1603
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:27,955
and the gown and cap
she was wearing in the video

1604
01:09:28,038 --> 01:09:33,252
were all identical
to the ones we found on the sixth floor.

1605
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:39,675
Also, you can only get to the sixth floor
by taking the elevator.

1606
01:09:39,758 --> 01:09:44,471
But you need diesel fuel
to get the elevator running,

1607
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:47,474
and An Doctor did buy 10,000 won's worth.

1608
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:49,643
It was you.

1609
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:52,897
JANG COUSIN CHOSE AN DOCTOR

1610
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:59,862
JANG DETECTIVE'S FINAL 3 MINUTES

1611
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:06,535
MEMORIAL TABLET OF THE DEAD, BROTHER

1612
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:07,745
Okay.

1613
01:10:10,247 --> 01:10:11,081
There's no doubt.

1614
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:16,045
JANG DETECTIVE CHOSE PARK SHAMAN

1615
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:19,256
PARK VILLAGE HEAD: 2, PARK SHAMAN: 2

1616
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:20,382
In any case,

1617
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:24,845
you can't always find all the clues
and complete the puzzle perfectly.

1618
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:28,766
You have to make a choice
after weighing the possibilities.

1619
01:10:29,683 --> 01:10:32,853
The killer slashed both her shoulders.

1620
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:36,941
Seems like they wanted to
dismember her completely.

1621
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:38,317
BRUTALIZED TO AN UNUSUAL DEGREE

1622
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,654
He's killed a lot of people before
and in various ways.

1623
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:46,200
So if anyone can carry out
a murder this brutal,

1624
01:10:46,283 --> 01:10:47,368
it's Park Village Head.

1625
01:10:47,451 --> 01:10:48,661
WORK OF A FORMER GANG MEMBER?

1626
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:50,829
But there is another possibility.

1627
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:54,708
Maybe Park Shaman
wanted to take out Je-in's heart,

1628
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:57,127
but her time was suddenly cut short.

1629
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:58,295
That could've been why

1630
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:00,798
she was forced to run away

1631
01:11:00,881 --> 01:11:02,841
without actually accomplishing her goal.

1632
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:05,386
That could be a possibility.

1633
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:10,683
This case…

1634
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:13,435
was particularly tough.

1635
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:16,230
The one who killed my Je-in…

1636
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:18,774
is you.

1637
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:23,904
FINAL VOTE COMPLETE

1638
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:29,159
The very first episode
of the deduction game, Crime Scene Zero.

1639
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:33,038
-I recognize her voice. So it's all live.
-You bet it is.

1640
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:36,166
The results of the nail-biting
deduction game to find the culprit

1641
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,585
of the murder
in the abandoned hospital are in.

1642
01:11:40,004 --> 01:11:43,924
Let's see who received the most votes
as the real culprit.

1643
01:11:44,883 --> 01:11:46,343
We will now

1644
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:49,096
announce the results.

1645
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:51,932
I'm nervous.

1646
01:11:52,516 --> 01:11:56,979
First, we will announce who was excluded
from the final list of suspects.

1647
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:00,107
With zero votes…

1648
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:04,737
Kim Handsome, you are excluded
from the final lineup.

1649
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:06,280
Wait, no one picked me?

1650
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:08,157
No one likes me?

1651
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,576
-It was because you're out of your mind.
-Pull yourself together.

1652
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:12,745
-You're off the list for sure.
-Please like me.

1653
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:15,039
-Next.
-There's more?

1654
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:16,498
With one vote…

1655
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:18,876
An Doctor…

1656
01:12:21,253 --> 01:12:22,463
and Jang Cousin,

1657
01:12:22,546 --> 01:12:24,423
you are also excluded
from the final lineup.

1658
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:26,842
-Did you vote for each other?
-No.

1659
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:28,385
-Did you?
-I didn't.

1660
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:32,473
And so, Park Village Head and Park Shaman

1661
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:34,224
were identified as suspects.

1662
01:12:35,225 --> 01:12:37,686
Which one of you messed up this time?

1663
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:39,730
Why are there two final suspects?

1664
01:12:39,813 --> 01:12:42,066
-So this is how it went.
-This is wrong.

1665
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:45,986
Will the two final suspects
please step forward?

1666
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:51,533
The ultimate deduction game,
Crime Scene Zero.

1667
01:12:52,284 --> 01:12:56,413
The results of the final vote
of the murder in the abandoned hospital.

1668
01:12:56,997 --> 01:13:00,501
The player who was ultimately identified
as the culprit is…

1669
01:13:00,584 --> 01:13:02,419
Man, this one was tough.

1670
01:13:03,003 --> 01:13:04,880
In a three to two split,

1671
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:08,050
the player with three votes is…

1672
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:11,970
Park Shaman!

1673
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:13,472
-What?
-What?

1674
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:14,640
Wow, this is…

1675
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:17,017
KIM HANDSOME CHOSE PARK SHAMAN

1676
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:18,769
-Park Shaman?
-Me?

1677
01:13:18,852 --> 01:13:19,686
Really?

1678
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:21,480
-Looks like it's her.
-Park Shaman?

1679
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:24,400
Park Shaman, you've been identified
as the final suspect.

1680
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:26,735
Please enter the jail.

1681
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:29,488
Mole-rye!

1682
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:31,490
-"Mole-rye."
-Hey, Mole-sun.

1683
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:33,492
What did you do?

1684
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:35,285
It wasn't me.

1685
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:37,496
-Mole-rye.
-How could this happen?

1686
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:44,169
Thank goodness we captured Mole-sun,
my Je-in's killer.

1687
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:46,922
The players who voted for Park Shaman,

1688
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:49,049
Jang Detective

1689
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:50,968
and Kim Handsome,

1690
01:13:51,051 --> 01:13:52,803
please step forward.

1691
01:13:54,304 --> 01:13:55,472
-He gets two votes?
-That brat.

1692
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:57,850
-He cast one vote earlier.
-Yeah, halfway through.

1693
01:13:57,933 --> 01:14:00,519
This is because of your first vote,
Detective.

1694
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:01,645
Wait.

1695
01:14:01,728 --> 01:14:03,230
Two people voted for Park Village Head?

1696
01:14:03,313 --> 01:14:06,066
Wow, that was close.
We could've been in real trouble.

1697
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:08,360
What do you mean, "real trouble"?

1698
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,613
If Park Shaman is the real culprit,

1699
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:13,532
Jang Detective and Kim Handsome

1700
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:17,202
will each win two million won.

1701
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:21,999
If Park Shaman is not the culprit,

1702
01:14:22,082 --> 01:14:25,419
the real killer will claim the prize money
of all other players,

1703
01:14:25,502 --> 01:14:28,046
a total of ten million won.

1704
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:29,798
-The real killer gets it?
-A whopping ten million won?

1705
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:31,758
-Not those who voted for the culprit?
-Ten million?

1706
01:14:32,342 --> 01:14:37,514
Park Shaman has been voted as the culprit
in the murder in the abandoned hospital.

1707
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:39,683
Let me load up on a few tears of joy.

1708
01:14:41,393 --> 01:14:43,645
If we're wrong about this,

1709
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:46,398
hand me that whole bottle of eye drops.

1710
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:49,109
Is she really the culprit

1711
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:52,404
who killed Jang Je-in?

1712
01:14:54,031 --> 01:14:55,199
Ms. Park Shaman.

1713
01:14:56,241 --> 01:14:57,159
"Are you…"

1714
01:14:57,242 --> 01:14:58,577
Are you…

1715
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:02,873
Jang Je-in's killer?

1716
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:09,171
I wonder.

1717
01:15:09,254 --> 01:15:10,881
-Oh, come on!
-Jeez!

1718
01:15:11,465 --> 01:15:12,674
I wonder.

1719
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:15,802
HEARTS RACING

1720
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:20,057
Since when did you toy with us?

1721
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:24,186
We have to watch our blood pressure
and heart health. Please don't do that.

1722
01:15:24,269 --> 01:15:25,812
I have to put more drops in now.

1723
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:28,565
Ms. Park Shaman.

1724
01:15:29,441 --> 01:15:30,442
Are you…

1725
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:32,402
I'm suddenly a bit worried.

1726
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:34,112
-Why? Don't be.
-I have no idea.

1727
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:36,448
…Jang Je-in's killer?

1728
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:41,161
Je-in…

1729
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:44,540
Yes, she is!

1730
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:47,876
Yes, she is!

1731
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,587
SUCCESSFULLY APPREHENDED THE CULPRIT

1732
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:51,588
I knew it!

1733
01:15:54,424 --> 01:15:56,593
-I told you it wasn't me!
-We caught my Je-in's killer!

1734
01:15:56,677 --> 01:16:00,347
I mean, come on.
I kept pushing her as the prime suspect.

1735
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:02,057
-How could you?
-Well, I…

1736
01:16:02,849 --> 01:16:05,894
But there was one thing
that was nagging at me.

1737
01:16:06,478 --> 01:16:08,897
Only the word "brother"
was written in Korean on the tablet,

1738
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:11,900
and that really bothered me.

1739
01:16:12,484 --> 01:16:13,485
Here it is.

1740
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:16,071
DURING THE FINAL EXAMINATION OF THE SCENE

1741
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:18,490
Oh man, I was an idiot.

1742
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:19,866
Why did I

1743
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:21,660
just let this slide?

1744
01:16:22,202 --> 01:16:23,870
I thought about why

1745
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:27,124
only the word "brother"
was written in Korean.

1746
01:16:27,207 --> 01:16:29,543
And when it comes to the word
for "the dead,"

1747
01:16:29,626 --> 01:16:31,420
normally, the character used for it

1748
01:16:31,503 --> 01:16:33,714
is the one that means "person," not "son."

1749
01:16:33,797 --> 01:16:35,257
And in this particular case,

1750
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:39,344
she should actually use
the character for "younger male sibling."

1751
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:42,139
So when I thought about why she didn't,
it just hit me.

1752
01:16:42,222 --> 01:16:44,057
He was her son.

1753
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:47,185
You only write the character "son"
to mean the deceased

1754
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:49,605
-when the deceased is your son.
-What?

1755
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:53,066
How would they know any of that?

1756
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:56,445
So, "Brother" is her son's name in Korean.

1757
01:16:56,528 --> 01:16:59,448
The moment I figured that out--

1758
01:16:59,531 --> 01:17:01,199
He was your son?

1759
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:02,326
Yes.

1760
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:05,495
-Why would you name your son "Brother"?
-I should boil you alive!

1761
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:07,205
Who names their son "Brother"?

1762
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:09,708
I named him "Brother"
because I raised him like one.

1763
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:12,669
All the clues were in the memorial tablet.

1764
01:17:12,753 --> 01:17:16,214
We'll now announce
the key piece of evidence you missed.

1765
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:17,716
I'm dying to know.

1766
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:19,426
How did she know about the sixth floor?

1767
01:17:19,509 --> 01:17:24,431
Take a look under the headboard
of the bed in Jang Je-in's hotel room.

1768
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:28,393
Hey, who searched this room?

1769
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:30,771
What's this?

1770
01:17:30,854 --> 01:17:32,105
It's a bug. Damn it.

1771
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:33,940
-This?
-A bug?

1772
01:17:34,024 --> 01:17:35,984
-How do you turn this on?
-So that's how.

1773
01:17:36,568 --> 01:17:38,278
She must've been listening in

1774
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:41,615
when Je-in left that message.

1775
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:43,075
She bugged her room!

1776
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:46,370
That was why she moved up the meeting.

1777
01:17:46,453 --> 01:17:48,789
Wow, I had no idea.

1778
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:51,833
-Did you kill her wearing that gown?
-Yeah.

1779
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:52,834
Darn it!

1780
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:54,753
Why the heck would you wear that?

1781
01:17:56,171 --> 01:17:57,756
-Why can't I?
-Is that what you're mad about?

1782
01:17:57,839 --> 01:17:59,091
Unbelievable.

1783
01:17:59,716 --> 01:18:01,635
Did that black plastic bag
have nothing to do with it?

1784
01:18:01,718 --> 01:18:05,138
No, I brought it with me
to put the heart in there.

1785
01:18:05,889 --> 01:18:07,724
I was right about the plastic bag.

1786
01:18:08,266 --> 01:18:11,311
She said she meant to carry
the heart in that bag.

1787
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:13,271
No one believed me.

1788
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:15,440
That's rich. You voted for me!

1789
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:18,694
Why'd you have to
go find three clues at the end?

1790
01:18:18,777 --> 01:18:21,446
Actually, I was worried
you'd find the plastic bag,

1791
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:24,116
so I slid it away with my foot to hide it.

1792
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:25,492
But he still somehow found it.

1793
01:18:25,575 --> 01:18:28,412
Mr. Village Head, you found
a key piece of evidence.

1794
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:29,955
-Great job.
-Good work.

1795
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:31,081
Your voice was so strong.

1796
01:18:31,164 --> 01:18:32,708
You gave a great performance.

1797
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,379
THE FULL STORY BEHIND
THE MURDER IN THE ABANDONED HOSPITAL

1798
01:18:37,462 --> 01:18:41,174
Park Shaman grew up extremely poor
in Yeonjidol Village

1799
01:18:41,258 --> 01:18:44,177
and was bullied
throughout her school years

1800
01:18:44,261 --> 01:18:47,889
by Jang Je-in, the only daughter
of an influential local resident.

1801
01:18:48,473 --> 01:18:50,308
In the winter
of her final year in high school,

1802
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:52,602
she couldn't take the bullying any longer

1803
01:18:52,686 --> 01:18:57,315
and attempted a minor revenge on Je-in
by slipping a dead mouse in her backpack.

1804
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:00,902
But Je-in collapsed in shock,
clutching at her heart,

1805
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:02,946
and was taken to the emergency room.

1806
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:06,992
It was revealed that Je-in
had a congenital heart disease,

1807
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:10,078
and Shaman was expelled
right before graduation

1808
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:13,665
for endangering the life
of an influential local's daughter.

1809
01:19:14,374 --> 01:19:17,669
She then moved to Seoul for work

1810
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:21,089
and started dating Gu Male Doc,
a medical student at E-Ryu University.

1811
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:23,133
Just as she was becoming happy,

1812
01:19:24,134 --> 01:19:27,137
she was suddenly possessed by a god

1813
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:30,015
and also found herself
unexpectedly pregnant.

1814
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:32,768
Gu Male Doc heartlessly left her

1815
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:35,228
after throwing her some money
for an abortion.

1816
01:19:36,354 --> 01:19:37,773
In fact,

1817
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:40,567
Gu Male Doc had fallen for Jang Je-in,
a fellow medical student,

1818
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:42,486
and left Shaman for her.

1819
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:46,823
She gave birth as a single mother,
but her son was born blind.

1820
01:19:46,907 --> 01:19:49,075
To protect him from the inherited fate
of becoming a shaman,

1821
01:19:49,159 --> 01:19:52,537
she registered him
not as her son but as her brother

1822
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:55,332
and sent him to be raised by her mother,
who lived alone.

1823
01:19:55,415 --> 01:19:57,918
The only hope Shaman had

1824
01:19:58,001 --> 01:20:00,462
was to raise 500 million won

1825
01:20:00,545 --> 01:20:02,923
for the surgery
that could restore her son's eyesight.

1826
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:05,634
But one day,

1827
01:20:05,717 --> 01:20:07,511
her mother passed away.

1828
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:11,556
Shaman then returned to Yeonjidol Village
to take care of her son.

1829
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:13,517
However,

1830
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,811
by some cruel twist of fate,

1831
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:19,231
Je-in also returned to Yeonjidol Village
that same year

1832
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:21,149
and opened a psychiatric hospital.

1833
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:24,569
As revenge on Je-in,

1834
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:27,656
Shaman spread false rumors
among the families of the patients

1835
01:20:27,739 --> 01:20:29,324
that the hospital
was haunted by evil spirits

1836
01:20:29,407 --> 01:20:31,493
and charged them exorbitant prices
for rites and talismans,

1837
01:20:31,576 --> 01:20:34,663
finally raising the 500 million won
for her son's surgery.

1838
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:38,041
But once Je-in found out,

1839
01:20:38,124 --> 01:20:41,503
she reported Shaman to the police,
leaving her to be taken into custody.

1840
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:44,381
When she was finally released
after ten days,

1841
01:20:44,464 --> 01:20:46,550
she rushed back home,

1842
01:20:47,926 --> 01:20:50,720
only to find that her son had disappeared.

1843
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:54,558
She searched the whole village,
but he had vanished without a trace.

1844
01:20:55,308 --> 01:20:56,184
However,

1845
01:20:56,268 --> 01:21:00,730
Yeonjidol Psychiatric Hospital closed down
while Shaman was in custody,

1846
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:03,525
and Je-in also disappeared.

1847
01:21:04,734 --> 01:21:07,445
This triggered her intuition
as a mother and shaman,

1848
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:10,782
and she frantically began
searching the hospital.

1849
01:21:11,741 --> 01:21:14,536
In the elevator,
she discovered a hidden button.

1850
01:21:15,453 --> 01:21:18,081
And upon pressing it,

1851
01:21:19,165 --> 01:21:22,544
she arrived on the sixth floor,
which was hidden from the outside.

1852
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:26,631
There, she found a secret operating room

1853
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:30,093
where Je-in
illegally practiced frontal lobotomies.

1854
01:21:30,176 --> 01:21:32,554
And inside a freezer tucked in the corner

1855
01:21:32,637 --> 01:21:35,807
was the body of her son
she'd been desperately searching for,

1856
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:39,060
abandoned with his heart ripped out.

1857
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:41,521
At that moment,

1858
01:21:41,605 --> 01:21:45,275
Shaman remembered
Je-in's congenital heart disease

1859
01:21:45,358 --> 01:21:47,777
and realized that Je-in had locked her up

1860
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:51,156
and taken her son's heart
while she was in custody.

1861
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:52,616
COMPLAINT

1862
01:21:52,699 --> 01:21:55,076
Since her son was mutilated
and died away from home,

1863
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,370
he was fated to become an evil spirit.

1864
01:21:57,454 --> 01:21:59,122
To prevent this,

1865
01:21:59,205 --> 01:22:02,125
Shaman had to recover his heart from Je-in

1866
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:04,085
and perform a purification rite.

1867
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:09,591
Shaman mummified her son's body and put it
inside the Buddha statue at her shrine

1868
01:22:09,674 --> 01:22:11,676
to serve and honor it,

1869
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,846
and waited for Je-in's return.

1870
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,766
Five years later,

1871
01:22:17,849 --> 01:22:21,102
to prepare for the rite
to be performed at the eve festival,

1872
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:23,355
Shaman dropped by Yeonjidol Hotel

1873
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:28,443
and heard the news that Je-in was back
and staying at the hotel.

1874
01:22:28,526 --> 01:22:29,819
The next day,

1875
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:32,030
while Chong Manager was distracted,

1876
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:35,659
she secretly checked the guest list
and stole the master key

1877
01:22:35,742 --> 01:22:38,828
to install a bug in Je-in's room.

1878
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:43,375
She discovered that Je-in agreed to meet
with someone named Han Survivor

1879
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:47,963
at 11 p.m. that night at "that place"
in Yeonjidol Psychiatric Hospital.

1880
01:22:48,755 --> 01:22:51,591
Shaman recalled Han Survivor's name,

1881
01:22:51,675 --> 01:22:54,552
which she had seen years ago
in the secret operating room.

1882
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:56,346
That meant

1883
01:22:56,429 --> 01:23:00,642
the two were going to meet
in the secret room on the sixth floor.

1884
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:04,980
Thinking this was the perfect opportunity

1885
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:07,691
for her to take her son's heart
back from Je-in,

1886
01:23:07,774 --> 01:23:10,402
Shaman left a note
pretending to be Han Survivor

1887
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:13,780
to get her to show up 30 minutes earlier.

1888
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:18,576
The first step in the purification rite
to appease her son's restless soul

1889
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,245
was to perform a sacrificial rite.

1890
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:22,414
She moved the location from the hotel

1891
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:24,165
to the front of the hospital,

1892
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:26,334
and instead of praying
for the village's peace,

1893
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:28,545
she cast a curse on Je-in.

1894
01:23:29,045 --> 01:23:32,424
She then returned home to place
the paper doll in her son's likeness

1895
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:35,301
and his belongings
in the spirit container.

1896
01:23:36,594 --> 01:23:40,098
Then, Shaman grabbed
a plastic bag for the heart

1897
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:43,560
and a container full of diesel
and headed to the hospital.

1898
01:23:44,102 --> 01:23:46,229
She filled
the emergency generator with diesel,

1899
01:23:46,312 --> 01:23:48,565
got the elevator running,

1900
01:23:48,648 --> 01:23:51,276
and hid in the secret operating room
on the sixth floor.

1901
01:23:52,318 --> 01:23:54,237
At 10:30 p.m.,

1902
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:57,490
when Je-in arrived at the operating room,

1903
01:23:57,574 --> 01:24:00,660
Shaman rendered her unconscious
by striking her in the head with a hammer.

1904
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:04,789
She was about to open Je-in's chest
with an electric saw to take her heart

1905
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,876
when Je-in woke up screaming.

1906
01:24:08,918 --> 01:24:12,088
A fierce struggle ensued,
with Je-in trying to escape

1907
01:24:12,172 --> 01:24:14,257
and Shaman trying to catch her.

1908
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:18,511
Je-in attempted to escape
through the window onto the ledge.

1909
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:23,767
Deciding to take the heart
after making her fall off the ledge,

1910
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:26,978
Shaman slashed Je-in's left wrist,
as she held onto the hospital sign,

1911
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:29,230
with the electric saw.

1912
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:31,066
Unable to hold on any longer,

1913
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:32,734
Je-in eventually fell

1914
01:24:32,817 --> 01:24:36,946
and got caught in the tangled power wires
on the outer wall of the hospital.

1915
01:24:37,655 --> 01:24:41,159
Unable to extract Je-in's heart
or retrieve and discard her body,

1916
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:42,994
Shaman was at a loss.

1917
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:44,996
But the clock neared 11 p.m.,

1918
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,040
the time Han Survivor
was expected to come.

1919
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:50,835
So she had no choice
but to return to her shrine.

1920
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:54,714
She vowed to extract her son's heart

1921
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:58,134
once Je-in's body
was recovered and buried

1922
01:24:58,676 --> 01:25:00,386
and continued praying.

1923
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:06,810
Hey.

1924
01:25:09,354 --> 01:25:10,271
Yes?

1925
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:11,689
JOO DAUGHTER-IN-LAW

1926
01:25:13,441 --> 01:25:14,776
JANG YOUNGEST'S ROOM

1927
01:25:14,859 --> 01:25:15,902
-You…
-Did you knock out this wall?

1928
01:25:15,985 --> 01:25:19,572
-Did you seduce my son?
-Oh my goodness!

1929
01:25:19,656 --> 01:25:21,699
Hang on a second.

1930
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:23,368
Please let go of me first.

1931
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:26,454
-Let go of me.
-No, I won't. I'll let go once you talk.

1932
01:25:26,538 --> 01:25:29,582
-Let go and I'll talk.
-Talk and I'll let go.

1933
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:31,292
-Let go and I'll talk.
-You want this to go on forever?

1934
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:32,752
-Let go.
-I don't exactly need an answer.

1935
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:34,003
I don't feel like talking either.

1936
01:25:34,087 --> 01:25:35,588
-Then I'll keep holding on.
-Okay, then. Shall we?

1937
01:25:35,672 --> 01:25:36,798
-Let's go.
-Fine by me.

1938
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:44,365
