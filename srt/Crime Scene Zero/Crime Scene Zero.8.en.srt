1
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,092
Who's that?

2
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:11,678
Who's that?

3
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:13,471
MURDER IN THE NIGHTLIFE DISTRICT II

4
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,724
-That's Park Hyeon-jun.
-Park Hyeon-jun?

5
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,018
WHY IS PARK HYEON-JUN
IN A PHOTO LEE GUN-JUN HAD?

6
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,103
-Hang on.
-The boy's name is Park Hyeon-jun.

7
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,187
PARK HYEON-JUN

8
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,897
-Park Hyeon-jun?
-I thought he was Lee Gun-jun.

9
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,107
-That's odd.
-Is Gun-jun actually Hyeon-jun?

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,734
It doesn't make any sense.

11
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,777
So here's the deal.

12
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,572
I only realized it myself
during the briefing.

13
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,782
-Mr. Attorney.
-Yes?

14
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,242
-You were texting with a guy
-Yes?

15
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:35,869
-by the name of Park Hyeon-jun.
-That's right.

16
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:39,998
However, Lee Gun-mi had the same
string of texts on her phone.

17
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,875
I knew she wasn't who she claimed to be,

18
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:46,004
but I never imagined
she'd have a third name.

19
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,298
-Who was the Park Hyeon-jun you met?
-What are you on about?

20
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,424
-I--
-What did he look like?

21
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:52,135
You'd know since you were in bed with him.

22
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,804
-But Park Hyeon-jun's a guy.
-Yes, a guy.

23
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,265
-Wasn't that Lee Gun-jun's alias?
-Wasn't he also Lee Gun-jun?

24
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,225
I don't know Lee Gun-jun.

25
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,395
Why'd he keep Hyeon-jun's family photo
if he wasn't Hyeon-jun himself?

26
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,564
-Exactly, which is why it's odd.
-Right.

27
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,483
Hear me out.
Check out Park Hyeon-jun in the photo.

28
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,568
-The nostrils are heart-shaped.
-Heart-shaped nostrils.

29
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,237
The Park Hyeon-jun in this photo
also has heart-shaped nostrils.

30
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,489
Are you the nostril evaluator?

31
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,157
Here's a photo of Lee Gun-jun,

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,534
but you can't tell
the shape of his nostrils.

33
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,828
-Let's go.
-Let's check the victim's body.

34
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,538
-Check the victim's nostrils.
-If they're heart-shaped,

35
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,373
-the victim is Hyeon-jun.
-Gun-mi.

36
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,585
How can Gun-mi
not have heart-shaped nostrils?

37
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,128
-I never had a reason to check.
-All right, let's see.

38
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,508
-They're heart-shaped!
-They're heart-shaped.

39
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,176
-Are you sure?
-They're heart-shaped for sure.

40
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,512
-Gun-mi, Gun-jun, and Park Hyeon-jun.
-They all have heart-shaped nostrils.

41
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,138
They're the same person.

42
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,391
Why did he go by Lee Gun-jun
in high school, then?

43
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,269
-Beats me.
-Even his dad's surname is Park.

44
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,814
-How do you know the officer?
-Yeah, and why did you take this photo?

45
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,732
How do you know Park Lieutenant?

46
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,819
As I mentioned,
we were colleagues a long time ago.

47
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,154
-Why did you steal the photo?
-Why did you take it?

48
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,074
Because to me, she was a fraud.

49
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,660
Then she suddenly showed up at my club,

50
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:03,456
and I found out she had
a photo of my former colleague.

51
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,128
Park Hyeon-jun, Lee Gun-jun,
and Lee Gun-mi were the same person.

52
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,004
So what does that indicate?

53
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:13,049
The one who has ties to Kim Club's past

54
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,426
is the dead Lee Gun-mi.

55
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,055
I'm sure Club is somehow connected
to Lee Gun-jun's father.

56
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:23,560
What about this brick?

57
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,728
There's clearly blood on it.

58
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,190
That can only mean
the culprit used it to strike the victim.

59
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,817
-That's right.
-No.

60
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,569
-The brick isn't the murder weapon.
-They did.

61
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,279
-No? Why not?
-No.

62
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,363
I'll come clean.

63
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,407
-That one's on me.
-What?

64
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,784
That's what I used
to beat the crap out of Gu Ninety.

65
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,369
-I used it.
-Seriously, lady.

66
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,246
-Are you kidding me?
-I knew it.

67
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,290
-Seriously!
-Look, the corner or the side of the brick

68
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,292
-couldn't have made that gash.
-Exactly.

69
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,419
-Yeah, the shape doesn't match.
-Exactly.

70
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,088
I threw that around
while beating up Gu Ninety.

71
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,465
What is it?
Did the chicken lady do something?

72
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,592
-Dancer.
-Yes?

73
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,509
Give me your purse.

74
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,845
-Tell me what she did first.
-I'll take care of that.

75
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,180
-What?
-I want to know what she did.

76
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:03,141
She beat up Gu Ninety with that brick.

77
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,267
SEARCHING AN DANCER'S PURSE

78
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,812
Is this where you store
the footage you filmed?

79
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:08,897
I don't know.

80
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,065
-Detective, here you go.
-What is it?

81
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,525
-What's that?
-Who knows?

82
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,611
-Let's check what's on this.
-Where can we do that?

83
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,489
I'm sure the footage on this

84
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,242
will show how this guy
is connected to all of this.

85
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,494
There's a folder titled "VIP."

86
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,288
I hope my photos aren't there.

87
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,082
"Gae Politician Marijuana."

88
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,043
-"Na Star Ecstasy."
-"Na Star Ecstasy."

89
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,712
-"Wang Chaebol."
-"Wang Chaebol Meth"?

90
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,089
Unbelievable.

91
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:38,092
-He must be Na Star. Unbelievable.
-Oh dear.

92
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,178
-They're having a blast.
-I had no idea.

93
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,931
-Seriously?
-Oh dear.

94
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,974
Look how buff Chaebol is.

95
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,684
This is outrageous.

96
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,103
She's out to ruin my club.

97
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,981
How can this be her fault
when you're the one hosting these parties?

98
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,734
I never gave her permission
to take photos.

99
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,945
You really dodged a bullet here.

100
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,488
I'd never let myself
be compromised this way.

101
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,656
-"An Dancer"?
-"An Dancer"?

102
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,699
INFORMANT - AN DANCER

103
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,285
That's a good shot.

104
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:07,121
Her plastic surgery
was more than just a success.

105
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,831
Can 500 million
really buy you a face like this?

106
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,085
-Informant? There's more?
-Informant? "Informant Profile."

107
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,461
Is An Dancer the informant?

108
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,797
-Who was her handler?
-Who did she work for?

109
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,881
Lee Gun-mi?

110
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,550
Hey, Dancer!

111
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:20,927
-Yes?
-Get over here.

112
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,054
-Me?
-Hey.

113
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,056
I'll punch you once
for every second that passes.

114
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,975
-What is it?
-Who were you passing information to?

115
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,060
-What?
-Who did you work for?

116
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,311
What do you mean?

117
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,313
This isn't your flash drive, is it?

118
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,899
If it were, it wouldn't have files
calling you the informant.

119
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,609
Spill it. Where did you steal it from?

120
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,736
The flash drive…

121
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,614
That's not mine. I found it.

122
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,782
-You found it?
-You found it?

123
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,951
-Where, exactly?
-Please, not your right fist.

124
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,703
-Save it for later.
-Give me some time.

125
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,080
-Give me time to explain.
-Save it for the culprit.

126
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,582
She's going to talk.
Where did you find it?

127
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,209
It was Gun-mi's.

128
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,836
I knew it.

129
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,840
-Did you beat her to death and take it?
-Did you steal it then?

130
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:02,218
I was at Hansim Pocha for the meeting

131
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,637
when Mr. Club told me
to check the water leak detector.

132
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,930
Do you remember that?

133
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,849
-You sent me out twice.
-I sent you out twice.

134
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:11,269
-Why did you send her to check on it?
-What time was that?

135
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,563
Because the water leak detector
was malfunctioning.

136
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,399
-It's the one at our club.
-We're in a flood-prone district,

137
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,525
and my club is below ground.

138
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,193
There's always water damage,

139
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,321
so I installed a water leak detector.

140
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,365
He sent me out twice that night
because the detector went off again.

141
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,536
I left Hansim Pocha around 10:40 p.m.

142
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,413
and made my way to the club.

143
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:34,125
I gave Gun-mi that flash drive
after putting the photos on it,

144
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,002
so I knew what it looked like.

145
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,379
When I saw a flash drive
identical to that on the ground,

146
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,965
I got curious and picked it up.

147
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,467
-Was that this flash drive?
-That was it.

148
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,886
I hear you, so continue talking over here.

149
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,721
-By the body's feet.
-Why?

150
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,890
I just want to do a camera test.

151
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,225
-Right here. Do we have the visual?
-I bet this is something weird.

152
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,393
-It's not.
-Of course not.

153
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,020
We're checking if you still look good

154
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,689
-on the thermal camera.
-Did you hear me? I just found it.

155
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,274
-We hear you.
-We do.

156
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,984
-Gold Spoon.
-She looks good.

157
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,695
I knew I could count on you
to listen to me.

158
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,406
Even with this, you can tell people apart.

159
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,701
If we check the recordings,
we'll find out who was here.

160
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,786
IDENTIFIABLE TO SOME DEGREE

161
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:15,291
Dancer, didn't I tell you
to practice your dancing?

162
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,379
How can a dancer be so bad at dancing?

163
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,463
Unbelievable.

164
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,049
Is there recorded footage or anything?

165
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,300
Just a second.

166
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,177
Wouldn't it be
on the camera's memory card?

167
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,762
THIS CAMERA MIGHT'VE CAUGHT SOMETHING

168
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,305
-Let's check this out.
-Here we go.

169
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,431
Did you find it?

170
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,809
RECORDED FOOTAGE
FROM THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT

171
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,310
-What is it?
-You found it?

172
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,603
-It's playing.
-It was at 9:15 p.m.

173
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,438
-No way.
-Hold on.

174
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,065
-Her hair!
-Oh my gosh.

175
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,149
-No way.
-Hold on.

176
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,484
-Her hair!
-Oh my gosh.

177
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,821
-That's me. Sorry, guys.
-That's you, Ms. Chicken.

178
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,323
-That's clearly you.
-Look.

179
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,159
-It's her.
-I don't hit her though. Keep looking!

180
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,661
Wait, who's the other person?

181
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,995
-Gun-mi, of course.
-It's Gun-mi.

182
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,623
Is this before or after
you beat up Gu Ninety?

183
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,959
After. This was at 9:15 p.m.

184
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,878
-She dragged the victim out by her hair.
-She dragged her out.

185
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,172
I may have pulled her by the hair,
but I didn't kill her.

186
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,299
-And?
-I took her purse.

187
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,759
-Why did you take it?
-Why?

188
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,553
I saw she had a passport,

189
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,764
so I told her not to mess up
if she wanted it back.

190
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,433
But she had her passport with her.

191
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,518
-I gave it back to her.
-When?

192
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,228
-That means you saw her again.
-Well, yeah.

193
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,899
Hey, it's rude to point at your elders.

194
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,234
A SWIFT CHANGE IN DIRECTION

195
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,318
It's just…

196
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,196
Anyway, I beat the crap out of a man
thinking he was Lee Eighty,

197
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,615
so wouldn't I be pissed to find out
he was Gu Ninety?

198
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,993
-That's understandable.
-I had to pay 20 million won to settle.

199
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,953
-Of course, I was fuming.
-Sure.

200
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,204
Didn't Gun-mi deserve to die?

201
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,706
-She did.
-She did.

202
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,876
When I got back,
I saw her outside her house.

203
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,919
-So I dragged her to the empty lot.
-Here?

204
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,255
I threatened to kill her,
and she begged me not to.

205
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,007
At that point, I was sure she was a woman.

206
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,427
-I couldn't beat up a petite girl.
-Of course, you couldn't.

207
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,805
I was so pissed off
that I kicked the big metal sheet.

208
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,184
-Hold on. When was this?
-It says so right here. 9:15 p.m.

209
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,518
Of course!

210
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,813
I actually heard a loud crashing sound.

211
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,608
-I heard the clanking at 9:15 p.m. too!
-Was it the sound of her kicking this?

212
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,610
-Oh, that's what that sound was?
-Sorry about that.

213
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,695
For a moment,
I thought it was an earthquake.

214
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,031
-I assumed it was construction.
-Just how strong is this lady?

215
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,491
Her kicks are as good as her punches.

216
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,368
I threatened to take her passport
if she didn't bring me Lee Eighty.

217
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,870
I told her to bring him,

218
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,206
and she said
to meet her somewhere at 9:30 p.m.

219
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,458
And at 9:35 p.m., I actually met the guy.

220
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,543
I'm pretty sure I spent an hour
beating him to a pulp.

221
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,129
-And?
-Until 10:35 p.m.?

222
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,423
We should be looking
for Lee Eighty's body.

223
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,050
-There will be a second body.
-Maybe he's buried here.

224
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,676
-So, did Lee Eighty die?
-Anyway…

225
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,011
Where's Lee Eighty?

226
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,137
Who knows? Maybe he bolted.

227
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:36,599
Didn't you say
you last saw her at 9:15 p.m.?

228
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,518
I never said it was when I saw her last.

229
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,811
That's suspicious.

230
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,438
When you line up our alibis,

231
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,901
the last person who saw the victim
is Ha Gold Spoon at 9:45 p.m.

232
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,486
That's what he said.

233
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,946
We need to keep digging.

234
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,241
I wonder what they did after meeting up.

235
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,452
Ha Gold Spoon, that little brat.

236
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,539
I was being nice because he's my landlord,
and now he's acting all arrogant.

237
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,294
SEARCHING GOLD SPOON'S COMPUTER

238
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,089
What has he been up to?

239
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:13,344
Look at this.
C-store's father-in-law chewed him out.

240
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:18,057
-He asked what C-store has been up to.
-That was sent at 9:30 p.m.

241
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,684
-Mr. Attorney!
-But…

242
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,227
Yes?

243
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,812
-Where are you?
-I'm over here.

244
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,481
Could you come here?

245
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,025
I found something suspicious
on your computer.

246
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,736
Why do you have a shortcut to Darkscene?

247
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,821
Darkscene?

248
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:35,116
-Darkscene. The name itself is shady.
-That sounds familiar.

249
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,492
ENTER EMAIL AND PASSWORD

250
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,620
-Even Gun-mi had an account.
-"Gunmi"?

251
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,999
-"Goldspoon" and "Gunmi."
-"Goldspoon," huh?

252
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,917
-Give us the password.
-What now?

253
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,629
Which password will you give us first?
Gun-mi's or Gold Spoon's?

254
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,006
What's Gun-mi's password?

255
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,133
-Why does her name pop up?
-She logged on from here.

256
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,135
Why does it show she logged on from here?

257
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,386
"Gunmi"?

258
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:59,181
I don't know about Gun-mi's,
but Goldspoon is my account.

259
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,059
-What's the password? Or just type it in.
-Give us the password.

260
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,477
Figure it out yourselves.

261
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,230
-As if that's possible.
-The clue's "heart."

262
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,523
-Heart?
-Heart.

263
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,192
-How do you type that in?
-Heart.

264
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,738
-H, E, A, R, T.
-Mr. Kim, how can you not know that?

265
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,324
Sorry.

266
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,993
I thought he meant
the heart symbol, Dancer.

267
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,911
What about "heart nose"?

268
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,913
-Heart nostrils?
-Heart nostrils.

269
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:23,998
It can't be.

270
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,709
-Maybe it's a numeric code. "Heart."
-Did he not write it down somewhere?

271
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,586
It's normal to write down
a complicated password.

272
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,921
I know what he meant by "heart."

273
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,256
-What is it?
-Here.

274
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,509
Type S and the number two side by side,
and you get a heart.

275
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,094
Try "S2S2."

276
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,722
-"S2S2."
-The number two?

277
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,350
-Yeah, the number two.
-"S2S2." That has to be it.

278
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,644
LOGIN SUCCESSFUL

279
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,898
Nice one, Dancer!

280
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,233
-I'm giving you a 50,000-won raise.
-Thank you.

281
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:52,652
What do we have here?

282
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,197
-"Jang Candidate's Illegal Funding."
-Call him Ha Psycho.

283
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,240
"Hammer Construction Bid Rigging."

284
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,534
-"Park Hyeon-jun Retribution Video."
-"Park Hyeon-jun Retribution Video."

285
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:01,952
What the heck?

286
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,621
What the heck?

287
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:05,831
PARK HYEON-JUN RETRIBUTION VIDEO

288
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,416
What the heck?

289
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,670
Oh dear.

290
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,589
-He has a bob.
-Chestnut Makgeolli sounds familiar.

291
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,674
Right?

292
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,761
Did you see that?
I taught Park Hyeon-jun a lesson.

293
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,347
What do you think? Aren't you satisfied?

294
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,058
Gold Spoon,

295
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,185
this is Park Hyeon-jun's phone.

296
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,398
I'll make sure to delete
the photo and the texts.

297
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,568
Wait, I remember seeing
that sky-blue blouse somewhere.

298
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,696
The blouse that was cut down the middle.

299
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,364
Isn't it the blouse that was cut in half?

300
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,492
Hold on. Why is this blouse cut up?

301
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,910
FOUND AT LEE GUN-JUN'S HOUSE

302
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,162
IS IT THE SAME BLOUSE FROM THE VIDEO?

303
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,665
I deleted the photo.

304
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,834
Now, I'll delete the texts.

305
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,336
All gone.

306
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,463
Mission complete.

307
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,840
-Hang on.
-Who's the guy in the video?

308
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,718
-Isn't that the victim doing all that?
-That's it.

309
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,011
-It was a one-man show.
-Exactly.

310
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,472
-He put on a show.
-He wore half of that blouse.

311
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,391
-Park Hyeon-jun is the one talking.
-He wore the blouse

312
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,018
and filmed a video of himself
looking all battered.

313
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,563
-This is how he did it.
-Exactly.

314
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,356
This is Park Hyeon-jun.

315
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,359
The camera's in selfie mode,
and he's faking the pain.

316
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,154
-And then…
-Did you see that?

317
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,197
-He switched hands.
-I taught Park Hyeon-jun a lesson.

318
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,949
He's saying that line as Gun-mi.

319
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,576
Yeah, only one hand
is visible at all times.

320
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,619
Mission complete.

321
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,538
-Is there a reflection?
-We're right.

322
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:28,914
It was a one-man show.

323
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,709
She played you good, Gold Spoon.

324
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:34,044
-You must've been furious.
-Let me explain.

325
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,130
-Go ahead.
-She got you good.

326
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,215
I met Lee Gun-mi at Sensibility Bar.

327
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,925
She agreed to go out,

328
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,803
but suddenly claimed she was busy
and said she couldn't meet up.

329
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,555
Honestly, it pissed me off.

330
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,307
I was wondering what to do

331
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,516
when I saw someone

332
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,186
who was totally my type
outside the convenience store.

333
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,563
-I ran into Park Hyeon-jun.
-The guy with heart-shaped nostrils.

334
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,565
Heart-nose. You met a heart-nose.

335
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,568
I wasn't getting anywhere with Lee Gun-mi,

336
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:01,071
so Hyeon-jun and I went out
for a glass of whiskey.

337
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,450
But I totally blacked out.
I'm guessing it was the same drug.

338
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,368
Like that time
when I couldn't remember anything, huh?

339
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,578
After I woke up,

340
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,663
he asked about our night
and said he had a good time.

341
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,040
He said he enjoyed it,

342
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,209
so I took it as a positive sign
and we parted ways.

343
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,544
But then, I got a text.
You saw it earlier.

344
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,505
-It was the photo of us in bed together.
-Yes.

345
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,632
I always have them sign a contract
before taking it further.

346
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,051
Was this signed the day you two hooked up?

347
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,135
He signed it,

348
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,722
but then took it from me.

349
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,891
I said I'd pay 50 million won
if he deleted the photo.

350
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,434
After he got the money,

351
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,771
he deleted the photo,
and everything was fine again.

352
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,440
-But then Gun-mi suddenly reached out.
-Okay.

353
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,067
I wanted to be with her

354
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,152
since she'll forever be
the woman of my dreams.

355
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,780
-He just won't stop.
-We agreed to go out,

356
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,282
but she came to my office instead.
That's probably when you saw her.

357
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,326
-That's probably it.
-That's when Dancer saw her.

358
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,954
Out of the blue, she went, "So?"

359
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,081
"Are you gay?"

360
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,166
She then showed me a text she received.

361
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,626
-And?
-It was that photo.

362
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,921
I thought Park Hyeon-jun had deleted it,
but he somehow sent a copy to Gun-mi.

363
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,758
-Gun-mi put on one heck of a show.
-You got swindled by both sides.

364
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,593
Once by Park Hyeon-jun
and once by Lee Gun-mi.

365
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,720
-I didn't know.
-Oh boy.

366
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,973
Anyway, she said she knew a place
that handled this kind of business.

367
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,267
So I asked her to handle it,

368
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,394
and she sent me that video on August 11th.

369
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,603
How much did you pay?

370
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,064
-Did you get ripped off again?
-How much was this video worth?

371
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,650
-I'm guessing a 9-figure sum.
-How much was it?

372
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,734
-200 million?
-200 million?

373
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,862
200 million won?

374
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,489
Park Hyeon-jun
scammed you out of 50 million won,

375
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,949
and then Lee Gun-mi
scammed you out of 200 million won.

376
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,243
You were scammed out of 250 million
by the same person.

377
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,244
Oh dear.

378
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,454
-You must've wanted to kill her.
-Exactly.

379
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,998
I paid him five million won first,

380
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,292
so he ended up taking
255 million won from me.

381
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,629
Mr. Gold Spoon may be an attorney

382
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,172
who acts all smart,

383
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,966
but he was scammed twice.

384
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,303
His political career hit a roadblock,
his father disapproved of him,

385
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,638
and he lost more than 200 million won.
But that wasn't the end.

386
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,224
There was a good chance
he'd get blackmailed again.

387
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,686
If he had realized the video
was a one-man show,

388
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,022
I don't think Ha Gold Spoon
would've just let it go.

389
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,816
Here's what I want to know.

390
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,027
What's with this photo?

391
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,986
Is that C-store's phone?

392
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,946
-Yeah, C-store's.
-C-store?

393
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,032
"You have one scary son-in-law."

394
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,116
What were you doing?

395
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,911
You were wearing a similar mask
when you were first brought in.

396
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,997
Anyway, this came
to his father-in-law's attention.

397
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,708
And he said, "What is this?
What have you been doing?"

398
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:21,003
I bet you were practicing
to copy those random assaults.

399
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,464
-What was this?
-Maybe he committed those assaults!

400
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,674
It wasn't me!

401
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,676
-With that face,
-How do we trust you?

402
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,512
-he could pass for any age group.
-You bet.

403
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,098
This must be the gift Lee Gun-mi sent.

404
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,100
-Oh, you're right.
-"Hope you're ready."

405
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,810
-"Hope you're ready."
-Gun-mi must've spied on him

406
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,188
and sent the photos to his father-in-law.

407
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,650
-Knowing he was planning another assault…
-Hence, "You have one scary son-in-law."

408
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,527
C-store, are you the one
behind the random assaults?

409
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,529
You just came up with a story yourselves.

410
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,906
Speak while I'm still being nice.

411
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,910
My father-in-law sent me those messages
and then flew into a rage.

412
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,079
He chewed me out on the phone
for 15 minutes.

413
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,831
So I ignored his calls after that.

414
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:01,251
Tell us why you were wearing that mask.

415
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,087
And what's that in your hand?

416
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,463
Is that a claw hammer?

417
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,091
-What?
-It brings me peace, that's all.

418
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,592
-What do you mean? Wearing a mask?
-Wearing a mask?

419
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,593
Yeah.

420
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,679
When I wear a mask and hold a hammer…

421
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,806
-Yeah?
-That makes me feel at ease.

422
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,224
Looking at a particular body part…

423
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,893
-also puts me at ease.
-Exactly.

424
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,895
-What's with him?
-I found your fetish odd,

425
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,231
but I felt a connection earlier.

426
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,483
-Hey, give me your bag.
-Wait.

427
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,819
SEARCHING HIS BAG

428
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,654
This is gross.

429
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,322
Just so you know,
you can wear this both ways.

430
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:34,618
He was wearing a black mask
when he first arrived at the scene,

431
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,537
but he was wearing a red one in the photo.

432
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,164
You can wear it both ways, inside and out.

433
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,833
I switch it up depending on my mood.

434
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,334
-Is that it?
-Yeah.

435
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,461
-I go around wearing that.
-Do you roam the streets?

436
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:48,882
-Is that part of your routine?
-Did you use your weapon or not?

437
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,592
Have you assaulted anyone?

438
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,094
I swear,

439
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,387
never in this neighborhood.

440
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,806
Not in this neighborhood?

441
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:56,932
Oh jeez.

442
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:01,186
But that has absolutely nothing to do
with the case at hand.

443
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,647
That's for us to figure out.

444
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,025
Wouldn't there be information
on Gun-mi's account, Detective?

445
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,402
-Why did she log on from here?
-What's her password?

446
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,612
We should check Gun-mi's place as well.

447
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,115
I want to check Gun-jun's belongings.

448
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,452
-Okay, then let's all go there.
-I want to look into Mr. Club.

449
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,995
Mr. Kim Club.

450
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,456
-Yes?
-Where's your phone?

451
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,749
It's right here.

452
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,755
All right.

453
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:28,922
KIM CLUB'S PHONE

454
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,469
TEXTS ON KIM CLUB'S PHONE

455
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,345
The water leak detector.

456
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,430
WATER LEAK DETECTION SYSTEM

457
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,098
Hold on.

458
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,060
Mr. Club, who's Lieutenant Gu Lackey?

459
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,312
Lieutenant Gu Lackey?
A police officer, of course.

460
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,480
Gu Lackey texted,

461
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,691
"Sir, I looked into what you asked
but found nothing."

462
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,401
TEXT RECEIVED AT 9:55 P.M.
CALL MADE AT 10:05 P.M.

463
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,361
"Call me as soon as you get something."

464
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,990
What did you two talk about at 10:50 p.m.?

465
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,326
I asked him for a favor.

466
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,036
-A favor?
-Yeah.

467
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,788
I wonder what that was about.

468
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,918
MEANWHILE, AN DANCER IS SEARCHING
GANGSTER WHOLE CHICKEN

469
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,507
What the heck?

470
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,594
No way. It's a recording device.

471
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,596
Look here, chicken lady.

472
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,640
-What's this? Explain this.
-What?

473
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:20,849
What do you mean?

474
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,272
Hold on.

475
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,108
Tell me the story again
and be more specific.

476
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,486
This was all that skank Gun-mi's doing.

477
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,238
"This was all that skank Gun-mi's doing."

478
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,656
That must be Lee Eighty.

479
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,866
Lee Gun-mi first came up with the idea

480
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,952
to mess with your arm.

481
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,412
-Lee Gun-mi was behind it?
-Lee Gun-mi planned

482
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,248
and executed the whole thing.

483
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:48,168
Lee Gun-mi first came up with the idea
to mess with your arm.

484
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:52,089
Lee Gun-mi planned
and executed the whole thing.

485
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,007
Where's Lee Gun-mi now?

486
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,677
You're too late.

487
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,555
She probably already took off
with the money from the deal

488
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,849
after selling me out to you.

489
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,685
She probably took off
while you were beating the crap out of me

490
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,270
like a fool.

491
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,772
Based on what we just heard,

492
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,941
you realized Lee Gun-mi had played you.

493
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,025
That's right.

494
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,862
You beat up Gu Ninety

495
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,822
and Lee Eighty.

496
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,866
What did you do to Lee Gun-mi?

497
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,784
I went to get her.

498
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:21,910
Where?

499
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,120
To the airport.

500
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:26,206
I got in a taxi at 10:20 p.m.

501
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,877
But the roads were blocked,
so the taxi couldn't budge.

502
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,545
Even if I had made it to the airport,

503
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,631
it would've been too late to catch her
before her 11:59 p.m. flight.

504
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,259
So I gave up and came back.

505
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,303
That was around 11:10 p.m.

506
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,554
Is that it?

507
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,599
I had no contact with Gun-mi after that.

508
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:47,603
She had been beating up Lee Eighty
for about an hour.

509
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,314
That's how furious she was.

510
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:53,233
So, would she have given up
because of a traffic jam?

511
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,069
She had been hell-bent
on finding Lee Eighty,

512
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,739
who had ruined
her boxing career and dream.

513
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,033
But then she found out
Lee Eighty wasn't responsible.

514
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:04,036
Every path in this story

515
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,662
leads back to Lee Gun-mi.

516
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,833
ADDITIONAL SEARCH
OF FRAUD LEE GUN-MI'S HOUSE

517
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,295
CURRENTLY OFFLINE

518
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,006
Why doesn't the Wi-Fi work in his place?

519
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:19,384
The electricity's been cut off,
so there's no Wi-Fi there.

520
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,929
HE HEADS OUT TO FIND WI-FI

521
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,598
-What are you looking for?
-The Wi-Fi password.

522
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,016
The Wi-Fi?

523
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,976
-I remember seeing it.
-It's here.

524
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,103
-What's the password?
-The ID is "hansim,"

525
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,480
and the password is "1heart4car."

526
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,607
-What does this mean?
-Did you say "1heart4car"?

527
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,151
The password is "1heart4car."

528
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,819
Okay, "1heart4car."

529
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:38,987
CHECKING NETWORK REQUIREMENTS

530
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,281
I'm in. Nice, I got it.

531
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,534
The password translates to Hansim Pocha.

532
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,039
-Here's Gun-mi's account.
-Oh, look.

533
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,375
The password's been saved,
so you can log in.

534
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,336
Is that also Darkscene?

535
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,587
LEE GUN-MI'S ACCOUNT ON DARKSCENE

536
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,631
"I'll forward the photos
of the VIP drug parties."

537
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:00,050
"If things go south,
we can pin it all on her."

538
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,886
-She must be talking about Dancer!
-Oh dear. You saw this, didn't you?

539
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,554
-I haven't.
-I bet you saw it.

540
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,764
-I didn't.
-Don't lie.

541
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:09,434
-The house didn't have Wi-Fi.
-That's why it was inaccessible.

542
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:13,522
Gun-mi wrote the message
but died before she could send it.

543
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,856
The message was never sent.

544
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,150
-Even then, she could've seen it.
-But Dancer could've seen it.

545
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,360
If she did…

546
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,821
-I swear I never saw it.
-Sure, of course.

547
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,698
-High five.
-Are you sure?

548
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,324
-She saw it.
-She did.

549
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,326
-If you did, then you're the killer.
-Wait.

550
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,329
Did you check the contents
of the flash drive you found earlier?

551
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,247
Of course.

552
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,333
-You were on it as an informant.
-Yet, you didn't confront her?

553
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,876
Of course, I confronted her.

554
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,003
-What did you do?
-So?

555
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,381
-First of all…
-Hurry up and talk.

556
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,800
-It'll be a punch for every ten seconds.
-Okay, I'll talk.

557
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:45,470
After submitting the registration form
for the meeting at 9:15 p.m.,

558
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:50,142
I glanced out the office window
when I heard a loud crash.

559
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,476
Ms. Chicken and Gun-mi were fighting,

560
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,687
and I was wondering
whether I should step in or not.

561
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,398
-If you had, you'd be dead by now.
-Ms. Chicken left around 9:20 p.m.

562
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,899
So I called Gun-mi

563
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,901
and asked if she was all right.

564
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,321
She said she couldn't get the money
because of her

565
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,655
and asked to meet half an hour later.

566
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,699
So we agreed to meet at 9:50 p.m.

567
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,909
I attended the meeting
but stepped out briefly at 9:50 p.m.

568
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,287
-We ran into each other, remember?
-I do.

569
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,580
I saw her stepping out.

570
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,081
I was about to say hi,

571
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,167
-but she walked off without noticing me.
-That reminds me.

572
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,086
The water leak detector alarm went off,
so I was going to have her go check it.

573
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,921
But she had disappeared.

574
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,175
We had agreed
to meet outside Slam at 9:50 p.m.

575
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:27,220
I called her on my way there at 9:51 p.m.,
but her phone was turned off.

576
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,723
Something felt wrong,
so I headed to her place.

577
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:32,851
I went to her place,
but I swear I didn't see Darkscene.

578
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,686
All I saw was her plane ticket to Russia.

579
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,688
-The e-ticket?
-Yes.

580
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,566
It was odd because we had agreed
to flee to China together.

581
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,737
But she had already packed her suitcase
and booked a flight to Russia.

582
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,698
Anyway, you knew Lee Gun-mi
was planning to flee the country.

583
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,033
I found out at that moment.

584
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,202
I found out
that she was going to go to Russia,

585
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:53,413
but at that point, I still had no idea
what was on the flash drive.

586
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,833
I came across the flash drive
the second time Mr. Club sent me out,

587
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,919
and I checked it in the break room
at the club.

588
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,922
Once I learned her plan to flee to Russia

589
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:05,967
after handing my information over,
I called her at 10:55 p.m.

590
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,096
Even after five years
of paying off her debt,

591
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,848
An Dancer still had to work
another 50 years to clear it.

592
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:15,060
She thought she could pay off her debt
and debut in China,

593
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,728
so she must've been full of hope.

594
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,982
If she had read the text about pinning
the blame on her if things went south,

595
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:24,569
she would've realized Gun-mi was a fraud
and that she had been backstabbed.

596
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,989
She had been there for Gun-mi
and considered her a close friend,

597
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,158
but she was being used
for her to make money.

598
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,493
She would've been furious.

599
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,204
The thing that bothers me

600
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,915
is that Gun-jun's place had no Wi-Fi.

601
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,542
Given the urgency of the message,

602
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,836
he would've gone somewhere that had Wi-Fi.

603
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,799
According to the login records
we saw at Gold Spoon's office,

604
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,593
Gun-mi logged into her account
while she was there.

605
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,346
But I wonder why
the message didn't go through.

606
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,931
Did something happen

607
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,434
just as she was about to send it?

608
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,520
Here's what I think is important.

609
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:02,732
Whatever Gun-mi or Gun-jun did,

610
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,694
several people had to find one of the two.

611
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,237
There are two theories.

612
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,406
Some people can't have the victim,
Gun-jun, skip town.

613
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:12,742
They either have to make him pay
or get something from him.

614
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:16,496
The other theory
is related to Gun-jun's own plan.

615
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,622
He talked about revenge,

616
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,207
and we have to figure out
what that's about.

617
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,959
This man clearly
hasn't told us everything.

618
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,461
I'm sure there's more to it.

619
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,754
He needs to tell us
how he knows Park Hyeon-jun's father.

620
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,341
Let's listen to
what was on the recording device again.

621
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,510
How do you get this to play?

622
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,053
Come on, mister.

623
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,472
You try it, C-store.

624
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,974
-Devices these days are so complicated.
-I doubt he'll be any better.

625
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,767
-C-store can't seem to do it.
-Mister.

626
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,019
For any device to work…

627
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,270
(PRESSING THE BUTTON)

628
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,730
…you need to turn it on first.

629
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,524
-Wait, you hit the record button.
-How clever of you.

630
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,278
-The red one isn't the power button.
-Hey!

631
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,655
-It's the record button!
-Did you delete what was on it?

632
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,865
Hold on.

633
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,825
-Give me that.
-Come on, C-store.

634
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,203
I have somewhere to be,
so I'll be off now.

635
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,705
Wait, that was clearly intentional.

636
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:01,124
(PLAYING WHAT WAS JUST RECORDED)

637
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:04,419
-You recorded us instead!
-That's a recording of us!

638
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,921
FIRST-EVER EVIDENCE DESTRUCTION
ON CRIME SCENE

639
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,631
-Seriously, C-store.
-Hey, C-store.

640
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,842
Sorry about that.
I'll just say I'm the killer today.

641
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,385
Assume push-up position.

642
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:16,681
Let's spread out and keep looking!

643
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,934
We'll gather
after collecting more evidence!

644
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,856
SENSIBILITY BAR

645
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,484
There's a CCTV up here.

646
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,528
CCTV FILMING OUTSIDE SENSIBILITY BAR

647
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,951
JANG C-STORE SEARCHES THE POLICE STATION

648
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,663
This computer was being repaired earlier.

649
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,374
-They must've fixed it.
-It must be fixed now.

650
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,875
Everything's breaking down here

651
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,336
-because of the heavy rain.
-Tell me about it.

652
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,713
"Database."

653
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,465
"Find missing."

654
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,509
-"Search for missing child"?
-What?

655
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:56,221
-Jeez, where is this case going?
-My heart just sank.

656
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,014
Year of birth.

657
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,100
She was born in 1993, like me.

658
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,560
(SOMEONE ALREADY DID A SEARCH?)

659
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:03,853
"Maniac Province."

660
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:04,938
SEARCH

661
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,398
AN TWO YEARS, MALE, 1993
OH KIDS, MALE, 1993

662
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,525
-Who's that?
-We have it!

663
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,402
-"An Two Years."
-Here he is.

664
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:11,528
-Hang on.
-That's him.

665
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:14,197
-He has heart-shaped nostrils.
-Heart-shaped nostrils!

666
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,574
IS THIS LEE GUN-JUN, AKA PARK HYEON-JUN?

667
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,909
-Wait, these are missing children.
-Why was he missing?

668
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,911
When did he go missing?

669
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,872
-He was reported missing in 2002.
-He went missing in 2002.

670
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,874
Maybe this is a case of identity theft.

671
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,003
RESEARCHING LEE GUN-JUN'S HOUSE

672
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,632
Hold on.

673
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,759
-Why's this case so complicated?
-No way!

674
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,136
No way!

675
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,262
What now?

676
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,264
What is it?

677
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:40,765
What now?

678
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:44,102
I found out
why he went by a different name.

679
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,063
This is a surname and given name
registration application

680
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,565
filed by Care Orphanage.

681
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,609
The application concerns Lee Gun-jun,
an abandoned male child,

682
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,153
born January 1, 1993.

683
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,488
It says here, "I hereby authorize
the name of this abandoned child

684
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,324
as Lee Gun-jun."

685
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,659
"He wasn't able to verify his own name

686
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,746
or any information about his parents
when he was found."

687
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,206
This was in 2002.

688
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,917
In 2002, he legally became Lee Gun-jun.

689
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:12,505
After that, he started carrying two IDs,
one as Gun-jun and the other as Gun-mi,

690
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,715
once he reached adulthood.

691
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,258
What is all this about?

692
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,803
Mister, what did you do
to Park Hyeon-jun's father?

693
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,765
What happened in 2002?

694
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,266
Hey, mister.

695
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,143
I've got no issue
roughing up 57-year-olds.

696
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,604
There was an unfortunate incident.

697
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,689
-What, exactly?
-I can't believe him.

698
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,901
If I were 30 years older,
I would've beaten him up.

699
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,152
Let's find out for ourselves.

700
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,695
-Let's figure it out.
-Get searching.

701
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,530
-Hey, let's go.
-Figure it out and then come back to me.

702
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,032
-Go to the club.
-Let's head to the club.

703
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,117
-You won't be able to find anything.
-Head to the club.

704
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,119
Wait, C-store.

705
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,497
Didn't you say you wanted to
listen to some music?

706
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,498
Yeah.

707
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:47,540
Let me play it for you.

708
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,376
HIS FRIEND IS THE ONLY ONE
WHO CARES ABOUT HIM…

709
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,045
ARE YOU READY?

710
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,049
What did you press?

711
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,718
FASCINATED

712
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,687
THANKS TO HIS FRIEND, HE ENJOYS
HIS FIRST CLUBBING EXPERIENCE

713
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,271
This is what we do around here.

714
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,023
I love it.

715
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,275
PARTY TIME

716
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:15,902
EXHILARATING

717
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,320
Hey, hold on.

718
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,323
Is that the best you can dance?

719
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,991
Does the hand need to go up to the ear?

720
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,159
Yeah, like this.

721
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,789
C-store, are you enjoying
your first time at a club?

722
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,666
-I'm having a blast.
-C-store seemed curious.

723
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,042
WHILE JANG C-STORE ENJOYS HIMSELF

724
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,919
What could be there?

725
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,796
"You have one scary son-in-law"?

726
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:35,839
SEARCHING THE EMPTY CONVENIENCE STORE

727
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,507
These are the dolls.

728
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,184
UNDER THE REGISTER

729
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,437
A DOCUMENT ENVELOPE?

730
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,071
Detective.

731
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,406
REPORTING IT TO THE DETECTIVE

732
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,532
Check this out.

733
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,997
That little bastard.

734
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,416
That little bastard!

735
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,295
What's this?

736
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:18,298
-That's the water leak detector.
-The detector.

737
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:20,550
Because we're below ground,

738
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,927
it frequently malfunctions
and goes off spontaneously.

739
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,513
It malfunctioned twice today.

740
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,515
-You had it fixed, right?
-That little bastard!

741
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,894
-What did he say?
-Hey, you bastard!

742
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:31,978
Is he talking to C-store?

743
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,396
What now?

744
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,523
You punk, I ought to teach you a lesson.

745
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,567
-What is it?
-What now?

746
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,569
You piece of trash.

747
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:40,779
RANDOM ATTACK OCCURS AT NIGHT…

748
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,989
-You attacked someone with a hammer.
-"Swung a hammer." Why, you little…

749
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,994
"The assailant indiscriminately swung
a hammer at a passerby in an alley."

750
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:48,912
You bastard.

751
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,997
He said earlier he didn't attack anyone
in this neighborhood.

752
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,833
-Exactly, it was in the Seoul area.
-He did it in Gangjong District.

753
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,627
RANDOM ATTACK OCCURS AT NIGHT…

754
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,004
"How much do you think I know?"

755
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:01,549
As long as Lee Gun-jun got away alive,

756
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,676
he could report the crime anytime.

757
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,221
To avoid going to prison,
C-store had to kill him.

758
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,140
I didn't want to worry the people
in this neighborhood.

759
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,308
This is nuts.

760
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:13,937
That's why I went as far away as I could
to commit these crimes.

761
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,396
-I mean it.
-Are you serious?

762
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,148
I didn't attack anyone around here.

763
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,777
-Listen to the details of this article.
-Okay.

764
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,153
"The crime occurred on a rainy day,

765
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:26,866
targeting a woman
under 160 cm in height with long hair."

766
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,285
-Lee Gun-mi was short.
-That's true.

767
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:32,705
What if C-store didn't know
that Gun-jun was Gun-mi at the time?

768
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,999
I mean, Gun-mi clearly
looked like a woman.

769
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,543
Also, it rained last night, right?

770
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,628
-It did.
-Yes, it rained.

771
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:43,675
On a rainy day, the petite Lee Gun-mi
was dressed like a woman.

772
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:47,053
She was hit on the head with a hammer.
We all saw the wound.

773
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:50,348
Why should we assume he only attacked
people in other neighborhoods?

774
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,894
I had been suspicious of the wooden dolls

775
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,814
because they all had umbrellas
and long hair.

776
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,484
Something about them gave me the chills.

777
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,278
I think there's a good chance

778
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:07,866
C-store just thought she matched
the profile of the women he targets

779
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:12,954
for his random attacks and attacked her.

780
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:16,416
The woman he attacked
could've just turned out to be

781
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,792
none other than Lee Gun-jun.

782
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,754
There has to be more on Kim Club.

783
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,799
What could he have done to Park Hyeon-jun?

784
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,135
Where was that photo of Park Hyeon-jun?

785
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,720
-At Gun-mi's place.
-Let's go there.

786
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,931
WOULD THERE BE A CLUE
AT LEE GUN-JUN'S HOUSE?

787
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,601
He even packed his razor.

788
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:37,020
Gosh, I need a quick bite.
Can we stop by the convenience store?

789
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,146
Me too.

790
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,522
Hold on.

791
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:40,773
Who's this?

792
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,402
I've often been told that I look like her.

793
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,905
Come on, she's pretty.
You two look nothing alike.

794
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,364
I look just like her.

795
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,034
-Mr. Club, don't I look just like her?
-Who's she?

796
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,327
People say I look like her.

797
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,371
-She's stunning.
-No way. Unlike you, she's beautiful.

798
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,750
A fake can never look like the original.

799
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,836
-Your hair's not styled like hers.
-Give it up already.

800
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,921
(DANG IT)

801
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,927
I found something else.

802
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,637
Of course.

803
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,555
I knew it.

804
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,767
A PIECE OF PAPER WAS INSIDE AN ENVELOPE

805
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,936
ALONG WITH A POLICE ID?

806
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,103
What the heck?

807
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:21,940
What?

808
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,858
-Kim Club!
-Kim Club?

809
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,735
-Get over here.
-Come on, mister. I mean, Mr. Kim.

810
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,198
"Center News."

811
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,618
"A Policeman's Family of Four
Killed in Fire."

812
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,745
DRUG RING'S INVOLVEMENT SUSPECTED

813
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:39,332
"The victims are Park Lieutenant
of Seoul's Gangdam Police Station,

814
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:42,293
who received recognition last year
as an exemplary officer,

815
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,795
along with his wife, Ms. Kim,

816
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,338
and their 9-year-old son."

817
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:48,007
-Their son? Is that Park Hyeon-jun?
-Yeah, it is.

818
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,258
Look at him casually eating.

819
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,094
-He scares me.
-He scares me too.

820
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:54,222
This part has been crossed out
with a red pen.

821
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,975
"The police received a tip

822
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,811
that Park had been colluding
with a drug ring."

823
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,855
AT THE TIME, KIM CLUB WAS THE DIRTY COP
WORKING WITH THE DRUG RING

824
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,233
Kim Club framed Park Lieutenant.

825
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,693
DID HE MAKE PARK LIEUTENANT HIS FALL GUY…

826
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:07,777
How reprehensible.

827
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,112
…AND KILL HIS ENTIRE FAMILY?

828
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,030
You killed his entire family?

829
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:14,075
Gun-jun even had this.

830
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,119
-What's that?
-What else could it be?

831
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,537
It's your old police ID.

832
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,913
My eyesight is going in my old age.

833
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:22,125
So the victim's revenge
was definitely aimed at Kim Club.

834
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:25,253
That's why there was gasoline.

835
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:28,089
-Right here. This gasoline.
-To avenge the fire with fire.

836
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:33,302
But seeing that he went as far
as getting gasoline for his revenge,

837
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,304
he wouldn't have fled to Moscow
before seeing it through.

838
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,140
-Fair point.
-He'd never do that.

839
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,683
-That's why he stayed behind.
-Who knows?

840
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,184
Something urgent must've come up.

841
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,646
Or perhaps you killed him first.

842
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,231
He died before he could use the gasoline.

843
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:46,649
You said you came by the house.

844
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,735
Didn't you notice the gasoline
when you took the photo?

845
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,070
How could I have noticed that?

846
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:54,115
The photo completely threw me off.

847
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:57,660
I had only thought of her
as a weird little fraud,

848
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,537
so I couldn't understand
how she had that photo.

849
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,999
I just grabbed it in a hurry,
which is why it got ripped in the corner.

850
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,669
I couldn't shake off the suspicion
after seeing it,

851
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,172
so I took it to Gu Lackey,

852
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,132
who was at the police station,
to show him.

853
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,593
I asked him to look the girl up
in the missing children database

854
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,553
because I thought she might be alive.

855
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,974
He said he couldn't find anything,
but it kept bothering me.

856
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,810
So, I called Gu Lackey again.

857
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,854
AUGUST 12, 2020, WEDNESDAY
LIEUTENANT GU LACKEY, 10:05 P.M.

858
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:28,191
That's when I realized
her age didn't add up.

859
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,610
I'd assumed it was the little girl,
but maybe it was the boy.

860
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:33,571
So I asked him to check
on the missing boys instead.

861
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:37,075
And Gu Lackey got back to me
and told me that he got a hit.

862
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,534
-A boy?
-Yes, a boy.

863
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,161
So that's when you figured it out.

864
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,705
To achieve his goal,

865
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,750
he wiped out an entire family.

866
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,169
After seeing the family photo
at the victim's house,

867
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:51,839
he looked into the matter, just in case,
only to learn that a child survived,

868
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,467
and that it was none other than Gun-mi.

869
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,761
You can imagine
how anxious he must've felt.

870
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:59,889
Let's say he went to Gun-mi's house
while trembling in fear.

871
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,558
What if he spotted the gasoline?

872
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:03,810
Then that would've answered it.

873
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,854
His gut instinct would've told him
that the victim was seeking revenge.

874
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,606
Given that,

875
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:11,484
he could've thought of
killing the victim first.

876
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,445
Detective, we have
all the circumstantial evidence.

877
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,864
Everyone here
had a reason to kill the victim.

878
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,826
Dancer would've killed her
if she had seen the message.

879
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:23,162
Club would've wanted to stop her
since he was the target for revenge.

880
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:27,250
I also had a reason to kill her
since she ruined my life.

881
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:30,294
And as for him,
he was scammed out of 200 million won.

882
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:33,422
-That's chump change to me.
-He had more to lose than just his money.

883
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:37,218
I was simply worried
that she could jeopardize my future.

884
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,345
And as for this kid here,

885
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,722
he could've been the killer,
even if it was voluntary manslaughter.

886
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:42,640
-Exactly.
-Yeah.

887
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,308
-True.
-The perfect target for his random attacks

888
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,477
just happened to show up on a rainy day.

889
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,855
There's no doubt

890
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:53,526
a deep-seated grudge
fueled this vicious attack.

891
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:56,362
There was a struggle,

892
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:59,907
and marks on her body
suggest a violent altercation,

893
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,534
but the soles of her shoes were too clean.

894
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,412
Also, we still haven't found
the murder weapon.

895
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,332
In that case, there's a possibility

896
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,294
that the murder didn't take place
at the empty lot.

897
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,922
-All right.
-If she had been attacked elsewhere,

898
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,425
wouldn't there be bloodstains or a weapon
in another location?

899
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,178
Look, check this out.

900
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,470
Look at the scars on her back.

901
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,183
There are four streaks

902
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,518
running vertically.

903
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:31,063
These scratches couldn't have been made
by a human hand.

904
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,317
She was slammed
against an object with this pattern.

905
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,693
-She was pushed against something.
-In that case,

906
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,820
should we find the place
that might have something of that pattern?

907
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:38,905
-That's what we need to find.
-Yeah.

908
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:41,532
Let's scatter and look for
what could've made that mark.

909
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,242
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
THAT MATCHES THE PATTERN

910
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,077
HANSIM POCHA

911
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,579
GANGDAM DISTRICT
LEASE DISPUTE CONSULTATION CENTER

912
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,289
KARAOKE

913
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,999
GANGDAM STATION YOUTH STREET MEETING
WITH BUSINESS OWNERS AFFECTED BY COVID-19

914
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,462
Jeez, this is a tough one.

915
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,172
-Hey, Dancer.
-Yes?

916
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,465
Does anything seem suspicious to you?

917
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,591
You, actually.

918
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,313
Over here! Could this have done it?

919
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,484
This AC condenser unit right here.

920
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,736
-The pattern's similar.
-Don't you think they match?

921
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,404
-This has a similar pattern.
-Right here.

922
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,073
-You're right.
-It looks similar.

923
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:24,909
-This has to be it.
-It's similar. Good work.

924
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:25,993
-Hold on.
-It's similar.

925
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,745
-Check this out.
-Well found.

926
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:29,830
-Let's say he was pushed into this.
-Yeah.

927
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,290
Wait, look!

928
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,918
There are some strands of hair here!

929
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,755
-He was slammed against the wall.
-That's how he got that gash.

930
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,215
His head was slammed against this wall!

931
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,009
HEAD WOUND
TORN-OFF FLESH AND HAIR

932
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,594
-There are strands of hair stuck here.
-I get it.

933
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,930
The rain washed away the bloodstains.

934
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:48,307
This is the alley
next to Ms. Chicken's restaurant.

935
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,475
-Yeah, it is.
-It is.

936
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:50,559
What's this?

937
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,520
Come on, Ms. Chicken.

938
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,230
-What's this area?
-Ms. Chicken.

939
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,358
What's that? That one right there!

940
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,152
-Isn't that blood?
-It's blood.

941
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:01,862
What on earth?

942
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,699
Ms. Chicken, you're busted.

943
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,450
You're not going to say
it's chicken blood, are you?

944
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,035
I know nothing about this.

945
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,037
Besides, anyone can come in here.

946
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,789
See? It's open to anyone.

947
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,791
Why is there blood on this box?

948
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,626
-It couldn't have been wiped on this.
-Beats me.

949
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,505
It doesn't look like blood spatter.

950
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,757
It could be chicken blood.
How should I know?

951
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,218
-Listen.
-How is this chicken blood?

952
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,013
I live my life covered in blood.

953
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,223
-Did Gun-mi invite you to Sensibility Bar?
-Hold on.

954
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,933
-She did, yeah.
-There's blood on this belt too.

955
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,226
-What?
-What?

956
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,311
-What's that?
-What?

957
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,397
-Is that the only bloodstain?
-Yeah.

958
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,942
-How…
-Are you sure it's blood?

959
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:43,321
-You can easily pop this out.
-Maybe she was hit with this.

960
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:46,157
-Detective, teach C-store a lesson.
-She was banged up.

961
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,867
The culprit battered the victim with this.

962
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,704
-All right, so this is the crime scene.
-This is where it happened.

963
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:52,997
-Right here.
-Hold on.

964
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,541
-But this… Hang on.
-This is what I think.

965
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,879
After she was thrust against the wall,
she was strangled against this.

966
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,547
Then she was beaten with this pole.

967
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:05,051
The killer grabbed this pole.
See how there's blood here?

968
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:09,096
-The victim had bruises all over.
-She was beaten up with that.

969
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,891
-The killer beat the crap out of her.
-Right.

970
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:14,185
I don't think
this was a premeditated crime.

971
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,312
-It was voluntary manslaughter.
-Exactly.

972
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:20,816
After killing someone like that,
you need to get rid of the body.

973
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,236
The recycling station was empty
at the time,

974
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,073
so the killer put her there first.

975
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:30,409
The killer briefly hid the body
at the recycling station,

976
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:33,329
but it was discovered in the empty lot.

977
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:36,040
So it means
the killer moved the body there.

978
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:38,959
But why did they move the body?

979
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,879
And since the body was moved…

980
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:44,924
We need to determine
how the body was moved.

981
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,592
Did the killer carry the body?

982
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,677
-If so…
-That means they're strong.

983
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,679
The body could've been carried.

984
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:54,517
It could've also been pushed
on a cart or something.

985
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,435
There are many possible scenarios.

986
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,978
So how was the body moved?

987
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:01,273
WHERE THE BODY WAS FOUND
WHERE THE MURDER TOOK PLACE

988
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:04,151
I bet there's something around here
that could've been used to move the body.

989
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:09,115
It'd be too exhausting to carry the body,
especially on a rainy day.

990
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,283
I'm sure there's something here.

991
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:19,750
NO ENTRY
DETOUR ADVISED DUE TO ROAD FLOOD

992
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,295
FLOOD RESTRICTION SIGN

993
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,718
Oh shit.

994
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:30,803
IT LIFTS UP?

995
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,686
Check this out.

996
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,521
-What?
-Where did you find that?

997
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,441
-What's that?
-Was that used to move the body?

998
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,317
With this?

999
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,279
This must be it.

1000
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,281
-There's blood!
-Is there blood?

1001
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:51,991
BLOODSTAINS?

1002
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,160
-I didn't realize this had wheels.
-It does.

1003
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:57,830
I looked for something with wheels,
and this was the only thing around.

1004
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,124
THE CULPRIT MOVED THE BODY
WITH THE FLOOD RESTRICTION SIGN

1005
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,542
This is what the culprit used for sure.

1006
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,836
C-store, you scored a big one.

1007
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,672
Even a woman could've easily
pushed this to the lot.

1008
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:10,968
-The women remain as suspects.
-Anyone could've done it.

1009
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:13,637
That being said, the body…

1010
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,806
Which route did they take?

1011
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:22,897
You had to either take the route
that passes the police station

1012
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:27,359
or the one that goes past Sensibility Bar.

1013
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,820
Going past the police station
wasn't an option,

1014
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:34,283
which means the killer
pushed the body past the bar

1015
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:36,577
while the truck was parked outside it.

1016
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,204
Detective.

1017
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,749
The delivery truck

1018
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,667
-should've parked here.
-The delivery truck?

1019
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:44,960
-Yeah
-Exactly.

1020
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,838
But it couldn't park here
because the road was blocked.

1021
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,548
-That was 10:10 p.m.
-Right.

1022
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:50,966
-Hear me out.
-Sure.

1023
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,136
-It parked here instead.
-Did it actually park here?

1024
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:58,516
By doing so,
it blocked the view of this CCTV.

1025
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,935
Because the truck blocked the CCTV…

1026
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:04,647
-The entire road became a blind spot.
-Exactly.

1027
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:08,776
So, after killing Lee Gun-mi,
someone had the chance

1028
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:13,697
to secretly dump the body
by getting past this blind spot.

1029
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,742
I'm sure we can access the footage
from this CCTV.

1030
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,536
MUST CHECK THE CCTV FOOTAGE

1031
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:24,458
SENSIBILITY BAR

1032
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:29,922
What is it?

1033
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,006
What now?

1034
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,384
-That was unexpected.
-What is it?

1035
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,510
ANOTHER DOOR?

1036
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:35,719
I knew it.

1037
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,514
No wonder.

1038
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,517
Sneaky bastards.

1039
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,143
It opens.

1040
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:46,355
A DOOR LEADING INSIDE SENSIBILITY BAR

1041
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:48,023
Sneaky bastards.

1042
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,150
IS BEING PRETTY A CRIME?

1043
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,363
Being sneaky, huh?

1044
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:55,614
Oh, here's the footage.

1045
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,700
You can check the footage here.

1046
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,828
Oh, it's the road outside the front door.

1047
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:06,542
What the heck? Jeez, it's Gold Spoon.

1048
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:09,503
-How do you work this?
-It's in real-time.

1049
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,547
Let's check from 10:10 p.m.

1050
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:16,093
CCTV RECORDING

1051
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,886
-What time is it?
-The truck's approaching!

1052
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,471
-What's with that truck?
-That's it.

1053
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:20,889
There's the truck.

1054
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:23,809
-What time was that?
-It says 10:15 p.m.

1055
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,019
Yes, it was around 10:10 p.m.

1056
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,938
It completely blocked the view.

1057
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,399
We might see the killer
through that small gap.

1058
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:33,027
The taillights went out.
The engine was turned off.

1059
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,903
-There's more.
-Right.

1060
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,363
-Are there multiple videos?
-Yeah.

1061
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,574
This was at 10:29 p.m.

1062
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:40,117
-Right, 10:29 p.m.
-Yeah.

1063
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,621
-The truck should be leaving now.
-It's leaving.

1064
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,251
-The truck's leaving.
-That was at 10:30 p.m.

1065
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,047
-Well, well.
-It was exactly 15 minutes.

1066
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,007
Someone would've passed by
during that time.

1067
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:59,053
I think the killer moved the body
through this gap.

1068
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:03,932
Here too?

1069
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,851
This is also a door.

1070
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,813
A DOOR ON THE OTHER SIDE?

1071
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,274
THE DOOR LEADS TO THE EMPTY LOT

1072
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,109
You can get to the empty lot through here.

1073
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:19,531
-There are two secret passageways.
-What?

1074
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:23,661
You can reach the empty lot
through this door.

1075
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,249
Gun-mi knew about this secret passageway.

1076
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:33,462
She told me about the door
that led to Sensibility Bar.

1077
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:34,797
I came in through that door

1078
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,131
-to beat up Lee Eighty.
-You did?

1079
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:39,093
However, I didn't know
there was a door leading out here.

1080
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,928
-Okay.
-I knew about this passageway too.

1081
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,097
-How so?
-Gun-mi was my friend.

1082
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,015
We would slip out
through the secret passageway

1083
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:49,728
when we drank past nine o'clock
and the cops showed up.

1084
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:53,482
The killer could've come through that door
and dumped the body here.

1085
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:57,111
Let's see if the sign
fits through this door.

1086
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:00,739
Does it fit?

1087
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:03,283
Just barely.

1088
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,119
Hey, it fits.

1089
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,708
This can't be done.

1090
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,835
-Why? Does it not fit?
-It doesn't fit.

1091
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,713
THE SIGN WON'T FIT THROUGH THE DOORWAY

1092
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,131
This is confusing.

1093
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,508
This is so confusing.

1094
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,679
So, you can get in, but you can't get out.

1095
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,098
That means
the secret passageway wasn't used.

1096
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:31,979
The only person who knew
that the truck would block the CCTV

1097
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,772
was C-store.

1098
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,065
If that's the case…

1099
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,484
It could've been done another way.

1100
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,863
Shouldn't we check
when the roads were blocked?

1101
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:42,448
I can tell you that.

1102
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:46,910
The road was open
from 10:30 p.m. to 11:15 p.m.

1103
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,245
It was open for 45 minutes.

1104
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:53,041
The killer likely moved the body down here
when the road was open.

1105
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,006
Hold on.

1106
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:02,092
Do you also see that nail?

1107
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,886
Yeah, I see it.

1108
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,763
-What's with that nail?
-Hold on.

1109
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,724
Is it stuck, or is it just in the water?

1110
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,643
-Is it stuck in there?
-It is.

1111
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,521
There's a nail over there.

1112
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,482
Could it have come from the sign?

1113
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:19,026
-Check if it's missing a nail.
-That seems unlikely.

1114
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:19,943
What is it?

1115
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,821
-There might be a scratch mark.
-Doesn't this look scratched?

1116
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:24,907
Or maybe not.

1117
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,159
This is a scratch mark.

1118
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,497
Isn't this scratch caused by that nail?

1119
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:34,500
This must be
where the killer passed through.

1120
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:35,584
-The back door.
-Through here?

1121
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,336
WAS IT SCRATCHED BY A NAIL
WHILE PASSING THROUGH?

1122
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:39,880
What if Gun-mi was killed
while the roadblock was lifted

1123
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,716
and her body was moved through here?

1124
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,220
-Between 10:30 p.m. and 11:15 p.m.?
-That's from 10:30 p.m. to 11:15 p.m.

1125
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:52,267
Detective, let's consider this
our time frame and weigh our options.

1126
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,477
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1127
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:56,730
COMBINE THE CLUES
TO COMPLETE THE DEDUCTION

1128
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,106
This is your last chance

1129
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:01,819
to show us anything you're carrying
that we haven't seen yet.

1130
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,780
I gave you everything I had.

1131
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:07,908
I never got the chance to tell you
about this earlier.

1132
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,618
-After all this time?
-Is he serious?

1133
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:12,329
-It's nothing. I just found this.
-You had plenty of time to tell us.

1134
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:13,455
-Where did you find this?
-Whose is it?

1135
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,833
-Whose is it?
-It's hers!

1136
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,001
There's a photo. It's Gun-mi's.

1137
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:21,547
Gun-mi must've had two phones.
One for Gun-jun, and one for Gun-mi.

1138
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:26,301
I wonder why the screen is cracked.

1139
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,178
-Why do you have this?
-I--

1140
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:31,181
-Mister, why do you have it?
-What did you do?

1141
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,308
This is why I stepped out of the meeting.

1142
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:38,856
The frame in this photo
matched the one in the video.

1143
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,692
I went to my office to confirm it.

1144
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:45,571
-That's why I ran into you at 9:50 p.m.
-It was after I discovered the frame.

1145
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,781
After checking the video,

1146
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:51,076
I stormed out of my office,
angry that Lee Gun-mi

1147
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,828
had been Park Hyeon-jun all along.

1148
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:55,122
And she was there, running past my office.

1149
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,124
-At what time?
-At 9:45 p.m.

1150
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,877
-At 9:45 p.m.?
-At 9:45 p.m.

1151
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,921
-There was a lot of valuable information
-At 9:45 p.m.

1152
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,132
-on her phone.
-She was still alive at the time.

1153
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:08,635
Things got physical between us
when I tried to take her phone.

1154
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,887
A physical altercation?

1155
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,264
That brat shoved me off and ran,

1156
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,932
but dropped her phone.

1157
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:17,019
-I picked it up since I needed it.
-As in this phone?

1158
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,312
Which direction did she run off to?

1159
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,272
Toward Hansim Pocha.

1160
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:23,775
But what if someone called
while I had this phone?

1161
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,361
That's why I turned it off
and put it in my pocket.

1162
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,196
After 9:45 p.m.,

1163
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,491
we don't know where Gun-mi went
after running off in this direction.

1164
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:35,495
The main point we need to focus on

1165
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,291
is that Gun-mi died over there.

1166
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:43,503
-Behind the fried chicken restaurant.
-Between that restaurant and the club.

1167
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,464
-Between the two places.
-She died in the alley in between.

1168
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:48,050
Meanwhile, the killer could've taken

1169
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,677
three possible routes to move her body.

1170
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:58,226
Route A passes through the blocked road
and by the convenience store.

1171
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:03,857
Route B passes Sensibility Bar,
where a CCTV has been installed.

1172
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:10,280
Route C passes directly through
Sensibility Bar to the empty lot.

1173
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,865
Those are the three routes.

1174
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,451
However, we checked
the routes ourselves earlier.

1175
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,787
-It wouldn't fit.
-Route C is too narrow.

1176
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:21,583
Then the route they most likely took
is Route A,

1177
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,295
which was blocked off due to flooding.

1178
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,047
-That's what I think.
-I agree.

1179
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,049
The flood restriction sign

1180
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:34,137
has a scratch that appears
to have been caused by a nail.

1181
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:38,725
The roadblock
was temporarily lifted last night.

1182
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,311
-It was lifted at 10:30 p.m.
-From 10:30 p.m. to 11:15 p.m.

1183
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:45,065
While the roadblock was briefly lifted,

1184
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:48,568
the killer moved the body
hidden inside the sign

1185
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,570
and dumped it in the empty lot.

1186
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:54,199
And they must've moved the sign back
before the roadblock was reinstalled.

1187
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:55,575
Also,

1188
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:59,997
there was blood on the box
found behind the chicken restaurant.

1189
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,123
That wasn't random.

1190
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,792
The killer beat the victim to death,

1191
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:07,379
but there was no way
they could move the body just yet.

1192
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:10,257
Not knowing what to do,

1193
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,884
they chose to temporarily hide
the body there.

1194
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,344
After keeping it there for a bit,

1195
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:18,724
they took the flood restriction sign
when the time seemed right

1196
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:22,102
and moved the body hidden inside it.

1197
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:25,689
That means there's a good chance she died
before the roadblock was lifted.

1198
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:27,024
That's right.

1199
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,984
The time of death was most likely

1200
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:31,486
-before the roadblock was lifted.
-It was before, not after.

1201
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:36,199
After killing the victim,
the killer initially hid the body

1202
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:41,747
and moved it afterward
when the time was right.

1203
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,999
Two crimes were committed.

1204
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:46,960
What we haven't been
able to figure out yet

1205
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:50,047
is why the killer chose to move the body

1206
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,548
all the way over there.

1207
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,343
We have to figure out
why the killer moved the body.

1208
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:58,930
Hold on.
We heard a loud crash at 9:15 p.m.

1209
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,057
CAUSED BY PARK CHICKEN

1210
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,933
She got into a fight with me at 9:15 p.m.

1211
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,936
Maybe the killer went out of their way
to move the body to the empty lot

1212
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,980
to frame someone.

1213
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,690
-The one caught on video was…
-Ms. Chicken.

1214
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,108
-It was me.
-Right, it was you.

1215
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:13,320
Someone who knew
about the commotion she caused

1216
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:16,865
used it to their advantage.

1217
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:19,785
So you're saying,
they knew about the altercation

1218
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,828
and moved the body to frame Chicken?

1219
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,331
-They made her the prime suspect, right?
-Yeah.

1220
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,668
Who witnessed the altercation
between Chicken and the victim?

1221
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:29,628
I did.

1222
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,213
-An Dancer.
-Who else?

1223
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,464
I only heard the sound.

1224
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:34,299
-Where did you hear it?
-From my office.

1225
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:37,177
-I heard it at the convenience store.
-I saw it from the hallway of the office.

1226
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,386
-Which office?
-Whose office?

1227
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,388
After submitting the registration form
at Gold Spoon's office,

1228
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:43,517
-So, on your way out?
-I heard a crash and looked outside.

1229
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,019
-Here's what I find odd though.
-Can't you see it from his office?

1230
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:49,731
I guess I could've seen
what made the noise.

1231
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,733
But as you know, I was busy.

1232
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,443
-I guess you would've been busy.
-Right.

1233
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,946
I wasn't all that curious about the noise.

1234
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:58,657
Couldn't you have also seen it
if you were at the convenience store?

1235
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,700
-I only heard it.
-I only heard it as well.

1236
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,035
-Why didn't Gold Spoon see it?
-We were together.

1237
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:04,496
-I was busy at the time.
-But Mr. Club left.

1238
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:07,707
Dancer was the only one
who actually saw the altercation.

1239
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:08,625
Right.

1240
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:11,628
Mr. Club could be lying
about not seeing what happened

1241
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,213
when he actually did.

1242
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:16,049
-Mr. Club left after getting cigarettes.
-Right.

1243
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:19,845
There's a chance
Mr. Club also saw me leaving the empty lot

1244
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:22,305
while grabbing onto Gun-mi's hair.

1245
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:25,767
They fought in that empty lot
for about five minutes.

1246
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:28,937
I called Gun-mi at 9:20 p.m.
after seeing that Ms. Chicken had left.

1247
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:33,650
Having ruled out Ms. Chicken as a suspect,

1248
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:36,111
I turned my attention to the others.

1249
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:39,072
I was the only one
who witnessed their fight,

1250
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:42,325
which means one of them must be lying.

1251
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:46,413
In this case, it boils down to
who can provide a valid alibi.

1252
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:49,666
I say this because
the primary location is Hansim Pocha.

1253
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,419
So, on the day of the murder,

1254
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:55,046
this meeting was the main event.

1255
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,215
Even Dancer was present,

1256
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:59,759
not as an employee of the club,

1257
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,596
but as a proxy
for the owner of Sensibility Bar.

1258
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:06,224
Except for Ms. Chicken,

1259
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:09,936
everyone else had to attend the meeting
for various reasons.

1260
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,189
The estimated time frame of the murder

1261
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:15,400
is between 9:45 p.m. and 11:15 p.m.

1262
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:18,320
There's no way the killer spent
the entire hour and a half

1263
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:19,988
killing and cleaning up.

1264
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,240
They must've gone back and forth.

1265
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:23,658
Hold on.

1266
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,828
Dancer, you kept texting the victim
but didn't get a reply.

1267
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:27,913
-Right.
-At least for a while.

1268
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:30,415
What was the text you eventually received?

1269
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:34,628
After seeing her altercation with Chicken,
I called to ask if she was all right.

1270
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,255
She said she couldn't get the money
because of her

1271
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:39,966
and postponed our meet-up time
to 9:50 p.m.

1272
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,635
But after that,
I lost contact with her again.

1273
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,303
-And her phone was turned off.
-Where were you going to meet?

1274
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,429
Outside Club Slam.

1275
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,765
When did you return to the meeting?

1276
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:49,142
I left at 9:50 p.m. and waited,
but she didn't show up.

1277
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:52,312
I tried calling her a minute later,
but her phone was off.

1278
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,521
-So, Club Slam, 9:51 p.m.
-Gun-mi's phone.

1279
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:55,023
-At what time?
-That's when he turned it off.

1280
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:56,233
I turned it off around that time.

1281
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,943
-That's when Gold Spoon turned it off.
-"Phone was turned off."

1282
00:53:58,026 --> 00:54:02,197
-And then what?
-I went to Gun-mi's place at 9:55 p.m.

1283
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,616
That's when I saw
her plane ticket to Russia.

1284
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:07,035
Then I left.
We voted at 10:00 p.m., remember?

1285
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:09,996
Finding Gun-mi was important,
but the vote was just as important.

1286
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,748
On my way back to Hansim Pocha,

1287
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:14,084
I got a call from my Mr. Club.

1288
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:17,087
He told me the water leak detector
went off again and to go check on it.

1289
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:19,673
So, I arrived at the club
at around 10:10 p.m.

1290
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:22,342
and came back to Hansim Pocha
at 10:20 p.m.

1291
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:23,677
She came back.

1292
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,680
We all cast our vote at 10:30 p.m.,

1293
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:30,016
and Mr. Club sent me out again
at 10:40 p.m.

1294
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,477
I was told to check things at the club.

1295
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,520
Did you stay at the club?

1296
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:36,398
-She was here at 10:40 p.m.
-No, I came back here at 11 p.m.

1297
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,275
That's when I found the flash drive
and checked what was on it.

1298
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,527
Why were you wandering around so much?

1299
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,863
-She got back at 11:00 p.m.?
-On my way to the club from here,

1300
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,074
I found a flash drive identical
to the one I'd given her.

1301
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:47,951
After dealing with the detector,

1302
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:50,620
I went to the break room
to check the flash drive.

1303
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,497
Did you find it out there on the street?

1304
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:54,791
Yes, on my way to the club.

1305
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:01,214
Did you say
the water leak detector went off twice?

1306
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,507
Yes.

1307
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,134
When it first went off,

1308
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:08,179
I planned to send her to the club
during the meeting, but she wasn't around.

1309
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:10,307
So I had no choice but to go there myself.
That was at 9:55 p.m.

1310
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,683
-That was 9:55 p.m.
-And then what?

1311
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,310
That's also when I got a text
from Gu Lackey.

1312
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:16,604
He looked for what I had asked,
but didn't find anything.

1313
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:19,399
When I looked at the photo again,
something was off.

1314
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,943
So at 10:05 p.m.,
I told Lackey to look for missing boys.

1315
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:26,656
Once I got to the club,
I saw that the detector had malfunctioned.

1316
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,949
-And then--
-Was it a malfunction?

1317
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:30,035
It kept going off,
even though there was no water leak.

1318
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:32,620
But I couldn't be bothered,
so I told Dancer to deal with it

1319
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:35,290
and returned to the meeting.

1320
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:37,459
I got back here at 10:25 p.m.

1321
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:39,461
-What took you so long?
-At 10:25 p.m.?

1322
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,421
But the water leak detector
went off again.

1323
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:43,673
That was around 10:40 p.m.

1324
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,884
-Dancer was at the meeting then.
-Right.

1325
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:48,428
So I told her to go check on it.

1326
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,597
-Was it another malfunction?
-Yeah.

1327
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,848
-Another one?
-Yeah.

1328
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:55,935
At 10:50 p.m., Lackey called
to tell me about the missing boy.

1329
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:59,064
That's when I went to Gun-mi's place
to confront her.

1330
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:01,107
-But no one was home.
-Right.

1331
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,860
Having had no luck,
I walked past the police station

1332
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,571
and returned to Hansim Pocha at 11:15 p.m.

1333
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:09,324
There's something I'd like to ask.

1334
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:13,411
At 10:20 p.m., you texted Lackey
to call you as soon as he had something.

1335
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:15,747
-I did.
-When did he call?

1336
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:18,124
-At 10:50 p.m.
-At 10:50 p.m.

1337
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:22,420
-Could Club have killed her at 10:50 p.m.?
-By that time, you knew the whole truth.

1338
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,756
Including the fact that Gun-mi was
going to commit arson to get her revenge.

1339
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:28,093
I had no idea about the whole arson thing.

1340
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:30,637
I was just anxious
about the whole situation.

1341
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,806
So my priority was to meet her

1342
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,892
and hear her side of the story.

1343
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:36,851
And if anything,

1344
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:39,854
she would've been the one trying to
kill me, not the other way around.

1345
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:41,856
That was her plan.

1346
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,109
-Right?
-Maybe that's why you beat her to it.

1347
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,735
To protect himself?

1348
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,195
That's ridiculous.

1349
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:52,200
I had absolutely no idea
that she had gasoline

1350
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:55,829
and was thinking about killing me
by setting me on fire.

1351
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:59,416
But you would've known
if you saw the gasoline at her house.

1352
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:00,708
I didn't see it though.

1353
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:03,795
What if you became sure of it
at 10:50 p.m.?

1354
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:05,880
-Be sure of what?
-That she was actually Park Hyeon-jun.

1355
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,340
He could've known for sure
when Lackey texted him.

1356
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:09,342
-And he could've seen the gasoline
-I bet he knew for sure.

1357
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,802
when he went to Gun-mi's house.

1358
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:12,637
Mr. Club could've been the killer.

1359
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,847
The roadblock was lifted,

1360
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,266
so he could've killed her,

1361
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:18,560
disposed of the body,
and returned by 11:15 p.m.

1362
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:20,645
Come on.
All right, let's say all of that is true.

1363
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:22,897
Kim Club and An Dancer.

1364
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,900
They wandered around a lot that night.

1365
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:30,447
An Dancer left the meeting
twice that night,

1366
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:34,492
and Kim Club did the same.

1367
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:38,913
They both had enough time
to commit the crime.

1368
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:41,499
What about you, C-store?

1369
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:42,459
JANG C-STORE'S MOVEMENTS

1370
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:43,710
I arrived at the meeting at 10:10 p.m.,

1371
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:46,337
but before that,
I had been looking for Gun-jun.

1372
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:50,300
I stayed at the meeting
and left without casting my vote.

1373
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:51,593
What time did you leave?

1374
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:52,677
At 11:00 p.m.

1375
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,597
Why didn't you sign out
before leaving at 11:00 p.m.?

1376
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,432
Because it was raining.

1377
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:00,643
-You just didn't feel like it?
-I was looking for someone.

1378
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:03,605
Were you out doing the thing
that brought you inner peace?

1379
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:04,814
Yeah.

1380
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,524
I just love them.

1381
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,652
-Love what?
-Petite women with long hair.

1382
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,529
-Especially on rainy days.
-Yeah, on rainy days.

1383
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:12,864
He attacks women

1384
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:15,325
-with a claw hammer on rainy days.
-Why does he act so proud of it?

1385
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:17,118
It's okay. He'll be behind bars soon.

1386
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,495
JANG C-STORE IS BOUND TO
END UP IN JAIL ANYWAY

1387
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:19,579
Moving on.

1388
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:22,081
-Let's check Mr. Gold Spoon's whereabouts.
-Sure.

1389
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,708
-My whereabouts are clear.
-Okay.

1390
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:25,585
-I left the meeting at 10:15 p.m.
-At 10:15 p.m.?

1391
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,545
I wasn't in the best of moods

1392
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:32,133
because all I had was Gun-mi's phone
and no idea where she was.

1393
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,551
Anyway, I left the meeting

1394
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,470
only to find that this road was blocked.

1395
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:39,849
I walked past Sensibility Bar
and went to Lee Gun-mi's place.

1396
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:41,893
That was when the truck
was parked outside the bar.

1397
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:43,728
I didn't notice it

1398
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:45,855
because it's not unusual
to see a truck there.

1399
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,440
-Oh, yeah?
-Yes.

1400
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:50,818
I went to Gun-mi's place
and saw what everyone here saw,

1401
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:54,656
which was her suitcase
and plane ticket to Russia.

1402
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:55,990
There wasn't much I could do,

1403
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:58,535
so I came back to the meeting
at 10:35 p.m.

1404
00:58:58,618 --> 00:58:59,786
When did you leave again

1405
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,579
after coming back to Hansim Pocha?

1406
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:05,667
I returned to my office at midnight.

1407
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,502
-You stayed until midnight?
-I was at the meeting all night.

1408
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:10,421
I gave legal advice
to some of the business owners.

1409
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:11,506
-Here?
-Yes.

1410
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:14,676
So, you left the meeting just once
within the time frame of the murder.

1411
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:15,843
That's right.

1412
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:22,100
When we compare his statements
to the theory we came up with,

1413
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,185
-his movements don't add up.
-He's no longer a suspect.

1414
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:28,189
He couldn't have gone through that road
at the time the roadblock was lifted.

1415
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:32,610
Based on the timeline we've established,

1416
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,404
these three are the prime suspects.

1417
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,116
During this time frame…

1418
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:40,493
We're the only ones
who left the meeting twice.

1419
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:43,997
There's one thing that keeps bugging me.

1420
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:49,586
The water leak detector malfunctioned,
and it happened twice.

1421
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,921
As a result,
their movements appear very suspicious.

1422
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:56,301
The point I want to emphasize
about the detector

1423
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:58,678
is that I had no say over it.

1424
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:03,474
I don't get the notification
since I'm not the boss.

1425
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:07,186
What I don't get is why he kept
telling me to handle it.

1426
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:10,106
-Who else would I ask then?
-The water leak detector

1427
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:11,608
may sound like a complex device,

1428
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:16,904
but all we do to fix it
is change the batteries.

1429
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:20,325
Besides, it frequently malfunctions
during humid, rainy days in the summer.

1430
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:22,535
-You could've easily handled it.
-Why should I?

1431
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,579
Why would you bother
your employee like that?

1432
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:26,205
Who else would I boss around then?

1433
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,374
-You were already there.
-Why else would I pay you?

1434
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,084
-Look, mister.
-You could've fixed it yourself. Yes?

1435
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:31,336
-Hey, mister.
-Oh, him.

1436
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:33,338
You went to the club

1437
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:36,758
and saw the detector malfunctioning,

1438
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:40,845
but left it to Dancer to fix it
instead of doing it yourself, right?

1439
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:44,098
It's just a nuisance,
especially with this big belly of mine.

1440
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,892
It's such a hassle to pick it up
and fiddle with it.

1441
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:48,811
-Maybe there was a reason
-I can barely see those tiny batteries.

1442
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,647
-to leave at 10:05 p.m.
-That's so suspicious.

1443
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:54,067
You don't know how tough running
a business is until you've done it. Jeez.

1444
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:57,820
I suppose that's understandable,
but he was there at the club.

1445
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:59,572
He took the time to go there, after all.

1446
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:02,241
But if he was busy with something else,

1447
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:06,496
he could've had Dancer
take care of the detector instead.

1448
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:09,207
I'm wondering if he sent me there
to keep me in one place.

1449
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:12,835
I only went to check on it
because Mr. Club told me to.

1450
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,005
-Right.
-That's what I'm wondering.

1451
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:20,218
-Okay, I get it now.
-Hold on.

1452
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:25,515
I never thought that having my employees
handle minor tasks

1453
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:28,935
would come across as suspicious or wrong.

1454
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:30,561
However,

1455
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:34,440
she knows I always tell her
to take care of such tasks.

1456
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,943
The water leak detector keeps going off,

1457
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,403
and she knows that.

1458
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:40,571
She knew I'd send her to fix it.

1459
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:41,864
-What?
-Get it?

1460
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,032
So what though?

1461
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:47,954
She can't just magically
make it malfunction remotely, can she?

1462
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,832
You saw it yourselves at the club.

1463
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:52,333
I never touch it myself.

1464
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:54,836
I just notice that there's something
wrong with it and tell her to fix it.

1465
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:57,338
She probably knows how to work it and all.

1466
01:01:57,422 --> 01:02:02,051
She could've caused
the detector to malfunction

1467
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:04,053
so that I'd receive a notification.

1468
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,471
It's a thought that just occurred to me.

1469
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,557
Wouldn't she have to be at the club
to pull that off?

1470
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,768
Who knows?
I don't know anything about that device.

1471
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:12,729
It never crossed my mind until now,

1472
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:15,481
but she was wandering outside all night.

1473
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:18,067
But she was here at the time
you sent her to fix it again.

1474
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:19,610
-Is that so?
-I was here at 10:20 p.m.

1475
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:20,611
Then I guess

1476
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:24,574
she could've set it on a timer
or something.

1477
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:27,493
I don't deal with this kind of stuff.
I'm the boss, damn it!

1478
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,537
-I mean, if you ever--
-Are you kidding me? Hey!

1479
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:31,622
-For goodness' sake.
-Man, you people are really testing me!

1480
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:33,207
You can't just shout us down, Mr. Club.

1481
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:35,251
So much for trying to control my temper.

1482
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:36,335
You brat!

1483
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:37,503
What?

1484
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,797
Here's the thing about Mr. Club.

1485
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:42,425
Let me tell you something about him.

1486
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:45,136
He wasn't in a good mood
when he came to buy cigarettes.

1487
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:46,846
How could I be?

1488
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:50,224
How could I be in a good mood
knowing that the kid of the family

1489
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:54,771
whose house I set on fire 20 years ago
and thought I had killed was still alive?

1490
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:56,439
-All right, then.
-Got it, Mr. Club.

1491
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:58,816
Shush, you punk!

1492
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,444
-I'm sorry.
-At 10:20 p.m.,

1493
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:03,738
-I got in touch with Gu Lackey.
-Let's send him to jail.

1494
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:04,781
That was it!

1495
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:06,949
-This is tough.
-Where are you going?

1496
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:08,826
-I'm sorry, sir.
-I wasn't done talking!

1497
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:13,456
Kim Club.

1498
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:15,374
Why did he keep sending me to the club?

1499
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:19,086
She's out to make me the culprit.

1500
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,047
Trying to be smart, are you?

1501
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:22,673
That brat!

1502
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:23,925
CAST YOUR VOTE BASED ON THE CLUES

1503
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:25,510
No matter how much I think about it…

1504
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,430
Let's say the detector went off.

1505
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:30,807
PLAYING OUT THE SCENARIO
INVOLVING THE WATER LEAK DETECTOR

1506
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:32,475
"Damn, it went off again."

1507
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:33,559
You come in…

1508
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:37,730
and pick up the detector to fix it.

1509
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,023
How's that a hassle?

1510
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:44,403
He got Dancer to leave twice
because of this.

1511
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:47,156
It's a piece of cake.

1512
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,326
Fixing it himself would've been quicker
than calling Dancer over.

1513
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:53,162
He could've just fixed the detector
since he was there,

1514
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:55,081
but he had me come instead.

1515
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:56,249
Regarding that,

1516
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:59,043
Mr. Club received the notification

1517
01:03:59,126 --> 01:04:01,295
about the water leak detector
at 9:55 p.m.,

1518
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:03,172
and initially went to the club.

1519
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:07,552
Then, he called me at 10:05 p.m.
and told me to fix the detector,

1520
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:12,014
and he returned to Hansim Pocha
at 10:25 p.m.

1521
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:15,309
That means there was
a 20-minute gap in between.

1522
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:18,020
He took longer than I did
to get back to Hansim Pocha.

1523
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:22,233
What if he didn't go to the club
from Hansim Pocha?

1524
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:25,570
He killed an entire family.

1525
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:27,530
And after so many years,

1526
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:31,534
he was faced with the possibility
of someone seeking revenge.

1527
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:35,329
He must've been terrified and anxious.

1528
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:38,708
What if he met Gun-mi
during those 20 minutes?

1529
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:43,087
He could've made up his mind to kill her.

1530
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,047
He must've been terrified.

1531
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:49,719
Fear drives people
to take drastic measures.

1532
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:53,931
You're the culprit.

1533
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:00,313
All right, Kim Club.

1534
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:02,023
Mr. Club.

1535
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:04,025
I'm sorry.

1536
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:07,820
JANG C-STORE AND AN DANCER CHOSE KIM CLUB

1537
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:18,205
An Dancer had no say in it.

1538
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:20,541
She had to follow Kim Club's order.

1539
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:25,922
That's why I saw her as someone
with limited free will.

1540
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:36,349
Could this have been used?

1541
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,732
This means An Dancer
is a likely suspect too.

1542
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:48,986
This is above it.

1543
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:53,866
There are people
who left the meeting twice that night.

1544
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,117
One of them is An Dancer.

1545
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:58,496
Kim Club also left the meeting
a second time.

1546
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:02,083
The culprit had to return to the meeting
to create an alibi,

1547
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:05,586
then leave again to move the body.

1548
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,838
What would they do?

1549
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:11,008
They needed a reason to leave the meeting
without raising suspicion.

1550
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:12,343
And what reason did they come up with?

1551
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:15,012
The water leak detector.

1552
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:21,811
It drops directly onto it.

1553
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:24,146
The water leak detector

1554
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:29,110
was located directly below
where the hand sanitizer would drip.

1555
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:31,779
They came up with a trick

1556
01:06:31,862 --> 01:06:34,407
to intentionally trigger the detector
with a time delay.

1557
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:35,866
After killing the victim,

1558
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:39,870
the culprit stashed the body
in the nearby recycling station

1559
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:41,205
and thought things over.

1560
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:45,418
She knew her damn boss would order her
to fix the water leak detector.

1561
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:46,961
Knowing that,

1562
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:50,548
she was sure
she would be sent out to fix it

1563
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:52,633
if it went off during the meeting.

1564
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:56,387
While pretending
to go out to fix the detector,

1565
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:59,807
she could've taken that opportunity
to move the body to the empty lot.

1566
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:04,520
You played it smart.
I'm impressed, An Dancer.

1567
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:08,149
You…

1568
01:07:09,483 --> 01:07:10,860
deserve to rot in jail.

1569
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:15,322
KIM CLUB CHOSE AN DANCER

1570
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:17,033
You were given

1571
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:19,660
a beautiful new face
and deserved to debut.

1572
01:07:20,327 --> 01:07:21,746
The betrayal must've cut deep.

1573
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:24,040
Regardless,

1574
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:26,417
you need to be punished for what you did.

1575
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:31,255
JANG DETECTIVE CHOSE AN DANCER

1576
01:07:31,338 --> 01:07:33,299
Can I really base my entire deduction

1577
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:36,469
on that one vague piece of evidence
I found in the final three minutes

1578
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:38,888
concerning the leak detector?

1579
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:43,642
Even so…

1580
01:07:44,977 --> 01:07:48,522
WHO DID HA GOLD SPOON CHOOSE?

1581
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:58,949
Kim Club and An Dancer.

1582
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:01,535
Given the timeline,
either of them could've done it.

1583
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:02,912
From that moment,

1584
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:06,248
I realized it all came down
to their movements and alibis.

1585
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,086
Let's see.

1586
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:14,715
If An Dancer was the one
who moved the body,

1587
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:18,302
she likely killed the victim
when she first left the meeting.

1588
01:08:18,385 --> 01:08:20,638
But there's proof

1589
01:08:20,721 --> 01:08:23,265
that she called Lee Gun-mi at 10:55 p.m.

1590
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:24,517
Think about it.

1591
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,268
Why would she call a dead person?

1592
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:29,271
Does it mean An Dancer isn't the killer?

1593
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:33,234
Did she call to check if she was alive
because she believed she wasn't dead?

1594
01:08:39,323 --> 01:08:42,159
FINAL VOTE COMPLETE

1595
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:46,080
The fourth episode of the deduction game,
Crime Scene Zero.

1596
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:48,874
The results of the nail-biting
deduction game to find the culprit

1597
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,168
of the murder in the nightlife district.

1598
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:55,297
Let's see who received the most votes
as the real culprit.

1599
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:59,969
We will now announce the results.

1600
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,472
-You didn't vote for me, did you?
-Come on.

1601
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:05,474
Mr. Club, did you vote for me?

1602
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:10,062
The ultimate deduction game,
Crime Scene Zero.

1603
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:14,275
First, we will announce who was excluded
from the final list of suspects.

1604
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,361
The results of the final vote
to determine the culprit are as follows.

1605
01:09:17,444 --> 01:09:19,530
With zero votes,

1606
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:22,408
Park Chicken

1607
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:24,952
and Ha Gold Spoon,
you are excluded from the final lineup.

1608
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:28,497
There's an unexpected someone in the mix.

1609
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:30,249
Seriously?

1610
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:32,251
Detective.

1611
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:34,003
Next.

1612
01:09:34,086 --> 01:09:35,880
With one vote,

1613
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:39,175
Jang C-store, you are also excluded
from the final lineup.

1614
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:41,594
Why am I in the final lineup again?

1615
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:44,346
-Those identified as suspects
-Who voted for me?

1616
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,557
were An Dancer and Kim Club.

1617
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,560
Will the two final suspects
please step forward?

1618
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:51,729
You've got to be kidding me.

1619
01:09:51,812 --> 01:09:54,607
I can't believe I'm being accused
alongside this thug.

1620
01:09:55,399 --> 01:09:57,109
Mind your manners.

1621
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,360
Why should I?

1622
01:09:58,444 --> 01:09:59,528
The ultimate deduction game,

1623
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:01,322
-Crime Scene Zero.
-What if they're tied?

1624
01:10:01,405 --> 01:10:04,742
The results of the final vote
of the murder in the nightlife district.

1625
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:08,370
The player who was ultimately identified
as the culprit is…

1626
01:10:15,836 --> 01:10:16,921
An Dancer

1627
01:10:17,796 --> 01:10:18,797
and Kim Club!

1628
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,633
As it's a three-to-three tie…

1629
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:21,842
An Dancer

1630
01:10:22,676 --> 01:10:23,510
and Kim Club!

1631
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:25,095
As it's a three-to-three tie,

1632
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,514
the players will decide
by reaching an agreement.

1633
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:29,391
-A three-to-three tie?
-Who was it?

1634
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:31,602
-Which three chose me?
-It's a three-to-three tie.

1635
01:10:31,685 --> 01:10:33,312
-They chose each other.
-They chose each other.

1636
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:35,314
Those who voted for An Dancer

1637
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:38,234
are Jang Detective,
Park Chicken, and Kim Club.

1638
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:40,319
Those who voted for Kim Club

1639
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:43,530
are An Dancer,
Ha Gold Spoon, and Jang C-store.

1640
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:47,618
You must now reach an agreement

1641
01:10:47,701 --> 01:10:51,038
and identify the final suspect.

1642
01:10:51,121 --> 01:10:52,289
We have to reach an agreement?

1643
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:57,002
Mr. Club, go stand over there.
It suits you better.

1644
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:59,004
What are you talking about?
You go over there.

1645
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,840
-Have you ever danced in a cage before?
-Go already.

1646
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:06,845
Since they're our final suspects,
we'll hear their closing arguments.

1647
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:09,306
-Mr. Club, you go first.
-Sure.

1648
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,934
Like I said before,

1649
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:17,064
all I did was order my employee
to check on the water leak detector.

1650
01:11:17,147 --> 01:11:21,026
Knowing I'd order her to do it,
she took advantage of the situation.

1651
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:23,320
She knew I'd send her to the club

1652
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:25,406
when I got the notification
about a water leak.

1653
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:28,617
-She moved the body in that window.
-That's an important point.

1654
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:32,496
Besides, how could I have known
if the road was flooded or not?

1655
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:34,873
How could I have known
to move the body through there?

1656
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:37,167
-The same goes for Dancer.
-She wouldn't have known either.

1657
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:41,505
I'm the boss, damn it!
You idiots are unbelievable.

1658
01:11:41,588 --> 01:11:42,798
It wasn't me!

1659
01:11:42,881 --> 01:11:45,592
-His final words were of no use.
-I'm the boss!

1660
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:47,386
-All he did was yell.
-I know.

1661
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:49,263
-All he did was show his nasty temper.
-All right.

1662
01:11:49,346 --> 01:11:51,807
I'd like to point out two things.

1663
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:53,100
First,

1664
01:11:53,183 --> 01:11:56,854
I believe Mr. Club kept me at the club
by sending me there to fix the detector.

1665
01:11:56,937 --> 01:11:59,815
If not for that,
I would've kept looking for him.

1666
01:11:59,898 --> 01:12:02,192
While I was at the club,

1667
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:05,946
he used that time to kill the victim
and dispose of her body.

1668
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:07,906
The second thing is something
I want you to think about.

1669
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:11,702
Mr. Club said he heard the crash
but didn't see anything.

1670
01:12:11,785 --> 01:12:14,163
-That was at 9:15 p.m.
-Right.

1671
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:18,751
But at that time,
that road was blocked due to flooding.

1672
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:21,378
The quickest way back to the club
was the route past the empty lot.

1673
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:24,923
So, what reason did he have
for taking the longer way back

1674
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:26,550
past the police station?

1675
01:12:26,633 --> 01:12:28,802
Here's why I'm bringing that up.

1676
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:33,766
We've established that the body was moved
to the empty lot to frame Ms. Chicken.

1677
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:36,852
Whether the culprit knows
about her altercation with Gun-mi

1678
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:38,103
-is a crucial point.
-True.

1679
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:41,857
-But he chose to lie about it--
-You admitted to seeing it.

1680
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:44,276
I did, but why would I admit it
if I were the culprit?

1681
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,404
-Okay, we'll gather our opinions now.
-I didn't see it.

1682
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:51,408
-An Dancer.
-Mr. Club.

1683
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:54,161
-I've been so good to you.
-How do you figure that?

1684
01:12:54,244 --> 01:12:57,247
I even made a fair deal
on your labor contract.

1685
01:12:57,331 --> 01:13:00,250
They both had plenty of time
to kill and dispose of the body.

1686
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:02,336
But there's more to consider than that.

1687
01:13:02,419 --> 01:13:04,713
There needs to be a clear motive
and strong evidence.

1688
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:07,049
They both had enough time to kill her.

1689
01:13:07,132 --> 01:13:08,384
But within that window of opportunity,

1690
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:11,804
did the culprit have a clear reason
to kill her?

1691
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:16,183
An Dancer said she left at 9:50 p.m.

1692
01:13:16,266 --> 01:13:18,769
-and went to Gun-mi's place at 9:55 p.m.
-Right.

1693
01:13:18,852 --> 01:13:22,022
While she was there,
she saw the plane ticket on her laptop.

1694
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:26,652
But at that point, Mr. Club
still didn't have a motive to kill her

1695
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:29,279
because he received the call
from Gu Lackey about the missing boy

1696
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:30,781
at 10:50 p.m.

1697
01:13:30,864 --> 01:13:32,699
At the time he first left the meeting,

1698
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:36,078
-he didn't have a motive to kill her.
-You're absolutely right.

1699
01:13:36,161 --> 01:13:38,539
But to argue against this,
An Dancer could bring up

1700
01:13:38,622 --> 01:13:40,416
the outgoing call he made to Gu Lackey.

1701
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:42,751
-What?
-He called Gu Lackey earlier that night.

1702
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:45,963
One could also argue that Kim Club
heard about who Lee Gun-mi was

1703
01:13:46,046 --> 01:13:49,842
before the time
he claimed to have heard it.

1704
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:54,388
I originally thought it was Kim Club,
but then I switched to Dancer.

1705
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:56,640
Let's do this.

1706
01:13:56,723 --> 01:13:59,643
We've discussed it, but ultimately,
it's up to you who you vote for.

1707
01:13:59,726 --> 01:14:01,228
Vote wisely.

1708
01:14:01,311 --> 01:14:03,355
Now,

1709
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:06,358
please identify the final suspect.

1710
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:13,991
Oh, we line up behind the person?

1711
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:31,216
You've got to be kidding me.

1712
01:14:33,927 --> 01:14:36,430
(EMPTY)

1713
01:14:36,513 --> 01:14:38,682
An Dancer, you've been identified

1714
01:14:38,765 --> 01:14:40,726
-It's rather empty here.
-as the final suspect.

1715
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:42,478
Please enter the jail.

1716
01:14:44,688 --> 01:14:45,939
You people are unbelievable.

1717
01:14:50,694 --> 01:14:53,322
I did find you suspicious
until the end though.

1718
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:54,823
-Mr. Attorney.
-Very suspicious.

1719
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:56,783
She's pissed.

1720
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:59,161
-Someone else could die.
-I'm too scared to make eye contact.

1721
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:01,497
If An Dancer is the real culprit,

1722
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:05,542
Park Chicken, Kim Club,
Ha Gold Spoon, and Jang C-store

1723
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:07,586
will each win two million won,

1724
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:12,090
and Jang Detective will win a million won.

1725
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,842
Darn, the detective doesn't get much.

1726
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:17,262
If An Dancer is not the culprit,

1727
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:20,349
the real killer will claim the prize money
of all other players,

1728
01:15:20,432 --> 01:15:22,893
a total of ten million won.

1729
01:15:22,976 --> 01:15:24,561
The stakes are high.

1730
01:15:25,145 --> 01:15:29,358
The fourth episode of the ultimate
deduction game, Crime Scene Zero.

1731
01:15:30,442 --> 01:15:34,905
An Dancer has been voted as the culprit
in the murder in the nightlife district.

1732
01:15:36,156 --> 01:15:41,119
Is she really the culprit
who killed Lee Gun-jun?

1733
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:42,746
We could all be wrong.

1734
01:15:44,581 --> 01:15:46,500
What's with that evil laugh?

1735
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,294
Ms. An Dancer.

1736
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:51,755
Are you

1737
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:55,634
Lee Gun-jun's killer?

1738
01:16:04,309 --> 01:16:05,561
Yes, she is!

1739
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:08,438
Yes, she is!

1740
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:11,608
SUCCESSFULLY APPREHENDED THE CULPRIT

1741
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:15,195
See that, people? I never lied.

1742
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:17,281
Good job.

1743
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:19,533
-Those final three minutes mattered.
-Nicely done.

1744
01:16:19,616 --> 01:16:21,743
-What a shame.
-She convinced us all.

1745
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:23,495
-That was close.
-Thanks for trusting me.

1746
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:26,498
-I have goosebumps.
-Why did you suddenly change your mind?

1747
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:29,293
-I changed my mind at the last second.
-I was on the fence,

1748
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:32,296
so I trusted my initial gut
but changed my mind just a minute ago.

1749
01:16:32,379 --> 01:16:34,506
You confused us
because all you did was claim

1750
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,758
that you gave orders
because you were her boss.

1751
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:40,887
-You people brought back my nasty temper!
-You dug your own grave.

1752
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:44,391
We'll now announce
the key piece of evidence you missed.

1753
01:16:44,474 --> 01:16:45,976
-Bring it!
-Did we miss something?

1754
01:16:46,059 --> 01:16:47,936
Is it alcohol or drugs?

1755
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:52,816
-Is that soju?
-What could it have been?

1756
01:16:52,899 --> 01:16:56,028
I told you something was up
with the water leak detector.

1757
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:58,238
-Wasn't it the hand sanitizer?
-Did she cause a reaction with alcohol?

1758
01:16:58,322 --> 01:17:00,616
-Guess how I did it.
-She made a hole in the cap.

1759
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:02,451
Like this.

1760
01:17:03,535 --> 01:17:05,912
She pierced a hole in the cap
and hung the bottle above it.

1761
01:17:06,496 --> 01:17:08,415
-She hung it?
-The soju dripped from the bottle.

1762
01:17:08,498 --> 01:17:10,000
Oh, she did that with soju?

1763
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:11,710
She hung it in the sanitizer holder?

1764
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:13,962
THE SOJU BOTTLE WAS HUNG
IN THE HAND SANITIZER HOLDER

1765
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:19,384
The first detector alert was a test,

1766
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:21,136
but the second one
was intentionally triggered.

1767
01:17:21,219 --> 01:17:23,096
SHE TRICKED THE DEVICE INTO
SENDING A NOTIFICATION TO KIM CLUB

1768
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:24,389
Where was this?

1769
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:26,099
It was at the club.

1770
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:28,060
A CRATE OF SOJU BOTTLES
WAS BY THE CLUB ENTRANCE

1771
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:30,020
The pin was also on the floor.

1772
01:17:30,103 --> 01:17:32,022
-It was?
-Anyway, the water leak detector

1773
01:17:32,105 --> 01:17:34,066
-turned out to be a major clue for us.
-Yeah.

1774
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:36,526
Wait, then Gun-jun… I can't believe him.

1775
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:38,278
-You're quite strong.
-You're brutal.

1776
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:40,030
How could you beat someone up like that?

1777
01:17:40,113 --> 01:17:42,199
-Should I demonstrate?
-No, we're good.

1778
01:17:42,282 --> 01:17:45,369
-I'd be happy to.
-That's not necessary.

1779
01:17:46,411 --> 01:17:48,914
THE FULL STORY BEHIND
THE MURDER IN THE NIGHTLIFE DISTRICT

1780
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:52,250
An Dancer had always wanted to be
a K-pop idol since she was young,

1781
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:55,921
but she was turned down
every time she auditioned.

1782
01:17:56,004 --> 01:18:00,050
Eventually, she joined
an entertainment agency as a trainee

1783
01:18:00,133 --> 01:18:03,762
and was finally close
to making her dream debut

1784
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:07,057
after undergoing a full makeover
with the agency's support.

1785
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:11,061
Then came the words
that completely shattered her world.

1786
01:18:11,144 --> 01:18:12,562
To debut,

1787
01:18:12,646 --> 01:18:15,357
she would have to repay the money
the agency had spent on her.

1788
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:19,277
As An Dancer despaired over
having no way to repay the money,

1789
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:22,239
the agency suggested she deliver drugs.

1790
01:18:22,823 --> 01:18:25,117
After learning that all the other trainees
had paid off their debts

1791
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,410
and debuted the same way,

1792
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:29,538
she started delivering drugs

1793
01:18:29,621 --> 01:18:32,999
but was soon caught by the police.

1794
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:35,419
However, instead of a police station,

1795
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:38,046
she was taken to a club
in Gangdam Station's nightlife district.

1796
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:41,049
As it turned out, the agency was a front
for a drug distribution ring

1797
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:44,761
that manipulated trainees
into working as couriers,

1798
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:49,141
and Kim Club, a former cop,
was their leader.

1799
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:51,977
Kim Club made An Dancer
sign an unfair contract

1800
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,730
by adding a prison waiver fee
to the initial debt,

1801
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:58,108
which left her no choice
but to work as a dancer at Club Slam

1802
01:18:58,191 --> 01:19:01,987
and deliver drugs to private VIP parties.

1803
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:03,905
Then one day,

1804
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:06,408
a woman her age named Lee Gun-mi
approached her,

1805
01:19:06,491 --> 01:19:08,702
claiming to be her number one fan.

1806
01:19:09,244 --> 01:19:11,705
As their friendship grew quickly,

1807
01:19:11,788 --> 01:19:15,083
An Dancer confided in her
about her enormous debts

1808
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:17,836
and her one-sided feelings
for Ha Gold Spoon.

1809
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:21,673
It was then that Lee Gun-mi proposed
a dangerous deal.

1810
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:26,094
She had the chance to make a lot of money
by selling photos of VIP drug parties

1811
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:28,847
to an organization operating in China.

1812
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:31,641
She grew hopeful
that she could pay off her debts

1813
01:19:31,725 --> 01:19:35,604
and become free so that
she could finally debut as an idol.

1814
01:19:36,354 --> 01:19:38,190
However, a few days later,

1815
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:41,318
she happened to see Lee Gun-mi
and Ha Gold Spoon

1816
01:19:41,401 --> 01:19:43,612
being affectionate with each other.

1817
01:19:43,695 --> 01:19:46,615
Thinking that her best friend
had betrayed her and stolen her man,

1818
01:19:46,698 --> 01:19:48,700
she was overwhelmed with anger.

1819
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,076
That night,

1820
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:54,915
she angrily called Lee Gun-mi
to call off the whole deal.

1821
01:19:54,998 --> 01:19:58,627
What she heard in response
was the shocking truth.

1822
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:00,378
She told An Dancer

1823
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:03,089
that she was a transgender woman
who hadn't been able to afford surgery

1824
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:06,092
and that her relationship
with Ha Gold Spoon was a misunderstanding.

1825
01:20:06,176 --> 01:20:07,761
She explained
that after selling the photos,

1826
01:20:07,844 --> 01:20:09,262
they would go to China together,

1827
01:20:09,346 --> 01:20:11,306
where she could have
her gender-affirming surgery,

1828
01:20:11,389 --> 01:20:13,767
and An Dancer would debut as an idol

1829
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:16,770
with a well-known
entertainment agency in China,

1830
01:20:16,853 --> 01:20:18,855
which she had already scouted out for her.

1831
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:21,775
After clearing up the misunderstanding,

1832
01:20:21,858 --> 01:20:24,945
An Dancer photographed the VIP drug party
to secure their future.

1833
01:20:25,028 --> 01:20:26,863
While giving Lee Gun-mi the photos,

1834
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:29,032
the two promised
they would flee to China together

1835
01:20:29,115 --> 01:20:32,285
after An Dancer cleared her debts.

1836
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:36,665
However, at 9:30 p.m.
on the day they agreed to meet,

1837
01:20:36,748 --> 01:20:38,458
Lee Gun-mi was unreachable.

1838
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:39,918
Meanwhile, as per Kim Club's order,

1839
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:44,047
Dancer visited Ha Gold Spoon's office
to submit the application

1840
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:46,883
for the meeting of business owners
affected by COVID-19.

1841
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:49,845
A loud crash rang out
as she stepped out of the office.

1842
01:20:51,221 --> 01:20:52,848
From the hallway window,

1843
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:56,560
she saw an argument unfolding
in the empty lot.

1844
01:20:56,643 --> 01:20:58,436
Consumed by rage,

1845
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,439
Park Chicken
was threatening Lee Gun-mi's life.

1846
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:05,777
After Park Chicken left,
An Dancer called Lee Gun-mi,

1847
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:09,614
who postponed their meet-up by 30 minutes
due to a setback.

1848
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:10,657
Having no other choice,

1849
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:14,452
she went to the meeting
with business owners affected by COVID-19

1850
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:16,121
with Kim Club.

1851
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:18,665
However, her anxiety increased

1852
01:21:18,748 --> 01:21:21,751
because Lee Gun-mi was unreachable again.

1853
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:23,420
At 9:50 p.m.,

1854
01:21:23,503 --> 01:21:27,215
the time they agreed to meet,
An Dancer left the meeting venue.

1855
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:30,176
However, instead of going to Club Slam,
which is where they agreed to meet,

1856
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:33,388
she saw Lee Gun-mi
heading into Ha Gold Spoon's office

1857
01:21:33,471 --> 01:21:35,599
and followed her inside.

1858
01:21:35,682 --> 01:21:40,395
What she discovered after Lee Gun-mi left
shocked her.

1859
01:21:40,478 --> 01:21:44,107
Lee Gun-mi had been selling
not only the VIP drug party photos

1860
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:48,028
but also An Dancer's information
to the organization in China.

1861
01:21:48,111 --> 01:21:50,322
She planned to keep
the 1.5 billion won for herself

1862
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:55,201
and blame everything on An Dancer
if anything went wrong.

1863
01:21:55,869 --> 01:21:59,331
Now livid, An Dancer
removed the flash drive mid-upload

1864
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:01,541
and shut down the computer.

1865
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:04,085
Just then, Lee Gun-mi returned,

1866
01:22:04,169 --> 01:22:07,547
snatched the flash drive from An Dancer,

1867
01:22:07,631 --> 01:22:09,591
and sprinted off.

1868
01:22:09,674 --> 01:22:11,509
She chased Lee Gun-mi

1869
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:15,764
down the dead-end alley between Club Slam
and Gangster Whole Chicken.

1870
01:22:15,847 --> 01:22:17,182
The enraged An Dancer

1871
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:19,976
slammed Lee Gun-mi against the wall

1872
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:21,937
and grabbed the flash drive.

1873
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,980
When Lee Gun-mi lunged at her,

1874
01:22:24,064 --> 01:22:26,316
she shoved her away,
knocking her to the ground,

1875
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:28,818
then began strangling her
with all her might.

1876
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:32,822
Consumed by extreme anger,
An Dancer lost control

1877
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:35,367
and struck Lee Gun-mi's head
multiple times

1878
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:37,911
with the nearby belt stanchion.

1879
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:42,916
When she finally came to her senses,
Lee Gun-mi was already dead.

1880
01:22:42,999 --> 01:22:47,045
An Dancer scrambled to find a way
to hide the body,

1881
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:49,673
panicking over the accidental killing.

1882
01:22:49,756 --> 01:22:52,425
Her thoughts
immediately went back to the fight

1883
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:54,552
between Park Chicken and Lee Gun-mi.

1884
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:58,974
Just as she decided
to move the body to the empty lot

1885
01:22:59,057 --> 01:23:00,433
to frame Park Chicken,

1886
01:23:00,517 --> 01:23:03,895
Kim Club called her.

1887
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:07,774
The water leak detector
malfunctioned again, as usual,

1888
01:23:07,857 --> 01:23:09,859
and she was ordered to fix it.

1889
01:23:09,943 --> 01:23:10,986
After quickly hiding the body

1890
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:14,239
at the chicken restaurant's
recycling station,

1891
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:17,659
she fixed the water leak detector
at the club,

1892
01:23:17,742 --> 01:23:21,371
only to realize 20 minutes had passed
since she left the meeting.

1893
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:23,331
To avoid raising suspicion,

1894
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:25,917
she thought it was best to cast her vote
at the meeting first,

1895
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:30,171
then return later to deal with the body.

1896
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:33,258
To come up with a reason
to leave the venue again,

1897
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:36,511
she punctured a small hole
in the soju bottle cap

1898
01:23:36,594 --> 01:23:38,805
and hung it upside down
on the hand sanitizer holder,

1899
01:23:38,888 --> 01:23:45,103
allowing it to drip and eventually trigger
the water leak detector.

1900
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:48,606
After returning to the meeting
and casting her vote,

1901
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:51,067
the water leak notification
finally came in.

1902
01:23:51,151 --> 01:23:54,320
As expected,
Kim Club ordered her to go fix it again,

1903
01:23:54,404 --> 01:23:57,866
giving her a reason to leave the venue.

1904
01:23:57,949 --> 01:24:01,119
She quickly fixed the water leak detector
at Club Slam,

1905
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:03,913
put the soju bottle and hand sanitizer
back in place,

1906
01:24:03,997 --> 01:24:06,750
and went to move Lee Gun-mi's body.

1907
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:09,586
She couldn't pass the police station
next to Hansim Pocha

1908
01:24:09,669 --> 01:24:12,714
because an officer
was stationed outside all night.

1909
01:24:12,797 --> 01:24:15,550
The alley between Hansim Pocha
and Goldspoon Building

1910
01:24:15,633 --> 01:24:17,594
was blocked due to flooding,

1911
01:24:17,677 --> 01:24:22,432
and the Sensibility Bar
had a CCTV installed outside.

1912
01:24:22,515 --> 01:24:23,516
Just then,

1913
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:27,103
she recalled the secret passageway
she had found out about

1914
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:29,147
while fleeing a police crackdown
at Sensibility Bar.

1915
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:32,567
She left the club and headed to the body,

1916
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:35,445
planning to move the body
through that passageway.

1917
01:24:35,987 --> 01:24:37,155
On her way,

1918
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:40,408
she noticed the flood restriction sign
that had been set aside.

1919
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:44,829
The roadblock had been lifted
as the rain had eased,

1920
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:49,626
and the sign had wheels
and enough space inside,

1921
01:24:49,709 --> 01:24:52,796
making it ideal for transporting the body.

1922
01:24:52,879 --> 01:24:54,672
Using the sign as a makeshift cart,

1923
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:56,591
she quickly loaded
Lee Gun-mi's body onto it

1924
01:24:56,674 --> 01:25:00,720
and went through the now-unblocked alley
to reach the empty lot.

1925
01:25:00,804 --> 01:25:02,555
After dumping the body,

1926
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,808
she searched Lee Gun-mi's body
for her phone

1927
01:25:04,891 --> 01:25:08,728
to leave a call record
and create an alibi, but couldn't find it.

1928
01:25:08,812 --> 01:25:12,482
All she could do was leave a missed call,

1929
01:25:12,565 --> 01:25:14,234
then return to the meeting

1930
01:25:14,317 --> 01:25:16,152
after putting the flood restriction sign
back in place.

1931
01:25:16,736 --> 01:25:19,489
She then told Kim Club
that it took her a while

1932
01:25:19,572 --> 01:25:22,367
to fix the water leak detector.

1933
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:25,995
Hoping the heavy rain
would wash away any evidence,

1934
01:25:26,079 --> 01:25:29,666
she dreamed of the perfect crime

1935
01:25:29,749 --> 01:25:32,961
with Park Chicken taking the blame.

1936
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:39,175
HEOYOUNG LAND'S 1ST ANNIVERSARY

1937
01:25:39,259 --> 01:25:41,261
Today's game is going to be huge.

1938
01:25:41,344 --> 01:25:44,556
This is the ultimate betting game,
open only to the chosen few.

1939
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:46,266
This place is for VIPs only.

1940
01:25:49,102 --> 01:25:50,520
Bong-cheon!

1941
01:25:50,603 --> 01:25:52,564
What the heck is this?

1942
01:25:52,647 --> 01:25:54,107
I'm going to kill whoever did it.

1943
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:55,525
Where's the gun?

1944
01:25:55,608 --> 01:25:56,776
You want to be thrown into jail?

1945
01:25:58,278 --> 01:25:59,988
I'll show you!

1946
01:26:01,531 --> 01:26:02,740
Quiet.

1947
01:26:05,201 --> 01:26:06,452
Freeze!

1948
01:26:06,536 --> 01:26:07,579
-My gosh!
-What was that?

1949
01:26:08,204 --> 01:26:09,205
What the heck?

1950
01:26:55,835 --> 01:27:00,840
