1
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,635
It's suspicious for sure.
Can we check his Agucci purse?

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,470
-Give me this!
-Let's see what's inside.

3
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:13,888
Come on, you're jumping the gun.

4
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,056
MURDER ON THE HANGANG BRIDGE II

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,267
-What's that?
-What's in there?

6
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,185
A LETTER?

7
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,478
-Is there anything else?
-No.

8
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,815
The letter. That's most important.

9
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,275
Are you kidding me? Look at this.

10
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,776
Are you kidding me? Look at this.

11
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,571
What the heck?

12
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,322
Whose…

13
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,241
-That's the smoking gun.
-Whose…

14
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:34,951
There's a name on the back. "Buddy Jr."

15
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,203
"Buddy Jr."?
They even gave the baby a nickname.

16
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,288
"Buddy Jr."?

17
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,414
The sonogram.

18
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:40,540
That freaked everyone out.

19
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:43,376
I figured he would've had
his one true love,

20
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,337
but I didn't have enough information
to pinpoint who the woman was.

21
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,007
Whose sonogram is this?

22
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,383
Who is it? Who wrote it?

23
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,053
Oh my gosh. Guys, don't be shocked.

24
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,471
I'll read this, so brace yourselves.

25
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:59,934
"To symbolize the time we spent together,
I gift you this watch."

26
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,479
"I hope you're not mad
that I splurged a little."

27
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,855
"That's just how much I love you."

28
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:07,734
"October 3, 2020."

29
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,819
You remember what happened then, right?

30
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,197
The car accident on the Hangang Bridge.

31
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,324
"Yours…

32
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:18,912
Second Marriage."

33
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:21,664
"…Second Marriage."

34
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,376
-What the…
-I knew it.

35
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,462
-Does this mean…
-Is it…

36
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,546
No way.

37
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,965
-I feel you. I would've killed him too.
-It can't be.

38
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,177
Lee Second Marriage, Yo-sep's second wife.

39
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,137
Fate must've been playing
a cruel joke on me

40
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,681
because she passed away

41
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,558
in the fire that followed the car crash.

42
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:44,479
Cho Yo-sep killed her
and staged it as an accident

43
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,897
to claim the insurance payout.

44
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,898
You're right.

45
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,818
The woman was pregnant with Buddy's child,

46
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:50,944
but Yo-sep killed her.

47
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:54,030
How did your friend
steal Second Marriage from you?

48
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,116
-He didn't steal her from me.
-Did you set them up?

49
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,201
I set them up on a blind date.

50
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,911
Why did you do that if you loved her?

51
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,413
-It wasn't like that.
-Then it was after you set them up.

52
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,748
It was indeed after that.

53
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,250
-One day,
-One day?

54
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,626
I was sick.

55
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,045
And she stopped by with homemade food.

56
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,797
That's when I fell for her.

57
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,175
It felt like I was seeing her
in a whole new light.

58
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,762
Gradually, something special
bloomed between us.

59
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,973
Hold on. What's this?

60
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,474
Is this the watch mentioned in the note?

61
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,227
-That must be it!
-That's…

62
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,188
That's Yo-sep's. He's wearing his watch.

63
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,649
"The gift you left behind."

64
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,484
-He wore the watch.
-That must be it.

65
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,653
-"October 12, 2020."
-The watch he's wearing

66
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,739
-was originally meant for Buddy.
-It's supposed to be yours, Buddy.

67
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,450
-"October 12, 2020." His blood would boil.
-Of course.

68
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,619
He posted that after killing her himself.

69
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,414
-Oh gosh, this is giving me a headache.
-I guess we'll wrap things up early today.

70
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,166
-Oh jeez.
-We won't have to search the river.

71
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,961
If Buddy hadn't killed him,
I would've ended him myself.

72
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:52,922
She was carrying his baby
he didn't know existed.

73
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,466
What he thought was an accidental death

74
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,968
turned out to be murder.

75
00:02:57,051 --> 00:03:01,431
Yo-sep claimed the watch
Buddy's true love got for him.

76
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,309
His rage and sense of betrayal
would be unimaginable.

77
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:07,937
I assume there would be
a deep-seated grudge.

78
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,107
Let's go back to October 2020,
right after Second Marriage passed away.

79
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,984
Did you believe it was an accident then?

80
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,360
I did.

81
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,446
When did you find out
it wasn't an accident?

82
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,282
His wife's body wasn't even cold yet,

83
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,784
but the punk began
showing off his new watch.

84
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,205
Considering how both his marriages
ended in a similar way,

85
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,207
I began to suspect
it couldn't have been a coincidence.

86
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,667
Then I found out

87
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,962
he had collected huge insurance payouts
from the two incidents.

88
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,798
I thought that if he had been
behind Second Marriage's accident,

89
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,383
-I couldn't let it slide.
-Of course not.

90
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,261
That's why I deliberately set him up
with Park So-yun.

91
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,971
So that she could dig into him?

92
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,431
She wrote on the Big Score Community

93
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:46,517
that she was desperate
and willing to do anything.

94
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,019
-Was she after a big score?
-Yeah.

95
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:52,523
I asked her to find proof
that Yo-sep had killed his wives,

96
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,900
and So-yun said

97
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,861
she had found a document
that laid out Yo-sep's plan.

98
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,698
-That--
-Showing his plan to kill Second Marriage?

99
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,158
Yeah, his murder plan.

100
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,036
I was going to get that document

101
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,038
and have him thrown behind bars.

102
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:07,956
That was my plan.

103
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,792
So-yun said
she'd leave the garage door open

104
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,086
so I could come and get it.

105
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,881
-It was around 2:40.
-A.M.?

106
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,467
Yeah. I was at his place
looking for the document

107
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,762
when I came across that letter
among Second Marriage's belongings.

108
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,097
Not long after,

109
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,432
the guy who was supposed to
be working the night shift

110
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,601
came back home about five minutes later.

111
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,603
-He came home?
-What time did you call him?

112
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,896
Was it 2:40 a.m.?

113
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,606
After talking to Neighbor on the phone,

114
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,899
-Cho Yo-sep--
-We didn't talk.

115
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,194
I asked to speak to him.
Look, I called at 2:39 a.m.

116
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,988
I called, but they said he wasn't there.

117
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,950
That means Cho Yo-sep made his way home
to the garage during that time.

118
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,577
He asked what I was doing there so late.

119
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:51,207
I made up an excuse,
saying So-yun had asked me for a favor.

120
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,961
-That's very vague.
-Was it around 2:50 a.m.?

121
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,547
Yeah. And then I returned to the house.

122
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,550
You left when Yo-sep came home
but returned later on?

123
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,718
Yeah, because of that letter.

124
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,804
After reading about the watch,

125
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:08,224
I realized it was mine
and came back for it.

126
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,851
Was the car in the garage
when you returned?

127
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:13,521
I'm not sure. The front door was open,
so I entered that way.

128
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,065
-All right. Look, Detective.
-The front door was open.

129
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,110
Regardless of whether Buddy
just told us the truth,

130
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:22,947
someone drove the car,
be it Cho Yo-sep or Park So-yun,

131
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,907
all the way to the Hangang Bridge.

132
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,617
Here's what we need to note.

133
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,911
Park So-yun was in the passenger seat,

134
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,372
-and someone else was driving.
-Right.

135
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,083
-I don't think Yo-sep was the driver.
-Me neither.

136
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,918
Because he had to
have been hit by the car.

137
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:40,423
I'd actually like to check out the car
on the bridge again.

138
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,800
-I didn't get a good look at it.
-Let's go up there.

139
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,094
-Shall we?
-My hunches are good, you see.

140
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,681
There's blood here.

141
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,391
The car definitely hit someone.

142
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,352
-Did you see the bloodstains?
-I did.

143
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,354
-Hold on.
-What is it?

144
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,566
I see how it happened.

145
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,360
Yo-sep was standing there

146
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,863
when the car rammed into him.

147
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,573
Exactly. That's right.

148
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:08,493
I say that because I see blood
on that thing over there.

149
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,161
-The guardrail?
-Exactly.

150
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,038
There's blood on the guardrail too.

151
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,164
BLOOD ON THE FRONT BUMPER AND GUARDRAIL

152
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:17,001
The blood on the guardrail
suggests the body fell into the river.

153
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,213
A third person must've driven the car
in the first place

154
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:23,132
-with Park So-yun in the passenger seat.
-Right.

155
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,258
They killed two birds with one stone.

156
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,510
By ramming into the guardrail,

157
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,136
-Exactly.
-Cho Yo-sep, who was standing here,

158
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,888
gets hit by the car,
falls into the river, and dies.

159
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,556
Park So-yun,
who was in the passenger seat,

160
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,308
gets thrown out the windshield and dies.

161
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,518
As for the driver,

162
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,812
they likely went down the bridge

163
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,606
to hide Cho Yo-sep's body.

164
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:42,318
Cho Yo-sep's body had to be hidden
for the death to appear accidental.

165
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,988
Because the driver wanted to make it
look like one of his insurance scams.

166
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,573
THE PLAN WAS TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE

167
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,701
A FAULTY AIRBAG AND SEAT BELT

168
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,704
CAUSED CHO YO-SEP'S INSURANCE SCAM
TO BACKFIRE ON HIM

169
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,624
So it has to be someone who knows
that Cho Yo-sep has been killing his wives

170
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:59,961
-to collect insurance payouts.
-Someone who knows about that, yes.

171
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:03,631
And someone close enough
to call him out over the phone.

172
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,300
And someone who's good enough at swimming

173
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,262
-To hide the body, yes.
-to go into the water and hide his body.

174
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,681
If the culprit had staged the scene
after being in the water,

175
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,684
that could explain the water
on the driver's seat.

176
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:18,187
-Right.
-However, the back seat is also wet.

177
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,982
I can't figure out
what they could've done back there.

178
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,484
They must've had a reason
to go back there.

179
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,705
-Hold on.
-Oh jeez, you startled me.

180
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,331
-Hold on.
-Oh jeez, you startled me.

181
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,377
What's that?

182
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,755
-What's that?
-Isn't that Hubby?

183
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,090
A PUPPY KEYCHAIN?

184
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,384
ONE FROM MARRY'S SALON?

185
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,846
-Where did you find that?
-I swear I know nothing about it.

186
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,055
Look at this!

187
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:54,932
Where was it?

188
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,100
In the car!

189
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,144
-On the car floor?
-Right here!

190
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,354
-Hold on a second.
-Hold on.

191
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,606
Hubby, no!

192
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,191
-You can't deny that's not Hubby.
-Hubby, no!

193
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,775
-Hubby!
-Tell us the truth now.

194
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,068
I will, so please give him back.

195
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,111
-Start talking.
-Give him back.

196
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,196
Start talking first.

197
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,407
I'm an animal lover too.
I don't want to do this.

198
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,243
Yo-sep took me out

199
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,037
for a few drives before.

200
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,998
-I think that's when I dropped it.
-That's when you dropped it?

201
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,708
-In this car, huh?
-I had no idea it'd be here.

202
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:21,792
You didn't know?

203
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,711
-I didn't.
-Check her purse.

204
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,463
I think it fell off this purse.

205
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,173
Hold Hubby. He's our hostage.

206
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,674
Let me check your purse.

207
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,093
-Just let me take a look.
-Please give my Hubby back.

208
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,179
-With this box cutter…
-Give him to me.

209
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,263
Unbelievable.

210
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,640
-What is it?
-What's that?

211
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,100
A syringe?

212
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,603
Anesthetic for animals!

213
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,521
Anesthetic?

214
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,523
-Explain this.
-Take a look for yourself.

215
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,696
Did you just find a phone?

216
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,868
UNDER THE DRIVER'S SEAT

217
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,413
CHO YO-SEP'S PHONE

218
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,456
-Whose is it?
-Whose is it?

219
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,083
-Yo-sep's.
-Yo-sep's?

220
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,669
-We've hit the jackpot.
-Where was it?

221
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,170
-Here we go.
-Under the driver's seat.

222
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,548
-You're good at finding stuff.
-Let's check the call history.

223
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,466
Who's "Masery"?

224
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,678
-"Masery"?
-Let me see.

225
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,096
-Isn't it you?
-It's not me.

226
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,055
It's not me.

227
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,723
-It's you.
-You're Masery.

228
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,934
-Marry, Masery.
-Marry Zzong Zzong.

229
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:20,851
Only you don't get it.

230
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,021
-See? I knew something was off.
-Everyone here gets it but you!

231
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,982
Wait, the woman
who cut off the guy's feet?

232
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,111
-Like the character in Misery?
-Did you also…

233
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,696
-Did you also cripple Noh Two Feet?
-What?

234
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,740
-Did you injure him to wheel him around?
-Just a second.

235
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,159
-Not so fast.
-Noh Two Feet.

236
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,578
Are you saying I'm Masery?

237
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,454
-Masery.
-Masery.

238
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,665
-We all get it except you.
-Should we check her name tag?

239
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,874
-No way.
-Maybe she cuts off their feet

240
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,002
-when they try to leave her.
-My name's Marry.

241
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,753
Let's check his voicemails.

242
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,005
Voicemail box.

243
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,339
There's one. Turn the volume up.

244
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,507
FROM THE DAY BEFORE THE INCIDENT

245
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,718
I need to tell you something.

246
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,595
I need to tell you something.

247
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,555
Come to the salon.

248
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,515
I'll be waiting.

249
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,309
-Come over here.
-Come over here.

250
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,351
-Come here.
-Why?

251
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,520
-You called him to the salon on the 28th.
-To the salon, huh?

252
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,771
I had something to tell him.

253
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,939
Which was?

254
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,984
-Well…
-Did you meet up?

255
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:11,944
What did you say to him?

256
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,864
You know,
just the usual stuff between couples.

257
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,825
-Be straight with me.
-You sounded angry in the voicemail.

258
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,036
-Not at all. I just had something to say.
-Be straight with me.

259
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,912
-Look at what I'm holding.
-I had something to say.

260
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,539
You're acting suspicious, Masery.

261
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:25,708
Detective.

262
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,753
I secured a key witness statement.

263
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,421
-AD, what do you have for me?
-All of a sudden?

264
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:34,467
I have a witness statement
from Park So-yun's neighbor.

265
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,926
I see. Let's hear it.

266
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,679
-Park So-yun and Cho Yo-sep's car
-What about it?

267
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,973
was seen at around 3 a.m.

268
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,058
-Around 3 a.m.?
-Yes.

269
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,603
-Who was driving?
-Cho Yo-sep was behind the wheel.

270
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,980
And Park So-yun
was in the front passenger seat.

271
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,024
-At 3 a.m.?
-Yes. At 3 a.m.

272
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:50,941
Around 3 a.m.

273
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,486
That's around the time of the accident.

274
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,863
-Cho Yo-sep was driving?
-Yes, he was behind the wheel.

275
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,366
So that confirms Cho Yo-sep was driving.

276
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,742
That's right.

277
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,118
-They were both in the car?
-Yes.

278
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,079
-Was it just them in the car?
-Yes.

279
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,665
-Today's case is very puzzling.
-Cho Yo-sep was driving?

280
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,875
Cho Yo-sep was driving.

281
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,253
Hold on. Cho Yo-sep was behind the wheel?

282
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,340
Then the killer
wouldn't have walked to the bridge

283
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,717
or arrived in a different car.

284
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,637
I suppose the killer
could've been hiding in the car

285
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,515
and then appeared to strike.

286
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,433
-Can we open the trunk?
-Yeah, let's.

287
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,559
Sure.

288
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,686
HOW DID THE CULPRIT GET HERE?

289
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,728
To the left.

290
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,442
Was the trunk empty?

291
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,777
Yes, it was empty.

292
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,654
But there's dirt here.

293
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:40,074
-Not just there. There's dirt here too.
-Where?

294
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,160
Here.

295
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,205
-There's dirt here too.
-Yes, there is.

296
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,289
So, from the back…

297
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,501
There's a trail of dirt
leading to the trunk.

298
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,920
Could this be a possibility?

299
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,507
What if the killer was in the trunk?

300
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,260
-There's dirt here.
-Right.

301
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,845
What if three people were in the car?

302
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,389
There must've been
three passengers to begin with.

303
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,683
But how did the killer
get out of the trunk?

304
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,484
A SKI HATCH ACCESSIBLE FROM THE BACK SEAT

305
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,237
We open the hatch to fit the golf bags in.

306
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,698
-No one can fit through there.
-That's not possible.

307
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,993
Can't you open the trunk from the inside?

308
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,202
Why don't you go in?

309
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,454
-Me?
-Yes, get in there.

310
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,497
-I think it'll open if you pull this.
-Pull what?

311
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,041
-It's a task for our kind Mr. Neighbor.
-Okay, fine.

312
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,626
-You're practically an angel.
-Goodness.

313
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,420
-Watch your head.
-Slowly.

314
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,298
If he's the killer, it'll feel strange
since he'd be reenacting the murder.

315
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,466
Exactly. If he's the killer,

316
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,510
-he'd be retracing his steps from earlier.
-He must think he's screwed.

317
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,762
-Right, that he's doomed.
-I'm ready.

318
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,221
-I'll close it.
-We'll shut the trunk.

319
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,556
The key's still in the hole.

320
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,102
WELL?

321
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,228
-I can open it.
-It opens.

322
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,149
-I can open it.
-It opens.

323
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,066
-It opens.
-See?

324
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,110
-It can be opened?
-The killer was in the trunk.

325
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,446
It opens from the inside.

326
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:04,366
I believe finding Cho Yo-sep's body

327
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,035
will give us some answers.

328
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,787
Why don't we look around?

329
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,498
Sure. I'll search the water down there.

330
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,833
Sounds good.
You can dive in, Mr. Neighbor.

331
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,003
THE MOST SUSPICIOUS ITEM: THE WATER TAXI

332
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,922
Can we catch a ride in the taxi?

333
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,131
The water taxi?

334
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:23,093
It's after hours, so I can't operate it.

335
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,846
-Should we look at the navigation system?
-Wasn't there a place he frequented?

336
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,556
Right, you said there was a place
he went often.

337
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,974
RECENT DESTINATIONS

338
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,186
WHILE THE WATER TAXI
IS BEING THOROUGHLY SEARCHED

00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,689
KIM DETECTIVE SEARCHES
THE UNOCCUPIED HWANG BILLIONAIRE'S OFFICE

340
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,778
A DOCUMENT ENVELOPE?

341
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,321
Hwang Billionaire.

342
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,241
What did you have hidden so well?

343
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,581
Everyone, are you busy?

344
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,335
-Sorry?
-Let's all take a look

345
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,920
at what Mr. Billionaire has.

346
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,089
-Who?
-Mr. Billionaire.

347
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,216
-There hasn't been much evidence
-Mr. Billionaire, come on.

348
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,133
against him so far,

349
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,304
but I found three suspicious photos
and a contract.

350
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,430
3 PHOTOS AND A CONTRACT

351
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,640
Sure. Take a look.

352
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:13,185
This looks like the original copy
of the contract

353
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,604
Cho Yo-sep used
to blackmail Mr. Billionaire.

354
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,647
-It is.
-Right?

355
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,816
The contract signed by Cha Contract,

356
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,944
the person he hired
to stage a water rescue.

357
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,322
And these are photos
of the Hangang Bridge.

358
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,660
Who's this?

359
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:30,995
Is he Cha Contract?

360
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,331
And this here is a photo of you,
Mr. Billionaire.

361
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,709
That's obviously me.

362
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:40,880
Why are they all kneeling
on the exact same spot?

363
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,425
-They're tying their shoelaces.
-Why are they tying their shoelaces here?

364
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,886
-What do these photos mean?
-What do they mean?

365
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:50,472
I found these at the house.

366
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,640
-These photos?
-Yes.

367
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,726
-At whose house?
-Cho Yo-sep's.

368
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,477
You found these at Cho Yo-sep's house?

369
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,395
Yes.

370
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,023
Are you saying Cho Yo-sep took these?

371
00:14:59,106 --> 00:14:59,940
Yes.

372
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,401
He wouldn't stop threatening me,

373
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,153
but I couldn't keep paying him off.

374
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,364
So I went to his house
to get the original copy of the contract.

375
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,866
What time did you go to his house?

376
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,117
At 2:30 a.m.

377
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,493
When he wasn't home?

378
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,454
I knocked on the front door,

379
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,205
but no one seemed to be home.

380
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,167
I noticed that the garage door was open,

381
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,045
so I entered the house
through the side door by the car.

382
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,213
-The car was there, but no one was around?
-The car…

383
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,381
Was the car there?

384
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,300
The car was there,

385
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:29,136
but I was focused on getting
what I came for.

386
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,722
The two people
who could've gotten into the trunk

387
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,974
are Billionaire and Buddy.

388
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,060
-We know they were at the house.
-That's right.

389
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,520
When did you say you were
at the house again, Mr. Buddy?

390
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,481
I first went there at 2:40 a.m.

391
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,984
-Billionaire was there first. At 2:30 a.m.
-He went first. When did you go back?

392
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,362
A little after…

393
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,781
3:05 a.m.

394
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,450
-Maybe around 3:10 or 3:15 a.m.
-Is there nothing here?

395
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,661
-So, 2:30 a.m., 2:40 a.m., and 3:05 a.m.
-Right.

396
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,663
-Mr. Billionaire.
-Yes?

397
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,748
Could you give me the password for this?

398
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,750
I don't know what the password is.

399
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,835
-You don't?
-No, I don't.

400
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,629
-Really?
-I don't know what it is.

401
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,131
I'm afraid you'll have to find it.

402
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,259
HE'S NO PUSHOVER

403
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,594
What's this website? "Darkscene"?

404
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,888
The name alone is suspicious.

405
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,058
"Darkscene," huh?
He must be dealing something sketchy.

406
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,476
He won't tell me his password.

407
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,062
-Don't they keep it in places like this?
-Come on, don't be like that.

408
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,272
"Darkscene"?

409
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,734
-The password should be somewhere here.
-It should be written somewhere.

410
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,653
I wonder what the password is.

411
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,243
Mr. Hwang Billionaire.

412
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,248
What the…

413
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,918
-Unbelievable.
-For goodness' sake.

414
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,753
What's this?

415
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,465
THE BACK OF THE DISPLAY CABINET OPENS UP?

416
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,425
What the heck?

417
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,051
-What is it?
-What's going on?

418
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,221
IN THE DISPLAY CABINET
AT HWANG BILLIONAIRE'S OFFICE

419
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,389
What's this?

420
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,516
A HIDDEN SPACE

421
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,517
-What is it?
-What's going on?

422
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,315
HANDLE WITH CARE
HIGHLY TOXIC

423
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,067
Hwang Billionaire!

424
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,652
CLUE OVERLOAD

425
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,654
We got our guy!

426
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,240
-Hwang Billionaire's our bad guy!
-Oh, come on.

427
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,616
What's this?

428
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:15,993
-It's a chemical.
-What is it?

429
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,119
-No wonder.
-Formalin!

430
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,954
-I knew there had to be more to him.
-I know.

431
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,498
-We've got memory cards here.
-This explains the dark web.

432
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,459
What are these?
There's something written on these.

433
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,920
-Let's check them over there.
-Suspect me all you want.

434
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,506
-Wait, what the heck? This is a finger!
-What?

435
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,799
Suspect me all you want.

436
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,342
Wait, what the heck? This is a finger!

437
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,343
What?

438
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,220
These are all fingers!

439
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,890
-Is he insane?
-Are you serious? This is a finger.

440
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,017
-Do all tubes have a finger in them?
-They do.

441
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,310
-That lunatic.
-Wait…

442
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,353
Five fingers… No, ten.

443
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,480
A COLLECTION OF FINGERS

444
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,106
Remember the framed photo?

445
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,816
The one with just the hands.

446
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,944
Do you have a hand fetish or something?

447
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,613
-What's going on?
-Hold on.

448
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,989
What's your deal?

449
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,741
I'm not the only one
with a hobby like this.

450
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,786
You have your affairs and gambling habits,
so what's the big deal?

451
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,287
How is this the same as gambling?

452
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,872
-I'm not into anything bad.
-Fine.

453
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,749
I like collecting fingers.

454
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,001
-No way.
-Seriously?

455
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,296
The villains we have encountered so far

456
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,715
were nothing compared to this guy.

457
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:16,136
He had a bizarre and morbid fascination
with such a disturbing subject.

458
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,474
It never occurred to me
that he'd be a psychopath of this degree.

459
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,975
It was unexpected.

460
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,062
-What's this? "Exciting Screams."
-I mean, listen.

461
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,815
"Strong Old Man."
"Office Worker with Pretty Hands."

462
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,275
-Fine, keep going.
-"Giant Mole on the Back of the Hand."

463
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,777
"Muscular University Student."

464
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,612
-Shall we check one of the cards?
-"Midnight Swim."

465
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,615
-That's from 2021.
-"March 29, 2021."

466
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,575
-"Delivery Gone Wrong."
-"Delivery Gone Wrong"?

467
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,743
What's this?

468
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,913
A BROKEN GLASS TUBE?

469
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,124
What's this back here?

470
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,128
Right here, "g9v2…"

471
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,130
-The password!
-Is that the password?

472
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,756
-Nine.
-G, nine.

473
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,007
-What's after V?
-V, E.

474
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:54,925
Got it.

475
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:55,884
-M.
-M.

476
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,302
-M
-Seven.

477
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,721
-Seven.
-X.

478
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,598
-This is one complicated password. X.
-Tell me about it.

479
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,641
-Three.
-Three.

480
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,351
-Q, one.
-Q, one.

481
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,186
Z, eight.

482
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,855
-Eight.
-That's it.

483
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:08,814
He kept it deeply hidden.

484
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,358
-It worked.
-We're in.

485
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,276
CHAT HISTORY?

486
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,193
"Transaction request."

487
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,739
"Location, Hangang Bridge.
Price, 300 million won."

488
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,074
"Retrieval complete."

489
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,450
What's this?

490
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,578
What is this, you shady billionaire?

491
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,579
Do you have to ask?

492
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,331
I bought those fingers.

493
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,958
You bought fingers for 300 million won?

494
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,877
There were dates written on them.

495
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,129
Scroll down all the way to the bottom.

496
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,256
-March 29, 2021.
-March 29th.

497
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,216
"Arrived on time. Task complete."

498
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,509
-"Has the target arrived?"
-"One male adult."

499
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,677
"One male adult"?

500
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,262
"Excellent swimmer."

501
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,389
"Requesting a job on a specific target."

502
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,266
The target must be Cho Yo-sep!

503
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,977
"One male adult. 2 a.m.
Excellent swimmer."

504
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,605
Whoever this was arrived on time
and completed the task.

505
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,482
-Check if they match these dates.
-That was sent at 2:36 a.m.

506
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,401
-Look.
-March 29, 2021.

507
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,570
This was the most recent one.

508
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,864
Doesn't this mean
he only collected the finger?

509
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,116
Cho Yo-sep's body
is likely missing a finger.

510
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,577
-Right.
-One of his fingers is here instead.

511
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:07,623
-Right, if it's been chopped off.
-Did Billionaire have someone kill Yo-sep?

512
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,541
-"Squeaky Clean."
-I must admit

513
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,128
being ostracized within the company

514
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,130
really took a toll on me.

515
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,842
There's that moment

516
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,137
when people take their final breaths.

517
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,972
I feel a thrill in watching such moments.

518
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,724
See? I told you he was a psychopath.

519
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,894
-He's a psychopath.
-But as for these fingers,

520
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,563
-I didn't cut them myself.
-You keep them as souvenirs?

521
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,814
Yes, that's right.

522
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,275
I don't just keep the fingers.

523
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,401
There are videos as well.

524
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,570
You have recordings
of people's last moments?

525
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,573
-I keep snuff films with me.
-Snuff films.

526
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,034
-I keep them too.
-He's a complete nutjob.

527
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,453
HE COLLECTED FINGERS AS SOUVENIRS
AND FOOTAGE OF PEOPLE'S DYING MOMENTS

528
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:49,039
After hiring a hitman
to carry out a murder,

529
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,500
I go retrieve the souvenirs
from the storm drain.

530
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,294
The fingers and the snuff films.

531
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,922
The storm drain?

532
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,717
So the photo captured the hitman
placing them in the storm drain.

533
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,470
-They weren't tying their shoelaces.
-That was a cover.

534
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,305
Yes, while pretending to walk past it.

535
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,849
-You retrieved your souvenirs.
-That's how I collected them.

536
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,018
What's this about Squeaky Clean
completing a task?

537
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:14,106
Anyway, I wanted Cho Yo-sep dead.

538
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:17,192
So, I told him to meet me
at the Hangang River.

539
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,319
-I called him.
-On the 29th?

540
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,698
No, the day before.
We set a time and date.

541
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,449
But I didn't show up

542
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,118
-at the agreed time.
-Instead,

543
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,120
-you arranged for a hit on the dark web.
-That's right.

544
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,913
That way, I had time
to go find the contract.

545
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,374
-When was the time you agreed to meet?
-2:30 a.m.

546
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:35,544
I didn't think Cho Yo-sep had any idea
about this particular hobby of mine.

547
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,922
But he had evidence
of my ties with the contractor

548
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,883
and the collection I kept.

549
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:43,760
So it made me wonder

550
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,013
if he'd show if I called him up
when he was already aware

551
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,265
that I was working with a contractor
to collect such things.

552
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,934
But the hitman texted me,
saying that the task was completed.

553
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,060
ARRIVED ON TIME, TASK COMPLETE

554
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,479
After reading that,
I left for the Hangang River immediately

555
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,231
and waited near the Hangang Bridge.

556
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,441
Once I was notified

557
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,901
that the task was complete
and the goods were in the storm drain,

558
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,280
I picked up my souvenirs
and headed back to my office.

559
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:05,907
I got back, but here's the catch.

560
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,160
Yo-sep should've been
the victim of my arrangement, right?

561
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,829
-But it wasn't him who died.
-It wasn't?

562
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:14,458
-I ran into Yo-sep around that time.
-The photo from earlier. Look at it.

563
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,625
DELIVERY GONE WRONG

564
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,544
-Which one?
-This one, "Delivery Gone Wrong."

565
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,963
-This is from "Delivery Gone Wrong."
-Right.

566
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,591
Oh, someone else died.

567
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,384
I wanted Cho Yo-sep dead,
but I didn't get what I wanted.

568
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,470
-So I'm not the killer.
-Who did the hitman kill?

569
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:27,804
-Who did the hitman take out?
-Who did they kill?

570
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:28,847
I don't know either.

571
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,474
-Who in the world did they kill?
-I have no idea.

572
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:34,019
-I tried to have Yo-sep killed but failed.
-An innocent person died instead.

573
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,605
Did an innocent person die
instead of Cho Yo-sep?

574
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:40,359
-Anyway, a random man got murdered.
-He died, yes.

575
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,862
-And you have that random man's finger.
-That's right.

576
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,572
But seeing this still gave you a thrill.

577
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,367
I'd appreciate it
if you were gentle with that.

578
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,952
-Either way, you're off to prison.
-Right.

579
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,121
How so?
I'm not the one who killed Cho Yo-sep.

580
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,082
Soliciting murder is a serious felony.

581
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,459
You had nine people killed.

582
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,504
That's none of your concern.
I'll have my lawyers take care of it.

583
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:04,800
Then, Cho Yo-sep
must've been up on the bridge

584
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,885
looking for evidence in the storm drain

585
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,470
when the car rammed into him.

586
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,222
HIT WHILE CHECKING THE STORM DRAIN?

587
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,557
Maybe he was looking inside,
wondering what was in there.

588
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:16,728
-What time did you go to the storm drain?
-Where's this storm drain?

589
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,647
I came here at 3 a.m.

590
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,689
-Where?
-The bridge?

591
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,567
-Yes, where we agreed to meet.
-He was at the scene on the bridge then.

592
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,486
Had the car already crashed or not?

593
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,529
It hadn't.

594
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:26,655
-At 3 a.m.?
-That's right.

595
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,281
-I--
-You didn't see the car?

596
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,617
I took my souvenirs
and went straight back to my office.

597
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,702
-Think of the exact time.
-It was 3:10 a.m.

598
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:33,912
-Okay, 3:10 a.m.
-Yes.

599
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,581
So there was no car accident
until 3:10 a.m.

600
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,958
Yo-sep and So-yun's car

601
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,293
arrived on the Hangang Bridge
sometime after 3:10 a.m.

602
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:43,130
-Then, the incident occurred.
-Exactly.

603
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,674
Why did Cho Yo-sep drive to the bridge

604
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,927
sometime after 3:10 a.m.?

605
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,055
The car crashed into the guardrail
near the storm drain.

606
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:56,017
Those who knew the storm drain served

607
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,353
as a drop-off point for deals

608
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,857
are just Cho Yo-sep and Hwang Billionaire.

609
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,734
Billionaire admitted
that he wanted Yo-sep dead

610
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,027
and that he put a hit on him.

611
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:10,574
He then claimed that the contractor
ended up killing the wrong person.

612
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:13,368
That seems a little suspicious to me.

613
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,789
MEANWHILE, JANG NEIGHBOR

614
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:18,957
You minx.

615
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:20,542
I'm onto you.

616
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,419
AGGRESSIVELY SUSPECTING AN MARRY

617
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,587
You little minx.

618
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,465
You minx.

619
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,260
I knew it.

620
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,386
TWO ENVELOPES?

621
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,183
From An Marry to Noh Two Feet.
The letter was returned.

622
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,226
There are two.

623
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,653
Jeez, what now? Enough already.

624
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,405
What's wrong?

625
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,324
Look… Look at this!

626
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,493
-What now?
-Look at this.

627
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,871
This woman!

628
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,080
SEOUL DISTRICT COURT RULING

629
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,999
-This woman!
-We were right about Noh Two Feet!

630
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,001
Check this out.

631
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,796
"Two Feet, do you still flirt
with older ladies

632
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,173
while giving them swimming lessons?"

633
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,342
"You're the sexiest
when teaching the backstroke

634
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,718
thanks to your smooth armpits."

635
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,011
She has weird taste.

636
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,138
"Oh, right. You can't swim
with both feet anymore, can you?"

637
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:18,808
-"Why didn't you stay when I told you to?"
-No, not my precious hair.

638
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,478
Please let go.

639
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:24,064
"I didn't want to use the hammer on you."

640
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,107
"Don't resent me too much."

641
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,110
She's not a doe-eyed wacko
but a complete cuckoo.

642
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,612
She terrifies me!

643
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,781
-This is Misery in real life.
-Where's Ms. Marry?

644
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,533
The look in Masery's eyes has changed.

645
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,284
-Masery.
-What?

646
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,911
Even her walk has become more arrogant.

647
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,496
What did you do to Noh Two Feet?

648
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,581
-With a hammer…
-Did you kill him with a hammer?

649
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,459
Want me to snap your feet too?

650
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,879
Want me to snap your feet too?

651
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,508
Please. I'm sorry.

652
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,343
I'm so sorry.

653
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,970
-She's "Masery" for sure.
-What do you want?

654
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:58,682
This means that Noh Two Feet
wasn't born with his condition.

655
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,101
I made him like that.

656
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,979
He was "Two Feet" to begin with,

657
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,565
-I made him "Noh Two Feet."
-but you gave him a new surname.

658
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,191
-This is terrifying.
-Does this mean

659
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,110
she's the real-life version of Misery?

660
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,194
Yes, it's the same story.

661
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,445
What about it?

662
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,781
So what if I smashed the guy's feet
for not loving me?

663
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,200
-Sure, fine.
-What about the anesthetic?

664
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,286
What were you going to do with it?
What was it for?

665
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,829
I was going to smash his feet.

666
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,957
-After sedating him?
-Yeah.

667
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,709
-Once you lured him here?
-She's terrifying.

668
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,252
On the 29th…

669
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,130
This is important.
Kim Detective, listen up.

670
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,090
Hear me out, or I'll smash your feet.

671
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,676
-Sorry. What were you saying?
-On the 29th.

672
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,387
-I was patiently waiting.
-Okay.

673
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:38,972
-For Cho Yo-sep?
-Yes.

674
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,600
I just couldn't understand him.

675
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:45,520
He wanted to break up with me just because
I filled out the divorce papers for him.

676
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,147
-That made me furious.
-Okay.

677
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,733
He was refusing to accept my love

678
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,068
and crawled back
to that damned Park So-yun.

679
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,405
I waited for him, but he never showed up.

680
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,741
So I went to the Water Rescue Team
at 2:30 a.m. to find him.

681
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,619
-I took the anesthetic with me.
-At 2:30 a.m.?

682
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,370
I was going to sedate him
and break his feet.

683
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,540
-But he wasn't there.
-He wasn't?

684
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:09,502
At around 2:52 a.m., I went to his house

685
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,212
and found him there.

686
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,131
So I took the anesthetic and…

687
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,883
-Did you stick it in?
-I was about to,

688
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,092
but he overpowered me.

689
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,469
-He overpowered you?
-Yes.

690
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:21,139
-Cho Yo-sep stopped your hand like this?
-He was like, "What the hell?"

691
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,891
That's how I dropped the syringe.

692
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,726
-Park So-yun wasn't around, was she?
-It dropped.

693
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,727
I wouldn't know.

694
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,978
This happened at the front door.

695
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,022
-So?
-Is that when the plant got knocked over?

696
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,316
-Again, no idea. I was at the front door.
-What happened next?

697
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:34,903
At 2:54 a.m.,
I figured I should head back to my salon.

698
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,821
So I got back here at 3:05 a.m.

699
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,615
I haven't seen him since.
I was here all night.

700
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,450
After he overpowered you,

701
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,911
-you just gave up and returned here?
-Without a fight?

702
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,663
-Just like that?
-Without fighting back?

703
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,666
-I never wanted to kill him.
-When you break men's feet?

704
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:51,461
Was the syringe we found in your purse
one of the two you still had?

705
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,922
I lost one syringe, and I had one left.

706
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,007
So you had one out of two left?

707
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,801
Where's the other syringe?
Somewhere on the floor?

708
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,678
-That syringe…
-Maybe Cho Yo-sep took it.

709
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,846
That could explain why Park So-yun
has no other injuries.

710
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,598
Maybe she used it to kill Park So-yun.

711
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,767
Knowing Cho Yo-sep
wouldn't leave Park So-yun for her,

712
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,435
she could've killed her to claim him.

713
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,979
No way. I'll have him,
even if I have to break both his feet.

714
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,940
-I couldn't care less about Park So-yun.
-Really?

715
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,733
-You only wanted the guy?
-He's all I need.

716
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,068
Didn't you want to get back at her?

717
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,986
I approached him to get my revenge,

718
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,614
-but I ended up falling in love with him.
-Why in the world did Park So-yun die?

719
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:24,786
All the suspects
were linked to Cho Yo-sep,

720
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,287
not Park So-yun.

721
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,289
Why kill So-yun of all people?

722
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,042
And where's Cho Yo-sep?

723
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:36,131
Ultimately, the key to all this
is the culprit's movements.

724
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,300
The car was in the garage.

725
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,761
Here's what we're dealing with.

726
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,889
Three people have been confirmed
to have been in Cho Yo-sep's house.

727
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,435
-Marry, me, and Billionaire.
-Right.

728
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,645
-Marry wasn't in the house.
-I was only at the front door.

729
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,355
-Still, whatever.
-Sure.

730
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:55,358
But we still don't know
why the plant pot was knocked over.

731
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,776
You're right.

732
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,029
The dirt from the car
seems to have come from the plant pot.

733
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,699
-You're right.
-We could assume that.

734
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:03,616
It was also in the trunk.

735
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,077
So I was leaning toward Billionaire…

736
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,164
-The car was parked like this,
-Yeah.

737
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,291
and the culprit
must've gotten in the trunk.

738
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,001
-Exactly.
-With dirt from the pot on them!

739
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:13,918
Oh, from here?

740
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,921
-That's right.
-They got in the car, not realizing it.

741
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,507
What were they trying to find?

742
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,926
-What can you hide in a plant pot?
-It's not that.

743
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,678
They got flustered and knocked it over.

744
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,264
-They weren't looking for anything.
-It was by accident.

745
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,099
WAS THE KNOCKED-OVER PLANT POT
THE CULPRIT'S MISTAKE?

746
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,435
Is there anything here?

747
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:33,480
Couldn't the culprit
have left any traces behind?

748
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,397
I think they could've.

749
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,741
DID HE FIND SOMETHING?

750
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,409
Is that a zipper on the belt?

751
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,996
-Earlier…
-There's something here.

752
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,748
That's where he hid something?

753
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:52,916
"KCN"?

754
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:53,833
What's this?

755
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,960
-It's a drug.
-It's a drug.

756
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,879
-It's potassium cyanide.
-For real?

757
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,048
Isn't this a man's belt?

758
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,217
-Whose house are we in?
-It's Yo-sep's.

759
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,927
-Isn't it Yo-sep's?
-It's Yo-sep's.

760
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,639
-How do you know what KCN is?
-Why was this here?

761
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,307
-It's potassium cyanide.
-Yes?

762
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,309
And I heard about it from So-yun.

763
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,144
-What?
-And you're only telling us now?

764
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,231
-Why is this here?
-What did she tell you?

765
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,858
She thought that he was going to…

766
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,235
To kill her?

767
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,070
That's what she thought. This is crazy.

768
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:25,532
Let's say the killer planned
to get into the trunk and kill them both.

769
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:29,410
Then they must've been aware
of Cho Yo-sep's plan to kill his wife.

770
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,079
How else could they have made such a plan?

771
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:31,996
What the heck?

772
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,332
-No way.
-What's that?

773
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,667
A DOCUMENT ENVELOPE UNDER THE BELT BOX?

774
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,960
-You're good at finding stuff.
-Nice.

775
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,170
-I just lifted it and…
-Nicely done, psychopath.

776
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,214
-It's an insurance contract.
-"Insurance Contract."

777
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:42,966
-Let's read it.
-"Kim First Marriage, Cho Yo-sep."

778
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,843
"Accidental death, 500 million won."

779
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,302
-What did I tell you?
-Check the date.

780
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,389
-All right, here's the second page.
-The policy effective date.

781
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,932
UNDERWORLD LIFE INSURANCE
APPLICATION REVIEW FORM

782
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,017
-"Park So-yun."
-"Park So-yun. Cho Yo-sep."

783
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,310
One billion won for accidental death.

784
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:55,311
-One billion won?
-One billion won.

785
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,106
-500 million to 700 million to 1 billion.
-Hold on.

786
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,441
500 MILLION AND 700 MILLION
HAVE BEEN COLLECTED

787
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,278
He still had a debt
of a billion won to pay.

788
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,988
NEXT TARGET WAS THE 1 BILLION WON
INSURANCE PAYOUT FOR PARK SO-YUN'S DEATH

789
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,116
So that's why he insisted
on waiting six months.

790
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,660
-He signed up for the policy
-Does that mean I could've died too?

791
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:11,870
-On February 3, 2021.
-Of course.

792
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,288
-You were next.
-That crazy bastard.

793
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:17,542
She feared for her life
and wanted to run away from her husband.

794
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,919
She wouldn't have gotten
into the car with him willingly.

795
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,087
-No way.
-She wouldn't.

796
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,299
Seeing the cyanide made me wonder

797
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:28,970
if Cho Yo-sep had killed Park So-yun
before driving her to the Hangang River.

798
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,138
CHO YO-SEP
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO END THIS SOON

799
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,349
When Jang Buddy
was contacted by Park So-yun…

800
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,978
She had found a document
that laid out Yo-sep's plan.

801
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,814
He was told there was proof
of Cho Yo-sep's crimes.

802
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,566
She said she'd leave the garage open

803
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:44,986
so he could come in
and find the proof himself.

804
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,195
WHAT IS THE TRUTH BEHIND THE MURDER PLAN?

805
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,864
He's an alcoholic.

806
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,533
That's right.

807
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,410
(RUMMAGING)

808
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,789
Can you all please come here?
I found something.

809
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,208
-What did you find?
-Please take a look at it.

810
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,337
-Something went wrong.
-"Ddior."

811
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,214
-"Insurance… Cyanide."
-"Insurance payout period."

812
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,134
-"Cyanide. Risk of detection in autopsy."
-"Risk of detection in autopsy."

813
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,011
This answers all our questions.

814
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,471
-"Hangang Bridge."
-"Hangang Bridge."

815
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:14,223
-"Cyanide."
-"Cyanide, car accident, gas leak, fire."

816
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,558
-Was there a fire?
-A fire.

817
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:18,311
-The article said there had been a fire.
-"No coolant."

818
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:20,772
-"Idling, remote car start."
-The fire came

819
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,398
-after the crash.
-Hold on.

820
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,234
Was this note written by Yo-sep
and not you, Mr. Buddy?

821
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,486
That's his murder plan.

822
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:29,322
-So Yo-sep wrote it?
-I went back to his house after 3 a.m.

823
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:31,616
and found it by his pillow.

824
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,701
This breaks my heart.

825
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,203
IF HE BROUGHT THIS
FROM CHO YO-SEP'S HOUSE…

826
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,454
Is this everything?

827
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:40,333
Is the murder plan
all he took from the house?

828
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,126
Where?

829
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,836
Did you check everything in here?

830
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,088
PAPER CRANES FOLDED BY JANG BUDDY

831
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,548
-How many paper cranes are in here?
-I folded them while thinking

832
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,633
about Second Marriage.

833
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,093
Don't tell me there are 1,000 of them.

834
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,135
I folded them myself.

835
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,138
-Is there something inside?
-Where's that piece of paper?

836
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,974
There's something rattling inside.

837
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,017
-What the heck?
-The watch.

838
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,352
-The watch.
-What is it?

839
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:00,478
Of course.

840
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,688
It's that watch.

841
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:04,857
-Wait, you stole this from Cho Yo-sep!
-What? Why?

842
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,485
How is it stealing?
I only reclaimed what was mine.

843
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:10,697
Cho Yo-sep uploaded a photo of himself
wearing the watch on social media.

844
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,700
-He brought it home.
-I told you earlier that I did.

845
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:17,954
There's no way to tell if he took it
from the house or Cho Yo-sep.

846
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,747
-Off his dead body, right?
-There's no way of knowing that.

847
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,792
-Believe what you want.
-Hold on to that.

848
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,168
Unbelievable.

849
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,421
Do we really have to
go through all of these?

850
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,923
-What a hopeless romantic.
-Out of all these,

851
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,175
what do you think
was his plan for Park So-yun?

852
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,469
A car caught on fire
at the Hangang Bridge.

853
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,929
That was how Second Marriage died.

854
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,558
Right, and Park So-yun realized

855
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:41,477
he was going to kill her
by giving her cyanide.

856
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,187
That being said,

857
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,065
a car accident
couldn't have been his plan this time.

858
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,233
Hold on.

859
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:50,778
Without coolant, idling a car
would cause the engine to overheat.

860
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,905
He planned to knock her out with cyanide

861
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,450
and leave the car idling
long enough for it to combust.

862
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,577
That's not the point.
Cyanide is already lethal.

863
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,371
-But the fire would erase any trace of it.
-It was a cover-up.

864
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,706
Detective.

865
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,541
-He's here.
-What's that?

866
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:05,668
-We're here.
-AD, what do you have for me?

867
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,212
I have Park So-yun's autopsy report
from the National Forensic Service.

868
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:11,424
Listen up.
We have the victim's autopsy report.

869
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,341
All right.

870
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,719
"The subject's stomach contents

871
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:17,555
included cyanide and water."

872
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:20,767
"Toxicology results
confirmed cyanide poisoning."

873
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:24,145
"In conclusion, the cause of death
has been ruled as poisoning."

874
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,607
We can safely conclude
that Cho Yo-sep killed Park So-yun.

875
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,193
But afterward,
Cho Yo-sep was killed by a third person

876
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:34,155
while he was staging the car
to look like an accident.

877
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,364
Exactly.

878
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:38,326
Aren't we supposed to find out
who killed Park So-yun?

879
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,827
-No.
-No.

880
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,038
NO?

881
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,540
I couldn't tell
what the truth was anymore.

882
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:48,211
Cho Yo-sep was the one
who killed Park So-yun.

883
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,796
In that case…

884
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,547
Where could Yo-sep be?

885
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,175
Is he dead or alive?

886
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,511
At that point,

887
00:34:56,594 --> 00:35:00,056
there was just one place left
that could help us move forward.

888
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:04,018
-Did you just grab the navigation system?
-I did.

889
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,896
"Favorites. Seongsan Bridge."

890
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,233
"North-end drainage channel, public pool."

891
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,236
"Hangang Bridge
north-end drainage channel."

892
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,863
Why would he go there so often?

893
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:19,200
Shouldn't we check the Hangang Bridge
north-end drainage channel?

894
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,327
-Yes, let's check it out.
-Seongsan Bridge…

895
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,787
The north-end drainage channel.

896
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,123
HANGANG BRIDGE
NORTH-END DRAINAGE CHANNEL?

897
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:28,501
We have a very capable AD who can help us.

898
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,753
AD!

899
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,380
Here he comes.

900
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,715
You ran? Shouldn't you have come by boat?

901
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,800
-No, sir.
-So tell me.

902
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,844
Is there a way for us
to search that reed field?

903
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,345
I'll get you a boat.

904
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,430
Okay. Make it quick, will you?

905
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,308
A FEW MOMENTS LATER…

906
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,352
Detective!

907
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,645
-What the heck?
-Detective!

908
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,815
Detective!

909
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,483
There's our boat.

910
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,569
Detective, could you lend me a hand?

911
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,821
-You're doing great.
-Good job, AD

912
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:57,738
Thanks for that.

913
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,491
How about we search
the reed field together?

914
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,617
Let's go.

915
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,703
I'll start rowing.

916
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,163
Off you go.

917
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,040
Hangang Express is leaving the station.

918
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,959
I never expected to row on this show.

919
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,045
-Oh dear.
-Look at us go!

920
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,173
-You're good at this.
-Head to the rock over there.

921
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,216
-Oh, this way.
-This is scary.

922
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,719
Hold on. I'll give you a hand.

923
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:25,224
-I'm scared. I'd rather grab the rope.
-I'll hold on so you can climb up.

924
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,267
But this is scary.

925
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,187
Will they be alone over there?

926
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,189
-Marry.
-Yes?

927
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,440
Kill him if you have to.

928
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,026
-If need be, I'll crush him with a hammer.
-Yeah.

929
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,613
We should…

930
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:41,032
Come closer to me.

931
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,451
-Goodness, Mom?
-Oh dear.

932
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:45,328
Mom, it's been so long.

933
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,455
I feel like I had a son like you
in a past life.

934
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,081
-My son! Let me see your face.
-Mom, I'm scared.

935
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,584
He's terrible at rowing.
There's water splashing everywhere.

936
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,419
Oh my. What are you two doing?

937
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,423
-Kara?
-This must be where I find love.

938
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,425
-Come on, Kara!
-Go on. I'll hold it steady.

939
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:00,927
Goodness.

940
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,346
Watch your step.

941
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,473
Push the boat for me, will you?

942
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,766
Push it hard.

943
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:08,976
Push it hard.

944
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,318
A CLOSE CALL

945
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,320
(HOLDING TIGHT)

946
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,281
NEARLY HELD HIS BREATH
AND DIVED INTO THE HANGANG RIVER

947
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,616
I almost fell into the water.

948
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,618
Jeez, that was close.

949
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:28,329
We almost had a detective die
for the first time in this series.

950
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,664
THE MURDER OF DETECTIVE KIM?

951
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:33,084
I almost lost my love
shortly after meeting him.

952
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:35,670
Careful.

953
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,172
-Watch your step.
-Be careful.

954
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,425
-This is a dangerous place.
-Watch your step.

955
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:44,887
Wait, we can't lose the boat.

956
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,931
-Don't let it float away.
-That has to stay!

957
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:49,183
-Mister, be careful.
-We need it.

958
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,978
-Would this do?
-Tie it to something.

959
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,438
-Tie the rope to it.
-That was hilarious.

960
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,190
About three of us should've fallen in.

961
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,401
Over here. See these bloodstains?

962
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,861
-There's a heavy trail of blood.
-Trail of blood?

963
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,863
That's blood!

964
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,365
-Over here.
-There's blood everywhere!

965
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,618
So this is where they brought the body.

966
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,870
-It's here too.
-Let's follow the trail of blood.

967
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,580
-The blood trails down that way.
-Over there!

968
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,999
-The blood trails down that way.
-Over there!

969
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,293
-Where?
-We found him.

970
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,213
What is it?

971
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,724
It's Cho Yo-sep
from the Water Rescue Team.

972
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:30,891
It's Yo-sep.

973
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:31,934
Yo-sep?

974
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:37,773
FOUND DEAD IN THE HANGANG RIVER
NORTH-END DRAINAGE CHANNEL

975
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,193
He's in his Water Rescue Team uniform.

976
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,280
Hey, Misery!

977
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,699
Yo-sep.

978
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:47,867
Misery did this.

979
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,076
-It wasn't.
-It was Misery.

980
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,662
-Is his leg injury just a coincidence?
-What the hell, Misery?

981
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:52,580
The legs…

982
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,290
-It wasn't me.
-That's so gross!

983
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,667
-So this is what you did to Noh Two Feet.
-It wasn't me.

984
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,837
-Wait, it looks like he was hit by a car.
-Yo-sep…

985
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,422
-Yo-sep.
-If you're hit here…

986
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,382
-He was hit by the car.
-Yes, it's from the car crash.

987
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,342
He was hit by the car.

988
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,094
The car hit him from behind,
nearly severing his legs

989
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,429
against the guardrail.

990
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,181
He then fell into the river and died.

991
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:14,310
We now know that Yo-sep
murdered Park So-yun with cyanide.

992
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,811
With that being said,

993
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,021
the key point for us now

994
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,732
is that this case has turned into
the murder of Cho Yo-sep.

995
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,276
Did he fall into the river

996
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,404
and get washed up here
through the drainage channel?

997
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,073
-There were blood trails.
-Or was he moved?

998
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:29,116
-Someone moved him.
-Yeah, I think he was moved.

999
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,328
Not many people would know
the geography of this place well enough

1000
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,789
to consider it a good spot to dump a body.

1001
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,083
-Him.
-The drainage channel!

1002
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,710
GOTCHA, YOU PUNK!

1003
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,962
He had this place marked as a favorite
on his navigation system!

1004
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,547
The truth comes out at last.

1005
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,299
You've been here twice, haven't you?

1006
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,258
That's not it.

1007
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,593
Look.

1008
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:50,346
-The things here belong to the homeless.
-Exactly.

1009
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,598
You're the only one with ties
to the homeless community.

1010
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,350
-The homeless--
-Do you know who else has this cart?

1011
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:57,311
-Jang Neighbor has the same one at home.
-Exactly.

1012
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,854
Explain the drainage channel.

1013
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,898
-Why have you been coming here?
-All right.

1014
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,859
So, just as we've deduced so far,

1015
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:07,071
Park So-yun died of cyanide poisoning.

1016
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:10,783
The killer waited in the trunk

1017
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:14,745
and then ran Cho Yo-sep over,
pushing him off the bridge.

1018
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,623
Who had the means
to pull the body from the water?

1019
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:18,833
-What's that?
-What's that?

1020
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,918
This was in Cho Yo-sep's wallet.

1021
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,712
It's from Underworld Life Insurance.

1022
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,590
"Your insurance application was mistakenly
delivered to your neighbor."

1023
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,926
"We sincerely apologize
for the inconvenience."

1024
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,803
-The houses look identical.
-"To Ms. Park So-yun."

1025
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:34,306
Neighbor received the insurance paperwork
for the policy Cho Yo-sep had taken out.

1026
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,976
The houses look the same,
which caused the mix-up.

1027
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:40,229
Yes, the form was delivered
to my house by mistake.

1028
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,940
I realized it after opening it
and passed it on to him.

1029
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:46,193
He threw a fit,
asking why I opened their mail.

1030
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,487
-I didn't read it though.
-Did Park So-yun know about this?

1031
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:52,199
After the insurance policy form
was mistakenly delivered,

1032
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,951
Jang Neighbor likely became

1033
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:58,581
somewhat aware of Cho Yo-sep's history
with insurance scams.

1034
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:02,501
Given the situation,
Jang Neighbor has surpassed everyone else

1035
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,920
and just became my prime suspect.

1036
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,338
-What's this?
-Did Park So-yun know about this?

1037
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,299
-What is it?
-Who knows?

1038
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,384
He wired 300,000 won to Noh Homeless.

1039
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,471
At around 10 p.m. last night,

1040
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:16,348
Cho Yo-sep wired 300,000 won
to Noh Homeless.

1041
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,017
You should know
as the captain of the homeless.

1042
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,268
-What's this about?
-Why am I their captain?

1043
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:20,895
-To a homeless person?
-300,000?

1044
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,688
-As if you don't know.
-Wait, 300,000 won?

1045
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:24,315
Why did he wire 300,000 won?

1046
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,775
Does he have all his fingers?

1047
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,068
-Any missing?
-His fingers?

1048
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,987
-He has all five on this side.
-They're all intact.

1049
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,906
So it was someone else's finger
that was cut off.

1050
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,491
-This person…
-Park So-yun…

1051
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,702
He sent someone else
to have his finger cut off.

1052
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:39,413
He needed a decoy.
He hired a contract killer, remember?

1053
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,958
Billionaire had planned
to kill Cho Yo-sep,

1054
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,960
-but Yo-sep figured it out.
-Exactly, he figured it out.

1055
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,046
Yo-sep needed someone to die in his stead,

1056
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:49,131
so he paid Noh Homeless 300,000 won
to take his place.

1057
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:52,092
That's how Noh Homeless
ended up dead instead.

1058
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,011
-Then, he--
-Where did Cho Yo-sep go?

1059
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,347
-To plan his wife's murder.
-To kill his wife.

1060
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,433
If you remember, a neighbor saw

1061
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:03,604
Cho Yo-sep driving the car at 3 a.m.
with Park So-yun in the passenger seat.

1062
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:06,690
There's a reason why these three
didn't know where Park So-yun was.

1063
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,318
It's highly likely that she had
probably died from cyanide poisoning

1064
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,153
-by then.
-She was already dead.

1065
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,948
She was probably dead
in the passenger seat.

1066
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,699
-She was already dead?
-Or…

1067
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,826
Why did Cho Yo-sep

1068
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:22,456
take the car to the Hangang Bridge
with the dead Park So-yun inside?

1069
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,293
Did someone force him to drive them there?

1070
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,213
It's a bit crowded here,

1071
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:31,131
so let's row back to the other side.

1072
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,383
Come on.

1073
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,801
Yo-sep…

1074
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,844
Yo-sep.

1075
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,430
Rest in peace.

1076
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,933
-You're so fake.
-Yo-sep.

1077
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,687
JANG NEIGHBOR IS NOW THE PRIME SUSPECT

1078
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:50,818
Wait.

1079
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:52,695
There's something here.

1080
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,784
What the heck? There's something here.

1081
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:00,035
A CELL PHONE?

1082
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,120
Over here!

1083
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:03,038
-What is it?
-I found something!

1084
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,124
-What?
-What is that?

1085
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:06,166
A phone?

1086
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,210
-It's a phone.
-Bring it here.

1087
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,088
Whose is it?

1088
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:15,551
PHOTO1_STAGED_INCIDENT_CONTRACT.JPG

1089
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:16,635
It's Yo-sep's phone.

1090
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,262
-This is Yo-sep's phone.
-Yeah.

1091
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,472
-Isn't this Yo-sep's phone?
-It is.

1092
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,391
He must have two phones.

1093
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:23,517
It's his burner phone.

1094
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,102
-"Squeaky Clean."
-Wait, Squeaky Clean?

1095
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:28,606
-How does he know Squeaky Clean?
-That's Hwang Billionaire's contractor.

1096
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:31,358
Both Yo-sep and Billionaire
had dealings with Squeaky Clean.

1097
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,737
Squeaky Clean contacted Cho Yo-sep
with a request of his own.

1098
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,531
-"For an hour."
-"Skip patrol on the 24th for an hour,

1099
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,991
and I'll wire you ten million won."

1100
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,659
Thanks to his own deals
with Squeaky Clean,

1101
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:44,204
he was able to figure out
what Squeaky Clean was up to.

1102
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,540
Squeaky Clean had a job to do,

1103
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,792
-so he cut a deal…
-With someone on the Water Rescue Team.

1104
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,128
He requested that no one make rounds
during certain hours.

1105
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:54,423
The times and dates perfectly coincided
with those in Hwang Billionaire's requests

1106
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,383
to Squeaky Clean.

1107
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,677
There must have been a moment

1108
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:03,182
when Cho Yo-sep became aware of
Billionaire's dealings with Squeaky Clean.

1109
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:05,392
-Check the dates.
-"Tomorrow from 2 to 3 a.m."

1110
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,019
"One hour, same amount."

1111
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,395
That was March 28th.

1112
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,899
-The 28th. And the one above it?
-He knew someone was going to die.

1113
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,568
-And also…
-What's this message from Buddy?

1114
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,654
-"#Quiet, #mouse, #sneakers, KCN."
-"KCN."

1115
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,280
I'll show you where I saw that.

1116
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,074
JANG BUDDY'S SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT

1117
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,492
What's this?

1118
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,661
"Men Breathe Loyalty."
Check out the Story Highlights.

1119
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:26,330

"#Piano, #highlighter, #mischievous."

1123
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:34,171
Jang Buddy posted those
and tagged Cho Yo-sep.

1124
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,422
-What do these mean?
-But look.

1125
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,675
-That matches what we just saw.
-"#Quiet, #mouse, #sneakers, KCN."

1126
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,260
-What is this, Mr. Buddy?
-Huh?

1127
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:43,305
"#Quiet, #mouse, #sneakers, KCN."
Why did you text him that?

1128
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:44,973
-What do they mean?
-What do they mean?

1129
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,517
We had…

1130
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:49,478
something going.

1131
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,105
-As in what?
-Just spill already.

1132
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,982
We're not that easy to figure out.

1133
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,234
-Unbelievable.
-Where's this?

1134
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:57,736
-Could they lead to coordinates?
-"Quiet."

1135
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,904
I mean the hashtags.

1136
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:03,909
When you type in keywords,
the map app displays results.

1137
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:06,829
-Can we type in words from the Highlight?
-The hashtags from his social media.

1138
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,373
"#Prim, #tears, #water spring."

1139
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,458
It's giving us something.

1140
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,711
"Ripple Town, Calm District,
Incheon City."

1141
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:14,795
"Incheon Port Terminal 2."

1142
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,673
-The last one sounds like a car.
-A BNW.

1143
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,591
-That's the car's make.
-Morsche, like Porsche.

1144
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,301
-These just point to cars.
-Right.

1145
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,636
-What about KCN?
-The codes

1146
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,930
must be from their car smuggling days.

1147
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:27,558
The tagged words indicate the location

1148
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,351
where the car should be picked up.

1149
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:30,561
COMMUNICATING THE LOCATION OF THE CAR
WITH THREE WORDS?

1150
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,772
"#Quiet, #mouse, #sneakers, KCN."

1151
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,649
Type in #quiet,

1152
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:37,651
#mouse,

1153
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,987
and #sneakers.

1154
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:44,324
Hangang Bridge!

1155
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,744
WHY DID THE HANGANG BRIDGE POP UP?

1156
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,954
What the heck? Why did the bridge show up?

1157
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,205
"#Quiet, #mouse, and #sneakers"?

1158
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,583
He was setting up a meeting
at the Hangang Bridge.

1159
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,209
-At 3:05 a.m.
-At what time?

1160
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,502
-At 3:05 a.m.
-You're right.

1161
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,838
This is the code calling him over
to the Hangang Bridge.

1162
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:02,301
Why did you text Yo-sep
the coordinates at 3:05 a.m.?

1163
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,428
I knew it would shake him.

1164
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:07,389
It means I'm onto what he did
with the cyanide.

1165
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:10,476
I wanted to lure Yo-sep out of the house,

1166
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,895
so I could look for his murder plan.

1167
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:17,816
Mr. Buddy was the one who lured Cho Yo-sep
to the Hangang Bridge.

1168
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,319
If Mr. Buddy is indeed the killer,

1169
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:22,488
perhaps he called Cho Yo-sep
to the Hangang Bridge,

1170
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:26,450
where Yo-sep had killed
Buddy's beloved Second Marriage

1171
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:28,452
to get his revenge.

1172
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:32,247
Did you check everything here?
Jeez, the smell.

1174
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:42,424
What now?

1175
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,218
Are you kidding me?

1176
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,803
What are you doing in my house?!

1177
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,179
PANICKED

1178
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,431
You can't do this in my house!

1179
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:52,851
I just got the chills.

1180
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,103
TA-DA

1181
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,064
I knew it.

1182
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,148
A BASEMENT AREA UNDER THE BED?

1183
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,191
Move over.

1184
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,402
HAS HE RESIGNED HIMSELF TO HIS FATE?

1185
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,863
-How brave of her.
-We'll go in there and see.

1186
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:06,990
Goodness gracious.

1187
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:09,785
What is it?

1188
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:16,667
BASEMENT OF JANG NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE

1189
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:24,675
-"Did you really have to take everything?"
-"Really have to take everything?"

1190
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:28,804
There's even a soccer ball here.
Something's fishy about this place.

1191
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:32,975
But one thing's for sure.
He was actually praying.

1192
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:35,143
-He was actually praying?
-I was praying.

1193
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,729
-Jeez, you're such a weirdo.
-What's this?

1194
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:41,567
-"Please forgive this one time."
-"Please forgive this one time."

1195
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:45,153
-What are these marks on the floor?
-Beats me.

1196
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:47,322
Look. Isn't this how the police
outline murder victims?

1197
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:48,240
TRACES OF SOMEONE WHO DIED?

1198
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,701
-Did you really have to
-What is it?

1199
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:51,952
-take everything?
-Did you?

1200
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:55,873
-What's in that thing?
-Oh, here.

1201
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,792
-It's a phone.
-There's another phone in here.

1202
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,335
Hold on.

1203
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,505
"I'm so glad to be reunited
with the people who saved me."

1204
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:04,798
"The man living next door."

1205
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:08,218
"That Rescue Team member
who didn't save you back then

1206
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:13,724
brought those gang members
from back in the day, so run for it."

1207
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,517
Whoever it was,
they didn't get to send it.

1208
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:19,646
Did this person die
before they could send this message?

1209
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,858
I think another homeless person
was trying to warn Jang Neighbor.

1210
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:26,820
Jang Neighbor has been
a true friend to the homeless.

1211
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,156
I'll tell you everything.

1212
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,158
Let's all head back up and hear him out.

1213
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:35,871
So?

1214
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,123
COMBINE THE CLUES
TO COMPLETE THE DEDUCTION

1215
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:40,667
You see, like I said before,

1216
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:44,588
I was living it up as the boss
of the Five-Star Gang.

1217
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,299
But one day, I was ambushed

1218
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,551
by a group of thugs

1219
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,845
near the Hangang River.

1220
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:55,015
Someone from the Rescue Team came to help,

1221
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:58,101
and that someone was Cho Yo-sep.

1222
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,563
Those who attacked me

1223
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,857
paid him off,

1224
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,275
-To look the other way?
-and he just left.

1225
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,069
CHO YO-SEP TOOK A BRIBE
AND TURNED A BLIND EYE

1226
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:09,279
But here's what upset me the most.

1227
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,156
The people who attacked me

1228
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:12,991
were my subordinates.

1229
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,745
-Those I thought of as my family.
-Your brothers.

1230
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,914
-The ones with stars on their foreheads?
-Yeah.

1231
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:22,626
After doing a number on me,
they left me by the Hangang River.

1232
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:25,253
The homeless came to my rescue.

1233
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:30,217
Since then, I vowed to leave the gang life

1234
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:34,179
and devote myself to helping the homeless.

1235
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:36,807
I'm sorry I mistook you
for an organ smuggler.

1236
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:39,059
I told you Mr. Neighbor was a good man.

1237
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,311
-Finish your story.
-So, I thought about

1238
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,730
what I could do to help them.

1239
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,899
Since many of them
live by the Hangang River,

1240
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,528
I scouted the areas
where the homeless usually stay

1241
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:50,821
while operating a water taxi.

1242
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,280
I'd sometimes bring them home,

1243
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:54,282
but because of the neighbors' complaints,

1244
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:56,994
I had them stay in the basement.

1245
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,745
-You hid them in the basement?
-Yeah.

1246
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,956
That's where I had them stay.

1247
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:04,376
Three people saved my life back then,

1248
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:07,921
and I had been searching for them
for quite some time now,

1249
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,132
and I only managed to reunite
with them recently.

1250
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:13,343
After reuniting with them,
I let them stay in my basement

1251
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:17,806
while I searched for a better place
for them to stay.

1252
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:19,683
But as I was coming home one day,

1253
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:21,143
I saw my house burning.

1254
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:27,065
I rushed in to put out the fire
and then went to check the basement.

1255
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,192
-Two had died.
-Two were already dead.

1256
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,944
Is that what the chalk outlines are?

1257
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,822
Two had died from inhaling too much smoke,

1258
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,907
but one was still alive.

1259
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:40,245
As you saw in the text, my saviors
tried to tell me who the culprit was.

1260
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:41,288
"The Rescue Team member

1261
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:45,167
brought those gang members
from back in the day, so run for it."

1262
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,210
And last night,

1263
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:51,882
the sole survivor of the fire
passed away as well.

1264
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:53,008
-At the hospital?
-She passed.

1265
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:56,094
So that got me thinking that perhaps

1266
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:59,139
I need to go back
to my Five-Star Gang days.

1267
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,391
I was merciless back then.

1268
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,310
Cho Yo-sep obviously couldn't be helped.

1269
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:07,064
I decided that he had to die.

1270
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:11,401
But the last surviving victim
always told me this.

1271
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:14,321
-"Cleanse people of their sins."
-Forgive.

1272
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,990
"Forgive." That's what she always said.

1273
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,367
So, instead of killing Cho Yo-sep,

1274
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,870
I decided to cleanse him of his sins.

1275
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:24,247
I was going to

1276
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,999
tie Cho Yo-sep to my water taxi

1277
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:29,503
and drag him underwater
in the Hangang River.

1278
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:34,674
That's why I keep a rope at the back
of the boat, near the life buoy.

1279
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,051
So that's how you wanted to cleanse him.

1280
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:38,303
Call it a harsh baptism.

1281
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:43,266
I considered it the harshest punishment
I could give him.

1282
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,144
I'd also be keeping the promise
I made to those who saved me.

1283
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,604
That's pretty hard to believe.

1284
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:49,648
I called his work for that reason.

1285
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:51,900
I asked for Cho Yo-sep,
but they said he wasn't there.

1286
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:55,529
Clearly, things weren't working out
as I had planned.

1287
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,989
-So you prayed at home?
-Yeah.

1288
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:01,618
For the peace of those who passed away
and for a chance to cleanse that sinner.

1289
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:04,162
That day didn't work out,
so I wondered when I'd get my chance.

1290
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,998
Either way, Cho Yo-sep deserved to die.

1291
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:10,001
He wanted to cleanse Cho Yo-sep
by tying him to the back of a boat?

1292
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,045
Is he out of his mind?

1293
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:14,548
He held back the urge to kill
with prayers?

1294
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:15,674
PLEASE FORGIVE THIS ONE TIME

1295
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,051
Is that even possible?

1296
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,845
I doubt he could hold back the urge.

1297
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,263
That said…

1298
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:25,016
We should discuss
why the drainage channel was used

1299
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,352
to dump and hide the body.

1300
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:29,062
By the drainage channel,

1301
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:34,192
I found some items that suggested
it was a shelter for the homeless.

1302
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:37,779
Cho Yo-sep killed the homeless people
Jang Neighbor was devoted to helping

1303
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:40,907
by setting a fire,
letting them die a horrific death.

1304
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,742
Killing him was the only fitting revenge.

1305
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,327
The dead body

1306
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:47,664
was then laid in a spot that served
as a makeshift shelter for the homeless.

1307
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:50,167
Maybe it was to console their spirits.

1308
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,795
Since he was an enemy of the homeless,
the body may have been left there

1309
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:55,714
as a kind of battle trophy.

1310
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:56,840
That's possible.

1311
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:59,759
But the fact that
the killer hid the body over there

1312
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:04,639
means they didn't want it
to be found anytime soon.

1313
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,683
Anytime soon? More like forever.

1314
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:11,479
The incident had to be written off
as a domestic case,

1315
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:13,940
which is why the killer
staged the crime scene.

1316
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,735
Let's not forget that this took place
on the Hangang Bridge.

1317
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:21,114
The killer had to know Cho Yo-sep
would be there to kill him.

1318
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,825
And Mr. Buddy was the only one
who could've lured Cho Yo-sep there.

1319
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,577
He did send the text to get him there too.

1320
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:28,246
Mr. Billionaire
also called him to the bridge.

1321
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:31,833
I asked to meet at Honey Chestnut Island,
not the Hangang Bridge.

1322
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,501
Billionaire was at the bridge at 3:10 a.m.

1323
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:34,669
To collect the finger.

1324
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:35,712
That's true.

1325
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:39,591
-This is a hard case to crack.
-Here's what I think.

1326
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:43,470
I'll lay out a scenario
where Jang Buddy is the killer.

1327
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,722
He said he was at their garage.

1328
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:48,183
I believe that's when he got
into the trunk.

1329
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,060
So, he was already in the trunk.

1330
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:53,271
Cho Yo-sep probably went to the bridge
because of Jang Buddy.

1331
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,940
He had used the cyanide,

1332
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,943
and someone who knew about it
called him to the bridge.

1333
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,570
But today wasn't your typical day.

1334
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,489
The fine dust level was very high,

1335
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:05,242
and even though it was 4 a.m.,
there wasn't a single car on the road

1336
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,035
-when the car suddenly accelerated.
-It was foggy too.

1337
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:08,995
Yo-sep must've left the car
to look for Buddy.

1338
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,873
I believe that's when Buddy left the trunk

1339
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,959
and slipped in through the back door.

1340
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:16,711
-Back door and not the front?
-The back door?

1341
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,421
There's dirt on the back seat.

1342
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:19,756
Let's say I did. What then?

1343
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,466
You climbed into the driver's seat
from the back.

1344
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:22,884
That makes sense, doesn't it?

1345
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,761
That explains the dirt on the back seat.

1346
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:28,974
It takes quite some time
to exit the trunk and get into the car.

1347
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,642
In that time,

1348
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:34,562
Cho Yo-sep might've spotted the killer,
despite the heavy fog.

1349
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:38,400
How could the dirt have gotten in the car?

1350
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:42,946
I get how it ended up in the trunk,
but how did it get on the seats?

1351
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:46,908
I couldn't explain how the killer moved
from the trunk into the car.

1352
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:50,870
-I believe Cho Yo-sep stopped the car.
-Can't really see, huh?

1353
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,497
-That's what I think.
-He probably did.

1354
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,416
-He stopped and got out.
-He stopped here and got out.

1355
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:55,792
The car came to a stop.

1356
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:58,628
Cho Yo-sep was out here looking for Buddy.

1357
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,880
"What the hell? Where is he?"

1358
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:04,551
"Jang Buddy told me to meet him here,
so where is he?"

1359
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,473
RE-EXAMINING THE TRUNK

1360
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,231
Right. Let's get back in here.

1361
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,899
TRIES TO CHANNEL THE KILLER

1362
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,237
There's a button.

1363
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,491
I see.

1364
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,201
IF YOU PULL THE LEVER

1365
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:34,789
THE BACKREST FOLDS?

1366
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,500
-Look.
-What?

1367
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:38,668
-Look.
-What?

1368
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,796
What the heck?

1369
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,632
-You can climb out.
-You can climb out.

1370
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:46,009
The entire backrest folds.

1371
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,135
Check this out.

1372
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:50,180
-This is the only place my foot can go.
-Exactly.

1373
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,515
-That must be it.
-By doing this,

1374
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,517
you can move up to the front seat.

1375
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:57,228
-You don't have to open any doors.
-Without being detected, that is.

1376
00:55:57,312 --> 00:56:01,024
-You can get to the driver's seat.
-That's why there's dirt on this.

1377
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:03,109
Without getting out of the car,

1378
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,111
the killer slipped into the driver's seat

1379
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,198
-without Cho Yo-sep noticing.
-That's right.

1380
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:10,200
The car suddenly accelerated
in both instances.

1381
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:11,159
HOW CAN THE 2 SKID MARKS BE EXPLAINED?

1382
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,494
Here. Imagine this is the car.

1383
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:13,495
RECREATING THE CRIME SCENE

1384
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:16,289
-Cho Yo-sep stopped the car here.
-Right.

1385
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:20,001
-He got out and looked for his friend.
-He looked for Buddy.

1386
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,962
-During that time, the killer moved up.
-The killer moved into the driver's seat.

1387
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,882
The car launched at Cho Yo-sep,
hitting him once.

1388
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:28,176
-The impact must've sent him flying.
-Right.

1389
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:31,471
After Cho Yo-sep was hit,
he probably pulled himself back up.

1390
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:34,891
Right after striking him with the car,
the driver backed it up.

1391
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:38,853
The driver then launched
the car at him again from here.

1392
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,397
ACCELERATED FROM A GREATER DISTANCE
AND HIT HIM A SECOND TIME

1393
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,314
That's the second impact.

1394
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:45,402
The only logical conclusion at this point
is that he was hit twice.

1395
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:48,363
But even if this is exactly what happened,

1396
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:50,365
I don't think how the killer did it
matters that much.

1397
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:53,535
Who got in the trunk and why?

1398
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:55,495
And why did Cho Yo-sep get out of the car?

1399
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,414
Those are the questions
we need the answers to now.

1400
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,706
Hold on.

1401
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,291
Wouldn't he have checked the storm drain?

1402
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,962
Yo-sep knew the storm drain
was Billionaire's drop-off spot.

1403
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:06,214
Yo-sep knew that.

1404
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:10,427
Mr. Billionaire had been taking things
from the storm drain,

1405
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:13,680
and Yo-sep wanted to use that
as leverage to extort him.

1406
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:17,475
He probably went to the Hangang Bridge
to see what was in the drain.

1407
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:21,396
If Cho Yo-sep was the one

1408
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:25,191
who first retrieved the finger and video
from the storm drain,

1409
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,777
a certain someone would've felt
compelled to stop him.

1410
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:31,698
Wouldn't Billionaire have killed him
to protect his future?

1411
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:35,452
Detective, I think Neighbor is right
about what we should be focusing on.

1412
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,579
The motive is what matters more right now

1413
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:40,498
-than how the murder was committed.
-The technicalities matter less.

1414
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,377
I've already identified
who the culprit is.

1415
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,045
-You have?
-Yes.

1416
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:49,132
I've been certain who the culprit is
for the past two hours.

1417
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,133
IS HE GOING TO ARREST THE CULPRIT NOW?

1418
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,218
Let me give you a hint.

1419
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,762
I want you to mull over what I said today.

1420
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:58,141
Think about who my suspicions
were mostly focused on.

1421
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:00,143
Think that through.

1422
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:02,520
I haven't been able to
put all the pieces together yet, but--

1423
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,939
-We have no idea who you focused on.
-Wait, what?

1424
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:07,108
-You don't?
-We haven't the faintest clue.

1425
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:09,652
-The homeless.
-You only talked about the homeless.

1426
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:13,114
Earlier, he demonstrated
how he got into the driver's seat.

1427
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,408
When cornered,

1428
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,619
people make extra effort
to present a plausible story

1429
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,871
to escape suspicion.

1430
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:23,166
People with limited knowledge
can be the most dangerous of all.

1431
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,710
-You're way off.
-Are you talking about me?

1432
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:27,420
-Yes.
-Was that about me?

1433
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,422
-I didn't do it.
-You don't know much.

1434
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:33,635
Just keep in mind that I learned a lot
from YouTube videos and TV.

1435
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,011
-It wasn't me.
-Let's head back down.

1436
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:39,057
ONLY THE LAST 3 MINUTES
AND THE FINAL VOTE REMAIN

1437
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,683
All right.

1438
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:43,603
Make way for Kim Detective,
the detective with the most swagger.

1439
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:45,730
Today's culprit
had better brace themselves.

1440
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:47,649
FINAL EXAMINATION OF SCENE AND VOTE

1441
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:49,984
EACH GET 3 MINUTES TO EXAMINE THE SCENE
BEFORE CASTING THEIR FINAL VOTE

1442
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,281
Get ready to be in the clink.

1443
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,658
CAST YOUR VOTE BASED ON THE CLUES

1444
00:58:57,283 --> 00:59:01,412
"Underworld Life Insurance
Application Review Form."

1445
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:04,791
To be the culprit in today's case,

1446
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:09,921
they had to have known in detail
about the insurance scam

1447
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:13,383
Cho Yo-sep was committing
by killing his wives.

1448
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:17,178
That's why I thought
the prime suspects were Jang Buddy

1449
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:20,598
and Hwang Billionaire.

1450
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:25,311
However, my opinion changed after we found
the apology letter in Cho Yo-sep's wallet.

1451
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:29,107
Jang Neighbor knew
that Cho Yo-sep had taken out

1452
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,651
an insurance policy in his wife's name.

1453
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:35,113
Also, Cho Yo-sep was the one
who put him in real danger

1454
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:37,198
that could've cost him his life.

1455
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:41,494
His life was saved back then
by the homeless people.

1456
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:46,541
Simply put, the homeless
are the most significant part of his life.

1457
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:50,670
He truly dedicated his life
to the homeless.

1458
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:54,048
The thing that likely angered him most

1459
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,550
was the fire started by Cho Yo-sep.

1460
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:58,303
The homeless people
who once saved his life

1461
00:59:58,386 --> 01:00:01,598
lost theirs because of this lunatic.

1462
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:05,560
"Did you really have to take everything?"

1463
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,061
Cho Yo-sep!

1464
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:11,399
Cho Yo-sep was more than
just someone he wanted to kill.

1465
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:15,320
By leaving his dead body
in the drainage channel

1466
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,405
where the homeless took shelter,

1467
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:21,576
he was consoling the souls
of those unjustly killed.

1468
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:24,370
I don't want to vote for you.

1469
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,623
But I'm afraid I have no choice.

1470
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,084
It was you.

1471
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:32,128
KIM DETECTIVE AND JANG BUDDY
CHOSE JANG NEIGHBOR

1472
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:34,088
What a shame. I'm sorry.

1473
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:40,637
JANG NEIGHBOR: 2, JANG BUDDY: 1

1474
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:44,932
I'm still on the fence.

1475
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:50,271
Why did Cho Yo-sep
drive to the Hangang Bridge

1476
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:53,358
and stop at that exact spot?

1477
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:57,862
Why was the body dumped
at the drainage channel?

1478
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:02,075
Why fish his wet body out of the water

1479
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:04,160
just to leave it at the drainage channel?

1480
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:07,455
While the killer
might've intended to hide the body,

1481
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:09,874
I believe they needed to

1482
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:13,044
find something Yo-sep was carrying.

1483
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:15,838
What could be the thing that was missing?

1484
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:20,134
Maybe it was the finger
he wanted to collect, but couldn't.

1485
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,722
RE-EXAMINING THE GLASS TUBES
USED TO STORE THE FINGERS

1486
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,351
Why is this cracked?

1487
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:31,354
As I inspected the glass tubes
that housed the souvenirs,

1488
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:34,190
I found that one of them was cracked.

1489
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:38,444
The section of fabric under that tube

1490
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:41,572
had faded to white,

1491
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:44,492
probably because some liquid
had leaked from it.

1492
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:48,287
Could this cracked glass tube

1493
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,331
have been damaged during the car crash?

1494
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:54,210
Could this be the item
he was trying to retrieve?

1495
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:57,296
Hwang Billionaire
would've climbed out of the trunk

1496
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,799
and used the car to run Yo-sep over,

1497
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,134
pushing him into the river.

1498
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:04,971
Then he would've checked the storm drain,
only to discover the finger wasn't there.

1499
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,597
After a moment of panic,

1500
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:09,642
he would've soon realized
that Cho Yo-sep must have it.

1501
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:12,645
That's why he fished the body out,
brought it to the drainage channel,

1502
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:16,941
and found the finger right then and there.

1503
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:18,985
The finger belonging to Noh Homeless.

1504
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:21,612
There's no escaping

1505
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:24,490
my investigative skills.

1506
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,033
My investigative skills

1507
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:27,910
deserve five stars.

1508
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,122
The culprit is…

1509
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:32,081
you.

1510
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:34,292
JANG NEIGHBOR AND PARK KARA
CHOSE HWANG BILLIONAIRE

1511
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:38,838
JANG NEIGHBOR: 2,
JANG BUDDY: 1, HWANG BILLIONAIRE: 2

1512
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:43,342
The watch.

1513
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:48,055
What I find most suspicious

1514
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:49,515
is the watch.

1515
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,058
Was this watch…

1516
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:53,186
Did he take it from Yo-sep's house,

1517
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,189
or did he kill him first

1518
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:58,941
and then retrieve it
from the drainage channel?

1519
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:00,777
There's no way to tell.

1520
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,737
Second Marriage was the love of his life

1521
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:05,072
and the mother of his unborn child.

1522
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:08,284
If he had found out the watch
she meant to give him

1523
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:11,537
was in the hands of her killer,

1524
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,539
he wouldn't have been in his right mind.

1525
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,793
Fueled by rage,

1526
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:19,253
Jang Buddy would've texted Cho Yo-sep,
hinting that he knew everything,

1527
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:23,633
and lured him to the place
where Second Marriage had died.

1528
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:25,593
He would've stayed hidden in the trunk,

1529
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:28,471
moved up to the driver's seat,
and ran Cho Yo-sep over.

1530
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:31,474
After hiding the body
at the fairly deserted drainage channel,

1531
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:34,393
he would've taken back the watch
Second Marriage had meant to give him.

1532
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:38,064
I believe Buddy Jang…

1533
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,274
is the culprit.

1534
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,861
HWANG BILLIONAIRE CHOSE BUDDY JANG

1535
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:48,407
JANG NEIGHBOR: 2,
JANG BUDDY: 2, HWANG BILLIONAIRE: 2

1536
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:52,411
WHO WILL AN MARRY CHOOSE?

1537
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,622
All right. Let's do this.

1538
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:56,415
-It was you.
-It was you.

1539
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:59,001
FINAL VOTE COMPLETE

1540
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:03,548
The third episode of the deduction game,
Crime Scene Zero.

1541
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:07,760
The results of the nail-biting
deduction game to find the culprit

1542
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,971
of the murder on the Hangang Bridge.

1543
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:14,517
Let's see who received the most votes
as the real culprit.

1544
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:18,855
We will now announce the results.

1545
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:21,482
Let's do this.

1546
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:24,068
-I hope you made the right choice.
-Please.

1547
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:26,529
I hope you were paying attention
to my last remarks.

1548
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,198
(A HALF-HEARTED NOD)

1549
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,741
It was pretty obvious, if you ask me.

1550
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:33,786
Don't you trust Kim Detective,
the detective with the most swagger?

1551
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,621
-I don't.
-Come on now.

1552
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:37,832
I think we're screwed.

1553
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:40,042
First, we will announce

1554
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:42,086
who was excluded
from the final list of suspects.

1555
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:45,381
The results of the final vote
to determine the culprit are as follows.

1556
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:47,884
With zero votes…

1557
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:50,386
Park Kara

1558
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:52,096
and An Marry,

1559
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:53,639
you are excluded from the final lineup.

1560
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:56,434
-Just the two of them?
-Are you serious?

1561
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:58,269
Only two were excluded?

1562
01:04:58,352 --> 01:05:00,980
-Dang, we're definitely screwed.
-Only two?

1563
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:02,398
And so,

1564
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:05,484
Hwang Billionaire,
Jang Neighbor, and Jang Buddy

1565
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,778
were identified as suspects.

1566
01:05:08,654 --> 01:05:10,197
Unbelievable.

1567
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:13,951
Don't tell me two suspects
received the same number of votes.

1568
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:17,163
The ultimate deduction game,
Crime Scene Zero.

1569
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:22,251
The results of the final vote
of the murder on the Hangang Bridge.

1570
01:05:22,835 --> 01:05:25,171
The player who was ultimately identified
as the culprit is…

1571
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:26,088
Please.

1572
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:33,512
-In a three to two to two split…
-Three to two?

1573
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,181
Three to two to two?

1574
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:36,891
…the player with three votes is…

1575
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:40,519
Jang Buddy.

1576
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:43,439
No! We're screwed!

1577
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:44,523
…Jang Buddy.

1578
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:47,652
No! We're screwed!

1579
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:51,280
Wait, what? Did I hear that right?

1580
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:52,615
Did you say Jang Buddy?

1581
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:56,619
Jang Buddy, you've been identified
as the final suspect.

1582
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:58,871
Please enter the jail.

1583
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,290
You fools!

1584
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:07,254
You're all so frustrating.
I practically spelled it out for you!

1585
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:09,590
What's wrong?

1586
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:10,591
-You…
-I…

1587
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:12,510
-Who are you even talking about?
-Hold on.

1588
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:13,552
A three to two to two split?

1589
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,638
Which two people voted for him?

1590
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:19,517
-Wait, a three to two to two split?
-Wait, what?

1591
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,060
I can't believe this. Hold on.

1592
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:24,730
-I can't believe you people. You idiots!
-What's going on?

1593
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,148
Is it not him?

1594
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:28,192
-Seriously.
-Today's a hot mess.

1595
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:31,404
-Was it Mr. Five Viscera and Six Entrails?
-The real issue is that the culprit

1596
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:34,699
-likely won the whole pot this time.
-You were all fooled.

1597
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:35,658
Ten million won?

1598
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,035
The players who voted for Jang Buddy,

1599
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,371
Kim Detective,

1600
01:06:40,454 --> 01:06:41,580
An Marry,

1601
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:44,375
and Hwang Billionaire,
please step forward.

1602
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:46,961
I voted for him in the first round.

1603
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:49,714
Marry, I have to ask,
so give it to me straight.

1604
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:51,424
-Why do you think I did it?
-Just wait it out.

1605
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:53,467
I'll explain my decision
once the culprit is revealed,

1606
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:55,344
Mr. Buddy.

1607
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:58,139
Wait, did you do it?

1608
01:06:58,222 --> 01:06:59,598
It's not you, is it?

1609
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:02,435
If Jang Buddy is the real culprit,

1610
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:06,313
An Marry and Hwang Billionaire
will each win two million won,

1611
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:10,526
and Kim Detective
will win one million won.

1612
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:14,572
-I refuse to take the money.
-This is better than the alternative.

1613
01:07:14,655 --> 01:07:17,825
If Jang Buddy is not the culprit,

1614
01:07:17,908 --> 01:07:21,954
the real killer will claim the prize money
of all other players,

1615
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,914
a total of ten million won.

1616
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:26,625
-I was fooled!
-Over my dead body.

1617
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:28,627
-I'll steal the money.
-But it all fits.

1618
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:31,047
-Detective, hand over your badge already.
-I'll kill them.

1619
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,506
He has to be the culprit.

1620
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:34,091
-The third episode
-I think it is Buddy.

1621
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:36,886
of the ultimate deduction game,
Crime Scene Zero.

1622
01:07:37,636 --> 01:07:41,891
Jang Buddy has been voted as the culprit
in the murder on the Hangang Bridge.

1623
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:44,769
Is he really the culprit

1624
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:47,688
who killed Cho Yo-sep?

1625
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,068
Mr. Jang Buddy.

1626
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,528
Are you…

1627
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:55,905
Come on, please.

1628
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,866
…Cho Yo-sep's killer?

1629
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:11,712
No, he's not!

1630
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:14,507
I told you so!

1631
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,550
You complete idiots!

1632
01:08:17,384 --> 01:08:19,512
-No, he's not!
-I told you so!

1633
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:20,930
FIRST FAILED APPREHENSION
ON CRIME SCENE ZERO

1634
01:08:21,013 --> 01:08:22,890
You complete idiots!

1635
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:26,560
I told you. I'm Kim Detective,
the detective with the most swagger.

1636
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:28,896
-Seriously?
-Was my swagger too much for you to trust?

1637
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:31,982
-I dropped plenty of hints!
-It was you, Mr. Billionaire.

1638
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:33,150
Why would it be me?

1639
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:34,902
It was Mr. Billionaire.

1640
01:08:34,985 --> 01:08:36,403
-It wasn't me.
-It was Mr. Billionaire.

1641
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:40,241
-I dropped countless hints. You idiots!
-Why would it be me? It's not.

1642
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:41,951
The culprit

1643
01:08:42,034 --> 01:08:44,453
-who masterfully deceived you all is…
-Was it Jang Neighbor?

1644
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:58,300
-Hwang Billionaire!
-I told you so!

1645
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:01,887
-…Hwang Billionaire!
-I told you so!

1646
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:02,888
No way.

1647
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:05,391
Give up your badge right now.

1648
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:08,519
Give up your badge right now.

1649
01:09:08,602 --> 01:09:11,814
No, wait! She's not done.
Surely there's more to the story.

1650
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:13,607
-You don't deserve your badge.
-So what about Hwang Billionaire?

1651
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:16,777
I feel so betrayed.

1652
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:18,612
You've got to be kidding me.

1653
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:22,575
As such, the real killer,
Mr. Hwang Billionaire,

1654
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:25,244
claims the prize money
of all other players,

1655
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:27,454
a total of ten million won.

1656
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:29,331
HWANG BILLIONAIRE CLAIMS
THE PRIZE MONEY OF 10 MILLION WON

1657
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:32,334
-This is crazy.
-Hold on. Did I hear that correctly?

1658
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:33,669
He's a scary guy.

1659
01:09:33,752 --> 01:09:35,045
What was that?

1660
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:37,506
He claims the prize money
of all other players.

1661
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,508
-Are you sure you said that right?
-Thank you.

1662
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:41,468
-You fool.
-Thank you.

1663
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:42,970
-Hold on.
-Wait.

1664
01:09:43,053 --> 01:09:44,597
-Mr. Jang Stone Bed.
-There's no way.

1665
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:45,848
You killed him.

1666
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:48,642
-Jeez, I can't believe you.
-Our detective is hopeless.

1667
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:50,102
You killed him!

1668
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:53,522
-You got me confused!
-You killed him!

1669
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:56,317
This is all Kim Detective's fault.

1670
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:59,445
All of this happened
because of Kim Detective.

1671
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:00,404
IDIOT DETECTIVE

1672
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:01,614
Confess already!

1673
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:02,698
We'll now announce

1674
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:05,409
-the key piece of evidence you missed.
-What could we have missed?

1675
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:07,244
I'm dying to know.

1676
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:08,913
-What was it?
-Out with it.

1677
01:10:09,496 --> 01:10:10,706
-The finger?
-His hand?

1678
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:13,125
You didn't look closely enough.

1679
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:14,627
-What is it?
-I checked everywhere.

1680
01:10:15,252 --> 01:10:16,337
You want us to continue investigating?

1681
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:17,838
CHO YO-SEP'S BODY?

1682
01:10:18,422 --> 01:10:20,466
AND…

1683
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,134
One's cracked.

1684
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:23,969
Exactly. One of them is cracked.

1685
01:10:24,803 --> 01:10:27,890
The contents leaked
and whitened the fabric beneath.

1686
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:32,061
You saw how all the fingers I had
were well preserved, right?

1687
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:36,941
To keep them that way,
they need to be submerged in formalin

1688
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:38,484
since it acts as a preservative.

1689
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:41,195
THE LEAKED FORMALIN
CAUSED THE DISCOLORATION

1690
01:10:41,278 --> 01:10:42,238
Check his pocket.

1691
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:44,990
-This one?
-Yes.

1692
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,284
What about it?

1693
01:10:47,993 --> 01:10:49,828
THE LINING OF HIS POCKET
IS ALSO DISCOLORED

1694
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:52,039
Does this mean Cho Yo-sep
had the tube in his pocket?

1695
01:10:52,122 --> 01:10:53,290
Yes, in this very pocket.

1696
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:55,000
CHO YO-SEP TOOK THE GLASS TUBE
FROM THE STORM DRAIN

1697
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,126
This is shocking.

1698
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,294
No one picked up on that.

1699
01:10:57,378 --> 01:10:58,420
HWANG BILLIONAIRE COLLECTED IT
AFTER KILLING HIM

1700
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:00,631
Man, you're something else.

1701
01:11:00,714 --> 01:11:02,174
IF ONLY WE HAD CHECKED HIS POCKET CLOSELY…

1702
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,425
This was a tough case to crack.

1703
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:05,302
How could you?

1704
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:06,929
I'm retiring as a detective.

1705
01:11:07,012 --> 01:11:08,347
KIM DETECTIVE
IDIOT

1706
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:09,682
The killer was impressive today.

1707
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:11,809
-Lucky you.
-He did a solid job.

1708
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:16,397
THE FULL STORY BEHIND
THE MURDER ON THE HANGANG BRIDGE

1709
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:19,358
During his time with the Hangang River
Water Rescue Team,

1710
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:21,151
Hwang Billionaire
often went on solo missions,

1711
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:23,821
earning resentment
from his fellow team members.

1712
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,532
Hidden beneath his headstrong behavior

1713
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:29,785
was an ugly secret.

1714
01:11:29,868 --> 01:11:30,786
He was addicted

1715
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:32,955
to a twisted hobby of finding thrill

1716
01:11:33,038 --> 01:11:36,875
in watching the life slip away
from drowning victims

1717
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,670
as they struggled underwater.

1718
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,089
Then one day,

1719
01:11:42,172 --> 01:11:44,842
he headed out on yet another
solo rescue mission,

1720
01:11:44,925 --> 01:11:47,636
following a report that a woman
had jumped into the river.

1721
01:11:48,345 --> 01:11:51,890
Just as he was about to watch her
take her final breath,

1722
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:56,145
he saw a group of men
sprinting toward her to rescue her.

1723
01:11:56,228 --> 01:11:59,690
Reacting swiftly,
he saved the woman instead.

1724
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:01,275
As it turned out,

1725
01:12:01,942 --> 01:12:05,946
she was the only daughter
of the Heaven Sent Group chaebol family.

1726
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:09,950
In a stroke of luck, Hwang Billionaire
not only became a hero who saved her life

1727
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:13,537
but also won her heart
and ended up marrying her.

1728
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:16,999
This ultimately secured him
the vice presidency at Heaven Sent Group.

1729
01:12:17,624 --> 01:12:18,834
However,

1730
01:12:18,917 --> 01:12:24,214
his father-in-law's blatant disdain
for a son-in-law of such humble origins

1731
01:12:24,298 --> 01:12:27,384
placed Hwang Billionaire
under immense stress.

1732
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:29,887
He decided to relieve himself

1733
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:32,264
by embracing the hobby
he had long turned away from.

1734
01:12:33,098 --> 01:12:34,808
He hired a contract killer

1735
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:37,186
to record snuff films of victims

1736
01:12:37,269 --> 01:12:38,854
and to cut off their fingers

1737
01:12:38,937 --> 01:12:41,940
that symbolize their final moments
before drowning.

1738
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:45,569
They made a secret arrangement
where the contractor placed his souvenirs

1739
01:12:45,652 --> 01:12:48,322
in the storm drain at a designated time
and received payment

1740
01:12:48,405 --> 01:12:50,240
after Hwang Billionaire collected them.

1741
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:53,160
While he endured

1742
01:12:53,243 --> 01:12:56,747
the ruthless life in the chaebol family
with the outlet he created,

1743
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:59,416
a rumor began to circulate
about Heaven Sent Group's impending doom

1744
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:02,544
due to the chairman's old age
and the company's declining business.

1745
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:05,714
Hwang Billionaire viewed this
as a chance to secure his footing

1746
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:07,132
in the company.

1747
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,425
So he began posting vlogs of him

1748
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:12,262
working as an honorary member
of the Water Rescue Team,

1749
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:14,098
highlighting his heroic and humble image.

1750
01:13:14,181 --> 01:13:16,725
Aided by the overwhelming public support
the videos attracted,

1751
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:21,146
he managed to win enough support
within the company as the future chairman.

1752
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:24,108
Behind the success of his vlogs

1753
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:27,403
was his junior colleague, Cho Yo-sep,

1754
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:31,156
who had always treated him with respect
ever since his Water Rescue Team days

1755
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,700
and helped film the videos
in any way he could.

1756
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:37,329
Over time, Hwang Billionaire
came to trust Cho Yo-sep deeply.

1757
01:13:37,955 --> 01:13:39,873
But one day,

1758
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:43,961
Hwang Billionaire
received a blackmail text.

1759
01:13:44,044 --> 01:13:47,089
To garner more views for the vlog,
they hired a temp worker

1760
01:13:47,172 --> 01:13:48,924
to pose as a drowning victim

1761
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:53,137
under the false promise of promoting them
to a full-time position.

1762
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,681
However, someone used
the secret contract as leverage

1763
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:58,058
to extort money from Hwang Billionaire.

1764
01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:01,437
While silencing the blackmailer
with a payoff,

1765
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:05,524
Hwang Billionaire had them tracked down.

1766
01:14:06,066 --> 01:14:07,860
His secretary found out

1767
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:09,987
that Cho Yo-sep was the blackmailer.

1768
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:12,114
It turned out Cho Yo-sep

1769
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:14,658
owed billions in gambling debt

1770
01:14:14,741 --> 01:14:16,493
and was also suspected of killing

1771
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:19,163
his two former wives
to claim their life insurance payouts

1772
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:21,331
by staging their deaths as accidents.

1773
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:23,250
Consumed by rage,

1774
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:27,045
Hwang Billionaire decided to hire
a contract killer to eliminate Cho Yo-sep.

1775
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:29,339
In the early morning of March 29th

1776
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:32,551
when heavy fine dust and thick fog
kept people indoors,

1777
01:14:33,093 --> 01:14:36,180
Hwang Billionaire planned to lure
Cho Yo-sep to Honey Chestnut Island

1778
01:14:36,722 --> 01:14:39,475
for the contract killer to eliminate him.

1779
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:42,644
And as per usual, he would be sent
a snuff film along with the finger

1780
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:46,148
as evidence that the task was completed.

1781
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:48,484
At 2:30 a.m.,

1782
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:52,112
while Cho Yo-sep was being dealt with
by the contract killer,

1783
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:54,573
Billionaire arrived at Cho Yo-sep's house

1784
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:57,409
to locate and destroy
the original contract.

1785
01:14:57,493 --> 01:15:01,205
Seeing that the door was open,
he entered the garage.

1786
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:05,709
There, he found Cho Yo-sep's wife,
Park So-yun, already cold to the touch.

1787
01:15:06,376 --> 01:15:09,171
Hwang Billionaire instinctively knew
she had been killed

1788
01:15:09,254 --> 01:15:12,674
like his two former wives
for a life insurance payout.

1789
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:17,471
However, the envelope he found
in the house contained something

1790
01:15:17,554 --> 01:15:21,767
even more shocking than the contract
he had been searching for.

1791
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:24,478
They were none other than
photos that exposed

1792
01:15:24,561 --> 01:15:27,356
the secret arrangement he had
with his contract killer,

1793
01:15:27,981 --> 01:15:31,818
which meant that Cho Yo-sep
could've realized

1794
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:34,738
that he was being targeted.

1795
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:39,618
Though his contract killer sent him a text
confirming that the job was done,

1796
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:42,287
he couldn't shake off his anxiety.

1797
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:43,455
Just then,

1798
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:46,250
he heard a noise coming from the garage.

1799
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:49,211
And what came next was Cho Yo-sep's voice.

1800
01:15:49,836 --> 01:15:53,131
As he suspected,
Cho Yo-sep was still alive.

1801
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:55,133
Given how things turned out,

1802
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:59,471
Hwang Billionaire decided that he had to
get rid of Cho Yo-sep himself.

1803
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:03,350
Just as he grabbed a box cutter
from the garage,

1804
01:16:03,433 --> 01:16:07,479
he heard Cho Yo-sep approaching
and quickly hid inside the car trunk.

1805
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:11,066
The car soon took off,
headed for its destination.

1806
01:16:11,149 --> 01:16:15,654
Moments later, he heard the car stop
and Cho Yo-sep get out.

1807
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:19,741
He pulled the lever
and climbed out to the back seat.

1808
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:22,828
The car was on the Hangang Bridge,

1809
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:25,414
and Cho Yo-sep
was searching the storm drain

1810
01:16:25,497 --> 01:16:27,374
that held evidence of a murder.

1811
01:16:28,041 --> 01:16:30,627
Hwang Billionaire
moved to the driver's seat immediately

1812
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:32,838
and drove the car
straight toward Cho Yo-sep.

1813
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:35,048
Fallen over from the impact,

1814
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:37,884
Cho Yo-sep tried to pull himself up
by grabbing the guardrail.

1815
01:16:37,968 --> 01:16:40,721
Hwang Billionaire then reversed the car
and launched it again,

1816
01:16:40,804 --> 01:16:42,639
hitting him even harder this time.

1817
01:16:43,223 --> 01:16:45,517
The force of the collision
deployed the airbag,

1818
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:48,312
causing Hwang Billionaire
to briefly lose consciousness.

1819
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:49,730
When he came to,

1820
01:16:49,813 --> 01:16:52,357
he saw that the car was sitting
on the edge of the bridge

1821
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:55,110
while Park So-yun's body
in the passenger seat

1822
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:58,405
was thrown out through the windshield.

1823
01:16:58,488 --> 01:17:01,325
He quickly got out of the car
to search the storm drain,

1824
01:17:01,408 --> 01:17:03,577
but there was nothing inside.

1825
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:07,414
Down in the river,
he saw Park So-yun's body caught on a buoy

1826
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:10,459
and Cho Yo-sep's body drifting away
with the current.

1827
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:12,377
He quickly climbed down
the ladder on the bridge,

1828
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,004
jumped into the river,

1829
01:17:14,087 --> 01:17:16,173
pulled Cho Yo-sep's body out,

1830
01:17:16,256 --> 01:17:19,926
and dragged it to the drainage channel
in the reed field.

1831
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:23,305
From the pocket
of the deceased Cho Yo-sep,

1832
01:17:23,388 --> 01:17:27,517
he retrieved the glass tube
with the finger and the snuff film,

1833
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:30,479
leaving the body concealed
in the drainage channel.

1834
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:34,483
Then, he returned to the crash site
on the Hangang Bridge

1835
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:37,361
and planned to make the crash appear
as another one of Cho Yo-sep's scams

1836
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:40,864
to receive an insurance payout
by killing his wife, Park So-yun.

1837
01:17:40,947 --> 01:17:43,241
The thick fine dust and fog

1838
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:46,995
would provide a plausible cover
for the scam to have gone fatally wrong.

1839
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:48,664
Using the emergency hammer,

1840
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:51,458
he smashed the windshield
on the driver's side

1841
01:17:51,541 --> 01:17:55,045
and ripped the airbag
with the box cutter from the garage,

1842
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:57,506
staging the crash
to appear as a car defect.

1843
01:17:58,215 --> 01:18:00,092
He also tore the seat belt
to make it look like

1844
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:02,302
it had been damaged in the accident.

1845
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:06,598
After staging the crime scene,
Hwang Billionaire returned to his office.

1846
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:09,059
He threw his wet clothes in a trash dump,

1847
01:18:09,142 --> 01:18:13,063
replaced the glass tube that had shattered
in the crash with a new one,

1848
01:18:13,146 --> 01:18:16,817
and stored the finger with the snuff film
in a hidden compartment in his cabinet,

1849
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,568
all the while hoping

1850
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:22,489
that his secret would be buried forever
along with Cho Yo-sep's death.

1851
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:27,494
An Dancer…

1852
01:18:27,577 --> 01:18:29,996
How can a dancer be so bad at dancing?

1853
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,707
My love for Gold Spoon is real.

1854
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:33,250
I don't get why she keeps coming on to me.

1855
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:34,918
Ms. Park Whole Chicken.

1856
01:18:35,001 --> 01:18:36,628
-How dare you?
-She's a bit rough.

1857
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:38,505
-Please, not your right fist.
-Save it for later.

1858
01:18:38,588 --> 01:18:39,965
I found him very suspicious.

1859
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:41,967
-Mr. Kim Club.
-I could just…

1860
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:44,594
Why, you little! I didn't see anything.

1861
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:46,346
He was even worse than I thought.

1862
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,473
The person who surprised me the most
was Jang C-store.

1863
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:50,475
Wait, you don't know?

1864
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:51,768
He's 27.

1865
01:18:51,852 --> 01:18:54,229
-Stay out of this, will you?
-I don't know, you brat.

1866
01:18:54,312 --> 01:18:55,731
The grown-ups are talking!

1867
01:18:58,024 --> 01:19:00,819
Everyone seemed so suspicious.

1868
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:04,156
That Mr. Gold Spoon's
being really sketchy.

1869
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:05,824
Let me explain.

1870
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:07,367
Explain what? Don't bother.

1871
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:09,369
-We already know everything.
-We don't need it.

1872
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:10,829
You can head down now. Let's go.

1873
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:12,539
-Let's check someplace else.
-I'm disappointed.

1874
01:19:12,622 --> 01:19:13,874
We got it. We're good.

1875
01:20:08,887 --> 01:20:13,892
