1
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,637
-I have to see it.
-You're going to watch it on the laptop?

2
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:13,930
MURDER AT THE FUNERAL HALL II

3
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,598
You know what privacy is, don't you?

4
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,308
-Turn up the volume.
-"Park Wife."

5
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,601
CHECKING PARK WIFE'S MEMORY CARD

6
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:21,521
-Oh dear.
-What's this?

7
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:23,398
-What the heck?
-Who is it?

8
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:24,816
-Hang on.
-What the hell?

9
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,320
-Oh dear.
-What's this?

10
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,697
-What the heck?
-Who is it?

11
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,282
-Hang on.
-What the hell?

12
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,491
PARK WIFE AND KIM SWEETHEART?

13
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,535
What is it?

14
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,162
Do you even have to ask?

15
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:41,166
I want to record
every single moment I spend with you.

16
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,251
-What did she say?
-"I want to record every moment with you."

17
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:45,712
-What the hell?
-One, two, three.

18
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,340
A SUDDEN PIANO DUET

19
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,470
-Are they crazy?
-This is insane.

20
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,765
They're playing it so frivolously.

21
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,354
-You've got to be kidding me right now.
-What the heck?

22
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,814
-What do we do?
-Is it something funny?

23
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,693
-Are they crazy?
-Read the room, will you?

24
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,028
This is unbelievable.

25
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,280
-Man, what on earth were they thinking?
-No way.

26
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:19,871
-Is this Secret Affair or what?
-We both look great on camera, don't we?

27
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,713
-I love the vibe.
-Don't we make a cute couple?

28
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:29,672
We do, babe.

29
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,883
-Who flails around like that on the piano?
-"Babe"?

30
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,176
Gosh, stop it.

31
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:37,722
Oh man. I really wanted to
keep this a secret.

32
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,728
This is a special compliment.

33
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,021
"A special compliment"?

34
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,231
A MOAN?

35
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,192
-This is wild.
-Hey, someone stop her.

36
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,735
That's enough.

37
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,487
-Hey, someone stop her.
-That's enough.

38
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,073
-Hey, someone stop her.
-That's enough.

39
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,700
How disgusting.

40
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,286
-Hold on, let me get this straight.
-Hang on.

41
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,580
These two.

42
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,624
These two.

43
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,459
I'm not involved.
Why are you looking at me?

44
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,752
-You're next.
-And us two?

45
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,796
My relationship is fairly new.

46
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,713
These two.

47
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,631
FORMER LOVERS

48
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:12,924
ENGAGED

49
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,092
NEW LOVERS

50
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,802
My relationship is fairly new.

51
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:16,970
I'm getting a headache.

52
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:20,223
-This man came here to destroy our family.
-Babe.

53
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,308
-Babe, don't badmouth me.
-I'm not your "babe."

54
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,018
FIRST LOVE "BABE"
(FORMERLY) JOO LOSER

55
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,813
You need to clarify
who you mean by "babe."

56
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,064
What's the matter, babe?

57
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,067
But I'm the best. You can't do this to me.

58
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:35,071
-Hey, then number us or something.
-Babe.

59
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,364
Should I number you girls by age?

60
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,909
I guess he's very indiscriminate.

61
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,287
I mean, he used to be into me.

62
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,664
How could he fall
for someone like Park Wife?

63
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,792
He definitely has an ulterior motive.

64
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,544
-Who does your heart belong to?
-Man, I'm tired.

65
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,798
-Point to the person or something.
-So who killed Jang Youngest?

66
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,383
Enough with the romance!

67
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,385
I don't know about that.
But gather around, babes.

68
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,387
I just found a key piece of evidence.

69
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,638
-What is it?
-Babe!

70
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,099
Where did you
get the herbal medicine from?

71
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,518
It was Ha K-Doctor's
Korean Medicine Clinic, right?

72
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,561
Yeah.

73
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,730
A MOMENT AGO

74
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,692
INSIDE PARK WIFE'S JEWELRY BOX

75
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:14,611
MEDICINE CLINIC RECEIPTS

76
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,237
The herbal medicine cost a fortune.

77
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,990
The receipts were for 30 million,
30 million, 25 million,

78
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,159
and 20 million won.

79
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,786
They were in this babe's jewelry box.

80
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,955
They were in this babe's jewelry box.

81
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,290
What? Park Wife's jewelry box?

82
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,000
Did you harm Daughter-in-law,
my first babe?

83
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,003
-See? I knew it.
-I mean…

84
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,880
Am I your third babe, then?

85
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,716
-You're the oldest but you're the third.
-You bitch.

86
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,884
-See?
-Babes.

87
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,510
-You bitch!
-Hey!

88
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,846
GRABBING EACH OTHER'S HAIR AGAIN

89
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,099
You think you're so innocent?

90
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,644
What makes you think
you have the right to grab my hair?

91
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,271
This is the kind of stuff
you see a lot at funerals.

92
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,107
Babes, don't fight. Please stop.

93
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,360
-You saw her faking it just now, right?
-Babes.

94
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,904
She flopped over
when I wasn't even touching her!

95
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,864
-Yeah, that deserves a yellow card.
-Exactly.

96
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,741
-But I can't tell what's yellow.
-No, that deserves a red.

97
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:02,992
Get me something yellow.

98
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,287
Babe, are you okay?

99
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,664
-You okay?
-You shut it.

100
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,581
(DISPLEASED)

101
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:09,958
You seem to be drooling a lot.

102
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,709
-Hear me out.
-No, how…

103
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,169
Let me ask you one thing.

104
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,420
Why, those darned…

105
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,797
Babe, where are you going?

106
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,048
-Babe!
-Where did it go?

107
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,591
My ugliest babe!

108
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,970
-Where are you going?
-Explain yourself. What are those?

109
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,596
Okay, hear me out.

110
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,557
Imagine if she and Second Son

111
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,976
actually had a son.

112
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,519
Think about the line of succession.

113
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,062
-It'd get complicated.
-It puts you at a disadvantage too.

114
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,940
How dare you think such a thing?
You're just a mistress.

115
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,275
Babe, even so,

116
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,986
scheming to make her infertile
is crossing the line.

117
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,737
-Aren't you even a little sorry?
-My babe here

118
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,657
-could've become permanently infertile.
-Oh, she's mad. You're dead meat now.

119
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,741
-Look at that.
-Babe, wait.

120
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:47,245
You're dead meat now.
Look at that. You're so dead now.

121
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,330
Goodness gracious. Careful!

122
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,959
THE CLUB MAKES AN APPEARANCE

123
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,253
-Oh, she's mad. You're dead meat now.
-Babe.

124
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,046
-Look at that.
-Babe, wait.

125
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,424
-You're so dead now.
-Babe, what the heck is that?

126
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,134
-Hold on, I'm going to…
-Wait, babe.

127
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:05,513
-Hey, sis. I'll step out for a moment.
-Babe, please don't get so worked up.

128
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,765
-She has anger issues.
-Don't get worked up.

129
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:08,766
All right.

130
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,227
Get the hell out
if you don't want to end up dead.

131
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,480
-Babe… I mean, babes!
-Wait.

132
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,066
Let's get one thing straight.
He seduced me first.

133
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,318
You want to die too?

134
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,778
You're the one who flirted with me first!

135
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,906
-You were the one who made things steamy.
-Me, make things steamy?

136
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,700
-I'm always like that.
-Why'd you play the piano?

137
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,118
-Why'd you do it?
-Babe, wait.

138
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,537
Where did you get that from?
I've never seen that before.

139
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,122
Babe, calm down.

140
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,249
Let's just find the culprit together.

141
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,126
Once we catch the culprit,

142
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,961
-I'm going to kill you first, so be quick.
-Babe.

143
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:40,089
-Okay, I'll go find the culprit quickly.
-I'm not crazy about him now either.

144
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,052
I swear, the both of you.

145
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,136
Damn it.

146
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,138
This family is so scary.

147
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,306
This won't do.

148
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:50,892
That bastard.

149
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,395
This little punk…

150
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,980
JANG YOUNGEST'S ROOM

151
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,775
I'll search this place from top to bottom.

152
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,778
What's this stuff all over it?

153
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,488
Oh my.

154
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,865
What's all this? Oh my gosh!

155
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,451
Come over here, Detective.

156
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,412
Isn't this Kim Sweetheart's?

157
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,290
-What?
-He was always wearing that scarf.

158
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,666
Blond hair?

159
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,752
-Isn't this Park Wife's?
-Yeah, exactly!

160
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,546
These must be
those tacky highlights of hers.

161
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,090
This was in Youngest's room.

162
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,133
Youngest must've found out.

163
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,844
Did Youngest know
that you two were dating?

164
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,221
-Be honest.
-Did he catch you or not?

165
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,766
-He did. He was smart after all.
-Of course.

166
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,810
-I knew it.
-How could you be so shameless?

167
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,478
Unbelievable.

168
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,146
-So?
-What happened then?

169
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,940
-So I told him…
-What'd my sweetie pie say?

170
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,651
"Is it a crime to be in love?"

171
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,111
Oh dear.

172
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:47,323
Then that little brat got pissed
and threw a fit.

173
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,658
What did he say he was going to do?

174
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,660
-Did he say he'd kill him?
-He said he'd tell his father.

175
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,620
So he said he'd tell his father.

176
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,122
You would've had to stop him, then.

177
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:57,125
Even then,
do you think I'd kill my own son?

178
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,669
You wouldn't know
since you've never had a child.

179
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,046
You wouldn't know
since you've never had a child.

180
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,424
Are you serious?

181
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,178
-The club's in that room over there.
-Where is it?

182
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,473
I'm getting goosebumps
from just talking to you.

183
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,434
Hey, let me get this straight.

184
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,812
That guy took advantage
of both you and me.

185
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,981
We're both victims here, you know.

186
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:23,109
You shouldn't be angry at me.

187
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,820
Direct that anger to Kim Sweetheart.
He's our common enemy.

188
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,197
Fair enough.

189
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,866
Do you see any scratch marks?

190
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,868
-This here…
-This is…

191
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,994
This is it.

192
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,495
(LIFT GOES UP)

193
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,580
This is it.

194
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,415
-Right.
-You don't need to be strong.

195
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,958
-Yeah.
-Anyone can reach the top drawers.

196
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,501
Since it goes up, yeah.

197
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,795
This lift here
goes up and down automatically.

198
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,301
ANOTHER MORTUARY LIFT

199
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,473
Yeah, you don't need to be strong.

200
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,851
Strength isn't an issue here.
Why did we think it must've been a man?

201
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,020
-It could've been one of the women.
-You're right.

202
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,771
Any one of those women
could've easily killed him.

203
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,148
WOMEN CAN'T BE RULED OUT

204
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,984
There must be something more here.

205
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,280
SEARCHING KIM SWEETHEART'S ROOM

206
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,874
HIDDEN AMONG THE PAPER CLIPS

207
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,627
A MEMORY CARD

208
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,838
Everyone! I found something
in Kim Sweetheart's room.

209
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,757
It's some kind of chip.

210
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,258
Where was it, exactly?

211
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,344
In your room, Kim Sweetheart.

212
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,261
-Oh my.
-Oh my.

213
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,055
-What did she find?
-A chip.

214
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,848
I knew that bastard was up to no good.

215
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,226
"That bastard"? That's too harsh.

216
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,979
-Whatever it is, stop right there!
-We should check it out.

217
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,774
I knew that bastard
was hiding some other secret.

218
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,484
-Small chip? Okay.
-A small chip?

219
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:47,610
-In here?
-In here.

220
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,195
-Just stop.
-Put it in, yes.

221
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,489
-What's this?
-Dopamine… Oh my.

222
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,157
-What the?
-Step back a bit.

223
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,492
-What is it?
-Is it me again?

224
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,579
-What's this?
-Dopamine… Oh my.

225
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,248
-What the?
-Step back a bit.

226
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,624
-What is it?
-Is it me again?

227
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,964
Sleep well, my love. Good night.

228
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,303
-No way. What is this?
-What do you mean?

229
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,764
Sleep well, my love. Good night.

230
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,057
WAS THAT KISS FOR KIM SWEETHEART?

231
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,058
Wait, is that it?

232
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,351
There's one more.

233
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,645
-Recorded 35 minutes later.
-Yeah, 35 minutes later.

234
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,189
-Play it.
-Haven't you done enough digging?

235
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,358
Chairman Jang?

236
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,943
-That's Father.
-It's a safe!

237
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,820
-Chairman Jang?
-It's a safe!

238
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,281
-That's Father.
-That's Chairman Jang.

239
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,450
Everyone, take a step back
so all of us can see the screen.

240
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,121
JANG BREADWINNER

241
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,295
-There's the passcode.
-The passcode was recorded.

242
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,214
The will must be in there.

243
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,217
-Is that a gold bar?
-A gold bar.

244
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,678
-What is that?
-Let's try opening it.

245
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,805
Let's see the passcode again.

246
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,515
Wait, let's rewind it.

247
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,310
He pressed the buttons like this.

248
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,228
He pressed four buttons in the top rows.

249
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:08,357
WHAT'S THE PASSCODE FOR THE SAFE?

250
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,942
I got it. Let's go.

251
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,945
ENTERING 7634

252
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,905
-It's wrong.
-Dang it.

253
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,199
The hint is the "kimchi" of Jang's Kimchi.

254
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,993
"Kimchi."

255
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,329
-Seven, one…
-"Kimchi."

256
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,747
Is it 7631, then?

257
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:24,832
Could this be it?

258
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,876
-It opened.
-Nice.

259
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,211
-There we go.
-What the heck?

260
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,463
-Jeez.
-What is this?

261
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,673
-What is this?
-It must be the will.

262
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,926
-This is what's important.
-"To Chairman Jang Breadwinner."

263
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,804
No, I think this is the report
Kim Secretary gave him

264
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,849
right before he met his lawyer
on the day he passed.

265
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,184
-Yeah?
-So what's it about?

266
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,311
-Why that little… What the heck?
-What's this?

267
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,646
-What the heck?
-"Joo Daughter-in-law."

268
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:47,813
-Who's that?
-"Every Wednesday."

269
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,149
It's about their affair.

270
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,610
-Her and Manager Jang Youngest.
-That's my sweetie pie and me.

271
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,612
So Chairman Jang had found out about you.

272
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,530
Oh, for goodness' sake.

273
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,115
Is there anything else?

274
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,785
Wait, what's this?

275
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,078
AND ONE MORE THING

276
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,372
-That's Youngest.
-Isn't that Youngest?

277
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,374
-Why is the photo torn?
-Where's the other half?

278
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,626
Was it you beside him?

279
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,169
I'm not sure.

280
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,212
-What?
-What do you mean?

281
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,838
-What if it's Sweetheart?
-Babe.

282
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,715
My babe Joo. I'll tell you.

283
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,302
-Babe.
-What?

284
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,554
Is he drunk? What's with him?

285
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,473
You're…

286
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,434
-in here.
-What are you saying?

287
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,186
-…in here.
-What are you saying?

288
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,771
-In here…
-What's he doing?

289
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,940
-I have my babe Joo.
-He's just nuts.

290
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,483
-What's wrong with him?
-He's a nutjob.

291
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,943
-I have my babe Joo.
-He's just nuts.

292
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,528
-What's wrong with him?
-He's a nutjob.

293
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,407
-That lunatic.
-What are you saying?

294
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,616
How much glue did you use?

295
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,494
Are you crazy or high?
You're creeping me out.

296
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,956
You opened the safe, ripped the picture,
and stuck it to your shirt?

297
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,209
-No way!
-I figured out the passcode

298
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,877
and then saw this.

299
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,796
You're still not over me, are you?

300
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,423
I'll just come clean.

301
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,632
To be honest,

302
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,969
I actually came here
to get revenge on my first babe

303
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,097
because she dumped me
and chose a chaebol family.

304
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,390
She's obsessed with money.

305
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,933
This guy was poor.

306
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,893
Why not kill her
or take revenge on her directly?

307
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,395
-No.
-Why seduce me?

308
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,355
-My revenge plan
-Because he still likes me.

309
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,358
was to destroy the chaebol family
she loved so much.

310
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,402
He wanted to completely destroy us.

311
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,988
Wiping out this entire chaebol family.

312
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,531
-That was my goal.
-I knew it.

313
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,783
Is that why you wiped out Youngest too?

314
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,201
How did you wipe him out?

315
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,412
So I joined the company
under false pretenses

316
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,831
and dug up all its secrets.

317
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,875
And it turns out
the key to their kimchi's flavor is MSG.

318
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,378
And the chairman preferred
diced radish kimchi over regular kimchi.

319
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,589
-That can't be true.
-What's the use of knowing that?

320
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,965
It's completely useless!

321
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,926
So I decided to infiltrate this family.

322
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,219
So you tried to join the family?

323
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:46,140
It was a real struggle
dating Jang Daughter.

324
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,975
-Yeah, I can see that.
-How tough was it?

325
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:51,061
-It was the hardest time in my life--
-But your feelings were true.

326
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,606
Why are you being like this?
Don't make excuses like that.

327
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,524
It was actually tougher
than my military service.

328
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,444
-Don't lie to me again.
-So what did you do with Youngest?

329
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,279
I don't know anything about Youngest.

330
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,865
I wanted to find out
this family's secrets,

331
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,241
which is why I seduced this babe.

332
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,786
-Pick one person to be your babe now.
-Okay.

333
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:07,953
It's getting so confusing.

334
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,622
No, here's the thing about love.

335
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,582
It never stays in one place!

336
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,844
-Babe!
-Just make him yours.

337
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,597
Even I have limits. Do you know
how hard it's been for me, babe?

338
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,182
The best punishment you can give him

339
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,725
is making him yours.

340
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,228
The best punishment? But I'm the best!

341
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,023
I'm going to make you mine.

342
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,152
But if the will isn't here either,
where on earth is it?

343
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,280
Hurry up…

344
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:45,741
What is it?

345
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,118
Hurry up and find the key.

346
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,119
What is it?

347
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,706
Why was Father so good
at squirreling things away?

348
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,875
-Seriously.
-Have you already seen this too?

349
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,085
What is it?

350
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,170
-He's seen it all. What's this?
-He must've.

351
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,172
-He must've.
-What's this?

352
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,384
-"NF Bio, DNA Test Results"?
-"DNA Test Results"?

353
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,219
-"Jang Breadwinner, male."
-"Kim Sweetheart."

354
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,178
"Paternity test."

355
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,098
-Look at this!
-I knew it!

356
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,516
Look at this! That son of a bitch!

357
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,352
"Kim Sweetheart. Paternity test."

358
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,522
JANG BREADWINNER AND KIM SWEETHEART
PROBABILITY OF PATERNITY: 99.99999999999%

359
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,024
Look at this! That son of a bitch!
You're my little brother.

360
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,776
-So this is how it goes.
-Hey.

361
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,486
Come on now.

362
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,114
I'm actually the son of a chaebol family.

363
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,241
The youngest son of a chaebol family.

364
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,200
Just like that?

365
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,619
How many personalities do you have,
you wacko?

366
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,873
-Does that mean I dated my stepson?
-The youngest son of a chaebol family.

367
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,585
What kind of twisted storyline is this?

368
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,128
-Wait, that means…
-This is fun. Keep going.

369
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,130
He dated his stepmother

370
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,631
and his older sister?!

371
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,676
You've got to be kidding me.

372
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,678
Can you please turn around?

373
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:48,762
-I'm your older sister!
-Hang on.

374
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,764
-Okay, please turn around.
-Wait, I need to know.

375
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,475
Did you sleep with him or not?

376
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,228
Oh, I can't! My goodness!

377
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,898
Oh, I can't! My goodness!

378
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,191
-Oh, my stomach! I feel sick!
-Damn it!

379
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,028
What do I do now?

380
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,237
-I'm losing my mind here.
-Listen.

381
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,990
Listen, you people!
I'm the one who suffered the most here!

382
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,242
This guy's a complete lunatic.

383
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,535
Put him in jail already.

384
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,580
Just look at Jang Daughter's face
up close for three seconds.

385
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,206
I feel so sorry for you.

386
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,000
I've only dated one guy my whole life,

387
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,668
and he was my younger brother.

388
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,339
My little sister's the one
I feel most sorry for.

389
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,925
How is Daughter
supposed to go on with her life now?

390
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,553
It'd actually be better to find some way
to send her to the afterlife too.

391
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,430
She can't possibly live with this pain.

392
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,432
It's been a long way around,

393
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:36,602
but I ended up by my true love's side,
Joo Daughter-in-law.

394
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,896
-There he goes again.
-He's actually insane.

395
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,022
Joo Woodlouse.

396
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,398
-Unbelievable.
-Joo Loser!

397
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,026
Love?

398
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:45,778
Don't be ridiculous.

399
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,488
I'll buy your love with money.

400
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,407
How much? How much do you need?

401
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,326
I'll rip your jaw off, I swear.

402
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,869
I'm a chaebol family's son now.

403
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,829
Isn't that what you've always wanted?

404
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,665
Let me think it over for a bit.

405
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,166
I'm good enough now, aren't I?

406
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,834
Think about it carefully.

407
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,795
Let's make something clear.

408
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,589
If the will
doesn't grant him any inheritance,

409
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,508
he won't become a chaebol family's son.

410
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:11,971
Then, Youngest is probably named
as the sole beneficiary in the will.

411
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,389
-Right.
-Sweetheart needed him gone.

412
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,432
So he can have you all to himself.

413
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,811
To claim me and this household.

414
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,355
He's crazy enough to do that.

415
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,692
I merely got my way into this family
to get my revenge

416
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,986
and ended up finding my love again.

417
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,613
Above all, Kim Sweetheart
found his way into this family

418
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,157
because he was after me.

419
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,869
But if Youngest disappeared,

420
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:40,874
he could be the only one in the family

421
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,876
to be named the successor.

422
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,212
I think he predicted to some degree

423
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,464
that his inheritance

424
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,092
would probably draw me back to him.

425
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:55,014
Hey, how'd you take those photos anyway?
I mean those videos.

426
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:59,143
THE TWO VIDEOS WERE RECORDED

427
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:02,187
FROM A SPOT FACING THE SAFE

428
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,273
-What photos?
-Did you hide something over there?

429
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,733
-The videos. Using a camera.
-Oh, the videos.

430
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:06,984
What if it's this?

431
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,112
-The picture frame?
-Oh, I took a look there

432
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,572
but there was nothing behind it.

433
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,198
-But look at the eyes!
-What's this?

434
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,701
-But look at the eyes!
-What's this?

435
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,661
-What's with her face here?
-Look.

436
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,329
-What's with the eye here?
-Let's see.

437
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,414
It's Kim Sweetheart.

438
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,749
We have this.

439
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,044
Oh, you're right. He's in there.

440
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,337
-Sweetheart gave this to me as a gift
-Here in her eye.

441
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,590
and said, "In this eye, there's me."

442
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,426
-He told me to look at it every night.
-He's really in there.

443
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,094
-My poor father.
-Look, I'm not crazy.

444
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,180
I didn't give a goodnight kiss
into thin air.

445
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,097
Babe.

446
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,809
To be honest,
I just needed the passcode for that safe.

447
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,186
How dare you call me "babe"?

448
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,604
-Is there a camera?
-A camera?

449
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,398
WHERE IS THE CAMERA
USED FOR RECORDING THOSE VIDEOS?

450
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,694
-Wait, hang on.
-I don't think there's one in here.

451
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:51,612
Hang on.

452
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,614
Hang on.

453
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:54,740
BACK OF THE FRAME OPENED

454
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,033
That's why you're the detective.

455
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,785
-Wow.
-No way.

456
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,328
What's this? Remove that cover.

457
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,662
Hey, here it is!

458
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,206
What's this? Remove that cover.

459
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,624
Hey, here it is!

460
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:04,875
-There it is.
-A hidden camera.

461
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,252
-Detective.
-Why, that son of a bitch. Jeez.

462
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,880
Isn't this enough to arrest him?

463
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:13,133
-Actually, I replaced the SD card in it.
-Why don't you toss him into jail?

464
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:17,513
This might contain some new footage.

465
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,640
-I didn't get to check this yet.
-Hey, you.

466
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,934
Check if there's footage
of when Father passed away.

467
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,393
JANG BREADWINNER'S DEATH
COULD'VE BEEN RECORDED

468
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,896
Gross. Erase everything and throw it away!

469
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,815
-No! Hey, you!
-What are you doing?

470
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,192
Gross. Erase everything and throw it away!

471
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,820
-No! Hey, you!
-What are you doing?

472
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,447
-What did you do?
-What do you mean?

473
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,826
-Did what?
-Sis! What did you do, sis?

474
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,286
-What, you son of a bitch?
-She got mad all of a sudden.

475
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,289
-There's nothing on it.
-You go stay in that room.

476
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,749
WHAT'S IN THE NEW MEMORY CARD?

477
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,668
-This is so entertaining.
-This is off the rails.

478
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,169
The 28th!

479
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,504
-That's the day--
-Before he passed.

480
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,588
You're right.

481
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,843
-Why can't it be me?
-"Why can't it be me?"

482
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,886
Why won't you give me anything?

483
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,097
-Oh dear.
-I refuse to accept your decision, Father!

484
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,765
-Earlier…
-What? "Refuse to accept"?

485
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:02,808
Who do you think you are?

486
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,434
Get out of my sight!

487
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,853
I won't leave!

488
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,187
This is mine!

489
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,438
How dare you!

490
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,190
Give it back right now!

491
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,441
Never!

492
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,361
Jang's Kimchi Banchan is mine!

493
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,779
No one else

494
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:16,905
can have it!

495
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,706
SHOCKED

496
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:26,915
Get over here.

497
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:29,710
-What the…
-Come here.

498
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:30,836
No, he didn't die.

499
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,629
He didn't? It looked like he did.

500
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,841
-It'd be weird if he didn't after that!
-He's clearly passed.

501
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,968
Father?

502
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,433
Daughter, help me.

503
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,437
Please help me.

504
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,565
If you ran away when he asked for help,
you're not even human.

505
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,485
-She's not human.
-Oh! She's not human, all right.

506
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,364
-Get over here. Hey.
-I didn't know he would pass away.

507
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,783
-Hey, grit your teeth.
-Hear me out.

508
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,745
-Grit your damn teeth.
-I swear I didn't know.

509
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,580
It was strange how Chairman Jang
died so suddenly

510
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:09,416
-when he was healthy.
-See? I told you it wasn't natural causes.

511
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,878
-It wasn't like that.
-Then what were you two arguing about?

512
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,046
The subsidiary.

513
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,965
-Jang's Kimchi Banchan.
-I wondered why you got flustered earlier.

514
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,425
I told you she was suspicious!

515
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,344
No wonder her hands were shaking!

516
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,554
I'm the best!

517
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,640
But I'm the best. You can't do this to me.

518
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,059
As if her mug isn't bad enough,
she's as greedy as a pig too.

519
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:30,729
She's had quite the temper
since she was young.

520
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,523
I had no idea
she was eyeing the subsidiary.

521
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,568
I guess she wanted to
be appointed as its CEO,

522
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,279
but as you know,
you can hardly call her competent.

523
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,573
No wonder my husband shot her down.

524
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,283
How dare you!

525
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,576
Give it back right now!

526
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,827
Never!

527
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,249
DURING A HEATED ARGUMENT
OVER THE APPOINTMENT LETTER…

528
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,500
No one else can have it!

529
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,086
…JANG BREADWINNER FELL DOWN THE STAIRS

530
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,712
Did he say he'd give the job to Youngest?

531
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,798
No, I didn't know who it was going to be.

532
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,466
I just took the appointment letter

533
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:00,926
and wrote my name on it.

534
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,096
In any case, it was all but decided
that Youngest would be the successor.

535
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,847
No, we don't know that.

536
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,057
We don't know that.

537
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,185
-Anyone could tell it was going to be him.
-It was clear to everybody.

538
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,395
I don't know

539
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,272
There's no way of knowing

540
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,274
She must be out of her mind.

541
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:19,152
-How did I even date her?
-But you know…

542
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,238
This is murder,
so she'd be arrested, right?

543
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,156
-One creep installing a hidden camera,
-No!

544
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,324
-and one murderer.
-No!

545
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,159
I swear it wasn't murder.

546
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,744
He collapsed,

547
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:31,456
and I simply left him there,
thinking he wouldn't die from that.

548
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,250
She claimed she merely neglected him,

549
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,002
but she caused his death
and neglected him.

550
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,422
If Youngest had somehow
found out about this,

551
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:42,050
wouldn't that have been enough motive
for Daughter to kill him?

552
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,052
I'll have to look for more clues.

553
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,054
Don't forget Youngest's cabinet.

554
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,015
Right, how do we open his cabinet?

555
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,725
Oh, Youngest's cabinet?

556
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,642
Hang on.

557
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,188
EXAMINING JANG YOUNGEST'S BODY AGAIN

558
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,818
If this is a promise ring
he exchanged with Joo Daughter-in-law,

559
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,278
shouldn't she have one too?

560
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,781
-I saw one over here.
-It's similar to the ring over there.

561
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,701
Look here. This ring.

562
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,703
Wait a minute. Take one out.

563
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,497
-The ones in the middle are missing!
-One pair is missing.

564
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,208
-There's a pair missing in the middle.
-Yeah, exactly.

565
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,128
-It's similar. It's this one.
-Why would the rings here go missing?

566
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:20,756
It's a phone!

567
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,090
It's a phone!

568
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,217
-We found a phone.
-Whose is it?

569
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,263
-Hey, isn't this Youngest's?
-Yes, it's Manager Jang Youngest's.

570
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,640
What's that? Is it a video?

571
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,272
A VIDEO OF JANG DAUGHTER?

572
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,107
I didn't know you played the piano.

573
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,943
She's good.

574
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,528
She seems very angry.

575
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,447
What could've pissed her off?

576
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,535
-My, that's scary.
-It's like she's possessed.

577
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,496
-That's scary.
-Man, this is insane.

578
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:55,582
From the way it's moving,
it looks like someone filmed by hand, no?

579
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,334
-It must've been Youngest.
-Youngest, of course.

580
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,718
-Gosh, that's scary.
-So scary.

581
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,012
With these skills,
you would've done better

582
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,556
as a professional pianist
than as a kimchi businesswoman.

583
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,141
You're the one who made me like this,

584
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:14,976
Father.

585
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,563
So don't feel so wronged.

586
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,109
At least you gave me one thing

587
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,319
before you passed.

588
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,407
-She knew it then.
-She knew he was dead.

589
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,284
-You knew he was dead.
-No, I really didn't know.

590
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,161
By "one thing,"
she meant that thing, right?

591
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,830
-Jang's Kimchi Banchan.
-Yeah.

592
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,374
"Jang Daughter."

593
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,793
-Youngest sent her a text.
-Saying what?

594
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,002
"I heard everything you said."

595
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,755
"I'm going to tell everyone
when Father's will is disclosed."

596
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,842
-So he was going to reveal it
-That she killed her father.

597
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:50,679
-during the will reading.
-December 30th, 2 a.m.

598
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,265
-She'd have to kill him then.
-And she must've done it.

599
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,558
-She had to.
-Tell us your story.

600
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:55,809
So how did you do it?

601
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:56,852
I…

602
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,563
read that text

603
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,399
at 4:10 a.m.

604
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:03,900
I went looking for him,

605
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,986
-wondering what exactly he had seen.
-To kill him?

606
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,989
No, he said he saw something,
but I had no idea what.

607
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,532
I didn't even know he filmed that.

608
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,660
So I went around looking for him,
but I never found him.

609
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,537
I didn't run into him once.

610
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,123
Okay, that's enough.
There's one more text.

611
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,666
It was sent to Daughter-in-law

612
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,085
at 4:50 a.m. on the 30th,

613
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,420
and it reads, "I made up my mind."

614
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:24,838
Made up his mind for what?

615
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,756
-At 4:50 a.m.?
-Yeah, at 4:50 a.m.

616
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,926
-But that's right before he died.
-Exactly.

617
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,595
To tell you the truth,

618
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:34,473
I saw her talking to Manager Jang
in private at 4:30 a.m.

619
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,515
Where?

620
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,934
I overheard them talking
somewhere in the lobby.

621
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,644
They said something about going away.

622
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,688
-Right, flying with Fungmu Air.
-Yeah.

623
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,233
Let's hear what he made up his mind about.

624
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,819
He made up his mind to be with me forever.

625
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,446
Don't be ridiculous.

626
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,405
-It's true.
-Forever?

627
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,656
Then give me your bag.

628
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,700
SEARCHING JOO DAUGHTER-IN-LAW'S BAG

629
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:56,369
His love for me

630
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,371
was so very pure.

631
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,248
Here's the ring.

632
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,834
She must've stolen it from over there.

633
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:06,171
Stole what? My sweetie pie
bought it for me as a promise ring.

634
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,965
-He made up his mind here and bought them?
-Who wears rings from the mortuary

635
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,634
-as promise rings?
-So that's what happened.

636
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,219
Do you know why he made up his mind here?

637
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:16,264
Because my father-in-law, the person
who was so against our relationship,

638
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,599
passed away, leaving us to be free.

639
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,559
He bought them here to commemorate that.

640
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:22,854
-Here's her phone.
-He bought it for me.

641
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,148
Oh dear. Please be quiet, everyone.

642
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,066
Did you find something?

643
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,904
A voice message from sweetie pie.

644
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:35,283
I'm sorry I said
I'd announce our marriage to the family

645
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:39,120
not knowing you were going through
something that difficult.

646
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,998
I don't care if you can't get pregnant

647
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,501
or if you can't marry me.

648
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,669
That rat bastard.

649
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:48,129
The only thing that matters to me

650
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,714
is you.

651
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:50,632
Crazy bastard.

652
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,300
My family, my status, and the inheritance…

653
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,011
I can give them all up.

654
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,222
-He's so romantic.
-Let's just go

655
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:01,017
to a remote village in France

656
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,688
and live happily, just the two of us.

657
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,523
But that's unacceptable for her.

658
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,191
-You bet.
-That must be why she killed him.

659
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,776
That's her motive.

660
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:10,986
That's ridiculous.

661
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,113
His feelings for me were so genuine,

662
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,531
-unlike someone.
-Enough of that crap.

663
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,702
-I can't take this nonsense anymore.
-I could say the same about you.

664
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,663
Seriously though,

665
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,249
Youngest was such a pure, innocent kid.

666
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:28,128
He said he didn't need the family fortune
or his ties to the family.

667
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,963
And that talk about France?
How ridiculous.

668
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,381
She's never even been to France.

669
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:34,384
That girl has burning ambition.

670
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,052
There's no way she'd go for any of that.

671
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,887
I felt terrible, but what else could I do?

672
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,015
I had to break up with him,

673
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,058
-and he took it really hard.
-My poor Youngest.

674
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,728
When did you break up with him?
Was it last night?

675
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,689
-Yes, early in the morning.
-Give us the exact time.

676
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,942
It was around 3 a.m.
when I saw him drinking,

677
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,486
and I had broken things off before that.

678
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:57,240
So that's why he drank so much.
He was upset about the breakup.

679
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,909
Seemed like it. But I just left him alone.

680
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:03,913
Why didn't you answer Youngest's calls
from around 4:20 a.m.?

681
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,916
Of course, I didn't answer.
I just ended things with him.

682
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,543
Why would I answer his calls?

683
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,212
-My poor child, drinking his tears away.
-He kept begging me to stay.

684
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,881
He called you at 4:20 a.m.?

685
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,883
-Yes.
-But you met him at 4:30 a.m.

686
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,218
Well, because he kept begging.

687
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,472
So you kept ignoring all his calls
but saw him when he came to you?

688
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:23,016
-Yes, we met and--
-Did he try to get you to go to France?

689
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,727
I felt so bad for ignoring all his calls

690
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:29,022
that I figured I'd see him
and put an end to things once and for all,

691
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,982
but he seemed pretty heartbroken.

692
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,400
Where's your phone, Eldest?

693
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,736
While we're on that,
get your phones out, everyone.

694
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:35,904
Let's see Eldest's phone.

695
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:36,821
ELDEST'S PHONE

696
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:37,989
Why won't it turn on?

697
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,450
-The battery's out.
-There's no power.

698
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,701
Just charge it then.

699
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:42,702
What's this?

700
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,954
IN THE PHONE CASE

701
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,917
-What's this now?
-"Funeral Procedure and Checklist."

702
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,251
-Where was it?
-Inside his phone case.

703
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,503
Inside Eldest's phone case.

704
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:52,879
-Wait.
-Eldest's?

705
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,632
CHIEF MOURNER(S) MUST INSPECT THE CASKET
20 MINUTES BEFORE THE PROCESSION

706
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:58,468
The chief mourners
were Eldest and Youngest.

707
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:01,554
That guaranteed him time
to be alone with Youngest.

708
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,139
They would've been alone from 5:40 a.m.

709
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,850
That guaranteed him
some alone time with Youngest.

710
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,560
There it is.

711
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:11,147
IN THE MEANTIME,
AN DETECTIVE CHARGES ELDEST'S PHONE

712
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,691
Didn't you observe the casketing?

713
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,984
-I did.
-We all saw the casketing.

714
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:18,113
I saw the body being casketed.
Why bother inspecting it again?

715
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,490
So you didn't go to the mortuary
at 5:40 a.m.?

716
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:21,783
So you didn't check it.

717
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,493
I just ticked the checklist
without checking.

718
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,036
-He could be lying right now.
-I signed it.

719
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,664
Then where were you
20 minutes before 6 a.m.?

720
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:28,998
-Here, of course.
-Where?

721
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,166
Here, out in front.

722
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,626
-You didn't go into the mortuary?
-No.

723
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,878
-But why? You could've met inside.
-Exactly.

724
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,005
-That's just where I was waiting.
-But he never came.

725
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:39,384
He never came, so I left
after ticking the items on the list.

726
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,969
So you never saw Manager Jang?

727
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,846
No, not after 3 a.m.

728
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,181
Except when you were killing him.

729
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,934
-You didn't go in there around 5 a.m.?
-Everyone!

730
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,018
ELDEST'S ROOM

731
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,062
What? What is it?

732
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,313
Whose phone is that?

733
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,773
-What is it?
-Oh, you charged it.

734
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,066
Oh my, you charged it.

735
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,153
JANG ELDEST'S PHONE IS ON

736
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,487
-Wait a minute.
-What's this?

737
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,906
Wait, it says,
"This is the private ambulance team."

738
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,242
"Consent form for hospitalization
at Yeonjidol Psychiatric Hospital."

739
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,161
-"Please sign the consent form"?
-Consent form for hospitalization?

740
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,579
Hospitalize who?

741
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:10,165
-Wait, Yeonjidol?
-Yeonjidol Psychiatric Hospital?

742
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,000
THAT TERRIFYING PLACE?

743
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,836
He spoke to the private ambulance team
on the phone at 5:43 a.m.

744
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,672
Then at 5:45 a.m., he texted,
"I'm sorry. Thanks for your hard work."

745
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,215
-What?
-"I'm sorry"?

746
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,509
-Because he killed him!
-This is…

747
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,386
-He killed him.
-He's sorry for wasting their time.

748
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,222
He was going to send Youngest
to the psychiatric hospital.

749
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,558
-But then he killed him.
-Youngest was dead.

750
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,060
Why were you trying to admit him?

751
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,395
Hey, stop freaking out.

752
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,398
Everything seemed to point to
Youngest becoming the successor,

753
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,609
and I honestly didn't know
the content of the will.

754
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,986
So I needed him gone
before the will was made public

755
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,696
for my own sake.

756
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,741
-We don't need the will to know that.
-And what have I been saying until now?

757
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,743
He tattled on me to Father.

758
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:50,246
He tattled on me
and nearly screwed me over.

759
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:54,334
The chairman texted Youngest on the 28th
to make sure to fire Eldest.

760
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:57,045
Once the kid was out of the picture,

761
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,671
I'd be able to come back.

762
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,882
So I planned to send him
to a psychiatric hospital

763
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,259
and made the arrangements,
but he never showed up.

764
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,094
And then,

765
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,514
I realized how stupid I was being.

766
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:10,975
I thought to myself, "What am I doing?
And at Father's funeral, of all places."

767
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,061
So I just decided to meet with the lawyer.

768
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,771
The lawyer's on our side, right?

769
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:19,359
So I just decided to meet the lawyer
and actually doctor the will.

770
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,611
There was no need to bother with Youngest,

771
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,572
so I sent the private ambulance team back.

772
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,241
Does that make sense?

773
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,576
Can we trust his statement

774
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,246
that he simply decided
not to follow his plan?

775
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,541
He called them
and canceled the request before 5:45 a.m.

776
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:38,670
Could the reason he had to cancel
be that he'd already killed Youngest?

777
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,880
Here's what I'm wondering.

778
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:44,843
From 4:25 a.m. to 4:30 a.m.,

779
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,678
Youngest was drunk on soju.

780
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,680
He bumped into me and threw up a little.

781
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,266
You can actually see the stains.
He threw up on my arm here.

782
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,725
He threw up on you?

783
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,396
Can we assume
that it had nothing to do with methanol

784
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,565
but with all the soju he binged?

785
00:30:58,648 --> 00:30:59,941
Probably.

786
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:03,027
But this vomit right here
is definitely because of the methanol.

787
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:06,030
Judging by his dilated pupils

788
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,325
-and the vomit,
-He couldn't even close his eyes.

789
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,035
he definitely drank the methanol first.

790
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,706
But ultimately,
the one thing we have to consider here

791
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,874
is this.

792
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,251
See?

793
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,168
TWO DIFFERENT STRANGULATION MARKS

794
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,629
One mark suggests
a rope wound around his neck.

795
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:26,009
-The other suggests it was angled upwards.
-Let me see.

796
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:29,345
So, for example, if his head was lowered
or he was sitting down,

797
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,847
the culprit must've come from behind.

798
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,434
The methanol couldn't have been used
after he'd been strangled to death.

799
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,561
We have to assume
that the methanol was used first

800
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,771
and then the culprit finished him off.

801
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,149
But given that his eyes are open,

802
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:44,944
I think the shock of being strangled
from the back startled him to wake up.

803
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:48,072
Either the killer put Youngest
in the casket after killing him

804
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:52,243
or they made him get in there on his own.

805
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:57,206
But wouldn't the body
normally be laid out flat

806
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,792
with the flowers arranged nicely?

807
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,502
And the paper too.

808
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:05,715
But I noticed everything inside
was squished from the start.

809
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,967
At first,

810
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:11,596
I thought some decorations might've gotten
squashed when his body fell in there.

811
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,473
But seeing how everything was squashed,

812
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:16,517
he might've tried to
fight back in the casket.

813
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,269
Perhaps some sort of struggle took place,

814
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:20,813
making the papers inside flat.

815
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,942
I have no idea
why he ended up in the casket

816
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:27,362
or how on earth he got in there.

817
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:30,615
That's why I think
we should investigate Youngest's cabinet.

818
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,117
We need to open this.

819
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,578
This one, Youngest's cabinet.

820
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,497
We need to find the key to that cabinet.

821
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,873
There must be something there.

822
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:42,168
-The key should be around here somewhere.
-We need to find the key.

823
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,628
Check his pockets.

824
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,297
The key might've fallen out here,
but I don't see it.

825
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:49,509
-Oh, here it is!
-What?

826
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:50,885
-Here it was.
-The key?

827
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,387
-The cabinet!
-It was here.

828
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,723
-My goodness.
-So it was there all along.

829
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,350
WHAT WILL JANG YOUNGEST'S CABINET REVEAL?

830
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,354
Hurry up. Open it, Eldest.

831
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,439
-What is it?
-What is it?

832
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:04,899
-This is…
-Let's see.

833
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,652
-There's another phone!
-Oh my.

834
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:08,611
-Wait, this…
-Youngest's?

835
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,363
Whose is it?

836
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,116
-It's Father's?
-It's your dad's?

837
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,743
-What, it's Father's?
-Let me see.

838
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,830
I saw a downloaded folder in the menu.

839
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,916
-What's this? "DNA test results."
-"DNA test results."

840
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,669
-The one that proves I'm his son.
-Right.

841
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,671
Next, Safe Bank.

842
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,132
-What? This is unacceptable.
-What's this?

843
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,759
-"Three failed password attempts."
-"Attempts."

844
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,929
Someone made three attempts
to access his account.

845
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,098
-For the banking app.
-His account, yes.

846
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:40,226
-What time was this?
-Around 3 a.m. Precisely, 2:57 a.m.

847
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,020
That's after Father passed.

848
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,563
So after he passed away,

849
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:46,649
-If it was around 3 a.m.…
-someone took this phone and…

850
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,735
Then it must be one of us.

851
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,195
-It was me.
-What?

852
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,740
-For goodness' sake.
-Suppose you did that after he passed.

853
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,283
-Where'd you put this phone?
-You didn't use this phone?

854
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,035
I did use it.

855
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,704
But Youngest took it from me
as I was using it.

856
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:00,955
He got angry and took it away.

857
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,332
-Right,
-So then, at 3:05 a.m., I--

858
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,500
-What the hell?
-What is it?

859
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,378
-What?
-So your father knew.

860
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,047
-Why, damn it!
-What's wrong?

861
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,882
We got it all wrong.

862
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,092
-What do you mean?
-What is it?

863
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,888
Youngest wasn't our father's son!

864
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,474
Youngest wasn't our father's son!

865
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,185
Are you serious?

866
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,103
-That's the paternity test.
-That crazy old lady!

867
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,646
-What?
-This isn't mine.

868
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,648
-It's not mine, it's Youngest's.
-Wait, hang on!

869
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,525
-Hold on.
-It's Youngest's test results.

870
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,527
-That woman is absolutely nuts!
-Wait, so…

871
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,071
-It wasn't mine.
-You're right.

872
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:36,783
-There's no denying it.
-The probability of paternity is 0.00001%.

873
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,076
-Oh my.
-Jang Youngest.

874
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,410
-No way.
-Who else were you with?

875
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,912
-I don't remember.
-What's with this lady?

876
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,497
-Get out, lady!
-Jeez, seriously.

877
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,124
But I don't remember anyone else
other than my husband.

878
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,876
How many men did you date
at that radish patch?

879
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,045
-Well, I was just harvesting…
-What are you, the Radish Party Girl?

880
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:51,130
Oh my. I'm in shock too.

881
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,341
BREADWINNER AND YOUNGEST: FATHER AND SON

882
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:56,010
BREADWINNER AND YOUNGEST: UNRELATED

883
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,597
Hold on. Lady, you got anything on you
in your pockets or something?

884
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,099
-I don't.
-You didn't show us anything of yours.

885
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,350
Frisk her.

886
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,393
-I don't get my husband.
-This is utter chaos.

887
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,312
Why did he not tell me any of this?

888
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,855
Oh, my Youngest.

889
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,440
-Wait, then--
-Stop touching me.

890
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,983
-I said I don't have anything!
-Your skirt.

891
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,902
Turn out your skirt pockets.

892
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,321
-This is the only one.
-Be honest. I only checked one.

893
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,406
This lady too. Search her clothes too.

894
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:20,159
-There's nothing. You already looked.
-You sure?

895
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,119
I don't have pockets.

896
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,120
Hang on.

897
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,330
Come on.

898
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,332
You didn't tell us you had a pocket here.

899
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,500
-There's more.
-There's more?

900
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:28,417
You're kidding me.

901
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,752
-What is it?
-What is it now?

902
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:32,088
What did she squirrel away
like pocket money, all folded up?

903
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,840
"Confidentiality Agreement."

904
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:34,882
"Jeon Butler."

905
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,175
For goodness' sake.

906
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,219
"Act committed in conjunction
with Kim First Wife…"

907
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,096
-I knew it. See that?
-What?

908
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,639
Darn it, hold on!

909
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,015
Read it out loud.

910
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,934
-Hold on!
-Read it out loud.

911
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,647
"Regarding the successor designation,

912
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,692
even if it is later revealed
that Jang Youngest and Kim Sweetheart

913
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,695
-were switched in the OB-GYN clinic…"
-Jeez.

914
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:59,657
"…that Jang Youngest and Kim Sweetheart
were switched in the OB-GYN clinic…"

915
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,909
-Jeez. Come on, guys.
-Of course.

916
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,494
Oh my!

917
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,371
You're my son?

918
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:09,458
-I actually found it
-Oh my!

919
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,835
-in Father's study.
-You're my son?

920
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,504
-You knew?
-Yeah, I knew.

921
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:14,589
He's my son?

922
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,508
This is insane.

923
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,844
-Oh my.
-I just happened to find out.

924
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,637
How could you pretend
like you didn't know?

925
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,264
Hey, enough. I'm…

926
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:26,017
Kim First Wife, that bitch.

927
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,145
She made me raise a kid who wasn't mine?

928
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,813
Wait, in that case… Hey.

929
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,565
What's wrong with this family?

930
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:35,151
I think this should be rated NC-39.

931
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:38,946
-No wonder I was drawn to Sweetheart.
-I suppose we'll do a paternity test.

932
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,241
-Wait, but…
-You were drawn to him?

933
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,784
DRAWN TO HER OWN BLOOD?

934
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:51,083
"THIS IS A SPECIAL COMPLIMENT
(JUST FOR YOU, MY SON)"

935
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,671
Sleep well, my love. Good night.

936
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:56,756
"SLEEP WELL, MY LOVE(LY SON)"

937
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:59,467
"IS IT A CRIME TO BE IN LOVE
(WITH MY SON)?"

938
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,303
-Wait, that means…
-This is fun. Keep going.

939
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,763
-He dated his stepmother…
-What is going on?

940
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,181
He's my son?

941
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,644
JANG YOUNGEST AND KIM SWEETHEART
WERE SWITCHED

942
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:13,439
PARK WIFE, JANG YOUNGEST: UNRELATED
PARK WIFE, KIM SWEETHEART: MOTHER AND SON

943
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,274
My son! Let me see your face.

944
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,318
-Mom.
-I should've known

945
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,111
-Mom!
-from this handsome face of yours.

946
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,571
I had my doubts, but…

947
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,948
-I mean…
-This is so ridiculous.

948
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,866
-Reveals like that are a must.
-About Youngest.

949
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,493
-They were kissing each other earlier.
-Youngest's eyes…

950
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,163
-And now here they are.
-look like Sweetheart's mother's eyes.

951
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,498
They both don't have double eyelids.

952
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,000
-I had my doubts.
-Wait, so are you getting any inheritance?

953
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,961
-I don't know. They're all dead!
-Listen.

954
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,338
The will is the most important thing
right now.

955
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,756
Snap out of it!

956
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,758
-I haven't seen the will either.
-All right, then.

957
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,760
-Give your mom a kiss!
-It's all about survival now.

958
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,971
Why don't you kiss
like in that video earlier?

959
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,555
-Let me make this very clear.
-The "special compliment."

960
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,932
-I won't approve of her.
-Daughter-in-law…

961
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,892
Babe, don't get the wrong idea.
We never kissed.

962
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,436
-She only gave me a special compliment.
-Son?

963
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,522
Our love was completely platonic.

964
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:57,358
-We just played the piano together.
-I don't care.

965
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,818
-Wait, babe.
-I'll never approve of you.

966
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,361
Babe, how much do you need?

967
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,862
-How much?
-I said not her!

968
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,614
-You know what?
-Snap out of it, you idiot.

969
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:04,865
That girl is off-limits!

970
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,118
-Don't be ridiculous. I have money now.
-Not that girl.

971
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,662
Lady, he can't help but want me.

972
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,747
Forget it. I'm not having you
as my daughter-in-law again.

973
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,291
You're old now, lady.

974
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,667
You woodlouse, I swear…

975
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,671
THIRD TIME BEING IN-LAWS?

976
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,381
Here's a possible scenario for Park Wife.

977
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,801
If she had seen the paternity test results
while trying to access the banking app

978
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:28,889
and found out that Youngest
wasn't her biological son…

979
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,058
Her debt amounts
to a whopping 10 billion won.

980
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:35,187
She's being bombarded
with demands for repayment,

981
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,940
so she's completely cornered.

982
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,943
And she knows that she can repay the debt

983
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:44,030
if her son is taken out of the picture.

984
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,741
What's more, he's not even her real son.

985
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:50,369
That would make it much easier
for her to kill him.

986
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,122
-But…
-I'm the victim here.

987
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:56,792
-Daughter-in-law knew about all of this.
-Exactly!

988
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,795
-This brat knew everything all along.
-Yeah.

989
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:03,174
As far as she's concerned,
she needs Youngest to die.

990
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,053
-Right, since he isn't the successor.
-Yes.

991
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,596
I get what this looks like.

992
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,682
I broke up with Youngest,
and he freaked out and kept calling me.

993
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:16,103
But still, I'd never kill him
because he wouldn't accept the breakup!

994
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,064
-But it's possible.
-Seriously.

995
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,732
Would you have done that?

996
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,275
Her entire life's goal

997
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,696
was to snatch herself a rich man
to up her social status.

998
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,656
But little did she know

999
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,993
that Youngest turned out to be
unrelated to Chairman Jang.

1000
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,371
The moment she found out about this,

1001
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:37,166
Youngest became worthless to her.

1002
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,960
Now, she would've had to get rid of him,

1003
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:44,131
but he was madly in love with her
and was giving her trouble.

1004
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,884
My family, my status, and the inheritance…

1005
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,719
I can give them all up.

1006
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:52,223
She'd naturally think,
"If only this man would disappear."

1007
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:57,728
Then Kim Sweetheart,
who treats her like she's his whole world,

1008
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,272
would eventually be hers.

1009
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:03,818
I get the feeling
that if we further investigate her,

1010
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,195
we'll find more shocking details

1011
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:09,657
that will get us closer to the truth.

1012
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,285
I'm so confused right now.

1013
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,246
-I just want to go home.
-No.

1014
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,206
-Wait.
-I don't even care who the killer is now.

1015
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,333
He wasn't even my son anyway.

1016
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,377
I don't know what I'm even doing here.

1017
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,304
One moment, please!

1018
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,140
We should at least hear him out.

1019
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,516
-Hang on. Here.
-What is it?

1020
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,434
What?

1021
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,644
-Let's look at that first.
-I found this in the condolence money box.

1022
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:41,814
What's that?

1023
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,399
A THERMOS IN THE CONDOLENCE MONEY BOX?

1024
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,652
-Is it methanol?
-What?

1025
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,697
-What is it?
-It's methanol.

1026
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,906
-Here, let me.
-What is it?

1027
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,408
THE SMELL OF METHANOL?

1028
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:54,702
What is it?

1029
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,078
What the heck?

1030
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,413
Open it.

1031
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,790
A HALF-AND-HALF THERMOS?

1032
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:00,958
Where was this?

1033
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,042
In the condolence money box.

1034
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,587
Who watched over the box the whole time?

1035
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,796
-Her.
-It's me.

1036
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,756
That's insane.

1037
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,301
Why did you put this in here?

1038
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:11,594
Why did you do that?

1039
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,471
-Go on. Yap away.
-Is it soju or what?

1040
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:15,931
This is crazy.

1041
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,183
Are you going to believe me?

1042
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,684
-Of course, I will, babe.
-Go ahead.

1043
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:21,061
I got myself a weapon now, so talk.

1044
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,063
Oh my, how scary.

1045
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,440
Well, the thing is…

1046
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:29,195
Okay, I knew Sweetheart
was Chairman Jang's real son.

1047
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,071
I found out about it,

1048
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,073
-so I wanted to get back with you.
-Okay.

1049
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:37,411
I admit I tried to feed methanol
to Youngest.

1050
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,079
-To kill him?
-You tried to?

1051
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,207
I don't even have the strength
to grab your hair anymore.

1052
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,583
And I did feed it to him.

1053
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:43,667
-You fed it to him?
-You did?

1054
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,794
-And I did feed it to him.
-You fed it to him?

1055
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:46,754
Yeah.

1056
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,090
When and how did you do it?

1057
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,593
He just wouldn't break up with me,

1058
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,679
and he got so clingy.

1059
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,515
So I told him all kinds of lies.

1060
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,683
Wait, it wasn't a lie. I am infertile.

1061
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,102
I told him his mom had made me infertile.

1062
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,604
-Right, that's not a lie.
-Best decision of my life.

1063
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,564
I even said… Jeez.

1064
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:08,359
-Mom!
-I said that, but he wouldn't let me go.

1065
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:12,947
So I ended up telling him
that I didn't have long to live.

1066
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,198
Then that handkerchief…

1067
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,824
So I put the red stuff on there

1068
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:17,660
and showed it to him.

1069
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,995
Don't tell me you told him
you were terminally ill.

1070
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,207
-Did you say you coughed up blood?
-It smells the same as the lip tint.

1071
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,960
He was so devastated when I told him that.

1072
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:30,422
But he kept saying
he wanted to be with me forever,

1073
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,757
but I didn't feel the same.

1074
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,716
I wanted…

1075
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,717
Me.

1076
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,636
Yeah, I thought
he'd be named the successor.

1077
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,305
-So how'd you feed him the methanol?
-When and how?

1078
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,557
-So I--
-Let go of her hand.

1079
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,684
That thermos has two compartments, right?

1080
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,686
So I put water in one side

1081
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:47,231
and methanol in the other.

1082
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:50,609
Then I suggested
that we commit suicide together.

1083
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:54,655
I drank water,
pretending I was drinking methanol,

1084
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,156
and then offered the thermos to him.

1085
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,783
So he drank from it.

1086
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:01,370
I saw him close his eyes and pass out.

1087
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,205
-Where?
-In the lounge?

1088
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,164
In the casket.

1089
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,083
-In the casket?
-What? In the casket?

1090
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,627
-You were lying in the casket together?
-Yeah.

1091
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:11,005
-So the empty space next to him…
-That's why it was squashed.

1092
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,132
-You were in there, babe?
-That's what happened.

1093
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:17,720
Then I left after confirming
that he stopped breathing.

1094
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:18,804
So you killed him.

1095
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,014
-You killed him.
-Here's the thing.

1096
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,807
I really thought he was dead.

1097
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,726
But after I got out,

1098
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,729
I read the instructions label
on the methanol container.

1099
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:29,898
It explains how to counteract methanol.

1100
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:33,902
It says that a large amount of ethanol
could neutralize the methanol.

1101
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,155
And then I remembered

1102
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:39,617
seeing him at around 3 a.m.
drinking a lot of soju.

1103
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,951
So I thought,

1104
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:45,247
"What if he got detoxified
and came out alive?"

1105
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,416
So I got scared
and was going to go back there,

1106
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:49,793
but right before the procession
at 5:50 a.m.…

1107
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,378
-At 5:50 a.m.?
-Around that time.

1108
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,130
You know what I'm going to say, right?

1109
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,506
-Yeah.
-You went into the mortuary.

1110
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,634
-I went in there looking for my son.
-I saw Park Wife

1111
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:59,386
go into the mortuary,
so I couldn't go in to check on him.

1112
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,348
Sure, but how should I have known
my son was in the casket?

1113
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,308
-I came right back out.
-Yes, she came out.

1114
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,060
But she didn't say anything.

1115
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,687
So to be honest,
I thought he'd died just fine.

1116
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:12,816
But we all saw the inside of the casket
before we headed out, right?

1117
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,194
-Oh gosh!
-This is insane!

1118
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,154
-Isn't this Youngest?
-Why's this punk sleeping in here?

1119
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,283
Remember how his eyes were open?

1120
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,202
That's what I don't get right now.

1121
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:25,371
-Because you saw him with his eyes closed?
-Yeah, exactly!

1122
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,831
When I killed him…
I mean, I thought I'd killed him.

1123
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:31,210
So perhaps someone inflicted
more harm on him after that.

1124
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:33,712
-So then, when you came out--
-I couldn't help but wonder

1125
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:35,130
because his eyes being open

1126
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,758
-suggested he had died in a struggle.
-So how much time

1127
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,719
-passed between the two events?
-What time did you lie in the casket?

1128
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:44,890
We met there at 5 a.m.,
and I came out at about 5:08 a.m.

1129
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:47,851
Wait, were you the ones
who moved Father's body?

1130
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:48,977
Did you two move him together?

1131
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,147
-Yeah.
-To where?

1132
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,233
You know, in the John Doe's drawer.

1133
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:55,943
-In Drawer 2?
-Exactly.

1134
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,361
You evil bastards.

1135
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,530
-I swear…
-You dare move the body?

1136
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:02,866
But then,

1137
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,245
let's say it all happened as she said

1138
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,996
and she left, thinking that he'd died.

1139
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,165
If what you're saying is true,

1140
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,710
-did you close the lid after all that?
-I am telling the truth.

1141
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,086
-You did, right?
-Yes, of course.

1142
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,754
I put everything back to normal.

1143
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:16,755
-Right?
-Yeah.

1144
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:18,924
What we know for certain

1145
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:24,012
is that the culprit is someone
who had a good reason to open the lid.

1146
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,889
And who would open it?

1147
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:26,890
I got chills.

1148
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,059
Try to recall as much as you can,
Daughter-in-law.

1149
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:32,771
When Youngest died, was he facing down?

1150
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,399
We were facing each other,

1151
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,151
and I think he slumped forward.

1152
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:41,071
The way I see it, he slumped forward
when he lost consciousness.

1153
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,948
-With his eyes closed, yeah.
-While inside,

1154
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:44,324
the methanol was neutralized.

1155
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,325
It must've been stuffy,

1156
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:49,037
so he probably called out for help,
and someone could've heard that.

1157
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,914
That must be why they opened the casket,

1158
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,916
and that gave them
the chance to strangle him.

1159
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,878
-But who?
-That's possible, but hang on.

1160
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:59,923
For now, Joo Daughter-in-law
isn't completely off the hook just yet.

1161
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:03,343
-No, she's not off the hook.
-Fine, sure. Whatever.

1162
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,512
First of all,

1163
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,681
the person who strangled him
is the real killer.

1164
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:12,102
So we need to find the person
who went into the mortuary.

1165
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,812
If Ms. Joo Daughter-in-law
is telling the truth,

1166
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:17,191
we'd have to consider if someone else
had gone into the mortuary after she left

1167
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,693
and whether the second assailant

1168
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:23,280
was none other than
Joo Daughter-in-law herself.

1169
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,158
Won't there be any clues here?

1170
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:27,576
DIFFERENT CORDS IN THE MORTUARY

1171
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:31,622
Could this be it?

1172
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:34,917
Is this it?

1173
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,343
A SEVERED CORD WRAPPED AROUND THE SPOOL?

1174
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:45,427
Everyone!

1175
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,471
-For someone who always dealt things--
-Everyone!

1176
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,348
-Look at this.
-What?

1177
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:51,266
-What now?
-Could this be the murder weapon?

1178
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,727
-What is it?
-Are there marks or something?

1179
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,687
No, this one piece had already been cut.

1180
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,022
-Where did you find it?
-Where?

1181
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:58,774
-Here.
-You're right.

1182
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:01,527
-It was wrapped around here.
-This is what the killer used.

1183
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,028
Only this piece was cut out.

1184
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:06,240
Should we hold it up to his neck
to see if it matches the marks?

1185
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,075
This…

1186
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:10,494
-This is actually mine.
-What?

1187
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:11,662
-It's mine.
-What?

1188
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:13,831
-You're confessing out of nowhere?
-That?

1189
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:14,998
This is yours, Eldest?

1190
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,209
-How is this yours?
-Explain it to us.

1191
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,503
-Well, when he was all drunk and stuff
-What is this?

1192
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:23,632
I considered tying him up
for the private ambulance guys to pick up.

1193
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:26,260
But I didn't go through with that plan
in the end.

1194
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,136
I wound up the cord I cut
back around the spool.

1195
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:31,431
-So you just cut it and didn't use it?
-No, I didn't use it.

1196
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:34,726
How long do we have to listen
to this nonsense for, Detective?

1197
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:40,566
If the one you resented enough to consider
admitting to a psychiatric hospital

1198
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:44,194
was now lying unconscious in a casket,

1199
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,113
who wouldn't be tempted to kill them?

1200
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,532
Especially when there were
countless weapons and no witnesses.

1201
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:52,619
The several minutes he had
were enough time to commit murder.

1202
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:56,331
Even the timing of when he sent
the private ambulance team back

1203
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,167
ties everything together perfectly.

1204
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,169
But there are two separate marks.

1205
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:02,921
This should be enough to go around twice.

1206
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,048
-Let's do a simulation.
-All right.

1207
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:08,260
-Okay, he's about to wake up.
-So let's say he goes, "Help me."

1208
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:09,845
-Suppose he said that.
-If you do this…

1209
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:13,056
-Who wraps it around the neck twice?
-Look at this.

1210
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,851
-It's long enough to validate the theory.
-Yeah, yeah.

1211
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:18,353
But how do we explain this mark
that's going upward?

1212
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,898
So you'd have to pull it like this, right?

1213
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,566
-I can tell you how.
-I get it now.

1214
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:24,526
-Oh, I see.
-The culprit wound it around,

1215
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,778
held both ends, and raised the platform.

1216
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:31,575
WRAPPED THE CORD AROUND THE NECK
AND RAISED THE LIFT?

1217
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:34,995
-That'd make the exact same marks, right?
-You're right!

1218
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,496
-I got chills.
-This is so cruel.

1219
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,206
But look again.

1220
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,208
Look at the cord mark here.

1221
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:43,045
-On the edge. It's not on the lid.
-Is that white?

1222
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:45,923
-This is white, so they used a white cord.
-There's a white cord here.

1223
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,466
-Like this one.
-Yeah, there is.

1224
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:48,592
Here.

1225
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:51,219
Oh, but the way it comes off…

1226
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:54,431
-Is that hanji?
-It does feel like hanji.

1227
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:55,974
-Wait, they used hanji?
-It must be this paper.

1228
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,769
-It's the residue from when it gets torn.
-Wait, but…

1229
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:03,273
No, I still think this red cord
was the murder weapon.

1230
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,484
Yeah, this was it.

1231
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:07,861
-Yeah, it's 100% the red cord.
-Makes perfect sense.

1232
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,113
Shall we have a seat
and chat for a minute?

1233
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,282
-Let's do that.
-All right.

1234
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:16,662
All right.

1235
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:20,040
I think we need to sort through
all the information we found.

1236
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:23,085
Wait, so who knew Youngest was in there?

1237
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:25,712
-Daughter-in-law, to start with.
-First, her.

1238
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:26,797
At the end of the day,

1239
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,801
you did decide to kill him off
and drove him to commit suicide.

1240
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:32,594
She downright killed him!

1241
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,221
-I didn't!
-It's 100% her.

1242
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,556
I didn't.
I feel like I'm being framed here.

1243
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,434
-Framed how?
-I thought he was dead when I left.

1244
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:43,605
To be honest, I was so shocked
when the casket was opened

1245
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:47,109
because he didn't look the way he did
when I last saw him.

1246
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,695
That's why I'm convinced
something happened along the way

1247
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:53,573
because I swear I didn't
do more harm to him after I left.

1248
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,701
-Hang on.
-Well, because earlier… Yes?

1249
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,786
-I have one question.
-Yes?

1250
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,621
-For Daughter-in-law.
-Go ahead.

1251
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,625
So you and Youngest
agreed to commit suicide together

1252
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:07,254
-and went into the mortuary, right?
-Yeah.

1253
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:10,465
Tell us everything you did,
step by step, exactly as it happened.

1254
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:14,219
Okay, first of all,
we agreed to meet at 5 a.m.,

1255
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:16,847
so we met there at 5 a.m.

1256
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:20,183
While I did suggest that we die together,

1257
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:21,977
-I couldn't actually die.
-Right.

1258
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,437
So I went in a little earlier.

1259
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,814
-To the mortuary?
-Yeah, I went in there

1260
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:29,109
and filled my thermos
half with methanol and half with water.

1261
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,570
After that, we opened the casket together.

1262
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:35,198
We took out your father's body
and placed it in there.

1263
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,409
-Where?
-Where the John Doe was.

1264
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:38,535
-You know, in…
-In Drawer 2?

1265
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:41,413
-Yeah, I heard it rarely gets opened.
-In the upper row?

1266
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:43,415
-In the upper row?
-Yeah, we put him in the upper row.

1267
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:47,961
Then he gave me the rings he bought
at the funeral supplies office,

1268
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,588
and we put them on right then.

1269
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:50,881
And then I said,

1270
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:53,800
"Okay, now we're really
going to be together forever."

1271
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,969
I feel bad, but I lied to him.

1272
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,512
Then we both drank from the thermos

1273
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:01,224
and laid down in the casket together,
facing each other.

1274
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:02,809
I kept observing him.

1275
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,479
He then slowly closed his eyes and died.

1276
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:09,524
There's one thing
that's been bothering me.

1277
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,068
Shall we go take a look?

1278
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:12,527
All right.

1279
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:18,450
TAKING ANOTHER LOOK AT THE MORTUARY

1280
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:20,577
-It's this.
-Okay.

1281
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:23,580
There's a constant flow of people here.

1282
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:24,873
AS BODIES KEEP COMING AND GOING

1283
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:27,709
Bodies are brought in
and taken out for the procession.

1284
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:28,794
THE LATE JANG BREADWINNER

1285
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,837
When she first came in,

1286
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,715
she took out Father's body.

1287
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:35,008
-And then…
-Yeah?

1288
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:38,345
When she first stashed him,

1289
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:42,474
she put him here in Drawer 4.

1290
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:44,059
-What makes you say that?
-I'll tell you.

1291
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,018
Look at the flower petals.

1292
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,603
-The flower petals over there.
-Yeah.

1293
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:49,940
FLOWER PETALS

1294
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:51,900
There are petals here.

1295
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,530
I thought the petals

1296
00:51:56,613 --> 00:52:01,618
must've come from the flowers
in the casket.

1297
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,830
So why were there petals in the freezer?

1298
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,414
What could be the reason

1299
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:08,333
for that to happen?

1300
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,086
I've racked my brains,

1301
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:14,131
and the only possibility
is that they must've fallen off the body

1302
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,800
when she forcibly took it out
and moved it.

1303
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:18,218
Listen.

1304
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:21,972
They keep moving the bodies
for the procession and such.

1305
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:24,975
-All others have families and whatnot.
-Right.

1306
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:28,103
At first, she must've shoved the body
into Drawer 4 without much thought.

1307
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:29,896
But after closing the casket and checking,

1308
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,440
she realized the body in Drawer 4
was soon going to be taken out

1309
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:34,276
for a procession.

1310
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:35,735
Then, people might find out.

1311
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,488
But a John Doe was in Drawer 2.

1312
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:42,909
So she must've thought the body
wouldn't be discovered for a long time

1313
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,494
if she put it in there.

1314
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:47,080
So she took the body out
and moved it to Drawer 2.

1315
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,833
Are you saying Daughter-in-law lied to us?

1316
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,168
-She lied!
-She lied.

1317
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,961
-Oh, so she lied?
-Yeah.

1318
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:54,713
She said she put the body
in Drawer 2 from the start.

1319
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:56,131
Yeah, that's what she said.

1320
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:57,841
The petals could've fallen from Drawer 1.

1321
00:52:57,924 --> 00:53:00,343
-There are gaps between the two rows,
-Okay.

1322
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,304
so things could've fallen from up there.

1323
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:03,763
I guess that's possible.

1324
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,265
But if she had lied to us,

1325
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:08,185
there has to be a reason for that
and something she'd gain out of doing so.

1326
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,312
But I can't think of any such things.

1327
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:12,397
There was no need for that at all.

1328
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,232
Did we miss something?

1329
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:15,650
In that case…

1330
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,361
MOVING ON TO A NEW TARGET

1331
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,071
What haven't we found yet?

1332
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:24,284
Okay, so… Daughter-in-law.

1333
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,369
-Nobody came in after you left, right?
-No one did.

1334
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,538
-You didn't either, right?
-No, I came in at…

1335
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,540
-Like I said, at 5:40 a.m.
-What is it?

1336
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,500
-Then at 5:50 a.m.
-Between 5:40 a.m. and 5:43 a.m.

1337
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:33,627
What's this?

1338
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,128
My notebook.

1339
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,470
Looks like a scheduler of some kind.

1340
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,180
-"Meeting with the chairman."
-Yeah.

1341
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:47,933
Nothing special. "December 27th, 3 p.m.
Meeting with the chairman."

1342
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:51,144
-What's 6-15?
-Just 6-15.

1343
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:52,854
Which is?

1344
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,315
They're just my favorite numbers.

1345
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,400
Why are you acting so fishy?

1346
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,152
-Tell us the truth.
-It's just 6-15.

1347
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:02,280
-You think it's a good time to joke?
-Kim Sweetheart, look at your mother.

1348
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,157
-We're all desperate here.
-Look at me.

1349
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:07,369
-Look me in the eye and tell me the truth.
-Read the room, seriously.

1350
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:08,870
What's 6-15?

1351
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,372
I'll come clean.

1352
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:13,208
-There's still more stuff?
-This is…

1353
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:16,378
-I'm almost getting sick of this.
-Well, it's the time, 6:15 a.m.

1354
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:18,296
-What?
-What happened at 6:15 a.m.?

1355
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,006
And what's it about?

1356
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:22,884
You wrote everything in detail
for other dates.

1357
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,552
Okay, this is what it is.

1358
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:27,514
The time of the cremation.

1359
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,225
-The cremation?
-Cremation?

1360
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:33,436
-Yeah, the procession was at six,
-So 15 minutes after the procession?

1361
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,854
-and it followed 15 minutes later.
-Yes.

1362
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:37,899
-It's the time of his cremation.
-Why did you take note of it?

1363
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:40,026
WHY DID HE WRITE DOWN
THE TIME OF THE CREMATION?

1364
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,611
Well, just because.

1365
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:44,114
-What's that supposed to mean?
-I just wrote it down.

1366
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:48,118
Why would you write down
the time of Father's cremation?

1367
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,828
Maybe he needed to know the time

1368
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:51,997
to kill Youngest in time

1369
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,874
to have him cremated
to make it a perfect crime.

1370
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,210
I mean…

1371
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,587
He wrote down the time
Youngest was supposed to burn.

1372
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,715
-The truth is…
-The truth is?

1373
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,091
I wanted to kill…

1374
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:05,719
I considered killing him very briefly.

1375
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:08,930
I briefly had that evil thought and went,

1376
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:12,142
"Should I kill him and burn the body
to get rid of the evidence?"

1377
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:14,769
I had that thought for a brief moment,

1378
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,479
but I didn't actually act on it.

1379
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,565
-Okay, I guess that's understandable.
-He wanted to kill him?

1380
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,774
You didn't even attempt it?

1381
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:20,817
Of course not.

1382
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,363
"6:15 a.m."

1383
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:27,157
Why did he write that down?

1384
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,826
The way I see it,

1385
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,454
he's definitely hiding something.

1386
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:34,456
Do you still have anything on you?

1387
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,124
On me?

1388
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:37,876
-What's this?
-What's this?

1389
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,003
It's nothing.

1390
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,422
-It's honestly nothing.
-I highly doubt it.

1391
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:45,216
-Let me search you, son.
-You never found it because you're dumb.

1392
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,594
-This is nothing.
-Hurry up and clear my name for me.

1393
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:50,180
-It's nothing important.
-You think so?

1394
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:51,765
-It's ticket receipts.
-From Fungmu Air.

1395
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,433
What? So you've had it all along.

1396
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,976
-"Jang Youngest."
-The plane tickets.

1397
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,520
-Is this Youngest's?
-Their tickets bound for Paris.

1398
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,856
-When did you take this?
-It was for the 30th at 10 a.m.

1399
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,900
Did you take these from Youngest?

1400
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:04,569
But Youngest's jacket was over there.

1401
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:06,863
-The envelope in here is empty.
-Is it an empty envelope?

1402
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:11,326
I told you I saw Youngest
and Daughter-in-law talking at 4:30 a.m.

1403
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:14,621
I overheard them discussing
going away somewhere.

1404
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:19,167
After hearing Youngest suggest
Daughter-in-law leave with him,

1405
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,835
I thought, "This won't do."

1406
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:23,755
So I started looking around for them,

1407
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:24,881
but I had no luck.

1408
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:28,885
Then, at 5:10 a.m.,
I came in here and saw this jacket,

1409
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:30,887
-so I--
-That's after Joo Woodlouse left.

1410
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,680
-At 5:10 a.m.?
-Yes, she left at 5:08 a.m.

1411
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:34,432
-Oh, you're right.
-Yes.

1412
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,101
So you were in the mortuary, then.

1413
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:39,813
-You had enough time to kill him.
-It was exactly 5:08 a.m. when I left.

1414
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,482
At 5:08 a.m.? I came in at 5:10 a.m.

1415
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,275
Oh, that's real close.

1416
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:46,152
-Son.
-So you were in here too.

1417
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:49,197
-I came in at 5:10 a.m.
-You came in, just took these, and left?

1418
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,074
and found this jacket.

1419
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:53,410
I had no reason to open someone's casket.

1420
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,620
-You didn't hear anything?
-Weren't you even curious?

1421
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:58,873
Whose casket is this? It's not Youngest's.

1422
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,417
-That's true.
-It's Chairman Jang's.

1423
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,128
His casket was there
because he passed away.

1424
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:05,338
So why would I open it?

1425
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:06,589
-I think
-Maybe you heard a noise.

1426
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:09,592
-there would've been a retching sound.
-Right, Youngest throwing up.

1427
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,594
He didn't throw up
when you were with him, right?

1428
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:12,595
No, not at all.

1429
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:15,056
He just died quietly with his eyes closed.

1430
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,933
-There would've been a retching sound.
-Yeah.

1431
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:20,979
And as for the stain on his sleeve…

1432
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:23,106
-This?
-You think it got on while killing him?

1433
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:25,817
I don't think he told us the truth there.
I think it got on his sleeve

1434
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,778
while he was tying the cord
around his neck.

1435
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,905
-But then--
-The vomit was all over his mouth.

1436
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,991
I can't believe my son is a murderer.

1437
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:34,200
That's not what happened.

1438
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,369
So you didn't hear any noise?

1439
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,620
-No.
-Nothing at all?

1440
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:38,580
None.

1441
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,081
You didn't touch the casket either?

1442
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:41,916
Why would I touch the casket?

1443
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,295
Why would I touch someone's casket?

1444
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:48,131
I'm not a psychopath like you!

1445
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:49,883
You could've opened it
if you had heard a sound.

1446
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:52,969
-Yeah, that's possible.
-But I didn't hear any sound.

1447
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:56,306
Man, you're all cornering me
all of a sudden

1448
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:58,933
when I'm the most normal person
in this family.

1449
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:01,102
Let's say Kim Sweetheart
was in the mortuary,

1450
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,812
checking out the flight tickets.

1451
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:06,191
And if he had heard
Youngest retch or some other noise,

1452
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,151
he could've easily killed him.

1453
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,612
-Shall we vote with our fingers?
-Hold on.

1454
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:12,322
Let's see how things are going.

1455
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:14,574
-Point to the person…
-To see who we're all suspecting.

1456
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,784
One, two, three.

1457
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,955
-He has four votes.
-How can everyone think so differently?

1458
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,166
Wait, how many votes did I get?

1459
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:24,125
You got three votes.

1460
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:26,085
-You fools.
-Four including mine from earlier.

1461
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,463
-Four including An Detective's.
-Man, you idiots.

1462
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:32,592
So no one knows
what's in the will right now, right?

1463
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:36,554
I think Kim Sweetheart is the only person
who might know its content.

1464
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:38,348
Let's say

1465
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:42,977
he found out
he was Chairman Jang's biological son

1466
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:45,855
only to learn that the will

1467
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,524
leaves everything to Youngest.

1468
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:51,319
That would make him mad enough
to want him dead.

1469
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:53,530
Sweetheart, did you hear
about the will's content?

1470
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:55,740
-I heard from the lawyer.
-What did the lawyer say?

1471
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:57,450
-You didn't share.
-You said you didn't know.

1472
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,535
I overheard them.

1473
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:02,455
The lawyer said that Kim Sweetheart
was mentioned by name in the will.

1474
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,041
When I heard that, I thought,

1475
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:07,460
"What? Why me?"

1476
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,255
"I'm not even married yet."

1477
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:13,341
-"I'm not part of this family."
-So you just heard your name was in it.

1478
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:15,802
-You weren't told how you were mentioned.
-Right.

1479
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:18,805
I was told to find out the details
later with the family,

1480
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,723
-but I was curious.
-That's understandable.

1481
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:24,352
That was around 12:30 a.m.,
so I went to the house after hearing that.

1482
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:28,565
And since I knew the passcode
thanks to the camera I had installed,

1483
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:31,067
so I opened the safe

1484
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:34,153
-To check for the will?
-to see if the will was in there.

1485
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:37,240
I only found out
that Daughter-in-law was dating Youngest

1486
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:38,950
and that Chairman Jang
was furious at them.

1487
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:42,996
Then I found the paternity test results
showing that I was Chairman Jang's son

1488
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,539
after rummaging around a bit.

1489
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:50,128
So I figured that was why the lawyer
asked me to look at the will.

1490
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,755
But honestly, to me,

1491
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:55,049
love matters more than money.

1492
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:57,093
I infiltrated this family for revenge.

1493
00:59:57,176 --> 01:00:00,680
I approached this chaebol family
to destroy them.

1494
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:04,809
But I saw Daughter-in-law get bullied
and slapped with kimchi by Park Wife,

1495
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:08,479
my former babe and current mom.

1496
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:10,064
You have no sympathy for your current mom

1497
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,317
but plenty of it for your ex
who got slapped with kimchi?

1498
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,651
-Is that it?
-Of course!

1499
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,279
-If you think about it…
-We were in a relationship twice.

1500
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:19,782
-This guy loves this woman so much.
-My painful labor was all in vain.

1501
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:23,786
Regardless of the awful act she commits,

1502
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,705
he's loyal to her,

1503
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:26,789
even now.

1504
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:29,292
That damned love.

1505
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:32,045
Kim Sweetheart's only love

1506
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:35,423
has always been Joo Loser from the start.

1507
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:38,593
That's why he was
deeply resentful of Youngest,

1508
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:42,096
the man Loser was in love with.

1509
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,474
On top of all that,
he even discovered the plane tickets.

1510
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:45,767
He would've then realized

1511
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:48,394
that the only woman he'd ever had eyes on

1512
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:51,481
was about to disappear from his life
with another man.

1513
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,066
He would've wanted to kill him even more.

1514
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,026
His rage would've been through the roof.

1515
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:58,196
Let's look for clues
for three more minutes before we vote.

1516
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:00,448
Detective,
you already voted for Sweetheart,

1517
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:02,075
so you need to think this through.

1518
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:03,785
Man, this is nuts.

1519
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:11,584
How will this ridiculous nonsense end?

1520
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,628
Today's case is a tough one.

1521
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,673
Harder than telling red from green.

1522
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:19,384
This is the trashiest storyline ever.

1523
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:20,551
CAST YOUR VOTE BASED ON THE CLUES

1524
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:27,100
We're missing the crucial piece
of circumstantial evidence.

1525
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:30,728
And that fact made me
feel unsure until the very end.

1526
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:36,567
But I think the checklist
gave me some clarity.

1527
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:40,321
If Eldest had opened the casket
to tick items off the checklist,

1528
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:44,701
he would've immediately realized
that the body inside wasn't his father's.

1529
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,744
He had been looking
for Youngest desperately,

1530
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:49,914
but there he was,
unconscious due to the methanol poisoning.

1531
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:51,874
No matter how incompetent Eldest may be,

1532
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:55,211
I don't think he would've let
that opportunity slip by.

1533
01:01:57,213 --> 01:02:00,049
PARK WIFE CHOSE JANG ELDEST

1534
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,428
JANG ELDEST

1535
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:06,973
By examining the crime scene,
we learned how Youngest died in the end.

1536
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:09,559
The culprit used some sort of cord

1537
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:11,519
to wrap around Youngest's neck

1538
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:14,021
and then activated the lift

1539
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:17,108
to generate the force to strangle him.

1540
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:19,026
Then, it hit me.

1541
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:22,363
I see.

1542
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,660
I get it now.

1543
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:30,246
There was another lift.

1544
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:36,127
HE'S WRESTLING WITH THE SAME DILEMMA

1545
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:44,260
One of the lifts for moving bodies
had the casket placed on it,

1546
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:46,179
and the other one was across the room.

1547
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:49,766
I did a simulation,
pretending I was the murderer.

1548
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:52,769
Why were there two lifts in that room?

1549
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:56,481
To answer that, we need to
consider something along with it.

1550
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:58,900
Namely, the schedule
of enshrinements and processions.

1551
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:02,987
Jang Breadwinner was taken out at 5 a.m.
from Drawer 1.

1552
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:05,990
The culprit must've put his body
back in Drawer 1.

1553
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:08,701
It was left empty, after all.

1554
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:12,038
But then, at 5:45 a.m.,

1555
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:14,791
Ji Hellbound was scheduled
to be enshrined there,

1556
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,334
which could've exposed the crime.

1557
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,461
So the culprit
would've taken the body back out…

1558
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:22,673
and moved it to the next drawer over.

1559
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,258
BY USING THE OTHER LIFT?

1560
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:25,343
The John Doe.

1561
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,970
They probably planned to temporarily hide
the body in his drawer

1562
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:30,473
to keep their crime a secret
for the time being.

1563
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:32,475
With such a plan in mind,

1564
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:35,978
the culprit would've moved
the body in a hurry…

1565
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:37,688
Youngest wasn't quite dead yet,

1566
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:42,401
and if the culprit
had heard him moan or retch…

1567
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:46,072
They could've strangled him to death.

1568
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:49,033
JANG ELDEST

1569
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:50,910
AND KIM SWEETHEART
CHOSE JOO DAUGHTER-IN-LAW

1570
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:53,621
ELDEST: 1, SWEETHEART: 1,
DAUGHTER-IN-LAW: 2

1571
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:54,789
My evil ex.

1572
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:02,505
After I left the room…

1573
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:05,424
the person who came in…

1574
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,093
THE PERSON WHO CAME AFTER 5:08 A.M.?

1575
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:09,762
I came out of the mortuary at 5:08 a.m.,

1576
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:15,977
but Kim Sweetheart said
he went in there at 5:10 a.m.

1577
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:22,024
He found the jacket

1578
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:24,277
and discovered the tickets as well.

1579
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,904
So he took them
to prevent me from leaving,

1580
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:29,240
and just as he was about to leave…

1581
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:33,494
he must've heard Youngest vomiting.

1582
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,914
If doing this will make you the successor,

1583
01:04:37,498 --> 01:04:39,000
then I should choose you.

1584
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:41,085
But what a shame.

1585
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:44,797
JOO DAUGHTER-IN-LAW CHOSE KIM SWEETHEART

1586
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:46,799
I don't date criminals.

1587
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:52,346
ELDEST: 1, SWEETHEART: 2,
DAUGHTER-IN-LAW: 2

1588
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:55,057
First of all, as for Kim Sweetheart,

1589
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:58,728
his explanation about the vomit
on his sleeve wasn't satisfactory.

1590
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:02,648
Kim Sweetheart said
the vomit got on his sleeve

1591
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:06,027
when Youngest
bumped into him and threw up.

1592
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:07,570
But how does that make sense?

1593
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:11,532
Plus, there's that random note
about 6:15 a.m.

1594
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:12,742
It's so random.

1595
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:15,786
Turns out it was the time
for Father's cremation.

1596
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,914
Hoping to eliminate Jang Youngest,

1597
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:21,125
he could've written the time down
as some sort of a deadline

1598
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:23,669
to wrap everything up.

1599
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,713
As for Ms. Joo Daughter-in-law,

1600
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:28,174
she said she realized
soju could've detoxified Youngest

1601
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:30,051
and decided to return and check.

1602
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:33,971
But could it really have taken her
40 minutes to come to that conclusion?

1603
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:36,015
And the second point.

1604
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:37,350
The petals.

1605
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:40,937
The petals point to only one conclusion,

1606
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,814
which is that Father's body was moved.

1607
01:05:45,232 --> 01:05:49,737
I couldn't help but think
that someone was telling only half-truths.

1608
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,573
Let's stay calm.

1609
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:02,041
A "CALM" FINAL EXAMINATION
AS EXPECTED OF A DETECTIVE

1610
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:04,585
Right.

1611
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:07,004
What we discussed all day today
was how he was killed

1612
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:09,715
and in what position he was killed.

1613
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:12,343
Like this…

1614
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:19,141
What's this?

1615
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:23,980
WHAT DID AN DETECTIVE DISCOVER?

1616
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:31,487
We have a lot of
suspicious circumstantial evidence.

1617
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:35,074
If one of the two had lied to us…

1618
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:41,539
You deserve punishment
for the crime you committed.

1619
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:43,290
It was you.

1620
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:45,918
FINAL VOTE COMPLETE

1621
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:49,880
The second episode of the deduction game,
Crime Scene Zero.

1622
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:53,718
The results of the nail-biting
deduction game to find the culprit

1623
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:56,053
of the murder at the funeral hall.

1624
01:06:57,054 --> 01:07:01,517
Let's see who received the most votes
as the real culprit.

1625
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:06,272
We will now announce the results.

1626
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:08,816
-No way.
-It can't be me.

1627
01:07:08,899 --> 01:07:10,609
There's no way.

1628
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:13,195
It's also sad to get zero votes.

1629
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,781
First, we will announce

1630
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:18,367
who was excluded
from the final list of suspects.

1631
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:21,954
The results of the final vote
to determine the culprit are as follows.

1632
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:24,498
With zero votes…

1633
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:27,752
Jang Daughter…

1634
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:29,211
Darn it.

1635
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:30,171
…and Park Wife,

1636
01:07:30,254 --> 01:07:31,714
you are excluded from the final lineup.

1637
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:33,132
-Park Wife too?
-Oh my.

1638
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,050
Of course.

1639
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:37,011
I guess you changed your mind at the end.

1640
01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:38,429
-Of course.
-Because she's your mom?

1641
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:40,806
She's my mom after all,
so I should protect her.

1642
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:41,807
Next.

1643
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,100
With one vote…

1644
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:48,147
Jang Eldest, you are also excluded
from the final lineup.

1645
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:49,607
As I should be.

1646
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:52,818
You really had us confused back there.

1647
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,361
I got more than one vote?

1648
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:56,530
And so,

1649
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:58,908
those identified as suspects

1650
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:02,411
were Joo Daughter-in-law
and Kim Sweetheart.

1651
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:05,081
If An Detective voted for you twice,
you have two votes…

1652
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:07,208
Detective, did you really
vote twice for me?

1653
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:10,753
-Detective!
-In that case…

1654
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:12,505
-It could be a three-to-three tie.
-Hang on.

1655
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:16,008
Will the two final suspects
please step forward?

1656
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:17,718
Come on, Detective.

1657
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:19,887
If it's a three-to-three tie,
do we have to discuss it again?

1658
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:22,556
The ultimate deduction game,
Crime Scene Zero.

1659
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:27,895
The results of the final vote
of the murder at the funeral hall.

1660
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:29,313
My babe.

1661
01:08:29,396 --> 01:08:31,899
The player who was ultimately identified
as the culprit is…

1662
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:35,027
If we have a tie,
we need to persuade the other side.

1663
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:42,201
With four votes…

1664
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:43,494
Oh, it's not a tie.

1665
01:08:46,705 --> 01:08:47,873
…it's Joo Daughter-in-law.

1666
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,041
FINAL SUSPECT: JOO DAUGHTER-IN-LAW

1667
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,252
Nice, Detective. You got it in the end.

1668
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:52,211
Thank you.

1669
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:55,673
Mr. Kim Sweetheart, have some faith!

1670
01:08:55,756 --> 01:08:58,717
Joo Daughter-in-law, you've been
identified as the final suspect.

1671
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:01,053
Please enter the jail.

1672
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:02,596
Put her in there, quick.

1673
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,640
-Come here.
-Where's the entrance?

1674
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:07,977
-Go in already.
-Man, I mean…

1675
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:13,649
You came up with this whirlwind of logic
over some little stain at the end.

1676
01:09:13,732 --> 01:09:16,110
My poor babe. I feel so bad for you.

1677
01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:17,862
The players
who voted for Joo Daughter-in-law,

1678
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:19,530
An Detective,

1679
01:09:19,613 --> 01:09:20,781
Jang Daughter,

1680
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:21,991
Kim Sweetheart,

1681
01:09:22,074 --> 01:09:24,577
and Jang Eldest, please step forward.

1682
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:25,870
(GRABS)

1683
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:27,204
-Babe.
-You!

1684
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:29,957
I couldn't vote for my mom,
even if it's for you.

1685
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,209
-If I factor in spite, he gets my vote.
-I couldn't pick my mom.

1686
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:34,086
How could you vote for your girlfriend?

1687
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:37,131
-You should've voted for your mom.
-But I found her after 33 years.

1688
01:09:37,214 --> 01:09:39,216
If Joo Daughter-in-law
is the real culprit,

1689
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,886
Jang Daughter,
Kim Sweetheart, and Jang Eldest

1690
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:44,054
will each win two million won,

1691
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:47,766
and An Detective will win one million won.

1692
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:51,604
If Joo Daughter-in-law is not the culprit,

1693
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:54,857
the real killer will claim the prize money
of all other players,

1694
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:57,318
a total of ten million won.

1695
01:09:57,401 --> 01:09:59,195
-Ten million won?
-The stakes are high now.

1696
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:01,614
Wow, that's a sweet deal.

1697
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,949
-Man, I want to be the culprit.
-This is great.

1698
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:06,076
Joo Daughter-in-law has been voted

1699
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:08,537
as the culprit in the murder
at the funeral hall.

1700
01:10:09,413 --> 01:10:12,041
Is she really the culprit

1701
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:15,127
who killed Jang Youngest?

1702
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:16,754
I'm dying to know.

1703
01:10:16,837 --> 01:10:17,922
Ms. Joo Daughter-in-law.

1704
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:20,382
Are you…

1705
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:22,801
She's the culprit.

1706
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:25,888
…Jang Youngest's killer?

1707
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:28,766
Well?

1708
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:32,311
I'm not.

1709
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:33,270
After all that?

1710
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,109
Yes, she is!

1711
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:42,863
Yes, she is!

1712
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:46,575
SUCCESSFULLY APPREHENDED THE CULPRIT

1713
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:48,410
Joo Daughter-in-law!

1714
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:51,080
-Poor babe.
-Joo Belle-Fille.

1715
01:10:51,163 --> 01:10:52,498
You're good, Detective.

1716
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:55,000
Goes to show you can't trust anybody.

1717
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:58,254
Above all else,
I just love seeing her in there.

1718
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:01,840
I may be in here now,
but a lot of you belong here too.

1719
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:03,425
Jang Daughter, you should be in there too.

1720
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:05,302
Why should I go in there?

1721
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:07,471
-Dad died by missing a step.
-You committed a crime!

1722
01:11:07,554 --> 01:11:08,847
-How is that my fault?
-Unbelievable.

1723
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,557
-You killed your dad!
-You're the worst.

1724
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:13,435
-Killed whom? I can't believe this.
-You just let it happen!

1725
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:16,772
We'll now announce
the key piece of evidence you missed.

1726
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:18,399
-We missed something?
-What is it?

1727
01:11:18,482 --> 01:11:21,277
An Detective, please tell them
what you discovered.

1728
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:23,821
-What did you find?
-So you really found something?

1729
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:25,072
-Come this way.
-Shall we?

1730
01:11:27,908 --> 01:11:30,411
AN DETECTIVE'S FINAL EXAMINATION
OF THE SCENE

1731
01:11:30,494 --> 01:11:32,788
What if he was killed like this?

1732
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:35,749
What if the culprit killed him
by pulling the cord?

1733
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,627
I tried it myself,
and it was hard to apply a lot of force.

1734
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:41,046
It felt like I was getting pushed back.

1735
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:44,216
So I figured the killer must've needed
somewhere to put their foot on

1736
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,719
and checked to see
where they could've gotten that support.

1737
01:11:52,599 --> 01:11:53,726
What's this?

1738
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:57,813
There was this vertical scratch mark.

1739
01:11:57,896 --> 01:11:59,815
If the culprit were a woman

1740
01:11:59,898 --> 01:12:04,528
wearing high heels
or some other shoes with a narrow base,

1741
01:12:04,611 --> 01:12:09,074
I figured she could've left a similar mark
when she pushed the casket with her foot.

1742
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:11,535
The only one who could've made
a mark like this was…

1743
01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:13,787
-With their shoes?
-Joo Belle-Fille over there.

1744
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:15,122
That's impressive.

1745
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:16,373
How did you figure this out?

1746
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:17,708
-You're good, An Detective.
-My gosh.

1747
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:21,670
So that's why she kept
carrying her shoes around.

1748
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:22,588
Applause, please.

1749
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:25,382
How did you figure this out?
You're amazing, Detective.

1750
01:12:25,466 --> 01:12:28,635
Ms. Jang Daughter made a great point too.

1751
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:30,763
She mentioned the petals.

1752
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:32,056
-Right, the petals.
-She caught that.

1753
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:34,558
The thing is,
I never put the body in Drawer 4.

1754
01:12:34,641 --> 01:12:37,811
I put the body in Drawer 1
and the petals fell below.

1755
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:40,481
-You put it in Drawer 1?
-Yeah.

1756
01:12:40,564 --> 01:12:42,191
She put it in Drawer 1

1757
01:12:42,274 --> 01:12:44,860
-Look at that monitor.
-but realized another body

1758
01:12:44,943 --> 01:12:47,237
-would be placed there at 5:45 a.m.
-Oh, another body.

1759
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:49,823
Yes, it said Ji Hellbound was coming in,

1760
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:53,077
so I quickly took it out
and put it in Drawer 2.

1761
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:56,705
-Good job, babe.
-Shouldn't we at least see the will?

1762
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:58,707
-Right, where's the will?
-I really want to see the will.

1763
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:01,085
-Tell me about it.
-Hey, it's the lawyer.

1764
01:13:01,668 --> 01:13:02,544
Mr. Attorney!

1765
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:05,005
-Why'd you get here so late?
-He's clearly a lawyer.

1766
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:07,216
Why didn't you come sooner?

1767
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:09,009
-I will now
-Yes?

1768
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:11,220
reveal the contents of
Chairman Jang Breadwinner's will.

1769
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:13,222
Oh my, I can't believe this.

1770
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:15,557
-I'm his real son. This is exciting.
-I'm looking forward to this.

1771
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:17,434
-He'd better have left me something.
-I'm excited.

1772
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:18,602
-Let me read it.
-I'm curious.

1773
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:20,854
"Will and testament."

1774
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:22,689
"Testator, Jang Breadwinner."

1775
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:26,443
"I hereby declare the following."

1776
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:30,739
"First, I acknowledge Kim Sweetheart,
whom I had been unaware of until now,

1777
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:33,325
as my biological son

1778
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,202
and officially register him
in my family registry."

1779
01:13:35,285 --> 01:13:37,079
Sweet. What's next?

1780
01:13:37,162 --> 01:13:38,080
-And?
-What's next?

1781
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:42,084
"Second, while Jang Youngest
isn't my biological son,

1782
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:45,337
I also acknowledge him as my real son."

1783
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:47,297
-Oh my.
-How heartwarming.

1784
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:48,841
SHE DIDN'T EXPECT THIS…

1785
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:50,259
"Third,

1786
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:52,970
in fear that the family may attack, fight,

1787
01:13:53,053 --> 01:13:55,472
-and grow to resent each other
-They already did.

1788
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:58,976
and in hopes that they will succeed
on their own with hard work…

1789
01:13:59,059 --> 01:13:59,935
It can't be.

1790
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:03,021
-…all of my wealth
-No way.

1791
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:04,773
and stakes in Jang's Kimchi…

1792
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:08,902
are to be given back to society."

1793
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:10,779
-Hang on.
-Are you kidding me?

1794
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:13,031
-No, wait.
-"Signed, declared, and published

1795
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:15,492
-on December 28th, 2012
-I have 10 million won in debt!

1796
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:17,828
-by testator Jang Breadwinner."
-Oh my.

1797
01:14:17,911 --> 01:14:19,746
I'd rather just go in there.

1798
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:22,916
-That concludes the reading of the will.
-This family's dysfunctional, all right.

1799
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,878
-Okay.
-My, that's so satisfying.

1800
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:28,630
You've been poor all your life,
and you're poor again.

1801
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:30,424
-Joo Belle-Fille.
-I got way ahead of myself

1802
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:33,552
before I even got a taste
of all that fortune.

1803
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:36,180
-At least you can tell colors apart.
-This is what this family deserves.

1804
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:41,226
THE FULL STORY BEHIND
THE MURDER AT THE FUNERAL HALL

1805
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:45,314
Born as the daughter of a fish vendor
in a reeking seaside village,

1806
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:49,610
Joo Loser only dreamed
of escaping the never-ending poverty.

1807
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:52,821
While working as a bookkeeper
for a small company,

1808
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:56,575
she embezzled a large sum of company funds
and headed to Seoul.

1809
01:14:57,743 --> 01:14:59,578
Determined to turn her life around

1810
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:02,581
by marrying into a chaebol family,

1811
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:06,376
she used the stolen money
to buy herself a glamorous background,

1812
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:09,213
changed her name to Joo Daughter-in-law,

1813
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:12,174
tattooed a mole under her eye,
and was reborn.

1814
01:15:13,133 --> 01:15:14,218
However,

1815
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:16,261
even after spending a fortune
on a matchmaking agency

1816
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:17,804
and going on countless blind dates,

1817
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:20,474
marrying into a chaebol family
proved to be a challenge.

1818
01:15:20,557 --> 01:15:23,727
She then ran into Kim Sweetheart,
her ex-boyfriend,

1819
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:26,230
and began dating him again.

1820
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:28,732
Then one day,

1821
01:15:28,815 --> 01:15:32,736
she had a successful date
with Jang Second Son of Jang's Kimchi,

1822
01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:35,280
Korea's leading kimchi chaebol.

1823
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:38,242
She immediately broke up
with Kim Sweetheart

1824
01:15:38,325 --> 01:15:40,244
and achieved her dream

1825
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:43,580
of becoming a daughter-in-law
of a chaebol family at long last.

1826
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:47,334
However, she soon learned

1827
01:15:47,417 --> 01:15:50,671
that her father-in-law, Jang Breadwinner,
had set aside his first wife's children

1828
01:15:50,754 --> 01:15:53,423
in favor of Jang Youngest,
the son of his second wife, Park Wife,

1829
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:56,593
as the successor to Jang's Kimchi.

1830
01:15:57,219 --> 01:16:00,097
She tried to turn the tide
by having a child,

1831
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:02,099
but things didn't go as planned.

1832
01:16:02,182 --> 01:16:06,103
When her husband and mother-in-law
suddenly died in an unexpected accident,

1833
01:16:06,186 --> 01:16:09,314
she was left all alone,
with no one in the family to support her.

1834
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:13,402
Park Wife, inflated with pride
after becoming the lawfully wedded wife,

1835
01:16:13,485 --> 01:16:17,447
saw Daughter-in-law as a nuisance
and started bullying her.

1836
01:16:18,156 --> 01:16:20,993
The only person
who shielded her from Park Wife

1837
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:24,746
was Youngest, who had just returned home
after studying abroad.

1838
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:29,501
Eventually, Youngest confessed his love
for Daughter-in-law.

1839
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:34,172
Drawn by the fact that he was
the de facto successor of Jang's Kimchi,

1840
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:38,427
she began an illicit affair
with her brother-in-law.

1841
01:16:39,011 --> 01:16:40,304
Then one day,

1842
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:43,348
Jang Daughter brought home her fiancé.

1843
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:44,474
The problem was

1844
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:47,436
that he turned out to be
none other than Kim Sweetheart.

1845
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:51,440
Sweetheart vowed revenge
every time they crossed paths,

1846
01:16:51,523 --> 01:16:54,526
making Daughter-in-law
suffer through days of torment.

1847
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,528
To make matters worse,

1848
01:16:56,612 --> 01:17:00,532
her father-in-law burst into the room
while she and Youngest were on a date.

1849
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:03,910
He threatened Youngest
that if they didn't end things,

1850
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:05,871
he would be excluded from the will

1851
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:08,915
and be removed from the family register.

1852
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:12,502
He then declared that he would arrange
a match for Youngest.

1853
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:16,131
With time running out
and feeling cornered,

1854
01:17:16,214 --> 01:17:19,343
Daughter-in-law attempted
to secretly register their marriage,

1855
01:17:19,426 --> 01:17:21,928
but marriage between in-laws
was not allowed.

1856
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:25,390
Exceptions could be made
if pregnancy were involved,

1857
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:29,186
but she had already become infertile
because of Park Wife's scheme.

1858
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:31,063
Then,

1859
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:33,065
in the middle of her despair,

1860
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:36,693
the news of the unexpected death
of Jang Breadwinner reached her ears.

1861
01:17:37,235 --> 01:17:39,196
On the second night of the funeral,

1862
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:41,782
she witnessed Kim Sweetheart
speaking with the family lawyer

1863
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:43,367
at the funeral home.

1864
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:47,621
She also overheard that his name
was mentioned in the will.

1865
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:49,539
At that moment,

1866
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:54,419
she remembered how he and Breadwinner
had been meeting quite often lately.

1867
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:58,131
She immediately rushed home,
searched Breadwinner's study,

1868
01:17:58,215 --> 01:18:00,133
and found a confidentiality agreement.

1869
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:01,551
It revealed that the late first wife

1870
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:04,262
had switched Park Wife's son
with another boy

1871
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:06,890
and that it was not Youngest
but Sweetheart

1872
01:18:06,973 --> 01:18:09,976
who was the true youngest son
of the Jang family.

1873
01:18:11,103 --> 01:18:14,648
If Breadwinner had known this
and altered his will,

1874
01:18:14,731 --> 01:18:19,027
the successor to the Jang's Kimchi empire
and the inheritor of his vast wealth

1875
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:21,571
would be Sweetheart, not Youngest.

1876
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:25,409
Daughter-in-law decided
to break things off with Youngest

1877
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:28,412
and pursue a new beginning
with Sweetheart.

1878
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:29,788
However,

1879
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:32,874
despite learning that she was infertile
and unable to marry him,

1880
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:36,253
Youngest insisted they give up everything
and leave for France,

1881
01:18:36,336 --> 01:18:38,380
refusing to end their relationship.

1882
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:42,592
Certain that she couldn't make him
give up on her,

1883
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:45,637
Daughter-in-law concluded
that she needed to get rid of him.

1884
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:48,223
She pretended to be terminally ill

1885
01:18:48,306 --> 01:18:51,268
and proposed that they commit
suicide together,

1886
01:18:51,852 --> 01:18:54,855
and Youngest accepted
Daughter-in-law's suggestion.

1887
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:57,023
At 5 a.m.,

1888
01:18:57,107 --> 01:18:59,401
the two met in the mortuary.

1889
01:18:59,484 --> 01:19:02,154
First, they removed
Breadwinner's body from his casket

1890
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:06,533
and put it in Drawer 1 of the freezer,
where his casket had been.

1891
01:19:06,616 --> 01:19:08,660
Then, they exchanged rings

1892
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:11,580
that Youngest had bought
as a promise to be together forever.

1893
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:14,624
She then took out the thermos
with two compartments,

1894
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:16,626
one filled with water
and the other with methanol.

1895
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:18,211
She drank the water

1896
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:21,089
while giving Youngest the methanol

1897
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:24,426
and laid in the coffin
while facing each other.

1898
01:19:24,509 --> 01:19:27,262
After seeing Youngest's eyes close,

1899
01:19:27,345 --> 01:19:30,223
she quietly left the mortuary.

1900
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:32,726
If the cremation went as planned,

1901
01:19:32,809 --> 01:19:36,229
Youngest would disappear without a trace.

1902
01:19:37,147 --> 01:19:38,440
Just then,

1903
01:19:38,523 --> 01:19:43,111
she saw the schedule of enshrinements
and processions on the lobby's monitor.

1904
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:45,363
Upon learning

1905
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:47,407
that a new body would be enshrined

1906
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:50,368
in Drawer 1 of the mortuary freezer
at 5:45 a.m.,

1907
01:19:50,994 --> 01:19:53,038
she rushed to the mortuary

1908
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:57,083
and moved Breadwinner's body
from Drawer 1 to Drawer 2,

1909
01:19:57,167 --> 01:19:59,002
where the body of a John Doe was.

1910
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:02,881
That was when she heard a moan
coming from Breadwinner's casket.

1911
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,050
She opened it

1912
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:09,095
and found that Youngest
was somehow still alive.

1913
01:20:09,846 --> 01:20:12,891
Panicking, Daughter-in-law strangled him

1914
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:16,186
with a piece of cut cord lying nearby
and killed him completely.

1915
01:20:16,269 --> 01:20:17,562
After closing the casket lid,

1916
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:20,148
she rewound the cord
neatly around the spool

1917
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:23,068
and calmly left the mortuary.

1918
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:27,781
The instructions on a methanol box
found in the lobby

1919
01:20:27,864 --> 01:20:30,534
told her that Youngest
had regained consciousness

1920
01:20:30,617 --> 01:20:32,994
because of the soju
he had drunk just before.

1921
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:36,957
Relieved, Daughter-in-law
returned to the funeral parlor,

1922
01:20:37,457 --> 01:20:40,252
hoping the casket Youngest was in

1923
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:42,546
would safely burn

1924
01:20:42,629 --> 01:20:45,257
and let her crime go undetected.

1925
01:20:53,723 --> 01:20:56,434
With the weather this gloomy,

1926
01:20:57,394 --> 01:20:59,396
the case is looking
all the more mysterious.

1927
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:02,107
HANGANG BRIDGE

1928
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:05,235
I got you now.

1929
01:21:05,318 --> 01:21:06,778
HWANG BILLIONAIRE

1930
