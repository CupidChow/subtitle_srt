00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:31,364
Today, 583 more people
have tested positive for COVID-19.

3
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,867
The government has raised the level
of social distancing and banned gatherings

4
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,076
of more than five people…

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,289
Tonight, Seoul City is introducing
a citywide shutdown of shops after 9 p.m.,

00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,249

00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:48,089
Record-breaking heavy rain has caused
severe flooding in the central region…

10
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:52,343
Especially in the Gangdam District,
where hourly rainfall of 120 mm

11
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,595
has caused flooding in many areas…

12
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:56,681
Gangdam District
is working to minimize damage

13
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,684

00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,329
It's the perfect weather
for a crime to occur.

18
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,208
Jeez.

19
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,253
What a cruel and chaotic world.

How could a murder like this

32
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,848
have happened in the heart of Gangdam?

33
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,603
How does this make any sense?

34
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,691
-Hey!
-Detective.

35
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,068
Hello, sir. AD, reporting for duty.

36
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:32,986
Get over here.

37
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,905
Who knows what kind of germs
you might be carrying?

38
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,408
-Okay, you can take off your mask.
-Got it.

39
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,325

41
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,787
Detective, don't tell me you caught it.

42
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,705
(THOROUGH)

43
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:47,876
What were you up to
before becoming an assistant detective?

44
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,752
I used to dance a little.

45
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,879
-You danced?
-Yes.

46
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:51,796
-Is that so?
-Yes.

47
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,214
Show me some moves, then.

48
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,551
I need to see whether you'll make
a decent assistant detective or not.

49
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:57,802
Got it.

50
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,555
WARMING UP HIS JOINTS…

51
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,228
ACK!

52
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,982
A RAIN-SOAKED HAZING

53
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,650
That was part of my performance.

54
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,027
That was some impressive dancing.

55
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,153
VERY SATISFIED

56
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,613

THE ASSISTANT DETECTIVE
TITLE EARNED THROUGH PAIN

58
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,701
Anyway, what case are we dealing with?
What happened here?

59
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,745
To be honest, I had trouble

60
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,580
identifying the victim for today's case.

61
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:26,915
All I know is
she worked at Sensibility Bar--

62
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:27,832
What?

63
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,044
So we don't have anything else
on the victim?

64
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,503
At the moment, we don't.

65
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,047
Are you kidding me?

66
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,965
Fine. Do we at least have our suspects?

67
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,092
Yes, sir. I'll bring them all here.

68
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,595
-Put the squeeze on them first.
-Yes, sir.

69
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,556
They should be taught
who's the boss from the get-go.

70
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,141
A VICTIM DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY…

71
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,142
That weather's awful.

72
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,685
WHO ARE THE SUSPECTS IN THIS CASE?

73
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,231
Any idea why we got called out this late?

74
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,108
What's the holdup? Move it along!

75
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,236
-Don't you know gatherings are banned?
-Suspects.

76
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,363
Suspects, form a single line.

77
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:01,241
-Keep in mind the times we're in.
-Who are you calling a suspect?

78
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,825
Who are you to boss us around?

79
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,162
I'm the lead detective on this case.

80
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,790
-A case?
-In light of the pandemic,

81
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,458
-I'll check your temperature first.
-Sure.

82
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,709
THOROUGH TEMPERATURE CHECK

83
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,963
You're at 36.3°C.

84
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,506
-Pass. You may remove your mask.
-Thanks.

85
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,466
-Wait here.
-What?

86
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,051
-Stand by!
-Okay.

87
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,844
Repeat the command. Stand by.

88
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:22,804
Stand by!

89
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,933
You're at 36.4°C. Pass.

90
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,937
Jeez. What's with all this nonsense?

91
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,356
You're at 36.3°C. Pass.

92
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,651
Did you even sanitize this?

93
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,237
-Pick up the pace.
-You're at 36.3°C.

94
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,488
-What the…
-What a hassle.

95
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,990
Are you serious right now?

96
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,410
It's because of the pandemic.

97
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,371
I've been flipping this mask inside out
every three days to get by.

98
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,914
I have no choice but to target your eye.

99
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:50,999
A NECESSARY ACTION

100
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,500
You're at 36.5°C. Pass.

101
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,586
-But my eyes are intense.
-I'm a busy person, you know.

102
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,172
-What the heck is going on?
-Why are we here?

103
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,674
-All right.
-I've been out all day today.

104
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,426
There's been a murder.

105
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,094
-What?
-Let's take a look at the crime scene.

106
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,554
It's this way. Come with me.

107
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:08,308
-Who in the world died?
-Seems like I'm tangled up in a mess.

108
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,979
-What is this?
-Who is this?

109
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,565
Is that Gun-mi?

110
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,358
Gun-mi?

111
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,651
-What the heck?
-Is that Gun-mi?

112
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,445
-Gun-mi?
-It's Lee Gun-mi.

113
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,654
-Gun-mi!
-Gun-mi?

114
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,615
-It's Lee Gun-mi.
-Hold on.

115
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,992
Do you know the victim?

116
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,493
Gun-mi's my friend.

117
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,412
-Gun-mi? What's her last name?
-Yes.

118
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,830
-Lee Gun-mi.
-Lee Gun-mi?

119
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,832
You know the victim, Ms. Lee Gun-mi?

120
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:33,958
FRIENDS WITH THE VICTIM?

121
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,085
Hold on.

122
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,964
Since she's your friend,
can I assume she's a woman?

123
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,758
Anyone can tell she's a woman.

124
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,259
Let's move things along.

125
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:46,054
You say she's a woman, but…

126
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,597
Her neck… Oh jeez!

127
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,514
What's wrong?

128
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,058
She has an Adam's apple.

129
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,809
Look.

130
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:52,727
What?

131
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,354
What the heck?

132
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,814
Detective!

133
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,025
Hey, AD.

134
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,360
Here's the victim's file.

135
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,279
HAS THE VICTIM FINALLY BEEN IDENTIFIED?

136
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,406
Is that the case? I see.

137
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,536
The victim is Lee Gun-jun.

138
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,496
What?

139
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,082
A 27-year-old male.

140
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,249
What?

141
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,877
Are you saying that's Lee Gun-jun,
not Lee Gun-mi?

142
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,629
THE VICTIM ISN'T LEE GUN-MI, A WOMAN,
BUT LEE GUN-JUN, A MAN?

143
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,381
Wait. Gun-jun's my friend.

144
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,800
HIS FRIEND?

145
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,885
Are you saying this is Gun-jun?

146
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,679
Didn't you hear the detective say
he was 27, you old man?

147
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,806
How old are you?

148
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,226
Just so you know, I'm 27.
He's my friend, and we're the same age.

149
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,727
The world is going mad, isn't it?

150
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,312
Come on, Ms. Park. Don't be like that.

151
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,815
I can tell something's off
about you people already.

152
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,110
The victim is Lee Gun-jun,

153
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,653
a 27-year-old male.

154
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,570
Unemployed.

155
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,239
His body was discovered

156
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,366
in the nightlife district
of Gangdam Station's Youth Street

157
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,743
at midnight on the 12th.

158
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,829
Exposure to the rain caused inconsistency

159
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,206
in the rate
at which the body temperature dropped,

160
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:58,292
making it impossible
to accurately determine the time of death.

161
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,671
The rain not only made it difficult
to estimate the time of death

162
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,048
but also wiped away the victim's blood

163
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,050
and potential evidence
left behind by the culprit.

164
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,761
This puts us in a very tough spot.

165
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,639
Business was already bad around here,
and now this?

166
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,141
Bad luck just doesn't let up, does it?

167
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,894
-Let's catch who did it.
-Form a single line and follow me.

168
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,772
Don't you dare slip away and come with me.

169
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,524
I need to get back to the store.

170
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,568
DIGGING INTO THE SUSPECTS

171
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:24,819
We're in for a ride today.

172
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,946
First suspect, Kim Club.

173
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,614
A 57-year-old male.

174
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,783
Owner of Club Slam.

175
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,785
Second suspect, An Dancer.

176
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,245
A 27-year-old female.

177
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,456
Dancer at Club Slam.

178
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,624
Third suspect, Park Chicken.

179
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,126
A 38-year-old female.

180
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,044
Owner of a fried chicken restaurant.

181
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,213
Fourth suspect, Jang C-store.

182
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,715
A 27-year-old male.

183
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,758
Part-timer at a convenience store.

184
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,969
Fifth suspect, Ha Gold Spoon.

185
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,429
A 32-year-old male.

186
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:56,100
Attorney and mediator
of the Gangdam District lease dispute.

187
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,811
Let's hurry up and catch the culprit

188
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,356
so the victim's soul can find peace
after the wrongful death.

189
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,066
-Got it?
-Who knows if it was wrongful?

190
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,611
All right. Let's begin the investigation.

191
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,697
The first thing we need to clarify

192
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,993
is whether you knew the victim
as Lee Gun-mi or Lee Gun-jun.

193
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,411
That's crucial.

194
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,954
-Mr. Kim Club.
-Yes?

195
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:21,250
Please introduce yourself
and how you knew the victim.

196
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,502
Sure thing.

197
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:26,714
I'm the owner of the hottest club
near Gangdam Station in Gangdam District.

198
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,174
-It's called Club Slam.
-"Club Slam"?

199
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:31,177
-I run a club near Gangdam Station.
-Okay.

200
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,637
The victim, did you say?

201
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,554
Yes.

202
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,722
Lee Gun-mi, was it?

203
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:38,434
The victim's name was Lee Gun-jun,
not Lee Gun-mi.

204
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,103
That darn brat was a guy.

205
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,939
Are you saying
you didn't know he was a man?

206
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,233
I thought he was a she.

207
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,194
So you had no idea
that the victim was a man?

208
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,154
How would I have known that?

209
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,239
Understood.

210
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,324
We'll move on to Ms. Park Chicken.

211
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,786
Right. Well, I've been running
a fried chicken restaurant

212
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,204
for just over a year now.

213
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,247
-A year?
-That's right.

214
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,541
I knew the victim as Lee Gun-mi,

215
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,169
and we've been friends for several years.

216
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:09,507
So you and Ms. Lee Gun-mi were friends?

217
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,843
We used to keep in touch regularly,

218
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,304
but then drifted apart.

219
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,807
-We only recently reconnected.
-Hold on.

220
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,517
Ms. Park is one scary woman.

221
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,270
Wait. Are those tattoos on your arms?

222
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,230
Yes. Is having tattoos against the law?

223
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,732
Do you slaughter the chickens yourself?

224
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,734
Why is your apron covered in blood?

225
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:32,738
I'm all about serving fried chicken
from freshly butchered chickens.

226
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,366
My restaurant is pretty well-known
around Gangdam District.

227
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,702
Do you always wear your hair like that
while frying chicken?

228
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,620
-Got a problem with it?
-Are those horns or what?

229
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,414
My customers say
they look like drumsticks,

230
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,623
but it's actually for hygiene.

231
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,251
The fried chicken lady
with the drumstick hairstyle.

232
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,794
Let's move on to Mr. Ha Gold Spoon.

233
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,629
-Sure thing.
-Please go ahead.

234
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,424
Honestly, I don't even know why I'm here.

235
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,801
-I save lives, not take them away.
-He's hot.

236
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,011
-Isn't he super hot?
-Is that so?

237
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,972
I'm working as the mediator
of the Gangdam District

238
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,599
commercial property lease dispute.

239
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:03,311
However, my main job is an attorney.

240
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,729
My family members

241
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,148
have practiced law for generations,

242
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,483
so I naturally chose the same path.

243
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,153
Hey, Detective. Let's send this guy home.

244
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,571
-Yes, let's.
-He couldn't have done this.

245
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,031
That's for me to decide!

246
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,158
Gold Spoon's not the type
to be in this part of town.

247
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:20,286
-He's on the suspect list.
-Did you call him by name?

248
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,705
Did I hear that right?
Are you on a first-name basis?

249
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,165
-Look here.
-Mr. Gold Spoon.

250
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,625
Is that how things are?

251
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,003
I serve the public, so why am I here
being treated like a criminal?

252
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,297
-I can vouch for this man.
-Right.

253
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,798
He's actually my landlord.

254
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,468
-Everyone around here knows him.
-In Gangdam District…

255
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,845
Are you a landlord?

256
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:41,515
I sure am. Goldspoon Buildings 1 and 2
are registered in my name.

257
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,850
I see, sir.

258
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,602
(SUDDENLY SHOWING RESPECT)

259
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,854
I'll do my best
to make you comfortable today.

260
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,022
Do you need an office?

261
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:49,440
Well, kind of.

262
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,942
-I'll let you know if a spot opens up.
-Sure.

263
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:52,860
Anyway,

264
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,529
did you know the victim,

265
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:59,158
either as Lee Gun-jun or Lee Gun-mi?

266
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:02,370
I went to Sensibility Bar to grab a drink
by myself and met the victim,

267
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,996
who was working part-time.

268
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,415
-That's when we got to know each other.
-Sensibility Bar?

269
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:10,419
Was the victim working part-time
as Lee Gun-jun or Lee Gun-mi?

270
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,254
She was working there as Lee Gun-mi.

271
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,964
Lee Gun-mi worked part-time.

272
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,549
-And that's how you met her?
-That's right.

273
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,926
I'm shocked

274
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,178
by what Ms. Chicken, Mr. Club,

275
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,972
-and Mr. Attorney just said.
-Why's that?

276
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:25,559
Because that's definitely Gun-jun,
my classmate from high school.

277
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,477
-What?
-Yeah.

278
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,645
What are you on about?

279
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,231
I can't believe
he's been living as a woman,

280
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:33,442
partying and working part-time.

281
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,529
I'm just so shocked
by everything I've just heard.

282
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,447
I had absolutely no idea.

283
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,826
Anyway, I work part-time
at a local convenience store.

284
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,537
My name's Jang C-store.

285
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,247
You might know this already,

286
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,582
but I work longer hours
than most part-timers.

287
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,293
I see him at the store whenever I drop by.

288
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,461
-He's very hardworking.
-Very.

289
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,464
Morning, evening, or night.
He's always there.

290
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,758
Judging by his looks,
I thought he was the owner.

291
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,093
Just to avoid any misunderstandings,

292
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,928
I really am 27.

293
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,556
-You seem like a nice guy.
-We're the same age.

294
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,058
Keep reminding us
so we won't get confused.

295
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,893
-We're the same age.
-This is a crazy world.

296
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,645
You must find it easy
to speak casually to him, then.

297
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,565
Why would I be uncomfortable
when we're the same age, Gold Spoon?

298
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,692
Since you're talking,
we'll move on to you, Ms. An Dancer.

299
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:18,696
Okay. I'm An Dancer, Gun-mi's best friend.

300
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,281
Mr. Kim Club is my boss.

301
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,283
I work as a dancer at his club.

302
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,410
-She's one of my employees.
-At Club Slam?

303
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:29,039
You said you were friends
with the victim, Ms. Lee Gun-mi.

304
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,041
Yes, we were best friends.

305
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,087
To be honest, I knew.

306
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,046
Knew what?

307
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,924
I knew she was actually a guy.

308
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,634
-What?
-You knew?

309
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:44,680
You became best friends with Lee Gun-mi
despite knowing she was actually a guy?

310
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,348
We were best friends from the beginning.

311
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:50,019
We were close enough
that we eventually shared our secrets.

312
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,228
She told me herself.

313
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:56,567
Did the victim want to transition
to become a woman?

314
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,527
Yes, she was a woman at heart.

315
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,779
-A woman at heart, huh?
Yes.

316
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:03,783
We couldn't get an accurate read
on the victim's body temperature

317
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,119
due to exposure to the heavy rain.

318
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,664
And that means, we can't pin down
the estimated time of death.

319
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,874
Oh dear.

320
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:15,503
I'd like to know the last time
each of you saw the victim,

321
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,380
either as Lee Gun-jun or Lee Gun-mi.

322
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,673
I didn't see him.

323
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,593
Were you working
at the convenience store yesterday?

324
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,512
-I was.
-You were on shift,

325
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,056
but you didn't notice anything going on
in the empty lot next to the store?

326
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:31,101
No, and just so you know,
Gun-jun lived above the convenience store.

327
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,187
-Yet, you didn't see him?
-No, I didn't see him yesterday.

328
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,897
-Are you sure?
-He could be lying.

329
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,023
That's rather suspicious.

330
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,149
What about you, Mr. Club?

331
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,319
I saw her around 8:20 p.m.

332
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,279
-Did you say 8:20 p.m.?
-It was around then. Yes.

333
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,197
Where did you see her?

334
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,491
In front of her place.

335
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,701
I see. So, you saw her.

336
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,078
What about you, ma'am?

337
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,581
I think it was a little over 9 p.m.

338
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,583
-I saw her outside her place.
-Outside her home?

339
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,418
You saw her outside her home.

340
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,336
What?

341
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,965
Ms. Chicken's account
just jogged my memory.

342
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:05,302
I saw them arguing at around 9:15 p.m.

343
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,513
We didn't meet up or anything.
I just happened to see it.

344
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,722
I'll take your word for now.

345
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,016
The truth will come out
once we investigate.

346
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,269
-That sounds suspicious.
-You'll be in big trouble if you lie.

347
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,312
What about you, sir?

348
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,482
I bumped into her briefly yesterday.

349
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,860
Around what time and where?

350
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,945
It was past 9 p.m…

351
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,113
Let me think.

352
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,865
It was around 9:45 p.m.

353
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,700
-Around 9:45?
-Around 9:45?

354
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,119
-Where?
-Right here. Outside my office.

355
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,371
Outside your office?
She didn't come inside?

356
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,539
No, she didn't.

357
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,584
You ran into her outside your office.
How did she seem?

358
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,587
I can't recall the details,

359
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,131
but she seemed to be in a hurry.

360
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,507
In a hurry?

361
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,927
Ha Gold Spoon said he saw her at 9:45 p.m.

362
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,930
Isn't the last person
to see the victim alive

363
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,307
usually the most suspicious?

364
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,684
No one saw her after that
because she was dead by then.

365
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:58,439
Assuming you're all telling the truth,

366
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,149
the estimated time of death

367
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:06,155
is between 9:45 p.m. and midnight.

368
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,699
Now, please tell me
what you were doing during that time.

369
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,576
I'd appreciate full honesty.

370
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,661
I probably look
the most suspicious right now,

371
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,747
so I'll tell you
how my evening went first.

372
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,959
I was in a meeting with business owners
who were affected by COVID-19.

373
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,794
-A meeting?
-Yes, it was held right here.

374
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,880
-He's telling the truth.
-You can see the banner over there.

375
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,634
"Gangdam Station Youth Street Meeting

376
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,303
With Business Owners
Affected by COVID-19."

377
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,305
-You hosted that meeting?
-I did.

378
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:35,726
I personally secured the support fund
from the Gangdam District Head.

379
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,687
Hoping to be of some help
to business owners,

380
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,482
I used my gift of persuasion
on the District Head.

381
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,817
Okay, when did the meeting end?

382
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:47,571
I gave legal advice until midnight,
so my alibi is solid.

383
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,490
-So, you were in a meeting.
-That's right.

384
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,741
And you, Mr. Club?

385
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,493
I was here with my landlord.

386
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,745
After all,
I'm also a small local business owner.

387
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:59,375
-You attended the meeting?
-Yes, I arrived at around 9:30 p.m.

388
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,669
-Did you sign the document?
-Of course.

389
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,838
-And Ms. Dancer?
-I also went to the meeting

390
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,049
on behalf of the owner of Sensibility Bar.

391
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,676
Was the whole neighborhood there or what?

392
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,927
You had to attend to receive aid.

393
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,011
NO SUPPORT FUND FOR ABSENTEES

394
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,429
Dancer's one of my employees,

395
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,682
but something came up
for the owner of Sensibility Bar,

396
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,685
so I brought her along to the meeting

397
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,436
so she could represent them.

398
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,980
Understood.

399
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,189
What about you, kid?

400
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,485
Can you also call me by my name,
Detective?

401
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,363
-I want to be called by my name.
-Do you?

402
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,281
The more I see him,
the younger he appears.

403
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,616
-C-store.
-Yes?

404
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,993
What were you up to?

405
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,494
I was also at the meeting.

406
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,745
-You were at the meeting too?
-Yes.

407
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,539
-I also--
-What about your shift?

408
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,041
I got here after my shift, so I was late.

409
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:45,045
In that case, Ms. Chicken,
you must've been at the meeting too.

410
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,756
-I didn't even bother registering.
-What?

411
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,216
My life's kept me on my toes.

412
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,803
You were on your toes?
Isn't that all the more reason to attend?

413
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,471
-Anyway, you didn't attend?
-No.

414
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,349
I wasn't desperate for money,
so I didn't bother registering.

415
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,059
Instead, I handled other matters.

416
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,477
Understood.

417
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:05,232
So, while the four of them
were in the same place,

418
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,860
you were handling personal matters.

419
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,612
Anyway, starting now,

420
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,532
you will assist me
in identifying the culprit.

421
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:17,453
You will investigate the scene
in teams of two.

422
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,538
-To prove your innocence,
-What a nuisance.

423
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,790
you must catch the culprit. Got it?

424
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,960
I will find out who did this
to avenge my friend.

425
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,212
How will we be paired up?

426
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,797
You want me to pair you
with your friend?

427
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,508
(NO, WITH GOLD SPOON♥)

428
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,135
You've got to be kidding me.

429
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,555
I'll give you what you want.

430
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,639
Take your friend with you.

431
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,559
-Let's do our best with the investigation.
-Sure.

432
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,477
Shall we?

433
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:43,729
I can't believe what happened.

434
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,023
The business owners
are worried sick as it is.

435
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,024
EXAMINING THE SCENE

436
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,234
THE NIGHT OF AUGUST 12, 2020

437
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,904
SOCIAL DISTANCING

438
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,405
AND HEAVY RAIN

439
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,909
GANGDAM STATION'S YOUTH STREET
WAS ALL BUT EMPTY

440
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,370
MEANWHILE

441
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,206
IN AN EMPTY LOT

442
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,334
THE VICTIM WAS FOUND DEAD

443
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,630
EMPTY LOT, LEE GUN-JUN'S HOUSE

444
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,091
JANG C-STORE'S CONVENIENCE STORE,
GANGDAM POLICE AGENCY, HANSIM POCHA

445
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,759
GANGSTER WHOLE CHICKEN, CLUB SLAM

446
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,553
HA GOLD SPOON'S OFFICE, SENSIBILITY BAR

447
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:20,849
INITIAL EXAMINATION OF CRIME SCENE
COLLECT CLUES FOR 15 MINUTES IN PAIRS

448
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,601
-C-store.
-Yeah?

449
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,562
You botched my shot
at getting paired up with Gold Spoon.

450
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:29,191
I'm struggling enough as it is,
and now a person's dead.

451
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:32,319
We'll have even fewer people
in the streets at night now.

452
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,654
Tonight's the night.

453
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,073
I'll look into every angle.

454
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,866
TEAM 3: JANG DETECTIVE & PARK CHICKEN

455
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,576
So, Gun-mi was a man, huh?

456
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,912
We'll start by checking that first.

457
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,541
AN EMPTY LOT IN THE CORNER
OF GANGDAM STATION'S YOUTH STREET

458
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,792
GANGDAM DISTRICT
TEMPORARY SCREENING CENTER

459
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,920
A TEMPORARY COVID-19 SCREENING CENTER
IS SET UP IN ONE CORNER

460
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,924
CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS
ARE SCATTERED EVERYWHERE

461
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,302
The body was found in an empty lot.

462
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,556
Due to the rain,
the bloodstains and other evidence

463
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,725
had already been washed away.

464
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:08,438
It's possible that the culprit's traces
were washed away as well.

465
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,983
I don't think this case
will be an easy one to solve.

466
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,027
That little…

467
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,821
Oh no, my poor Gun-mi.

468
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,322
Man, what a shame, Gun-jun.

469
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,908
Gun-jun, was it?

470
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,994
The kid had me completely fooled.

471
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,997
I thought she was a woman.
How was I supposed to know otherwise?

472
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,957
Is that why she always wore a scarf?

473
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,834
That explains the scarf.

474
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,545
-Detective, doesn't her neck look chafed?
-Hold on.

475
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,213
Isn't that a strangulation mark?

476
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,840
You're right. There's some redness.

477
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,176
Considering the mark,
she was likely strangled to death.

478
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,218
Look at her head.

479
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,139
She has a deep gash on her head.

480
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,932
-You're right.
-That's pretty deep.

481
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,269
It looks like it was made
with a claw hammer.

482
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,105
What's this?

483
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,108
What happened here?
Did something chafe her back?

484
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,152
Doesn't it look like
something was scraped against it?

485
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,404
Are these scratches from fingernails?
What are these marks?

486
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,991
She also has wounds
on the back of her hands.

487
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,285
It clearly got physical.

488
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,954
It's safe to say she was in a fistfight.

489
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,414
-She's pretty banged up.
-Exactly.

490
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,001
What could've been the murder weapon?

491
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,587
Was she attacked with a shovel?

492
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:18,967
This shovel…

493
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,222
DID HE FIND THE MURDER WEAPON?

494
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,641
Goodness. What do we have here?

495
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,185
-Hey, C-store.
-Yeah?

496
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,062
Aren't her shoes too clean?

497
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,563
It could be because of the rain.

498
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,274
-Were the soles washed clean?
-It could've washed the soles clean.

499
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,320
Let's check her purse.

500
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,780
EXAMINING THE VICTIM'S BELONGINGS

501
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,365
There's quite a bit of stuff here.

502
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,908
Jeez, this is a lot.

503
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,826
A passport? Was he going somewhere?

504
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,496
Why else would he have a passport on him?

505
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,830
Why was she carrying around a passport

506
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,458
when she's never even
traveled abroad before?

507
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,418
She's been making a lot of money.

508
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:57,130
"Kim Sucker, Lightweight,
Richie, Han Sucker."

509
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,508
She got a lot of money
out of these suckers.

510
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,803
She also got her deposit back,
so she must've been planning to move out.

511
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,638
I guess she was planning to
leave the country.

512
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,307
-Probably to run away abroad or something.
-What's this?

513
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,435
FUNGMU AIR, E-TICKET

514
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,979
She booked a flight to Russia.

515
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,063
Russia?

516
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,065
She was going to take the redeye tonight,

517
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,359

LEE GUN-JUN'S PHONE

519
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,699
What is it?

520
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,826
-She had been texting.
-About what?

521
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,245
It was with Jang C-store,
the convenience store part-timer.

522
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,539
C-store, you little punk!

523
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,623
What are the texts about?

524
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,541
MESSAGES

525
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,459
She wrote, "Hope you're ready."

526
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,502
"Hope you're ready"?

527
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,673
C-store called her at 9:57 p.m.

528
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,467
What the hell? C-store, you little…

529
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:47,806
Mr. Attorney, I see you've exchanged
messages with Gun-jun.

530

"Meet me at my usual lounge bar."

535
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,399
Who says we can't be friends?

536
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:01,236
-And here I thought you were a decent guy.
-There's nothing to it.

537
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,446
Besides, we didn't meet up.

538
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,072
You didn't?

Mr. Attorney.

546
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,008
-Yes?
-This is awfully suspicious.

547
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,927
Well…

548
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,347
-I knew her as Gun-mi.
-Smile.

00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,558
MR. SUSPICIOUS ATTORNEY

552
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,859
Why did a guy who owns two buildings
do such a thing?

00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,408
"Don't screw up."

571
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,410

How did Gold Spoon
come up with such a good idea?

577
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,180
This guy's not so clean, is he?

578
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,140
BUSINESS CARDS FROM FANCY BARS

00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,475

the one run by Jeong Tender,

581
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,855
and even the one run by Kim Piano Key.

582
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,190

He sure loves to drink for an attorney.

587
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,493
DOES THE PRIVILEGED RICH MAN
ENJOY THE NIGHTLIFE?

588

CRUMPLED PAPER IN THE TRASH CAN

You've got to be kidding me.

591
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,089
She thinks a slap to her forehead
cured her text neck?

592
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,757
"Do you believe there's a god,
Gold Spoon?"

593
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:31,219
"Well, I do.
Be my savior and my god, Gold Spoon."

594
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,930

00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,190
Why are all the nostrils heart-shaped?

598
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,692
What's this guy's deal?

599
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,528

611
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,597
Let's check his messages.

612
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,391
"I'm Ha Gold Spoon,
the one you met at Sensibility."

613
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,060
"Then tell me which days you're free."

614
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:21,937
Is Gold Spoon serious?

615
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,694
"Park Hyeon-jun, convenience store."

616
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,613
Wait. What's this?

618
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,742
I read these messages
on Lee Gun-mi's phone earlier.

619
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,536
What the heck?

620
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:39,871
"Memories of that day."

621
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,917
They slept together.

622
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,420
Mr. Attorney!

623
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,714
Mr. Attorney,
I didn't expect this from you.

624
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,508
I must admit, I'm a little disappointed.

625
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:59,975
You must've been into clubbing.

626
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,940
VIBING

627
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:09,109
Hey, don't mess with that.

628
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:11,278
That's reserved for the DJ!

629
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,154
Come on, it's me you're talking to.

630
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,282
It's not like I haven't been here before.

631
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,033
HA GOLD SPOON IS NO STRANGER TO CLUBBING

632
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:20,287
I want to check out the club you work at.

633
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,123
I was rejected at the door
the last time I went there.

634
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,709
I think I know why. It's because…

635
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,586
-Never mind.
-Why? Tell me.

636
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,712
-Forget it.
-Tell me.

637
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,089
Come here. Just tell me, will you?

638
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,048
How could I?

CLUB SLAM

640
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,099
Why's this door locked?

641
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,226
-What? It's over here.
-Hey, friend.

642
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,103
The entrance is this way.

643
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,271
What?

644
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:47,647
What's this door, then?

645
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,690
What are you talking about?

646
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,734
Find your own way in.

647
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:51,651
A DOOR WITH A LOCK?

648
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,989
HEADING TO CLUB SLAM'S ACTUAL ENTRANCE

649
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,420
I got bounced at the door once

650
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,213
when I tried to get in.

651
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,883
I've made it my mission
to get inside a club at least once.

652
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:19,471
CONGRATULATIONS!
JANG C-STORE ENTERS A CLUB

653
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,143
I'd give anything to write my name
on a sign-in sheet.

654
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,897
Why won't they let me into these places?

655
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,316
August 8th.

656
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,111
Lee Gun-mi, a 27-year-old,
entered the club.

657
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,031
Wasn't she friends with Dancer?

658
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,785
An Dancer's break room.

659
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,705
SET UP IN THE CORNER OF THE CLUB

A BREAK AREA FOR DANCERS

661
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,129
AN DANCER'S LOCKER

662
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,590
I see she wanted to be a K-pop idol.

663
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,258
ALWAYS DO A FIT CHECK!
YOU'LL BE AN IDOL ONE DAY

664
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,677
I'LL EVEN HAVE A MANAGER WHO FANS ME

665
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,512
HOW DID AN ASPIRING IDOL
END UP AS A DANCER IN A CLUB?

666
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,515
An Dancer's phone is here.

She talked to Lee Gun-mi at 9:20 p.m.

674
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,203
and called her at 9:51 p.m. and 10:55 p.m.

675
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,330
She called,
but the calls didn't go through.

676
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,625
Lee Gun-mi, on the 12th.

677
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,714
"I'll be outside Slam
at 9:30 p.m. with the money."

678
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,882
"Gun-mi, we're still on for later, right?"

679
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,968
"I'll be at Hansim Pocha.
Call me when you get here."

680
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,428
"Why can't I reach you?
You're coming, right?"

681
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,971
"Is something up? Where are you?"

682
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,764
"How dare that tiny bitch…

683
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,307
KIM CLUB

684
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,934
…threaten to sue me?"

685
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:51,020
"If I ever catch you
with that fraud again,

686
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,313
I'm going to kill you."

687
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,398
"Okay."

688
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:56,818
"Mr. Kim, I have something important
to tell you after work."

689
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,988
"As if you could have anything
important to say."

690
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,532
There was bad blood between them, huh?

691
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:03,658
TINY BITCH, FRAUD

692
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,035
I'm no good with social media,
but here I am.

693
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,788
AN DANCER'S INSTAGRAM

694
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:11,082
"Catching a drink with Gun-mi after work."

695
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,626
"Gun-mi's being harassed
by a crazy woman."

696
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,836
SAYS SHE WON'T EVEN EAT
FRIED CHICKEN ANYMORE…

697
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,464
MAN OR ALIEN, I DON'T CARE!
YOU HAVE MY SUPPORT ♡

698
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,715
Not even eating fried chicken, huh?

699
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:22,093
So Park Chicken is who she meant
by crazy woman.

700
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:26,848
A PHOTO STRIP

701
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,100
Oh, right. She said
she was friends with Lee Gun-mi.

702
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,020
This was ripped apart
and taped back together.

703
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,688
Did they have a falling out?

704
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,274
What's this?

705
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:38,943
Isn't this a camera?

706
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:39,861
A TINY CAMERA?

707
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:41,738
(DISCOVERS SOMETHING MORE)

708
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:42,906
What's this?

709
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,365
"Lee Eighty"?

710
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,701
"China… Korea… A branch"?

711
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,163
"An idol singer in China.
One billion, five hundred million."

712
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,623
Who's Lee Eighty?

713
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:57,253
What am I reading? What does this mean?

714
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,713
What's with these flyers from China?

715
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,381
Is she headed there
to entertain VIP customers?

716
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:01,758
"Contract Termination."

717
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,052
Wait a second. Contract termination?

718
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,345
"I, An Dancer…"

719
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:08,932
AS OF TODAY, I, AN DANCER, SETTLED MY DEBT
OF 500 MILLION WON IN A SINGLE PAYMENT…

720
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,809
That's incredible. Good for you, Dancer.

721
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,770
Okay, what's next? What's this card?

722
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:15,647
"Secret Card"?

723
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,774
What secret card?

724
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,818
I should check out Kim Club's office.

725
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:20,985
KIM CLUB'S OFFICE

726
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:24,447
From what I've observed so far,
that guy is a menace.

727
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:28,117
I decided to search his office
because I found him suspicious.

728
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,330
FILE FOLDER ON THE DESK

729
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,665
"Contract."

730
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,917
"Lee Performer hereby
enters into this contract."

731
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,627
Lee Performer signed this in 2015?

732
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,838
Wait. Lee Performer had plastic surgery?

733
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:44,175
Did he put Lee Performer to work
after making them get plastic surgery?

734
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,303
An Dancer…

735
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,017
This is shocking.

736
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,229
No wonder I wasn't attracted to her.

737
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,731
You little punk.

738
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,525
You should always start
by searching places like this.

739
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,693
I knew it.

740
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,111
AS PREDICTED

741
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,071
Jang Detective's sixth sense!

742
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,575
"VIP Party Log"?

743
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:12,495
Wang Chaebol, Gae Politician, Na Star.

744
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:16,583
Even Ha Gold Spoon
has been attending these VIP parties.

745
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,003
Seriously?
Why did he write my name in this?

746
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,714
CALENDAR ON THE DESK

747
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:25,592
"Fuzz, fuzz, fuzz"?

748
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,094
As in the police? Are these the dates
of when they're raiding?

749
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:33,182
VIP parties, VIP…

750
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,268
There's a key card.

751
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,603
ANOTHER SECRET CARD?

752
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,397
C-store.

753
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,859
C-STORE'S BEAMING
NOW THAT HIS DREAM CAME TRUE

754
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,152
What's up with you?

755
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,154
Did you find something?

756
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,406
(HOLDING UP HIGH)

757
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,033
-What's wrong with him?
-What's this?

758
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:50,950
I don't know.

759
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,078
DOES THE SECRET CARD OPEN THIS DOOR?

760
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,081
BINGO!

761
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,500
What's this?

762
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,212
HIDDEN BEHIND THE LOCKED DOOR

763
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,757
A SECRET SPACE

764
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,470
The club has a secret den.

765
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:15,224
No way. The bottles of liquor here
are all older than I am.

766
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:18,061
My gosh. What is all this?

767
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,398
WHOA!

768
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:23,900
No way.

769
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,154
100 grams of meat for 4.5 million won?

770
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,448
Ice for 28 million won?

771
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,241
This can't be actual ice.

772
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,662
Should I report this to the police?

773
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,205
I'd better go do that.

774
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:40,583
Officer, I saw something really important.

775
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,168
You should check it out over there.

776
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,504
I cannot answer you.

777
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,547
You don't have to answer me.

778
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,218
But if you go check it out,
you'll get praised for doing a good job.

779
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,178
So this is the police station.

780
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,930
LIEUTENANT GU LACKEY

781
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,894
TRUSTWORTHY POLICE, A SAFE COUNTRY

782
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,691
"Flood-Related Road Closures."

783
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,152
"From 7 p.m. to 10:15 p.m."

784
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,487
"From Goldspoon Building

785
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,864
to Hansim Pocha."

786
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,201
GOLDSPOON BUILDING 1, HANSIM POCHA

787
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,246
BETWEEN GOLDSPOON BUILDING 1
AND HANSIM POCHA

788
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:22,417
THE SECTION WAS BLOCKED OFF
DUE TO FLOODING

789
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,877
NO ENTRY
DETOUR ADVISED DUE TO ROAD FLOOD

790
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:28,756
Goldspoon Building 1 was blocked off
between 10:15 and 10:30 p.m.

791
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,384
11:15 P.M., YOUTH STREET
GOLDSPOON BUILDING 1 - HANSIM POCHA

792
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:33,845
"Under repair."

793
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,222
The computer's being repaired?

794
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,769
What's this now?

795
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,396
WAIVER OF PUNISHMENT (SETTLEMENT)

796
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,939
Not again, Ms. Chicken.

797
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,275
"Park Chicken, Gu Ninety."

798
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,068
"The victim, Gu Ninety,

799
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:52,363
was offered a whopping 20 million won
and came to an amicable agreement."

800
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,614
I see.

801
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,659
Why did Ms. Chicken
get mixed up in something like this?

802
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,202
GANGSTER WHOLE CHICKEN

803
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:01,581
WHOLE CHICKIN

804
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,541
It's whole "chicken", not "chickin."

805
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:05,543
"We only fry a limited number
of 50 chickens each day."

806
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:08,046
WE'RE NOT ON FOOD DELIVERY APPS.
WE DELIVER OURSELVES.

807
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,257
Jeez, look at all the blood.
That's real blood.

808
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,260
Does she really slaughter
the chickens herself here?

809
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,762
That's intense.

810
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,514
There's a chicken coop right here.

811
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,017
She actually raises her chickens here.

812
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,101
That's insane.

813
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:25,563
THE ALLEY NEXT TO GANGSTER WHOLE CHICKEN

814
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,942
LOCATED AT THE END OF THE ALLEY

815
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,904
GANGSTER WHOLE CHICKEN
RECYCLING STATION

816
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,408
PARK CHICKEN'S ROOM
IN A CORNER OF THE RESTAURANT

817
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,415
INSIDE A STORAGE BOX

818
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,376
"Strong Punch, Fire Fist Award."
I knew she packed a punch.

819
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,171
She's the former female champion.

820
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,547
HER FIERY PAST

821
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,303
Here we go. I found something.

822
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,097
It's a document envelope.

823
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,140
"Medical Report."

824
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:04,102
Her rotator cuff was torn.

825
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:07,021
That's why she had to quit boxing,

826
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,274
and that led to her contract
being terminated.

827
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:14,695
In 2015, her agent, Bok Punch,
terminated her contract.

828
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,572
"Seoul Unfair Police Station."

829
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,698
What's this about?

830
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,492
What? Hold on.

831
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,409
I'LL GET YOU MYSELF!

832
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,416
Of course. Now we're in business.

833
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,835
JANG PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR
EVERYTHING YOU WANT

834
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,879
ON THE FRIED CHICKEN RESTAURANT COUNTER

835
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,798
Park Chicken.

836
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:34,715
PARK CHICKEN'S PHONE

837
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,721
"Go live your life now.
Report if you hear from the boss."

838
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,598
That was in 2015, so five years ago.

839
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,808
"Got it."

840
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,351
She reached out once a year.

841
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,520
"Lee Eighty." Hold on.

842
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,898
I saw that name on a business card.
Could it be that Chinese person?

843
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,026
"I told Lee Eighty
to come to the empty lot."

844
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,946
Lee Gun-mi, Park Chicken, and An Dancer

845
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,240
are all connected in some way.

846
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:05,788
Gun-jun, where were you headed
in such a hurry?

847
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,083
ON THE 2ND FLOOR
OF THE CONVENIENCE STORE BUILDING

848
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,669
VICTIM LEE GUN-JUN'S HOUSE

849
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:15,339
First of all, I have to look into Gun-mi,
or more precisely, Gun-jun.

850
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,799
I'll search this place from top to bottom.

851
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,470
"Studio Apartment Rental Contract."

852
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,516
"Electricity Service Termination Notice."

853
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:29,520
THE RENTAL AGREEMENT ENDED
BEFORE THE DAY OF THE MURDER

854
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,606
He must've been in a real hurry.

855
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,191
BELONGINGS SCATTERED EVERYWHERE

856
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:36,986
I doubt this was an easy life,
with all these wigs and fishnets.

857
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:39,238
ALL SORTS OF ITEMS
USED TO DRESS UP AS A WOMAN

858
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,206
Hold on.

859
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:49,916
Why is this blouse cut up?

860
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,002
What's that about?

861
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,963
Why was it cut precisely in half?

862
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,799
Nothing in the cup.

863
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,134
Why is there no photo in here?

864
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,845
AN EMPTY PICTURE FRAME

865
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,057
LEE GUN-JUN'S LAPTOP

"E-ticket Itinerary…"

867
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:07,975
It's Darkscene.

868
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,270
No connection.

869
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,813
CURRENTLY OFFLINE

870
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,108
"E-ticket Itinerary and Receipt."

871
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,318
DEPARTURE: SEOUL/INCHEON
ARRIVAL: MOSCOW

872
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,319
Moscow?

873
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:22,823
What's this?

874
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,118
Is this gasoline?

875
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,121
Oh, that's definitely gasoline.

876
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,041
Why did she have so much gasoline at home?

877
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,548
WALLET INSIDE THE SUITCASE

878
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,303
A written apology by Kim Club.

879
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,764
October 30, 2000. Kim Club.

880
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,182
A WRITTEN APOLOGY BY KIM CLUB?

881
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,850
NARCOTICS CRIME INVESTIGATION TEAM 1
SERGEANT KIM CLUB

882
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:50,851
Of course.

883
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:54,397
I knew there was more to Mr. Kim.

884
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,358
What will I be able to find

885
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:00,194
In the convenience store?

886
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,863
GS25 GANGDAM STATION BRANCH

887
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,909
THE CONVENIENCE STORE
JANG C-STORE WORKS AT

888
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,078
There's definitely something off
about C-store.

889
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:13,499
He said he knew
Lee Gun-jun from high school,

890
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:16,419
so I'm guessing
there's some history between them.

891
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,219
What kind of family photo is this?

892
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,887
Judging by how angry the dad looks,

893
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,889
C-store clearly caused some trouble.

894
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,224
That little brat.

895
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,519
What sort of dolls are these?

896
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,438
What are they?

897
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,358
I don't get it.
Why does he have such unusual dolls?

898
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,778
They all have long hair,
almost like women.

899
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:46,115
And they're all holding umbrellas.

900
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,120
A PRIVATE AREA FOR JANG C-STORE
IN A CORNER OF THE STORE

901
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,538
The 27-year-old.

902
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,749
Jang C-store.

903
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:56,917
Look at that.

904
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,669
I already got something.

905
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,881
"Man Stabs Stranger in Random Killing
in Maniac Province."

906
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:04,425
"Random, random, random."

907
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,345
"A man in his twenties fled
after pouring boiling oil

908
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,221
on a five-year-old."

909
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,182
"A man in his twenties."

910
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,184
"A, a man in his thirties."

911
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,061
Why does he have these news clippings?

912
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,234
"Ruling, Jang C-store."

913
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,028
"Ordered to be placed
in juvenile detention"?

914
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,698
C-store was the perpetrator?

915
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,618
I see.

916
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,828
C-store bullied Lee Gun-jun.

917
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,663
This is a case of school violence.

918
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,375
WAS JANG C-STORE A SCHOOL BULLY?

919
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,834
Who would've thought, huh?

920
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,086
Wait, the trash can.

921
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,046
I forgot to check the trash can.

922
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:45,716
What's this?

923
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,634
SOMETHING BROKEN?

924
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,302
A CCTV?

925
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,013
Why is it smashed?

926
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,390
A BROKEN SECURITY CAMERA

927
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,350
What's this?

928
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,187
What did he do with this?

929
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,230
HAMMER

930
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,023
HANSIM POCHA

931
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,400
This is where everyone gathered.

932
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:03,484
GANGDAM STATION YOUTH STREET MEETING

933
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:06,695
A meeting was held at Hansim Pocha,

934
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,740
and four of the five suspects
were present.

935
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:15,079
I need to find out
if they were all there the entire time.

936
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:18,082
So they had to choose between
a tiered payment according to annual sales

937
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,334
or an equal lump sum payment.

938
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,920
The lump sum payment won more votes.

939
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,216
REGISTRATION FORM FOR MEETING WITH
BUSINESS OWNERS AFFECTED BY COVID-19

941
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:29,844
SUBMIT REGISTRATION FORM
TO THE CONSULTATION CENTER

942
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,470

LIST OF ATTENDANTS

944
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,975
Right. Kim Club attended.

945
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,060
An Dancer attended as a proxy.

946
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,938
Jang C-store filled in
for Hong Father-in-law.

947
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,314
He didn't sign out.

948
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,399
(EMPTY SIGNATURE FIELD)

949
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,946
"Useful information on COVID-19 damages
affecting small businesses."

950
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,074
"Joo, the tenant of store A

951
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,119
on Youth Street in Gangdam District,
had their business suspended

952
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:56,495
for operating illegally at night."

953
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,372
What's this?

954
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,875
SENSIBILITY BAR

955
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,626
Hold on a second.

956
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,421
All right, let's take a look.

957
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:06,964
THE BAR WHERE THE VICTIM,
LEE GUN-MI, WORKED

958
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,390
Sensibility Bar is closed.

959
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,310
It received a two-week suspension penalty.

960
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,436
"Due to a violation

961
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,730
of the Infectious Disease Control
and Prevention Act."

962
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:23,981
How do I get in?

963
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:25,941
All the doors are locked.

964
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,027
None of them opens.

965
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,363
-Mr. Ha Gold Spoon, you must leave now.
-Right.

966
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,698
I'm right behind you.

967
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,368
Have you already forgotten
how kind I was to you last week?

968
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,495
Give me five more minutes.

969
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,662
No exceptions, sir.

970
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,789
-No exceptions?
-You need to go.

971
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:45,211
By the looks of it,
I should just escort you to jail.

972
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,295
Me?

973
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:47,338
Never mind.

974
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,631
You'd better watch what you say.

975
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,674
I was just messing around.

976
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,718
People were way shadier than I expected.

977
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,220
INITIAL EXAMINATION
OF CRIME SCENE CONCLUDED

978
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:58,891
COMBINE THE CLUES

979
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,227
During this briefing,

980
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,437
I want you to ask all your questions

981
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,982
and answer any questions directed at you
as best as you can.

982
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,318
We'll begin with Ms. Dancer.

983
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,488
Why don't you kick us off?

984
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:13,989
Sure thing.

985
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:15,783
FIRST BRIEFING: AN DANCER

986
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,118
I wonder where she's been poking around.

987
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,204
First things first,

988
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,581
I'd like to talk about the body.

989
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:26,210
The wound on her head stood out the most.

990
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:29,129
Whatever caused it left a deep gash.

991
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:33,092
That's why I believe the blow to the head

992
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,927
caused Ms. Gun-mi's death.

993
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,346
Why use such a formal address
to talk about your friend?

994
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:40,307
Because this is a formal setting, C-store.

995
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,143
Why can't you tell

996
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,937
when to speak and when not to?

997
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,106
Aren't you old enough to know better?

998
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:51,068
She said it was a formal setting,
yet she still called me C-store.

999
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,444
-You two are friends.
-What's that about?

1000
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,696
-Let's--
-You're still alive.

1001
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,197
Let's keep it professional.

1002
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,575
All right, moving on.

1003
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,744
The marks on her neck
suggested she had been strangled.

1004
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,162
Agreed.

1005
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,747
-Also--
-She was all banged up.

1006
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,250
Exactly. Especially her arms.

1007
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,837
The cuts and bruises there could
only have been caused during a scuffle.

1008
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,131
But here's something suspicious.

1009
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:13,799
The soles of her shoes were too clean.

1010
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:17,011
Even accounting
for the rain washing them off,

1011
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,804
wouldn't there be
some sort of trace left behind

1012
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,598
after such a violent fight?

1013
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:21,974
The soles were too clean?

1014
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:24,351
-They were too clean.
-Did someone change her shoes?

1015
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,686
One more thing.

1016
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,521
-There's the brick.
-The brick?

1017
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,274
I found a brick with blood on it.

1018
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:32,276
A bloody brick?

1019
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,445
Yes, I found a brick
stained with a lot of blood.

1020
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:38,324
There's a possibility
she was struck on the head with it.

1021
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:40,284
I don't think so.

1022
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,286
That's just what I think.

1023
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,288
-Okay.
-Right.

1024
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,289
Moving on.

1025
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:49,043
The next person I'm curious about is…

1026
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,795
That look on her face
makes me uneasy again.

1027
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:56,050
When else would I get to
go into Gold Spoon's room?

1028
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,136
-I'm already uncomfortable.
-She went through everything.

1029
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:01,555
She took advantage of this chance
because she likes him.

1030
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,726
She wouldn't be smiling like that
if she had properly searched his office.

1031
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,728
-I did find something a bit suspicious.
-I see.

1032
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,146
-What is it?
-A bit suspicious?

1033
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:12,024
What was the nature
of your relationship to Gun-mi?

1034
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:13,025
What?

1035
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:16,737
You two were exchanging texts
like you had a thing going on.

1036
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:21,033
Didn't you say
you just met her at the bar?

1037
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,826
You guys were texting each other?

1038
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,455
It's not so unusual to exchange numbers
with someone you clicked at a bar, is it?

1039
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:28,207
You hit her up first.

1040
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,459
I just asked to meet, that's all.

1041
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,294
Explain these, then.

1042
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,506
Heart-shaped nostrils!

1043
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,257
"Heart-shaped nostrils"?

1044
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,426
Is this why
I don't do it for you, Gold Spoon?

1045
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,636
Jeez, well…

1046
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,305
-"Heart-shaped nostrils"?
-To give you more context,

1047
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:49,061
he kept photos of heart-shaped nostrils
hidden under his keyboard.

1048
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:52,981
I mean, everyone has
a favorite body part, no?

1049
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,316
-Not really.
-But nostrils?

1050
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,984
-Who likes nostrils?
-Come on.

1051
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:58,153
When you meet someone,
what makes you fall in love with them?

1052
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:01,448
You can fall for someone's eyes,
personality, or voice.

1053
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,283
Sure, but not nostrils.

1054
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,245
-Well, I--
-Anyway, you have a thing for nostrils.

1055
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,746
-I just--
-To each their own.

1056
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,332
-I wasn't going to say this, but listen.
-Let me see your nostrils.

1057
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,583
Have you ever wondered

1058
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,293
why some mayo bottles
have a star-shaped tip?

1059
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,378
Oh, yeah.

1060
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:17,464
Have you ever imagined air coming out
of your nose in the shape of a heart?

1061
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,883
-How beautiful is that?
-I suppose.

1062
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,760
He got all misty-eyed. He's serious.

1063
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:24,471
-Gold Spoon.
-Do we really need to

1064
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,890
put my personal preference on trial
in front of everyone?

1065
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,268
Gun-mi also had heart-shaped nostrils.

1066
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:31,895
-I should check the nostrils later.
-To be honest,

1067
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,314
I couldn't sense any love

1068
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,316
in the air that came out of your nose.

1069
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:41,155
-What about Lee Gun-mi?
-Breathe out your nose, not your mouth.

1070
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,698
Did you feel love from her breath?

1071
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:43,782
It was overwhelming.

1072
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,328
Let's move on from that for now.

1073
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,581
I noticed you were a regular
at Sensibility Bar.

1074
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:51,874
You even brought back lighters.

1075
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:54,001
-I wasn't a regular.
-There was a business card too.

1076
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:57,129
You clearly go to bars often.

1077
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:59,465
Do you enjoy the nightlife, Gold Spoon?

1078
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:02,509
His family has three generations
of attorneys or something, right?

1079
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,678
-That's what he said.
-Won't they lose face if word gets out?

1080
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,973
My grandfather
was the Minister of Justice,

1081
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,725
and my father was the prosecutor general

1082
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,852
of the Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office.

1083
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:15,731
As you know, I care deeply about
the local economy of Gangdam District.

1084
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:18,192
-That's true. He's a brilliant man.
-I sometimes go to bars

1085
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:21,153
to get insight into the reality
of self-employed people.

1086
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:23,071
-Besides, I'm still young.
-What an excuse you've got.

1087
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,365
He goes to the hottest places though,

1088
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,618
like the bar run by Kim Piano Key.

1089
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:28,994
Is it still in business?

1090
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:30,496
They say it's a great place for singing.

1091
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,247
Kim Piano Key

1092
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,708
-I hear he's a pervert.
-Stop bringing up stuff like that.

1093
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,668
Anyway, Gold Spoon,

1094
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:39,296
your father must've found out
what you were up to.

1095
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,756
Don't screw up.

1096
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,049
-Don't screw up!
-Don't screw up.

1097
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,717
Gold Spoon, don't screw up!

1098
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:44,927
You get that a lot, don't you?

1099
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,179
You need to get into politics,

1100
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,639
so you were told not to screw up.

1101
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:51,683
"Don't embarrass your father.
Don't screw up."

1102
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,978
What he meant was that
I should take each step with care.

1103
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,356
He wasn't trying to set me straight

1104
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:59,566
because I had screwed up in any way.

1105
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,820
I also found non-disclosure agreements.

1106
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,404
Those who signed them

1107
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,950
had to keep conversations
or their relationship with you a secret.

1108
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:09,326
-And who signed them?
-And--

1109
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:12,663
Shin Fox, Bang Libertine,
and Park Hyeon-jun.

1110
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:15,207
-Those were their names.
-So, women?

1111
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:18,794
Most sound like women's names,
but Park Hyeon-jun sounds like a man's.

1112
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,296
Wait, so were you
in a romantic relationship with them?

1113
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,674
Well, I'm not married.

1114
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,177
I have both time and money,
so I can date whoever I want.

1115
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,428
Do you swing both ways?

1116
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:30,722
Gender isn't important.

1117
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:33,725
-I date whoever I'm attracted to.
-Oh, so it doesn't matter to you.

1118
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,561
-Gender doesn't matter?
-Does it not matter to you too?

1119
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:36,645
I guess that's possible for some.

1120
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:39,731
I can be drawn to anyone,
and that can sometimes leave me

1121
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,526
vulnerable to people
who want to exploit my wealth.

1122
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:43,986
-So that's why.
-He's an attorney for sure.

1123
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:46,947
It's to keep them quiet
if they change their minds later.

1124
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,949
-It's like an insurance, huh?
-You could say that.

1125
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,660
-Detective, here's what I want to know.
-Go on.

1126
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:53,745
Was he dating Lee Gun-mi

1127
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,205
or Lee Gun-jun?

1128
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,623
That's a good question.

1129
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,667
I'm curious about that too.

1130
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,627
In your messages with Park Hyeon-jun,

1131
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:06,091
there was a photo of you two in bed,
topless and under the covers.

1132
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,551
It must've been chilly.

1133
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:11,597
Tell us about the unforgettable
memories of that day, Gold Spoon.

1134
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,099
You sure looked like you had a good time.

1135
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,268
I'll cover my ears.

1136
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:19,062
-Did you sleep with him?
-He's looking away, avoiding eye contact.

1137
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,939
-I'll tell you.
-Did you sleep with him?

1138
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,192
I had a drink

1139
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,819
-and passed out.
-As if.

1140
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:30,115
Didn't I explain
the non-disclosure agreements?

1141
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:31,742
That man in the photo

1142
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,995
stole the document from me.

1143
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,413
While you were out cold, huh?

1144
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:37,623
Gold Spoon.

1145
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:38,582
Go on.

1146
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:40,417
I have shocking evidence.

1147
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,335
-What is it?
-Is that so?

1148
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:45,756
The man in the photo
looks very much like Gun-mi.

1149
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,132
Is this Gun-mi?

1150
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:48,675
Who is he?

1151
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,428
Let me back you up with what I found.

1152
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:53,805
-Sure.
-This was on Gun-mi's phone.

1153
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,098
Didn't you catch this?

1154
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,266
I didn't.

1155
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,935
I found text messages on the phone

1156
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,895
-I read those texts too.
-that was on her body.

1157
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:04,316
In Mr. Gold Spoon's phone,
the name was saved as Park Hyeon-jun.

1158
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:05,692
However,

1159
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:09,363
an identical string of texts
was found on Gun-mi's phone.

1160
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,864
Do you see where I'm going with this?

1161
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:14,159
I'm afraid you're going to have to
give us an explanation.

1162
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:17,079
Gun-mi and I had agreed to meet.

1163
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:20,749
But after a while,
she began playing hard to get.

1164
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:21,667
Right.

1165
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,920
She kept turning down plans to meet,
so I got upset.

1166
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:27,881
By now, you all know
why I was drawn to her.

1167
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,424
Yeah, the nostrils.

1168
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:33,595
That's when I met Park Hyeon-jun,
who looked a lot like Gun-mi

1169
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:36,014
and had the feature I loved.

1170
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,224
RAN INTO PARK HYEON-JUN
AT THE CONVENIENCE STORE

1171
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,059
I felt drawn to him too.

1172
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,311
So I asked for his number,

1173
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:42,688
and we began exchanging texts.

1174
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:46,525
But then you realized
they were the same person.

1175
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:47,609
I had no idea.

1176
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:51,029
-He was Gun-jun.
-You were duped twice.

1177
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,864
It was Gun-jun all along.

1178
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,701
Heart-shaped nostrils
can't be that common.

1179
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,661
And of course, he'd use a fake name.

1180
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:59,538
You and Gun-jun got into bed, and--

1181
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:02,582
Before today, I had never even
heard of the name Lee Gun-jun.

1182
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,543
-Hyeon-jun was Gun-jun.
-Park Hyeon-jun, then.

1183
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:06,920
-Here's one last thing, Gold Spoon.
-Sure.

1184
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,839
Did you ever throw away…

1185
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,049
something important?

1186
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,885
He likely threw it away
because it was trash. Come on, Dancer.

1187
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,804
My love for you hasn't been crumpled.

1188
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:17,347
What's that?

1189
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,474
-The letter I wrote to him.
-You dug that out of the trash?

1190
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,894
Did Gold Spoon crumple up
and throw away the love letter

1191
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:24,563
An Dancer wrote him?

1192
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,690
An Dancer doesn't have
heart-shaped nostrils,

1193
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:29,359
but she wrote the letter
on a piece of heart-shaped paper.

1194
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,360
All right, then.

1195
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:35,115
I think it'd be best
for Gold Spoon to go next.

1196
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:37,743
Before diving into the details,

1197
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:39,661
I'd like to offer

1198
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,455
a different interpretation
of the crime scene.

1199
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:45,000
I can't take him seriously anymore
now that I know about his nostril fetish.

1200
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,003
Here's the bloodstained brick.

1201
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:51,339
Did anyone happen to see
the fan guard next to it?

1202
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:52,591
-Yes, I saw the fan guard.
-I saw it too.

1203
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:53,508
You saw it, right?

1204
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:57,345
Now, focus on the marks on her back,
which follow an unknown pattern.

1205
00:50:57,429 --> 00:51:01,683
When I held the fan guard up to it,
I noticed the patterns matched.

1206
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,435
So I made the assumption

1207
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:07,397
that Lee Gun-mi
fell onto the fan guard first,

1208
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:11,485
and someone came up and strangled her,
adding more pressure

1209
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:14,821
and leaving those marks on her back.

1210
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,657
And as for the order
in which the murder took place,

1211
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:20,202
I believe she was first attacked
with the brick,

1212
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:24,414
then strangled,
which left those marks on her back.

1213
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,333
That's my theory about the crime.

1214
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:29,127
Mr. Attorney sure is smart, isn't he?

1215
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:31,088
Nobody else thought of that.

1216
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:34,424
Mr. Club, I'm sure you're aware

1217
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,009
that I'm not that fond of you.

1218
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:38,470
-Excuse me?
-There's something sketchy about you.

1219
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:41,556
-You're harsh with your employees.
-That came out of nowhere.

1220
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,227
So I went to his office at the club
to dig up dirt on him.

1221
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,646
But more so than Mr. Club,

1222
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:52,442
Ms. An Dancer surprised me
with an unexpectedly dark past.

1223
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:53,860
-Is that so?
-Yes.

1224
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,321
I'm getting a headache. She's too much.

1225
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:58,824
No, Dancer.
I told you to hold the heart up here.

1226
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:05,664
-I think he kind of liked that.
-And breathe out of your nose.

1227
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:06,748
Ms. An Dancer,

1228
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:10,085
aren't you stuck in
an exploitative contract with Club Slam?

1229
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:12,295
Come on, it's hardly exploitative.

1230
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:15,215
Like I'd sign one with a mere dancer.
She's not even a K-pop idol.

1231
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:19,344
Ms. Dancer, you were a trainee
at Star-Star Entertainment, right?

1232
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:20,303
That's right.

1233
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,264
When she signed with Club Slam,

1234
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:25,600
her debt was carried over and increased
to a total of 550 million won.

1235
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,769
That alone makes it
an exploitative contract.

1236
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:28,895
On top of that,

1237
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,522
one of the clauses

1238
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:33,066
states that they could take measures
to make her look like her old self.

1239
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,609
-Have you seen her old photos?
-Oh dear.

1240
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,570
No, don't even bring them out.

1241
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,321
Don't bring them out.
It's best not to see them.

1242
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,239
Gold Spoon!

1243
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:41,700
-Cover your eyes.
-Don't touch anything!

1244
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:46,329
It's such a shame
that they butchered her pretty face.

1245
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:48,331
An Dancer…

1246
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:49,791
GASPING

1247
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,626
What's this?

1248
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:55,964
Is this what An Dancer looked like before?

1249
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:02,512
-I thought it was you, Detective.
-Look, Detective.

1250
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,556
-Your eyes are no good.
-I thought she looked amazing.

1251
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:08,268
-I have a little question, Mr. Attorney.
-What is it?

1252
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,687
What if she had that face

1253
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,106
-but with heart-shaped nostrils?
-I've been wondering that too.

1254
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,275
-Gold Spoon, is that all it takes?
-Would you date her or not?

1255
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,484
Then I'd date her.

1256
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:18,737
Really? Is the fetish really that intense?

1257
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,447
-You should go back to your old self.
-It's my preference.

1258
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,199
And while you're at it,
get your nostrils done too.

1259
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:24,117
-Gold Spoon.
-All right.

1260
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:27,412
I think it was the vanity.
That's where I found her phone.

1261
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,122
These are some of her texts.

1262
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,916
She and Mr. Club texted.

1263
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:33,251
"Mr. Kim, I have something important
to tell you after work."

1264
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:34,377
She sent that on August 12th.

1265
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:37,422
I wondered what she wanted to
talk to him about.

1266
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:40,717
You were halfway through completing
a contract termination.

1267
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,510
Is that so?

1268
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:45,555
-Dancer, is this true?
-I found the contents surprising.

1269
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:46,640
It said that you repaid

1270
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,642
the 500-million-won debt
in a single payment

1271
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,185
-and demanded termination.
-That's right.

1272
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:52,020
-She paid off her debt already?
-She didn't.

1273
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:55,440
The only signature on it was hers.

1274
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:58,735
-She was likely expecting a large payment.
-You think so?

1275
00:53:58,818 --> 00:53:59,819
-An Dancer.
-Yes?

1276
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,988
Where were you going to
get the money from?

1277
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,658
-I've got my own plans, Mr. Kim.
-Of course.

1278
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,743
What I really want to know
is where she got the money

1279
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:09,579
to settle her debt and request
to terminate her contract.

1280
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,790
Then, I found this in her desk drawer.

1281
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,959
You didn't have to be so thorough,
Gold Spoon.

1282
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:17,128
She had flyers
and a business card from China.

1283
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,089
-China?
-The name on it was Lee Eighty.

1284
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:20,048
The note in the back read,

1285
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:22,550
"1 billion, 500 million"
and something about debuting in China.

1286
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:24,970
The tone was rather hopeful.

1287
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:28,598
I couldn't tell what was on the flyers
because they were all in Chinese,

1288
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:30,392
so I ran them through a translation app,

1289
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:34,104
and I realized
they were VIP party exposés.

1290
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,356
"The fall of the aristocracy."

1291
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:39,150
"The disgraceful truth
behind elite political families."

1292
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:42,112
The other one exposed

1293
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:46,241
the top celebrity, Kang Pung-pung,
as a drug addict.

1294
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:48,118
-And this.
-Yes?

1295
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,661
You had a tiny camera.

1296
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:52,038
-A camera?
-There was a camera

1297
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,707
smaller than a table tennis ball.

1298
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:54,874
By any chance,

1299
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:58,336
were you planning to film me secretly
and sell the video to a Chinese broker?

1300
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,463
Is that how you were going to
make the money?

1301
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:03,675
-Well, I mean…
-Wait, you don't know?

1302
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:05,719
The grown-ups are talking, all right?

1303
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:06,803
I'm just…

1304
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:08,680
Do you really not know?

1305
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:12,183
-What is it? Tell us.
-The grown-ups are talking.

1306
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:14,102
I'm just curious, that's all.

1307
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:16,271
-Are you serious right now?
-Seriously?

1308
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:19,441
Anyway, that's what I found out
about An Dancer.

1309
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:21,151
-That'll be all.
-All right.

1310
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:22,652
Should I go next?

1311
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:23,611
-Sure.
-Go ahead.

1312
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,071
NEXT BRIEFING: KIM CLUB

1313
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,698
Mr. Attorney.

1314
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:27,699
Me, again?

1315
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:30,368
Did you check the wallet
on the victim's body?

1316
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:31,953
-The wallet.
-I did.

1317
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:35,081
Inside the wallet
was a check for 50 million won.

1318
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,042
Wasn't that issued by Mr. Gold Spoon?

1319
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,335
-It was.
-That's right.

1320
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,295
It's likely that Lee Gun-mi

1321
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:43,006
blackmailed him using
a photo of them together in bed.

1322
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:46,509
That seems to be how she got the money.

1323
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,720
I'm a victim too, guys.

1324
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:50,889
-That came out of nowhere.
-That was unexpected.

1325
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:53,767
-What's with the sudden 180?
-That 50 million won?

1326
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,269
I should've paid five million won
and earned her silence,

1327
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,396
but I failed to do that.

1328
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,273
So I had to pay an additional 50 million.

1329
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,233
PARK HYEON-JUN/CONVENIENCE STORE
I TOOK IT THAT DAY

1330
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:05,070
If only it ended there, right?
But I'm sure it didn't.

1331
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,696
And that usually leads to murder.

1332
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,948
Fifty million won is just the beginning.

1333
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,909
The grown-ups are talking!

1334
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:13,787
HURT

1335
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,121
Come on, C-store.

1336
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:18,666
Look at C-store,
acting all innocent and naive.

1337
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,752
-Why? I thought he was hardworking.
-I am.

1338
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:24,297
Your past is quite different
from your present, C-store.

1339
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,216
-Is that so?
-What? What do you mean?

1340
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:27,592
-Turns out,
-Yes?

1341
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,511
C-store spent a year in juvie.

1342
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:31,388
-In juvenile detention?
-I knew it.

1343
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:33,598
It's rare to be sent to juvie for a year.

1344
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:38,186
He made Lee Gun-jun dress up as a girl
and bring him money.

1345
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:39,437
He was the perpetrator.

1346
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:42,190
-Man, what a piece of trash.
-So, it's like this.

1347
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:44,901
So he knew about the victim's proclivity
and took advantage of it.

1348
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:47,987
-That might not have even been the case.
-He's the worst, Detective.

1349
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,739
He might not even have had
such a proclivity,

1350
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,616
but the experience of making money
under such a disguise

1351
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:54,327
could've led him to further pursue it.

1352
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:55,286
You tell us.

1353
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,122
Talk, you piece of trash!

1354
00:56:57,205 --> 00:57:00,166
How dare you move to our neighborhood,
acting like some innocent kid?

1355
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,751
You can STFU.

1356
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:06,256
-I didn't know you knew such a term.
-Is that the best abbreviation you know?

1357
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:08,425
-C-store.
-I know a few.

1358
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:10,593
What did I tell you
about how you talk to your elders?

1359
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:13,304
-You brat.
-Let me explain.

1360
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:14,806
You see,

1361
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:15,932
back in the day,

1362
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,184
I used to have some fun.

1363
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,895
-Were you a bully?
-He was a short and skinny kid,

1364
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,814
so we made him do things for us.

1365
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:25,775
But I didn't know about this side of him.

1366
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:27,277
I only found out today.

1367
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:31,281
I had no idea that Gun-jun
spent part of his life as Lee Gun-mi.

1368
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:32,574
-I swear.
-Is that so?

1369
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:35,076
Detective, can I step in
and share something?

1370
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,828
-I'm probably the only one who knows it.
-Sure.

1371
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:41,040
As I said, Gun-mi and I
have been friends for a few years.

1372
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:44,502
She appeared in Gangdam out of nowhere
after being gone for several years,

1373
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:46,713
so I wondered why.

1374
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:49,757
Then one day, she told me

1375
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:53,303
-that she had to get revenge on someone.
-Revenge?

1376
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:54,471
-Was this recent?
-Yes.

1377
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:57,599
And she said she was going to
leave this place once she was done.

1378
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:58,892
Is that so?

1379
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,518
-Lee Gun-mi said that?
-Maybe it was this bastard.

1380
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:04,522
-There's something off about him.
-I'll keep that in mind.

1381
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:07,025
Anyway, I'm sure you all saw
the hole in the skull.

1382
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:08,109
-Yes.
-Yes.

1383
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:13,323
I found something that appears
to match the size and depth of the wound.

1384
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:15,700
A claw hammer
was in the convenience store.

1385
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:17,577
In the convenience store?

1386
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,162
So the weapon wasn't the brick?

1387
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:22,415
-That seems like the same size.
-It's the perfect size.

1388
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:23,750
And here's more about his past.

1389
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:24,876
Do you…

1390
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:27,045
have a kid?

1391
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:29,964
Look here.

1392
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:32,300
Here's C-store in his school uniform.

1393
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:34,511
Next to him is his girlfriend
who's also in a school uniform.

1394
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:37,013
But that girlfriend is holding a baby.

1395
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:41,518
Next to them in the photo
is an older man who looks very angry.

1396
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:43,686
-They were teen parents.
-Teen parents.

1397
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:47,232
I was clueless and didn't know better,

1398
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:50,109
so I ended up becoming a dad
in high school.

1399
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,195
But I took responsibility.

1400
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:55,156
I've accepted responsibility
and stayed committed.

1401
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,325
The older man in the photo
is my father-in-law.

1402
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:58,910
He owns the convenience store.

1403
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:00,745
Oh, it's your father-in-law's
convenience store.

1404
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:02,413
-That's right.
-Really?

1405
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,374
-No wonder.
-Oh dear.

1406
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:05,583
And so--

1407
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,961
No wonder he never took any days off.

1408
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,963
-Do you still get paid?
-Of course!

1409
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:14,634
I didn't understand what this was
because I didn't know who owned the store.

1410
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,511
But his father-in-law

1411
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:20,932
must've installed a security camera
to monitor him.

1412
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:23,851
I found one in the trash
that had been smashed.

1413
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:27,105
-Yes, I smashed the heck out of it
-You're a piece of work.

1414
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:29,065
after finding it.

1415
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:31,234
You're still just as hot-tempered.

1416
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:33,194
He seems to have anger management issues.

1417
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:35,113
Here's what I think.

1418
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:39,909
He's been building up anger inside him
like a burning fire.

1419
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,536
When I went through his desk,

1420
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:44,205
I found news articles
on so-called random acts of violence,

1421
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:46,624
including an incident
where boiling oil was poured on someone

1422
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,668
and a random stabbing spree.

1423
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:51,588
He had the news clippings
in his little collection.

1424
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:52,505
Really?

1425
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,716
Did you randomly attack
and kill Lee Gun-mi?

1426
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:58,011
How can it be random
when we knew each other?

1427
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,430
You didn't know Lee Gun-mi though.
You knew Lee Gun-jun.

1428
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:03,641
-She's right.
-See? You just got caught in a lie, huh?

1429
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:06,019
It could count as random
because you didn't know Lee Gun-mi.

1430
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:06,978
That's not true.

1431
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:08,896
-One more thing.
-Unbelievable.

1432
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,690
I haven't quite figured this out yet,

1433
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,108
but on the convenience store counter,

1434
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:15,612
I found five dolls displayed in a row.

1435
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:18,948
-Give me a break.
-They all had long, straight hair

1436
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,618
and were holding umbrellas.

1437
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,494
-A rainy day.
-Perhaps on a rainy day like today,

1438
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:25,913
he kills someone and gets rid of a doll.

1439
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,791
Or maybe he's adding one

1440
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,335
-for every crime he commits.
-That may be the case.

1441
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,420
You bastard. I've had it with you.

1442
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:35,757
-Assume push-up position.
-My joints on my right side are weak.

1443
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:37,342
Why do you have those dolls?

1444
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,594
I just like them, that's all.

1445
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:41,471
Why would you though? You're a guy.

1446
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:43,431
Please be respectful
of people's preferences.

1447
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:45,016
-Right.
-Sir, come on.

1448
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:47,018
I guess it's better than a nostril fetish.

1449
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:48,519
Of course. His fetish was shocking.

1450
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:49,979
There are no lesser preferences.

1451
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,857
-The neighborhood has such an awful vibe.
-All right, Detective.

1452
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:53,983
That's all I have for now.

1453
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:55,693
I'm disappointed in you, Mr. Club.

1454
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:58,696
All right, then.
C-store, why don't you go next?

1455
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,073
Sure.

1456
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:01,032
Okay.

1457
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:02,700
First of all,

1458
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:05,536
I went to Mr. Club's club.

1459
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,038
It was for one reason only.

1460
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:08,206
You wanted to go inside, huh?

1461
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:11,417
It was amazing. My only regret
is that I couldn't play some music.

1462
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:14,671
Come straight to me next time,
and I'll get you past the bouncer.

1463
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,130
Thanks, sir. Okay.

1464
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:19,967
My next stop was Ms. Chicken's restaurant.

1465
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:22,303
All you did at my club
was take a tour of the place?

1466
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:23,304
Yes.

1467
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:25,431
C-store,

1468
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:26,891
assume push-up position.

1469
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,645
This is a tough character to play.

1470
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:33,606
I went to Ms. Chicken's restaurant,

1471
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,525
and I was so shocked.

1472
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:37,610
Ms. Chicken

1473
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,362
used to be

1474
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:42,198
a boxer.

1475
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:44,075
I saw that too.

1476
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:46,577
A former boxer?

1477
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:48,162
-So she was a boxer?
-She was a boxer,

1478
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:50,081
-but not just any boxer.
-Look at her posture.

1479
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,541
In 2015,

1480
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:54,544
she even won
the Strong Punch, Fire Fist Award.

1481
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:57,380
So, why didn't her boxing career take off?

1482
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:58,506
I wonder why.

1483
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:01,884
-She had an unfortunate accident.
-Oh dear.

1484
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:03,845
She tore her rotator cuff.

1485
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:06,723
In her case, it was serious.

1486
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,474
However,

1487
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:12,103
she didn't consider this a mere accident.

1488
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:15,481
She claimed that someone had drugged her
before the match.

1489
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:19,110
Why? Because someone needed her to lose.

1490
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:22,238
She accused someone of fixing the match

1491
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:24,949
and asked the police
to launch a formal investigation.

1492
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:28,035
However, the police claimed
that there was no evidence of her claims

1493
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:29,662
and closed the case.

1494
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,748
Then, she received the paperwork
stating as such.

1495
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:33,082
RE: INVESTIGATION RESULTS NOTICE

1496
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:35,752
-On it, she left a memo.
-What did it say?

1497
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:39,130
-"I'll get you myself."
-I see.

1498
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:41,007
-Unbelievable.
-What's wrong with that?

1499
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:45,553
There are texts she exchanged with Gun-mi
after the case was closed.

1500
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:46,721
What did they talk about?

1501
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:49,056
-"So, what about your boss?"
-Okay.

1502
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:52,643
There's a big time jump
after the first text.

1503
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:54,729
She asked Gun-mi if she had looked into it

1504
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:57,023
and confronted her for not reporting back.

1505
01:02:57,106 --> 01:03:00,276
Gun-mi appeared to be very stressed by it.

1506
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:02,069
-Now, let's talk about this.
-Detective, hold on.

1507
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:05,531
What was Gun-mi doing in 2015

1508
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,408
for you to be interested in her boss?

1509
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:11,078
She was the one
who injected the drug into my shoulder.

1510
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,580
-Really?
-What?

1511
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:16,209
Before the match, a girl bumped into me
and injected something into my shoulder.

1512
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:17,418
After that, I couldn't punch.

1513
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,462
I instinctively knew
she had done something,

1514
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:21,339
so I confronted her after the match.

1515
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:23,299
So, until then, you didn't know her?

1516
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:24,509
I didn't.

1517
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:29,180
-But…
-You're saying that someone

1518
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:31,140
put Lee Gun-mi up to it.

1519
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:33,559
Gun-mi said someone
had ordered her to do it.

1520
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,478
So what next?
I told her to bring that punk to me.

1521
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:39,607
That means the person
who ordered Lee Gun-mi to do it

1522
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,943
was Lee Eighty,
as in the name on the business card.

1523
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:44,111
Because she hired a private investigator…

1524
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:45,613
Jang Private Investigator strikes again.

1525
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:47,198
-Jang Private Investigator?
-Right.

1526
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:50,076
She had Jang Private Investigator
look into Lee Eighty,

1527
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,995
and he discovered that Lee Eighty
frequented our neighborhood.

1528
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:54,080
-Lee Eighty?
-Yes.

1529
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:58,960
Do you really think I opened a shop
in this neighborhood just to earn money?

1530
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:00,753
I came here for Lee Eighty.

1531
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:01,879
But then,

1532
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:03,923
something unexpected happened.

1533
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:05,258
What now?

1534
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:09,303
You lost your temper again yesterday,
didn't you?

1535
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:10,847
-What happened?
-What is it?

1536
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,933
-She beat the crap out of someone.
-Oh dear.

1537
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,560
This is what happened.

1538
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:18,145
Shortly before the murder took place,

1539
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:20,606
Ms. Chicken and the victim
settled for 20 million won,

1540
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,817
when the victim was injured enough
to be hospitalized for eight weeks.

1541
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:23,901
-Oh my.
-Oh dear.

1542
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,778
He probably also thought
the amount was excessive,

1543
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,655
given that he wrote
"a whopping" 20 million won.

1544
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:31,284
I paid him well to get released quickly.
I didn't want the hassle.

1545
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,411
-All right.
-Who did she assault?

1546
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:36,205
The victim's name is Gu Ninety.

1547
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:37,832
-Gu Ninety?
-She beat up Gu Ninety?

1548
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:39,709
-Lee Eighty and now Gu Ninety?
-That's his name?

1549
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:41,878
-Do they belong to the Hair-Parting Gang?
-I suppose.

1550
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,713
So, that's not the same person
as Lee Eight.

1551
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:45,381
-It's Lee Eighty, not Lee Eight.
-Right, Eighty.

1552
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:47,925
-It's a completely different person.
-Lee Eight exists as well.

1553
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:48,926
Anyhow, Lee Eighty.

1554
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,554
Lee Eighty and Lee Eight
are completely different people.

1555
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:52,930
Isn't Lee Eighty Chinese?

1556
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:55,057
Fine, let me explain.

1557
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:58,561
-Gun-mi said she had Lee Eighty with her.
-Okay.

1558
01:04:58,644 --> 01:05:00,313
-So I went and beat the crap out of him.
-Right.

1559
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:01,981
But he turned out to be Gu Ninety!

1560
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:04,609
-Right.
-His hair was parted more to the side.

1561
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:07,236
-It was 90% to the side.
-Oh dear!

1562
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:10,406
But before I could do anything,
someone called the cops.

1563
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:12,408
What else could I have done
but settle quickly?

1564
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:15,161
There was no time to waste
if I wanted to catch Lee Eighty.

1565
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:18,080
Okay, moving on.
Did any of you stop by the police station?

1566
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,040
Not yet.

1567
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:20,583
At the police station,

1568
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:22,627
I found a list of roadblocks

1569
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:27,715
that were set up at specific times
because of the flood.

1570
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:29,967
The list shows

1571
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:31,469
that the road between Hansim Pocha

1572
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:33,638
and Mr. Attorney's building
was sectioned off.

1573
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:34,680
Yes, that's right.

1574
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:37,058
Didn't they block that section off
due to flooding?

1575
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:39,560
The road was blocked once again
at 11:15 p.m.

1576
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:42,146
Before that,
it was blocked until 10:30 p.m.

1577
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:44,649
So there was a brief period
when it wasn't blocked.

1578
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:47,234
Oh, so there was a period
when traffic wasn't restricted?

1579
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:48,486
During that time…

1580
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:51,989
Detective, now that I think about it,

1581
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:53,699
if that road is blocked,

1582
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:56,369
we have to take a detour
past the police station.

1583
01:05:56,452 --> 01:06:01,457
But there's always an officer
standing guard outside.

1584
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,918
If the culprit didn't want to be seen,

1585
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:06,087
they had to go through
the restricted area.

1586
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:07,463
Can't you also go around the back?

1587
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:09,340
That's something to think about.

1588
01:06:09,423 --> 01:06:10,925
Anyway, that's all I have for now.

1589
01:06:11,008 --> 01:06:12,426
CULPRIT'S ROUTE DEPENDS ON THE TIME
THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED

1590
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,762
Now, let's hear from Ms. Chicken.

1591
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:16,555
-Sure.
-Please go ahead.

1592
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,183
I have a few follow-up questions for her.

1593
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:21,018
Is using an animal's name
a family naming tradition?

1594
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:22,186
Shut it.

1595
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:25,189
WATCH YOUR MANNERS…

1596
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:27,984
Since C-store came at me, I'll bite back.

1597
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:32,154
I found texts between him and the victim
on the victim's phone.

1598
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:33,114
Really?

1599
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:36,617
At 9:05 p.m.,
C-store texted, "What's this?"

1600
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,285
To that, the victim replied,
"Hope you're ready."

1601
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:39,996
She knew something.

1602
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,039
I doubt it was about a nice surprise.

1603
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:43,082
That's exactly what it was.

1604
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:45,793
It was a surprise?
What was it about? Tell me.

1605
01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:47,128
Don't stall and spill.

1606
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:48,796
What made you say, "What's this?"

1607
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:50,881
-A gift.
-What sort of gift?

1608
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:53,050
-Just a gift.
-What was in the gift?

1609
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:53,968
A gift.

1610
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:56,220
Okay, whatever. Just cut the crap.

1611
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:59,890
Why did you call her at 9:57 p.m.?

1612
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:02,018
-Hey! Why did you call her at 9:57 p.m.?
-Sorry?

1613
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:03,394
Well, I was curious.

1614
01:07:03,477 --> 01:07:05,980
-Did he call Gun-mi at 9:57 p.m.?
-C-store called her.

1615
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:06,981
No one picked up.

1616
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:09,150
Did you kill her for not picking up?

1617
01:07:09,233 --> 01:07:12,111
Come on. I don't kill someone
for not picking up my call.

1618
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:13,029
I'm serious.

1619
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:15,364
Anyway, I checked out the house
that Gun-mi,

1620
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:18,576
or should I say Gun-jun, lived in.

1621
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:21,537
She got a notice
about her electricity being cut off.

1622
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:24,165
That, among other things,
suggested she was preparing to leave town.

1623
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:27,543
She had only rented the house
for about a month, anyway.

1624
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:29,170
She told me she came to get her revenge,

1625
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:33,132
so maybe she was leaving because
she'd already done what she came to do.

1626
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:35,926
Didn't you see the plane ticket
she had in her wallet?

1627
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:36,969
-I saw it.
-There was one.

1628
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:37,928
She booked a flight

1629
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:41,640
-Bound for Russia.
-for 11:59 p.m. on the 12th.

1630
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:42,850
-Right.
-For 11:59 p.m.?

1631
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:45,936
I believe
this is somehow tied to the case,

1632
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,897
so we should look into it.

1633
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:49,356
Mister.

1634
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:50,858
Me?

1635
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:52,943
What did you do before running the club?

1636
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:54,653
Me?

1637
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,030
I used to work for a company.

1638
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:57,406
What kind of company?

1639
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:59,617
-I was a civil servant.
-A civil servant?

1640
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:01,660
He used to be a fuzz.

1641
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:03,079
What?

1642
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:04,455
Oh, come on.

1643
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:06,624
I was a detective, so what?
That's not a crime, is it?

1644
01:08:06,707 --> 01:08:09,502
-He was a crooked cop.
-So you were getting inside information.

1645
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:13,005
I found an official apology
he wrote a while ago.

1646
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,758
He was on the narcotics teams
at the Gangdam Police Station.

1647
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:17,051
Yeah, I handled narcotics cases.

1648
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:19,970
He worked at Gangdam Police Station
and carried out coercive investigations.

1649
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:22,890
-Even back then, he had quite the temper.
-Right.

1650
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:25,059
Anyway, I found
an official apology he wrote.

1651
01:08:25,142 --> 01:08:27,478
But do you know who had it?

1652
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,856
Lee Gun-jun. He had it.

1653
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:31,857
-What?
-What?

1654
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,234
Lee Gun-jun had it.

1655
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:36,862
How did he end up with a letter
you had written in 2000?

1656
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:40,741
I found one more suspicious item,
but I'm not sure if it's related.

1657
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:43,119
On Lee Gun-jun's desk at his place,

1658
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:45,579
there was a picture frame
with a photo ripped out of it.

1659
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:48,415
Only a ripped corner was left behind,

1660
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:51,502
and you could see
what resembled the police logo.

1661
01:08:51,585 --> 01:08:55,005
So that got me thinking that maybe
Mr. Club was worried

1662
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:57,341
about being connected to Gun-jun
and took the photo with him.

1663
01:08:57,424 --> 01:08:59,135
Were you ever in his room?

1664
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:02,513
-This is embarrassing to say.
-Go on.

1665
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:05,891
I met that girl

1666
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,477
-while having drinks.
-Okay.

1667
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:11,480
I wanted to start
a little something with her,

1668
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:13,941
but when I woke up the next morning,

1669
01:09:14,024 --> 01:09:15,693
I noticed I had been robbed of everything

1670
01:09:15,776 --> 01:09:17,653
-at the hotel.
-I see.

1671
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:19,530
-Unbelievable.
-And that tiny bitch had already left.

1672
01:09:19,613 --> 01:09:23,742
I'm guessing that's when she took
my wallet and the written apology.

1673
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:26,287
-She took them all.
-And I guess she just kept them.

1674
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:28,706
Why were you at Lee Gun-mi's house?

1675
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:31,333
All I remembered about her was her name,

1676
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:33,836
but despite my best efforts,
I couldn't find her.

1677
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:35,671
But after several years,

1678
01:09:35,754 --> 01:09:39,383
she showed up at my club with An Dancer.

1679
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:41,886
They were supposedly friends
and joined at the hip.

1680
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:44,722
I knew I recognized her,

1681
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:47,141
so I checked the sign-in sheet.

1682
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:48,934
And it really was Lee Gun-mi.

1683
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:52,438
Something felt off about her,

1684
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:53,981
so I went to her place.

1685
01:09:54,064 --> 01:09:56,108
And what about the photo? What was it of?

1686
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,568
I went to her place

1687
01:09:57,651 --> 01:09:59,904
and saw a family photo

1688
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:01,530
with someone I recognized.

1689
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:05,284
There was this colleague
from my days back in the force,

1690
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:07,828
and she had a photo of his family.

1691
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:09,079
What?

1692
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:11,832
-A former cop colleague?
-Was she the daughter

1693
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:13,125
of a former colleague?

1694
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:14,418
You mean, son.

1695
01:10:14,501 --> 01:10:17,379
Was Lee Gun-mi in the photo?

1696
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:21,300
The photo was taken a long time ago,
so I couldn't be sure.

1697
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:24,720
So, there's a good chance
you worked with Lee Gun-jun's father.

1698
01:10:24,803 --> 01:10:26,805
Okay, that'll be all.

1699
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:29,683
-Next, I'll move on to Ms. Dancer.
-Sure.

1700
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:32,937
Your Story Highlights had captions
like "Eternal friendship"

1701
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:36,649
and "Man or alien, I don't care."

1702
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:38,400
But I guess you had a falling out,

1703
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:42,071
because the photos you took on August 7th
had been ripped at some point.

1704
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:43,781
-Yeah, right down the middle.
-Exactly.

1705
01:10:43,864 --> 01:10:45,199
That was the day

1706
01:10:45,282 --> 01:10:48,202
I saw Gun-mi
walk into Gold Spoon's office.

1707
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:52,998
I had confided in her
about how I felt, you see.

1708
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:56,377
I told her that I liked Gold Spoon a lot.

1709
01:10:56,460 --> 01:11:00,464
Even though she knew that,
she went into his office.

1710
01:11:00,547 --> 01:11:02,424
It's only normal
that it pissed me off, right?

1711
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:03,384
Right, of course.

1712
01:11:03,467 --> 01:11:06,095
So, I said that was it for us
and ripped up the photo.

1713
01:11:06,178 --> 01:11:07,388
Why did you tape it back together?

1714
01:11:07,471 --> 01:11:10,557
-I was so mad, so I called her that night.
-Okay.

1715
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:12,685
That's when I learned the truth.

1716
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:16,480
She told me she was born a man
but had the heart of a woman.

1717
01:11:16,563 --> 01:11:18,482
And because of that,
she could never be with Gold Spoon.

1718
01:11:18,565 --> 01:11:19,733
At the time,

1719
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:21,485
I didn't know Mr. Attorney's passion

1720
01:11:21,568 --> 01:11:24,488
for heart-shaped nostrils
trumped all else.

1721
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:25,572
-Hold on.
-Yes?

1722
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:27,574
When did you first meet Gun-mi?

1723
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:28,867
Gun-mi?

1724
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,745
She came up to me one day
when I was working at the club

1725
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:33,789
and said I was pretty.

1726
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:35,165
She was there as a guest?

1727
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:38,043
Yes. She told me
she was my number one fan.

1728
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:41,046
Once I learned we were the same age,
we became really close.

1729
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,882
I do believe that they patched things up

1730
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:46,844
because Lee Gun-mi texted her saying,

1731
01:11:46,927 --> 01:11:50,431
"I'll be outside Slam
at 9:30 p.m. with the money."

1732
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:53,017
Dancer texted her multiple times,
but Gun-mi didn't respond

1733
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,310
even after 9:40 p.m.

1734
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:57,354
-Dancer couldn't reach her.
-So basically, no contact.

1735
01:11:57,438 --> 01:12:00,441
-Was she going to give her the money?
-Detective, this is what you must note.

1736
01:12:00,524 --> 01:12:03,193
The timeline of events
seems especially important today.

1737
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:07,072
Why didn't the victim
reply even after 9:40 p.m.?

1738
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:09,325
Mr. Gold Spoon said

1739
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:13,412
-he last saw Lee Gun-jun at 9:45 p.m.
-Yes, 9:45 p.m.

1740
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:19,126
C-store called the victim at 9:57 p.m.,
but the call was missed.

1741
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:21,337
Again, the victim didn't pick up.

1742
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:24,256
Please make note of that timeline.

1743
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,883
Got it.

1744
01:12:25,966 --> 01:12:28,260
And here I thought
you were all fists and no brains.

1745
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:29,970
All right.

1746
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:32,014
FINAL BRIEFING: JANG DETECTIVE

1747
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:33,891
Detective, did you find much?

1748
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:38,520
The first question I have
is for An Dancer.

1749
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:45,402
How did you end up working at Club Slam?

1750
01:12:46,987 --> 01:12:47,821
Me?

1751
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:50,949
You saw what I looked like before.

1752
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,077
It was really bad.

1753
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:57,873
After ten failed auditions,
Star-Star Entertainment took me in.

1754
01:12:57,956 --> 01:13:02,252
They said I could make it
with some minor tweaks to my appearance.

1755
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:05,547
That's how I ended up
getting a full body makeover.

1756
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:07,174
They had me lose weight as well.

1757
01:13:07,257 --> 01:13:10,427
Since then, people have told me
I look like AN YUJIN of IVE.

1758
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:11,887
I get that pretty often.

1759
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:15,516
-No way. She's way prettier.
-You're like a half-baked version of her.

1760
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:16,892
Who? IU?

1761
01:13:16,975 --> 01:13:19,186
-So? Is that when you got piles of debt?
-Anyway, moving on.

1762
01:13:19,269 --> 01:13:21,688
-I got the 400-million-won debt then.
-Because of the full body makeover?

1763
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:22,606
It cost 400 million won?

1764
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:25,234
-Jeez, just what did you get done?
-I can't say I'm surprised by that number.

1765
01:13:25,317 --> 01:13:26,985
Being reborn would've been quicker.

1766
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:29,238
-The process was absolute hell.
-Really?

1767
01:13:29,321 --> 01:13:31,073
-They promised me a debut as an artist.
-Right.

1768
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:33,409
But I wasn't aware of my debt until then.

1769
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:36,120
When I thought my debut
was finally happening,

1770
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:39,456
they showed me their books
and said I couldn't debut

1771
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,417
until I cleared my 400-million-won debt.

1772
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,753
How could I have that kind of money
when I spent most of my life as a trainee?

1773
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:47,589
When I told them
I had no money to pay off my debt,

1774
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:49,716
they told me to work part-time.

1775
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:53,345
Have you heard of drop-offs?

1776
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:55,472
It's what people do these days.

1777
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:56,432
As in drug dealing?

1778
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:58,434
I'd drop off a package somewhere.

1779
01:13:58,517 --> 01:13:59,518
-For someone to collect.
-Yes.

1780
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:02,312
-That's what they made me do.
-What has the world come to?

1781
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:05,399
Without 400 million won,
what option did I have? So, I did it.

1782
01:14:05,482 --> 01:14:08,694
But then, the police showed up.

1783
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:10,779
THE POLICE?

1784
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:11,905
So I went with them.

1785
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:15,617
But instead of the police station,
they took me to a club.

1786
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:18,745
There, Mr. Kim gave me two options.

1787
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:20,998
Either I go to jail

1788
01:14:21,081 --> 01:14:24,251
-or work at the club.
-What a scumbag.

1789
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:27,546
I chose to work at the club,
and 150 million won was added to my debt.

1790
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:29,047
That was the cost of staying out of jail.

1791
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:29,965
Hey!

1792
01:14:30,048 --> 01:14:32,885
-That was stated in the contract.
-You got a good deal, Dancer.

1793
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:34,136
-You hear me?
-Thank you.

1794
01:14:34,219 --> 01:14:37,806
-Look at your old photos and reflect.
-Okay.

1795
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:41,268
-That's how you ended up working at Slam.
-Yes, that's right.

1796
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:44,146
The pieces are finally coming together.

1797
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:47,483
At Mr. Club's office
inside the club he runs,

1798
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:52,279
I obtained a list of VIP parties.

1799
01:14:52,362 --> 01:14:56,825
Our very own Mr. Gold Spoon
was also among the VIP guests.

1800
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:59,161
I attended parties
held at a club in a building I own.

1801
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:01,413
-Of course, he was there.
-What's wrong with that?

1802
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:04,917
Influential politicians, business leaders,
and other prominent figures attended.

1803
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,545
Everyone who's anyone shows up
at the VIP parties at my club.

1804
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:11,757
Everyone's bound to show up
on a list or two if you dig like this.

1805
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:12,883
Absolutely.

1806
01:15:12,966 --> 01:15:14,176
-Anyway,
-I'm jealous.

1807
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:16,428
where is it that these people

1808
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,640
enjoy their VIP parties?

1809
01:15:19,723 --> 01:15:23,477
I managed to find the very room
where the parties took place.

1810
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:25,687
-You did?
-How did you get in there?

1811
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:28,023
A key card?

1812
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:33,111
ONLY A SECRET CARD CAN UNLOCK THE DOOR

1813
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:36,615
Unbelievable.

1814
01:15:38,325 --> 01:15:40,035
Are you kidding me?

1815
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:45,040
So this is what you've been up to.

1816
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:47,626
Unbelievable.

1817
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:50,003
They were doing drugs at these parties.

1818
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:51,797
You've got to be kidding me.

1819
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,258
Cocaine, meth,

1820
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:56,927
-ecstasy, marijuana, and more.
-No, no.

1821
01:15:57,010 --> 01:16:00,180
There were all sorts of drugs in there.

1822
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:01,306
Meat…

1823
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:02,808
MEAT = MARIJUANA, CANDY = ECSTASY

1824
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:04,393
-…and others.
-Don't forget the candies.

1825
01:16:04,476 --> 01:16:05,727
The menu referred to drugs, didn't it?

1826
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:06,853
ICE = METH

1827
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:10,399
Oh, so that's how it connects.
You bastard.

1828
01:16:10,482 --> 01:16:11,900
I'm onto you now.

1829
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:13,527
You people are worse than animals.

1830
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:15,028
Mr. Gold Spoon.

1831
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:16,947
-I didn't do drugs.
-You're not a privileged rich man.

1832
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:18,490
-I didn't know.
-You're just an animal.

1833
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:19,825
I didn't know they were there.

1834
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:22,286
-I also have a question for An Dancer.
-Ask away.

1835
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:23,245
Were you aware

1836
01:16:23,328 --> 01:16:26,081
of these so-called VIP parties?

1837
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:29,626
-I was aware of them, yes.
-You were?

1838
01:16:30,627 --> 01:16:33,797
I know the adults are talking,
but can I add something to that?

1839
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,090
Sure, go ahead.

1840
01:16:35,173 --> 01:16:38,010
He's scared he might get yelled at again.

1841
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:41,346
-Detective, let's go easy on the kid now.
-He's so timid now.

1842
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,390
-Let's go easy on the kid.
-Poor kid.

1843
01:16:43,473 --> 01:16:47,311
You've finally developed something
called manners.

1844
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:50,939
Yes, it's definitely
made me more cautious.

1845
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:52,816
Earlier,

1846
01:16:52,899 --> 01:16:56,570
Mr. Attorney mentioned
that he found Lee Eighty's business card.

1847
01:16:56,653 --> 01:16:58,447
-Yes. "One billion, five hundred million."
-"One billion, five hundred million."

1848
01:16:58,530 --> 01:16:59,531
Something about debuting in China too.

1849
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:04,119
That money could be what Dancer would earn
by debuting in China,

1850
01:17:04,202 --> 01:17:07,414
but it might also be connected
to that tiny camera.

1851
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:11,543
She might've recorded
the VIP guests partying

1852
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:14,880
and traded the footage to settle her debt.

1853
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:16,340
Hey, An Dancer.

1854
01:17:16,423 --> 01:17:19,468
Is that what you've been cooking
at my club?

1855
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:21,303
-Just spill it.
-Were you going to rat us out?

1856
01:17:21,386 --> 01:17:22,387
First of all,

1857
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,766
-I have a debt of 550 million won.
-Right.

1858
01:17:25,849 --> 01:17:28,644
Over the years,
I've only been able to pay off 50 million.

1859
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:31,229
Yeah, 50 million won
over the course of 5 years.

1860
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:32,481
That took me five years.

1861
01:17:32,564 --> 01:17:34,524
-At this rate--
-You only have 50 more years to go.

1862
01:17:34,608 --> 01:17:36,151
I confided in Gun-mi

1863
01:17:36,234 --> 01:17:37,778
about my financial problems,

1864
01:17:37,861 --> 01:17:40,405
and she told me what I could do.

1865
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:45,035
Selling photos of VIP guests doing drugs
to people in China

1866
01:17:45,118 --> 01:17:47,079
could get me 500 million won per person.

1867
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:50,207
Is Lee Eighty the name
of an entertainment agency in China?

1868
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:52,334
No, Lee Eighty is a broker.

1869
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:55,045
I had to hand him the photos to get paid.

1870
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:57,798
Gun-mi also said she had found
a Chinese agency for me.

1871
01:17:57,881 --> 01:18:01,968
Dropping off drugs in the VIP room
was part of my job anyway,

1872
01:18:02,552 --> 01:18:05,889
so I made a hole in my purse like so.

1873
01:18:05,972 --> 01:18:10,102
-For the camera?
-I hid it here to take photos.

1874
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:12,396
Doesn't Ms. Chicken also know Lee Eighty?

1875
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:15,023
-No, she's been hunting him down.
-She's looking for him.

1876
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:19,986
These two had been waiting for Lee Gun-mi
to find him and deliver him.

1877
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:21,988
These two are connected to Lee Eighty.

1878
01:18:22,072 --> 01:18:23,115
-All right.
-We should try to find him.

1879
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:24,032
Sounds good.

1880
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:26,743
I have one last thing to ask.

1881
01:18:26,827 --> 01:18:28,120
-C-store.
-Yes?

1882
01:18:28,203 --> 01:18:31,623
You arrived at the meeting
for business owners at 10:10 p.m.

1883
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:33,166
-I showed up late.
-At 10:10 p.m.

1884
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:36,044
All attendees

1885
01:18:36,128 --> 01:18:39,339
had to sign out when leaving the meeting.

1886
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:42,259
-That's right.
-Mr. Club signed out,

1887
01:18:42,342 --> 01:18:43,635
as did Dancer.

1888
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:45,846
-She came as a proxy.
-Though she was representing someone else.

1889
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:49,224
You had to sign the form
to receive the support fund.

1890
01:18:49,307 --> 01:18:51,226
Exactly. However,

1891
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:56,356
not only did you show up late,
but you left without signing out,

1892
01:18:56,440 --> 01:19:00,694
even though
you could've received a support fund

1893
01:19:00,777 --> 01:19:03,196
for your father-in-law's
convenience store.

1894
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,449
-His father-in-law…
-Why didn't he sign out?

1895
01:19:05,532 --> 01:19:07,784
Why didn't you sign out when leaving?

1896
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:11,121
-He was furious when he arrived.
-Why were you so angry?

1897
01:19:11,204 --> 01:19:12,581
Here's the thing.

1898
01:19:12,664 --> 01:19:14,207
You said I was angry when I arrived.

1899
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:15,834
-Yeah, while you were on the phone.
-I was on the phone.

1900
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:17,753
I was on the phone

1901
01:19:17,836 --> 01:19:19,421
with our delivery guy.

1902
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:20,464
Why were you angry at him?

1903
01:19:20,547 --> 01:19:23,759
He couldn't park his truck
in front of the convenience store

1904
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:26,470
-because of the roadblocks.
-Right, they blocked the roads.

1905
01:19:26,553 --> 01:19:28,972
I suggested he park in a different spot,

1906
01:19:29,055 --> 01:19:30,807
but he said,

1907
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:34,186
"If I do, the truck will block
the view of the CCTV."

1908
01:19:34,936 --> 01:19:37,898
You mean the CCTV
in front of Sensibility Bar?

1909
01:19:37,981 --> 01:19:39,232
Did he park there?

1910
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:40,400
He probably did

1911
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:41,818
and blocked the camera's view.

1912
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:44,780
Detective, his statement just now
shouldn't be taken lightly.

1913
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:48,700
Knowing when the CCTV
had been blocked seems crucial.

1914
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:49,618
She's right.

1915
01:19:49,701 --> 01:19:51,411
-The camera outside Sensibility Bar.
-The truck, huh?

1916
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:53,955
New evidence has surfaced
regarding the delivery truck.

1917
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:56,458
-All right.
-The delivery truck.

1918
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:57,793
THE DETECTIVE'S 1ST ROUND OF VOTING

1919
01:19:57,876 --> 01:19:59,419
I will cast my valuable vote.

1920
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:01,171
My vote…

1921
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:04,424
will go to the person
with a strong motive.

1922
01:20:04,508 --> 01:20:06,927
THE DETECTIVE CASTS 2 VOTES TOTAL,
1 OF WHICH IS CAST AFTER THE BRIEFING

1923
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:07,969
Make a wise choice.

1924
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:09,471
So that's where it was.

1925
01:20:10,555 --> 01:20:15,018
Detective, you'd better get this right
if you want to keep your badge.

1926
01:20:15,101 --> 01:20:17,854
IN MEMORY OF A CERTAIN DETECTIVE
WITH SWAGGER WHO WAS BANNED FROM THE FORCE

1927
01:20:19,689 --> 01:20:20,857
WHO WILL THE DETECTIVE VOTE FOR?

1928
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:23,944
There's something this one person has
that the other four don't.

1929
01:20:24,694 --> 01:20:25,654
I'll tell you what that is.

1930
01:20:26,196 --> 01:20:29,491
WHO DOES JANG DETECTIVE
CURRENTLY THINK THE CULPRIT IS?

1931
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:31,660
You have a family.

1932
01:20:33,703 --> 01:20:34,621
What does he mean?

1933
01:20:35,455 --> 01:20:36,289
A child.

1934
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:37,958
You have a family.

1935
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:40,001
JANG DETECTIVE CHOSE JANG C-STORE

1936
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:41,086
What does he mean?

1937
01:20:41,878 --> 01:20:43,338
-A child.
-What?

1938
01:20:43,421 --> 01:20:44,673
You have a family of your own.

1939
01:20:44,756 --> 01:20:46,299
For goodness' sake.

1940
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:48,385
I guess he has a point.

1941
01:20:48,468 --> 01:20:50,470
The youngest person here
has a wife and a child.

1942
01:20:50,554 --> 01:20:52,138
He even has a father-in-law.

1943
01:20:52,222 --> 01:20:54,850
This is why I can't stand old-timers.

1944
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:57,018
Yet, you sounded like
a geezer yourself just now.

1945
01:20:57,102 --> 01:20:59,688
Anyway, let's all get back out there,

1946
01:20:59,771 --> 01:21:02,065
look for clues we missed,

1947
01:21:02,148 --> 01:21:04,025
and catch the killer.

1948
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:05,443
Do better, damn it!

1949
01:21:08,071 --> 01:21:10,740
Reverting back
to your juvie days, are you?

1950
01:21:11,324 --> 01:21:12,284
That was intense.

1951
01:21:13,326 --> 01:21:14,369
Keep up the good work.

1952
01:21:14,452 --> 01:21:16,663
THE SCENE OF THE CRIME
WILL REVEAL THE CULPRIT

1953
01:21:16,746 --> 01:21:17,956
-Hello.
-Hello.

1954
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:19,332
-Hello.
-How are you?

1955
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:21,251
I bet he witnessed a lot of things.

1956
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:24,296
Where should we even begin?

1957
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:25,797
First of all,

1958
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,259
I'd like to see what Mr. Club took.

1959
01:21:29,342 --> 01:21:31,094
-Oh, right.
-The photo.

1960
01:21:31,177 --> 01:21:32,888
-Show us the photo.
-I'd like to see the photo.

1961
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:35,473
Mister, show us the photo
if you want to clear your name.

1962
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:36,933
Tell us where you put it.

1963
01:21:37,017 --> 01:21:38,435
It's right here.

1964
01:21:38,518 --> 01:21:39,811
-You have it with you?
-Pull it out.

1965
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:41,396
-I'll take it out.
-All right.

1966
01:21:42,147 --> 01:21:43,899
-This is the photo.
-The family photo.

1967
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:45,317
Who's that?

1968
01:21:46,776 --> 01:21:47,652
Who's that?

1969
01:21:49,988 --> 01:21:51,615
It's Park Hyeon-jun!

1970
01:21:51,698 --> 01:21:52,824
Hang on a second.

1971
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:54,326
That's Park Hyeon-jun.

1972
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:55,994
-Park Hyeon-jun?
-Park Hyeon-jun?

1973
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:58,622
-I thought his name was Lee Gun-jun.
-That's odd.

1974
01:21:58,705 --> 01:22:00,582
It doesn't make any sense.

1975
01:22:00,665 --> 01:22:02,834
How can he be Park Hyeon-jun?

1976
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:04,002
Then what about him?

1977
01:22:04,085 --> 01:22:05,879
Park Hyeon-jun was a guy.

1978
01:22:05,962 --> 01:22:06,796
Yeah, a guy.

1979
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,299
-Wasn't that Lee Gun-jun's alias?
-Wasn't he also Lee Gun-jun?

1980
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:16,533
