Monday, March 29, 2021.
This is your one-minute traffic report.

00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,851
HANGANG RIVER

4
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:20,228
Fine dust carried
by the northwesterly wind,

5
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:24,107
along with heavy fog,
is reducing visibility.

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,859
Please stay alert
for unexpected situations--

7
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:34,367
MARCH 29, 2021, 4:00 A.M.
HANGANG BRIDGE

8
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,577
At around 4 a.m.,

9
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,538
a report came in about a car crashing into
the Hangang Bridge guardrail

10
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:41,082
and sustaining heavy damage.

11
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,794
Police immediately sealed off the area

12
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,088
and started investigating
the cause of the accident.

13
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,507
However, the thick fog and fine dust

14
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:52,093
are making it hard to process the scene.

15
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,722
Current traffic restrictions
will remain in effect until…

16
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:10,028
MURDER ON THE HANGANG BRIDGE I

00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:27,045

FINE DUST 167 µg/m³
CURRENT TEMPERATURE

19
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,762
The air is nasty.

20
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,225
You shouldn't be outside
on days like this.

21
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,559
The fine dust level is so high.

22
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,062
And what's with this thick fog?

00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,231
LEAD INVESTIGATOR ON THE THIRD CASE
KIM DETECTIVE

24
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:52,779
Man, it looks like someone's been
drunk driving or something.

25
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,699
It slammed into the guardrail.

26
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:01,287
AN ACCIDENT WHERE A VEHICLE CRASHED INTO
THE HANGANG BRIDGE GUARDRAIL

27
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,997
So someone had been driving,

28
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,210
and both the driver
and the person in the passenger seat

29
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,712
were thrown from their seats
into the Hangang River.

30
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,297
TWO HOLES IN THE WINDSHIELD

31
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,136
As of right now,

32
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,721
I only see one body.

33
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,682
A BODY FLOATING IN THE RIVER

34
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,146
The door's unlocked.

35
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,358
Why is the door unlocked?

36
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,445
This is unlocked too.

37
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:38,575
If the passengers had been thrown
from their seats during the crash,

38
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,285
all the doors should've been locked.

39
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,496
MEANWHILE

40
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,456
This one's locked.

41
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:52,088
Both the front and back doors are locked
on the passenger's side.

42
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,925
The shards of glass from the windshield

43
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,637
are on the driver's side
and not the passenger's.

44
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,974
As for the car's hood,

45
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,809
the driver's side is clean,

46
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,520
whereas the passenger's side
is covered with shards.

47
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,608
It doesn't seem
like your typical car crash.

48
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,068
It appears to be

49
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:17,197
a murder staged to look like a car crash.

50
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,287
-Hello, Detective.
-Oh, AD.

51
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,998
-I'm Kang Minhee, the assistant detective.
-There you are.

52
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,666
Do we know who the victim is?

53
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,378
Yes. This is everything we have so far
on the victim and suspects.

54
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,922
Here's the file.

55
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,633
CASE FILE DELIVERED

56
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,134
All right, let's start with the victim.

57
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:41,638
The victim is Park So-yun,
a 30-year-old female.

58
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,807
She's a newlywed of three months
and a stay-at-home wife.

59
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:48,686
A car crash on the Hangang Bridge
was reported at 4 a.m.,

60
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,730
and her body
was found floating in the river.

61
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,525
The estimated time of death
is between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m.

62
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,821
Where did the other person go?

63
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,241
WAS THERE ONLY ONE VICTIM?

64
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,326
Whose car is this?

65
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,412
The victim's or someone else's?

66
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,539
I knew you'd ask, so I came prepared.

67
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,874
I see.

68
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,835
You're on top of things, aren't you?

69
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,630
You got me a neat rundown
of the car owner.

70
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,341
Cho Yo-sep, a 35-year-old male.

71
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,051
The victim's husband,

72
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:22,553
and the leader of the
Hangang Bridge Water Rescue Team.

73
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,766
So where is Cho Yo-sep?

74
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:30,019
We've been trying to contact him
but haven't had any luck yet.

75
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,730
Could he be underwater
in the Hangang River down there?

76
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,441
-We'll have to confirm that.
-All right.

77
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,902
-Keep trying to contact him for now.
-Sure.

78
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:42,490
Meanwhile, bring the suspects
in this case here immediately.

79
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,117
-Yes, sir. I'll bring them over.
-Okay.

80
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,788
With the weather this gloomy,

81
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,416
the case is looking
all the more mysterious.

82
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,628
What's going on?
Oh my, there must've been an accident.

83
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,880
-Oh, dear.
-Hubby, don't look.

84
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,048
THE 5 SUSPECTS ARE SUMMONED

85
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,385
-Suspects, please come this way.
-Oh, Hubby. Did that spook you?

86
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,636
Who here is the suspect?

87
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,014
Every one of you is a suspect.

88
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,057
-Us?
-What is he talking about?

89
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,101
-I'm a busy woman, you know.
-Hurry on over.

90
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,770
-This looks like…
-Oh my. This is a major accident.

91
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,023
-Can you even see?
-This should be scrapped.

92
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,274
Sorry about that.

93
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,984
This can't be salvaged.

94
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,402
-Wait, hold on.
-There's no way.

95
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:23,698
Are you perhaps
Hwang Billionaire of Heaven Sent Group?

96
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,034
-Why did you drag me out here so early?
-It's Hwang Billionaire!

97
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,535
-Don't you know him?
-Hwang Billionaire.

98
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,662
Goodness. What a pleasure.

99
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,913
-What an honor.
-Nice to meet you.

100
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,291
-I'm in business myself.
-I see.

101
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,375
I'm Hwang Billionaire.

102
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,544
Right, of course. It's a pleasure.

103
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,212
-Well, I…
-Nice to finally see you in person.

104
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,630
-I respect you.
-Why the handshakes?

105
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,841
He's my role model.

106
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,302
Oh jeez. What are you, a fly?

107
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,722
-Mister, why did you bring us here?
-Are you okay, Hubby?

108
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,223
-It's not "mister."
-He's a busy man.

109
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:52,977
First of all, let me give you
a quick rundown of the case.

110
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,897
This car crashed into
the Hangang Bridge guardrail,

111
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,648
leaving a body floating in the river.

112
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,901
-What? A body?
-Down there?

113
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,903
-If you look at the windshield…
-What on earth happened?

114
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,280
-Oh my!
-My gosh!

115
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,033
-But it's so cold today.
-Miss, look over there.

116
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,201
Oh my!

117
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:11,412
Shouldn't you get the body out of there?
The water must be freezing.

118
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,998
-What on earth happened?
-Oh dear.

119
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,792
There are two holes here,

120
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,211
one on the driver's side
and the other on the passenger's side.

121
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:23,299
These seem to suggest both were thrown out
of their seats through the glass.

122
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,926
However, there's only one body.

123
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,969
It's obviously suicide.

124
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,679
These are difficult times.

125
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:32,141
-It's been an issue.
-I called you to the scene

126
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,684
to get to the bottom of this case.

127
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,770
One of you

128
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,689
is the culprit behind this murder.

129
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,066
What? Are you serious?

130
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,984
Are you seriously suspecting him?

131
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,655
-You've got some nerve.
-I already have a pretty good idea.

132
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,074
I can tell from your expressions alone.

133
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,867
-How cocky.
-Now, AD,

134
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,496
go get the body ready for examination.

135
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,747
Yes, sir.

136
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,541
All right, let's go.

137
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,876
Follow me, everyone.

138
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,964
Who are you to boss us around?
I'm having the worst luck this year.

139
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,465
DIGGING INTO THE SUSPECTS

140
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,135

Second suspect, Jang Buddy.

144
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,767
A 35-year-old male.

145
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,227
Foreign car dealer.

146
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,312
Third suspect, Jang Neighbor.

147
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,897
A 47-year-old male.

148
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,234
Hangang River water taxi operator
and the victim's next-door neighbor.

149
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,153
Fourth suspect, Park Kara.

150
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,821
A 46-year-old female.

151
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:30,074
CEO of Kara Okay, a cosmetics company.

152
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,659
Fifth suspect, An Marry.

153
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,161
A 29-year-old female.

154
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:36,622
Owner of Marry Marry Zzong Zzong Zzong,
a dog grooming salon.

155
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,624
Let me remind you once again.

156
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,461
Somebody here, besides me,

157
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,129
is the culprit.

158
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,132
Do you even hear yourself?
This could hurt my company's value.

159
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,676
Let me briefly introduce myself.

160
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,013
I'm Kim Detective,
the detective with the most swagger.

161
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,599
I'm sure you're familiar
with the star profiler,

162
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,768
-Pyo Chang-wan.
-Yes, of course.

163
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,104
I studied by watching his YouTube videos.

164
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,063
What's he barking about?

165
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,815
And let's not forget
the queen of psychological counseling.

166
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,194
You probably all know Dr. Oh Eun-yong.

167
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,571
-Right, I watch her shows often.
-Who doesn't know Dr. Oh?

168
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,656
I've watched all the shows she's been on.

169
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,533
So have I.

170
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,785
-Maybe you just watch a lot of TV.
-No, that's not it.

171
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,537
Sounds like you're unemployed.

Then, let's start with Jang Buddy.

174
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,335
Please tell us about yourself

175
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:26,297
and the nature of your relationship
with the victim, Park So-yun.

176
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,510
-First of all, I'm a foreign car dealer.
-A foreign car dealer?

177
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,636
So you're a car dealer.

178
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:36,349
I'm actually an old friend
of the victim's husband.

179
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,809
This must've been
a crime of passion then, right?

180
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:42,063
The truth is,
I'm the one who set him up with So-yun.

181
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,524
-You introduced them?
-I'm right.

182
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,193
-You deal in people too?
-So your best friend

183
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,695
married the woman
you set him up with, correct?

184
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,031
Yes, I set them up,
hoping they'd tie the knot.

185
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,075
She must've been his ex-girlfriend.

186
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,786
Next, the suspect
with the most questionable hairstyle.

187
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,412
-Excuse me?
-Jang Neighbor.

188
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,831
Well, I…

189
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:05,419
I operate a water taxi
here on the Hangang River.

190
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,337
A water taxi?

191
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,840
Whenever you're stuck in traffic,

192
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,343
please give me a call,
and I'll be of service.

193
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:16,764
Tell us about your relationship
with the victim, Park So-yun.

194
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:20,059
She and her husband live next door to me.

195
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:24,105
-I see. They're your neighbors?
-That's right.

196
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:28,901
The couple moved in
about three months ago,

197
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,947
so there hasn't been
a lot of interaction between us.

198
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,949
But there were noise issues,

199
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,160
so we weren't exactly
on the best of terms.

200
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,162
A lot of murders happen these days
because of noise issues

201
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,497
between apartment floors.

202
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,334
I just assumed
they were a bit oversensitive.

203
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,379
Is that why you wanted to kill them both?

204
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,548
Gosh, no. I'm not that kind of person.

205
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:53,551
I'm a man making an honest living
operating a water taxi.

206
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,094
All right.

207
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,972
There's someone here
who hasn't spoken once since they arrived.

208
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,224
-Sorry?
-Mr. Billionaire.

209
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,436
-Are the rich always reserved?
-Unbelievable.

210
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,812
You're very quiet.

211
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,731
He's not someone who'd chat with us.

212
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,774
As you can see, I'm quite busy.

213
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,902
-I've been enjoying your vlogs.
-Thank you.

214
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,905
You head to the office early
and also show your morning routine.

215
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,617
-You're the ultimate role model--
-You're my role model.

216
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,076
What the…

217
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,661
You both see him as a role model?

218
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,954
-How dare you?
-Excuse me.

219
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,539
-May I introduce myself?
-Please do.

220
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,043
All right. I'm Hwang Billionaire,
the vice president at Heaven Sent Group,

221
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,712
one of Korea's leading companies.

222
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,049
-You're the vice president?
-That's right.

223
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,260
I actually read the article.

224
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,472
You became vice president

225
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,515
because you married well, didn't you?

226
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,267
I'm only stating the facts.

227
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,519
-My, you just crossed the line.
-That's true.

228
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,521
Was I too direct?

229
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,066
We all know the story. It made headlines.

230
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,860
He used to be on the Water Rescue Team,

231
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,738
and he saved the life of a drowning woman

232
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,990
who turned out to be
a chaebol family's daughter.

233
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,202
And just like that,
he became her Prince Charming.

234
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,536
It couldn't have been a coincidence.

235
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,788
We need to dig into him.

236
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:07,750
The victim's husband, Cho Yo-sep,

237
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,085
is a junior colleague of mine.

238
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:13,130
You all know that I was formerly on the
Hangang Bridge Water Rescue Team.

239
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,675
My wife and I

240
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:19,136
dined with Yo-sep and his wife once.

241
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,139
It must be because they were newlyweds,
but they seemed very happy together.

242
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,349
-Is that so?
-Yes.

243
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,685
-So they seemed happy.
-That's right.

244
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,688
What is Mr. Cho Yo-sep like?

245
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,774
He's always been generous
to those around him,

246
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,067
so he has a good reputation.

247
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,568
He's good to me too.

248
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,195
He's a good person.

249
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,240
I've known Yo-sep since we were kids.

250
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,908
Oh, I see.

251
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:44,203
-I'm his next-door neighbor.
-Right.

252
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,163
-Jeez, you people…
-Nice to meet you.

253
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,665
-I'm the CEO of Kara Okay.
-Right.

254
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,417
-You should give me one first.
-I'm Park Kara.

255
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,001
-Why--
-That was my last card.

256
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,838
I'm sure you've heard of Kara Okay.

257
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,132
-It's a global cosmetics company.
-Kara Okay?

258
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,633
-Cosmetics?
-Yes.

259
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,844
First of all, is that your real name?

260
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,345
Of course.

261
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,513
-Park Kara.
-Park Kara.

262
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,724
-Are you perhaps a fan of baccarat?
-Excuse me?

263
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,225
Can't you see this? It's a calla lily.

264
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,394
A calla lily? Oh, the flower.

265
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,604
The name itself is beautiful,
but it's quite unfortunate

266
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,856
that your last name had to be Park.

267
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,941
You've got to be kidding me.

268
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,110
As for me… What was her name again?

269
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,112
-Ms. Park So-yun.
-Right.

270
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,406
I feel like I've heard her name before,

271
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,116
-but nothing's coming to me.
-Right.

272
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:25,244
As for Mr. Cho Yo-sep, I've met him once.

273
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,831
I speak at a lot of business seminars,
and one was at where he works.

274
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,500
He was friendly and polite.

275
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,043
That's how he seemed.

276
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,379
-Can I go? Hubby seems hungry.
-Go ahead.

277
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,840
-A hubby? You said you weren't married.
-You can go.

278
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,343
It's my dog. His name is Hubby.

279
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,803
-So that's who you meant.
-All right.

280
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,514
-Who brings a dog at the crack of dawn?
-Please introduce yourself first.

281
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,017
Hi, I'm An Marry,

282
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,437
and I'm the owner
of a nearby dog grooming salon

283
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,772
called Marry Marry Zzong Zzong Zzong.

284
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:56,358
I don't know Ms. Park So-yun that well,

285
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,194
but I met Yo-sep

286
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,821
at the Hangang River Puppy Crew.

287
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,239
-What's Puppy Crew?
-Puppy Crew?

288
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,533
Oh, it's actually Puppy Running Crew.

289
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,952
It's a running group
where people go on runs with their dogs.

290
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:11,832
Yo-sep was stylish and quite good-looking.

291
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,000
-I see.
-Yes.

292
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,002
-Running has been all the rage.
-I smell an affair.

293
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,712
-I'm telling you.
-What are you talking about?

294
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,173
-You knew he was married.
-You didn't like him, did you?

295
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,633
-Well…
-So that's why…

296
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,677
WOOF WOOF!

297
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,262
What was that? Hold on.

298
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,973
-Are you okay?
-What did Hubby say?

299
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,433
He wants you to quit barking nonsense.

300
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,812
All right, then.

301
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,815
I realized something interesting
while listening to your stories.

302
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,526
All of you suspects gathered here today

303
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,694
are more closely connected

304
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,030
to the victim's husband, Cho Yo-sep,

305
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,658
than to the victim, Park So-yun.

306
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,035
I have to say, this is quite unusual.

307
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,954
Where's the husband?

308
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,331
Try calling him. You're his best friend.

309
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,833
Why don't you try calling him?

310
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,170
Oh, you were turning Bluetooth on.

311
00:13:58,838 --> 00:13:59,839
He's not answering.

312
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:00,798
HANGING UP

313
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,552
It's a total dog's breakfast today.

314
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,679
Don't listen to her, Hubby.

315
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,557
The estimated time of death

316
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,184
is between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m.

317
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,311
Now, given that information,

318
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:18,941
let's hear each suspect's alibi
at that time frame.

319
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,401
First, Mr. Jang Buddy.

320
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,945
I was sleeping and even dreaming.

321
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,906
-It was a lovely dream.
-You were asleep?

322
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,909
What about you, Ms. An Marry,
CEO of Marry Marry Zzong Zzong Zzong?

323
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:32,538
I was in my grooming salon,

324
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,664
sound asleep.

325
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,457
-Do you not have a home?
-Do you not have a home?

326
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,084
There's a small room inside the salon.

327
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,420
-So she's homeless.
-No way.

328
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,963
And Mr. Hwang Billionaire?

329
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,341
I was at the office the whole time,
busy with work.

330
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,343
-Between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m.?
-At that hour?

331
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,928
That's how companies are run.

332
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,847
We work while you're asleep.

333
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,266
-Of course.
-I guess that makes sense.

334
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,894
Is there anyone who can verify that?

335
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,563
Shouldn't my word suffice?

336
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,732
-That's so cool.
-I'm writing that down.

337
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:00,816
And you, Ms. Park Kara?

338
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,443
-I run a global company
-Sure.

339
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:03,819
-in the K-beauty industry.
-Of course.

340
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,197
Communicating and corresponding
with people in Europe and the US

341
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,574
can easily lead to an all-nighter.

342
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,285
-So you were working at the office?
-That's right.

343
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,203
Mr. Jang Neighbor, you're next.

344
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,580
Right.

345
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,206
Well, I was…

346
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,001
I was praying.

347
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,586
-You were praying?
-Yes.

348
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,714
Did you pray you wouldn't be caught
after committing a murder?

349
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,383
Gosh, no. What a terrifying thing to say.

350
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,801
Then what were you praying about?

351
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:31,972
Just for some personal stuff in my life.

352
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,641
That sounds a bit suspicious.

353
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:37,227
Based on the alibis you provided,

354
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,063
no one could have done it.

355
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,773
The two of you were asleep at home.

356
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,359
-Everyone here seems so nice and friendly.
-Right.

357
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,777
All right.

358
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,612
I, Kim Detective, the swagger detective,

359
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,323
will surely catch the culprit.

360
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:52,910
Here's to hoping you find
as much evidence as possible.

361
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,870
-Off we go!
-Sure.

362
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,581
Please come this way.

363
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,874

00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:08,175
A CAR ACCIDENT ON THE HANGANG BRIDGE

367
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,262
A BODY FLOATING IN THE RIVER

368
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,115

373
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,086
Please come this way.

374
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,005
I know my way around this area.

375
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,548
TEAM 1: JANG NEIGHBOR & HWANG BILLIONAIRE

376
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,800
Marry Zzong Zzong, hurry up.

377
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,218
What's taking you so long?

378
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,137
Just a second.
I want to leave my baby here.

379
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,930
My sweet little…

380
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,224
Goodness, Hubby. You tripped. Come here.

381
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,728
You can rest here.
Mommy will be right back.

382
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,148
They got her body out of the river.

383
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,608
That's good work by our AD.

384
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,527
Oh jeez.

385
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,611
EXAMINING THE BODY FIRST

386
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,363
This is unbelievable.

387
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,242
Drowning has to be the cause of death.

388
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,786
I see glass shards lodged in her forehead.

389
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,830
-You're right.
-Right?

390
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,583
She must've gotten those cuts
as she went through the windshield.

391
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,543
As for other injuries…

392
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,756
It doesn't look like
there's any other evidence on the body.

393
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,758
I wonder what happened.

394
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,802
Why don't we head up to the car?

395
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,721
-Shall we?
-Sure.

396
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,016
It's a pity such a nice car
got rammed into the guardrail.

397
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,894
It was a horrific accident for sure.

398
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,104
Meanwhile, no one knows where Yo-sep is.

399
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,564
Is he even alive?

400
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:49,109
To get answers,
we'll have to inspect the car.

401
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:55,866
Hold on. Was she the one driving,
or was she in the passenger seat?

402
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,369
There are holes
on both sides of the windshield.

403
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,122
I see hair strands.

404
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,917
Look, right here.
There's a lot of hair stuck to the glass.

405
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,669
I see. She was in the passenger seat.

406
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,171
Wait a second.

407
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,965
The glass shards are outside the car
on the passenger's side.

408
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,467
But on the driver's side, they're inside.

409
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,345
The glass shards are inside the car
on the driver's side.

410
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,431
-There aren't any on the other side?
-No, not on the passenger's side.

411
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,474
If the shards are inside,

412
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,768
the glass must've been struck
from the outside.

413
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,647
Check this out.

414
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,731
It's an emergency hammer.

415
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,651
This is a hammer
used to break car windows.

416
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,488
I think the windshield
was smashed with this.

417
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,698
-On the driver's side, I mean.
-I see.

418
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,367
Wait, the seat belt.

419
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,994
Why was the seat belt cut?

420
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,330
Take a photo of this.

421
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,414
It's important.

422
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:51,171
-It was cut first and then torn, right?
-It was cut and then torn at the end.

423
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,507
-The airbag burst.
-Yes.

424
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,259
Does it usually get ripped like this?

425
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,594
Is this normal?

426
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,679
A TORN AIRBAG

427
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,556
Wait, there's something down there.

428
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,974
On the footwell.

429
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,350
FOUND ON THE PASSENGER SIDE FLOOR MAT

430
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,518
-What is it?
-It's a box cutter.

431
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,353
So that must've been used to cut these.

432
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,105
They cut the airbag.

433
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,649
-And the seat belt.
-Right, and the seat belt.

434
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,025
They must've staged an accident.

435
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,777
-On purpose?
-Exactly.

436
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,157
There's water.

437
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,450
Why is there water on this side?

438
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,702
Why?

439
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:24,580
Why is there water in the car
when it didn't go into the water?

440
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,082
The back seat is wet as well.

441
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,460
Did the killer open the car doors
after they got out of the water or what?

442
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:32,796
SUITCASE FOUND

443
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,256
There's a suitcase.

444
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,887
Did she pack for a vacation?

445
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,517
-The trunk won't open.
-It won't?

446
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,352
Let me see. Wait, there's a key.

447
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,688
CAR KEY FOUND

448
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,648
You can release this, and…

449
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,066
-Right, of course.
-We can use this.

450
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,944
You'd know from driving
all those fancy cars.

451
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,615
TRUNK OPEN

452
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,492
IS THERE SOMETHING INSIDE?

453
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,244
There's nothing here.

454
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,246
Why is it empty? That's not right.

455
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:14,379
The gate was left open, huh?

456
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,883
Someone must've gone
up and down the ladder.

457
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,426
But we're up so high.

458
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,553
This looks dangerous.

459
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,517
These are skid marks.

460
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,395
There are skid marks over here as well.

461
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:36,360
Skid marks of this length suggest

462
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,655
rapid acceleration or sudden braking.

463
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,949
Or maybe the car sped up,
turned back quickly,

464
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,408
and crashed into the guardrail.

465
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,122
STORM DRAIN

466
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,290
What's this?

467
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,833
How do you lift the grate?

468
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,509
What is it?

469
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,469
-My heart's racing.
-Why?

470
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,472
I haven't felt a dopamine rush like this
since I started my company.

471
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,849
There are bloodstains on the front.

472
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,643
BLOOD ON THE FRONT BUMPER

473
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,229
Where's the person
who was hit by this car?

474
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,856
This case is an absolute mystery.

475
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,444
PARK SO-YUN & CHO YO-SEP'S HOUSE

476
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,530
In cases like this, we must always start
by learning the backstory

477
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,031
-of the deceased.
-Is that so?

478
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:27,703
You need to know what the backstories are

479
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,830
to figure out why they died.

480
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:34,126
So, I'll swing by the couple's house
and thoroughly search the place.

481
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,003
Would you look at that?

482
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,713
They collected paintings

483
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,589
and designer purses.

484
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,092
They only drank premium water as well.

485
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,177
They wallowed in luxury.

486
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,431
Wait. "Night shift."
He worked the night shift that day?

487
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,308
If he worked the night shift on the 28th,

488
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,978
that means he should've been working
all night tonight.

489
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,146
28TH - NIGHT SHIFT
29TH - DATE OF INCIDENT

490
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,732
Right, of course.

491
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,109
Only someone with life experience
would notice something like this.

492
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,154
They were just husband and wife
on paper, huh?

493
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,114
Okay.

494
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,536
POKER CHIPS AND LIGHTERS FROM CASINOS

495
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,288
Chips, huh?

496
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,874
"Jackpot Land." "Gamblers House."

497
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,835
A BOX INSIDE THE CABINET

498
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,963
A two million won membership

499
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,631
Smooth? Oh, it's actually "Swoosh."

500
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,592

00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,762
Who's Kim First Marriage?

503
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,474
ANOTHER BOX

504
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,809
"Deliciously Touching."

506
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,146
ON THE BACK OF ONE COOKBOOK

507
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,939
"Lee Second Marriage"? What's this about?

508
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,649
Who's this person?

509
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,401
Who are Kim First Marriage

510
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,861
and Lee Second Marriage?

511
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:47,699
What's this?

512
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,870
Wait. It's a payment reminder.

513
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,830
"Since Cho Yo-sep brought in a bankroller,

514
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,374
one billion won
of his two-billion-won debt

515
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,043
to Gamblers House has been cleared."

516
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,587
"Gamblers House"?

517
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:04,591
What happened?

518
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,344
Why is the plant knocked over?

519
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,012
A PLANT POT KNOCKED DOWN
IN A CORNER OF THE GARAGE

520
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,935
This looks like the one we found earlier.

521
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,561
Wait. Is it the same model?

522
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,729
AN IDENTICAL BOX CUTTER?

523
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,109
What are these?

524
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:24,778
That's 3425.

525
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:25,862
CAR LICENSE PLATES

526
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,989
What are these?

527
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,327
GPS from Steel Car Rental?

528
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:33,912
Hold on.

529
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,539
What's with all these?

530
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,958
CHO YO-SEP'S LEDGER

531
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,876
Dated back in 2013.

532
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,003
"Foreign car,
smuggled out of the country."

533
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,088
I see.

534
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:46,341
He took in cars that had been parked
for extended periods

535
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,427
for some shady business.

536
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,678
Are you kidding me?

537
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,054
AMOUNT: 15 MILLION (HALF OF 30 MILLION)

538
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,431
JANG BUDDY'S HOUSE

539
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,307
I should check out his house.

540
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:57,436
I found evidence related to cars

541
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,148
at Cho Yo-sep's house,

542
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,775
so I went to Jang Buddy's place next

543
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,402
since he introduced himself
as a car dealer.

544
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,196
He must drink a lot.

545
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,407
The place is a mess.

546
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,202
What's this?

547
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:15,954
Check these out.

548
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:16,997
ALSO FOUND AT JANG BUDDY'S HOUSE

549
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,248
Unbelievable.

550
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,833
CAR LICENSE PLATES AND GPS

551
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,626
"Steel Car Rental."
They must've been in cahoots.

552
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,752
Hold on a second.

553
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,255
JANG BUDDY'S LAPTOP

554
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,924
"Big Score Community"?
What on earth is this?

555
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:31,219
"We dream of big scores and no sweat.
Big Score Community."

556
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,554
Was he running this?

557
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,681
"I'll be in touch."

558
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:37,225
"Please help this penniless orphan."

559
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,187
"I know of an amazing opportunity
for a big score. Who's interested?"

560
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,607
"I don't do anything predictable.
Only call if you've got the balls."

561
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,691
Hold on a second.

562
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,235
Is that Cho Yo-sep?

563
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,945
IS THE COMMENTER "YO_SEP!" CHO YO-SEP?

564
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,947
Wait a second. Is this…

565
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:55,410
"A lowlife of 29 years.
I'm freaking desperate here."

566
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,870
"I'm a woman living in Seoul."

567
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:57,954
Wait, what?

568
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,289
POSTED BY: SMALL_PARK

569
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,458
WE_AINT_STRANGERS
I'LL BE IN TOUCH

570
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,751
This is unbelievable.

571
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,129
Cho Yo-sep and…

572
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,297
CHATS

573
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,344
"Why'd you set me up
with a woman like her this time?"

574
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,304
He must've introduced
a lot of women to him.

575
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,431
"Why'd you set me up
with a woman like her this time?"

576
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,309
"I'm going to have to end this soon."

577
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:21,186
So he was going to break things off.

578
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,896
CHO YO-SEP, PARK SO-YUN

579
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,273
"Why'd you set me up
with someone like him?"

580
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,192
What the heck?

581
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,902
PARK SO-YUN, JAN 14, 2021:
THE DAMN LUNATIC YELLS AND CURSES!

582
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,785
HANGADAK

583
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,995
"Car collision on Seoul Hangang Bridge."

584
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,206
"Front seat passenger dies in fire."

585
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,834
"Ms. Lee" and "Mr. Cho."

586
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:48,338
Wait. Can that be Cho Yo-sep?

587
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,633
"Heaven Sent Life Insurance."

588
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,218
"Gamblers House."

589
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,389
So the guy received payouts
from the insurance company.

590
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,474
Something smells fishy, all right.

591
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,810
So Buddy must've found something out.

592
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,063
What's this?

593
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,816
Hold on.

594
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:08,733
YEAR PLANNER

595
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,653
What's all this? "Da-won."

596
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:13,780
"Gyo-eun."

597
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,574
"Won-yeong."

598
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,993
What's this about?
Was he dating multiple women?

599
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,369
16TH, THURS: JU-A, 10 O'CLOCK
17TH, FRI: IN-SEON, 7 O'CLOCK

600
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,954
He's a player.

601
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,415
What's this?

602
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,418
INSIDE THE GLASS BOTTLE
FILLED WITH PAPER CRANES

603
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,963
"I thought you were upstanding,
but you were far from it."

604
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,339
"You stole my heart."

605
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,425
LOVE NOTES?

606
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,719
"Remember this date. August 2, 2019."

607
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,516
"August 2, 2019, 6 p.m."

608
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,227
There's nothing under August 2nd.

609
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,854
I should just ask him about it.

610
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:48,898
LUNCH BOXES

611
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,108
What are these?

612
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,985
"I heard you were sick."

613
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,195
"Have some porridge and get better."

614
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,572
"It's evenly cooked."

615
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,324
Who was this from?

616
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:00,285
"I made some side dishes."

617
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,745
LOVE NOTES HERE TOO?

618
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,580
Who wrote all these?

619
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,544
JULY 30, 2011, HANGANG BRIDGE

620
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,129
"Celebrating
Hangang River-Crossing Contest."

621
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,464
River-Crossing Contest?

622
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,799
JANG NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE

623
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,092
Let's check out this house.

624
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,887
I see. The houses are identical.

625
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,723
The houses looked exactly the same.

626
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,268
From the outside,
one might even confuse the two.

627
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,812
JANG NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE
PARK SO-YUN & CHO YO-SEP'S HOUSE

628
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,776
Everything has been burned.
What did he do here?

629
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,402
Didn't he say he was praying?

630
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,405
Everything has been burned.

631
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,495
What's with this piece of paper?

632
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:49,000
From Seoul Unfair Police Station
to Jang Neighbor.

633
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:52,587
So they concluded
that it was an accidental fire, not arson.

634
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,255
Something definitely smells fishy.

635
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,343
"Lifeguard"?

636
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,430
That suggests there's somewhat
of a connection, doesn't it?

637
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,186
WATER TAXI ROUTE MAP

638
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,939
"Hangang Bridge, number eight."

639
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,859

640
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,112
"Traffic accidents."

641
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,488
BRIDGE 8, ACCIDENT-PRONE AREA

642
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,451
Looks like he was living on
instant noodles.

643
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,078
Why does he have so many paper cups?

644
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:30,458
"Certification of Content."

645
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,212
REQUEST FOR TERMINATION
OF HOUSING LEASE CONTRACT

646
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,880
He signed a lease agreement for a house,

647
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,467
but reports were filed
for his breach of special clauses

648
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,302
concerning noise and cleanliness.

649
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,389
So, the landlord was evicting him.

650
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:46,891
"Consultation."

651
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:50,770
"Cho Y." So Cho Yo-sep filed a complaint.

652
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,856
"The odor from the homeless
makes living here unbearable."

653
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,900
The homeless? What's this guy's deal?

654
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,404
What's over here?

655
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,531
Did he collect clothes
that people threw out?

656
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,367
MEANWHILE, IN THE DRAWER

657
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,661
What are these?
Why are there nice clothes in here?

658
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,914
The drawer is filled
with designer clothes. Jhanel.

659
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,751
A Noncler fur sweater
worth 2.3 million won.

660
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,253
What's this?

661
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,422
He bought so many designer items.

662
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:18,882
Brada.

663
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,091
More Jhanel.

664
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,469
But these were all signed by So-yun.
Wait, what?

665
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:25,430
Jeez, I just can't figure it out.

666
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,642
"Request for Attendance."

667
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,312
So he lurked around the house next door,
peeked through the window,

668
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,897
and eventually broke in.

669
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,817
Man, he's a stalker too, huh?
He's the total package.

670
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,697
What's this? "Russia, five."

671
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:43,865
"India, three."

672
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,742
"Brazil, three."

673
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:46,993
"China, three. Kenya, four."

674
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,954
What the heck?
What exactly does this guy do?

675
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,544
"Captain Eun Smuggler."

676
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:00,673
He's no ordinary water taxi operator.
He's a career smuggler.

677
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,218
What a mysterious guy.

678
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,719
JANG NEIGHBOR'S LAPTOP

679
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,263
What's this?
Five Viscera and Six Entrails Community?

680
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,725
"Senior Neighbor." Wait, "neighbor"?

681
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,478
What kind of online community is this?

682
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,396
I just got the chills.

683
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,192
THE CHILLING TRUTH
BEHIND THE ONLINE COMMUNITY?

684
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,530
There's a note here.

685
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,075
What in the world is this guy's deal?

686
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,703
I wanted to check out the water taxi.

687
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,676
WATER CALL TAXI

688
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,511
Is there anything suspicious
about the water taxi?

689
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:49,180
-The water taxi has a navigation system.
-Yes?

690
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,807
Let's see where it went recently.

691
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,685
Right here. "Hangang Bridge
north-end drainage channel."

692
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,687
-Is that where we are?
-"Hangang Bridge Dock."

693
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,188
"Seongsan Bridge."

694
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:01,234
I've always admired Mr. Hwang Billionaire
as my role model.

695
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,821
Mr. Billionaire is my role model.

696
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:08,616
I visited his office not out of suspicion,
but simply to catch a glimpse of his life.

697
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,285
Life is all about that one big score.

698
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:17,584
This man right here
is the one I really respect.

699
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,502
CHO YO-SEP

700
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,591
What's this? Is someone drowning?

701
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,845
Why does he have a framed photo
of someone drowning?

702
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,096
A MYSTERIOUS PHOTO

703
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:34,726
Look at that.

704
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,477
How cool.

705
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,314
"The wedding of the century."

706
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,857
The wedding of the century, huh?

707
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,735
"HEAVEN SENT GROUP'S HEIRESS
MARRIES HANGANG RIVER'S HERO…"

708
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,111
This is my dream as well.

709
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,322
"A male Cinderella is born." That's it.

710
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:50,867
Life is all about that one big score,
and he found his.

711
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,873
A Book on Culture for the Uncultured.

712
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,124
Written by Cheon Crude.

713
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,084
"Cheon Father-in-law."

714
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,753
His father-in-law gave him this book.

715
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,089
A New Year's card.

716
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:09,218
The father-in-law didn't mention
anything about Mr. Billionaire.

717
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,428
AND…

718
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:13,473
THE FAMILY PHOTO

719
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:16,476
"Hwang Billionaire Vlogs."
I'm really bad at these things.

720
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,729
Hwang Billionaire Vlogs…

721
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,940
So this is the kind of content he makes.

722
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,650
FROM CIVIL SERVANT
TO CHAEBOL'S SON-IN-LAW?!

723
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,234
RAMYEON TASTES THE BEST
AFTER BEING IN WATER

724
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:28,279
THIS IS NOT A DRILL!
REAL-LIFE RESCUE BY HWANG BILLIONAIRE?!

725
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,410
"Monthly Performance Graph."

726
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,747
This report shows his achievements.

727
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:43,503
Apparently, Hwang Billionaire Vlogs
are quite influential.

728
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:47,507
This must be what proves his value.

729
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,969
Hold on. He left his phone here.

730
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,845
HWANG BILLIONAIRE'S PHONE

731
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:53,930
What's this?

732
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,598
WIRE 200 MILLION BY MIDNIGHT
OR I'LL MAKE IT PUBLIC

733
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,809
Now, this is amusing.

734
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:58,977
PHOTO1_STAGED_INCIDENT_CONTRACT.JPG

735
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,938
"Contract."

736
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,899
He signed a deal with Cha Contract,
agreeing to a certain term.

737
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,776
"I agree to the appearance contract."

738
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,072
I found an envelope.

739
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,325
What am I looking at?

740
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,452
Seriously?

741
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,037
CONFIRMATION OF INSURANCE PAYOUT

742
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:22,208
What's this doing in this man's drawer?

743
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:26,004
My role model
is looking quite suspicious now.

744
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,589
There's something strange about this guy.

745
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,676
-I'll search this house.
-Go ahead.

746
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,178
I'll look through Park Kara's office.

747
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,765
I'm familiar with most people
who are relatively wealthy.

748
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,477
But I didn't recognize the company
when I got her business card earlier.

749
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,938
Ms. Park Kara.

750
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,274
She has money in a picture frame.

751
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,652
My goodness, even her cushion
has money printed all over it.

752
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,489
She's obsessed with money
even though she's already loaded.

753
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,033
YOUR MONEY IS MY MONEY
MY MONEY IS MY MONEY

754
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,618
Is she from a family of haenyeos?

755
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,620
She must be from Jeju Island.

756
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,705
YOUNG PARK KARA

757
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,415
Could there be something under here?

758
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,001
There is something.

759
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,044
FROM CHO YO-SEP

760
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,046
I see she knew Yo-sep personally.

761
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:12,383
"You're invited to the VIP yacht party."

762
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,262
It's a bankbook.

763
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,556
One owned by Ms. Park Kara.

764
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,808
"Hangang River Yacht Party."

765
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,311
"Gamblers House"?

766
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,064
"Gamblers Finance."

767
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,857
Why is her balance at zero?

768
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:30,985
The money's all gone.

769
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,155
What's this?

770
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,492
"How to participate in the art auction."

771
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,743
Gambling?

772
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,953
Something smells fishy.

773
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:42,663
The trash can.

774
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,334
See? I knew it.

775
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,837
"High-stakes illegal gambling den raided."

776
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,298
"Greed laid bare."

777
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,510
Oh dear. She got busted.

778
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,973
"Kirakara Cream."

779
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,308
What's this?

780
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,232
"List of Problematic Employees."

781
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,944
Joo Dead-end. Wait, Joo Dead-end?

782
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,278
That name rings a bell.

783
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,155
Wait. It's Park So-yun.

784
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,615
"Filed a report to the Labor Office."

785
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,784
So Ms. Park So-yun worked here.

786
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,661
DID PARK SO-YUN
WORK AT PARK KARA'S COMPANY?

787
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:23,871
KARA OKAY
ORGANIZATIONAL CHART

788
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,331
Park Kara.

789
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,458
This clearly looks suspicious.

790
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,709
Something's bound to be here.

791
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:32,547
What the heck?

792
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,006
Hold on.

793
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,302
Oh boy.

794
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,512
What's this?

795
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:43,933
"Marry Marry Zzong Zzong Zzong
Dog Grooming Salon."

796
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:48,980
Ms. Marry said she and Yo-sep
were in the same running crew.

797
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,065
Were they just running mates?

798
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,193
Is she not connected to Ms. Park So-yun
as claimed?

799
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,361
That's what I'm here to find out.

800
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:02,326
"National Certification, An Marry."

801
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,250
She said earlier
they were just running mates.

802
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:13,588
Were they close enough that she'd keep
photos of them in an album?

803
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,300
What's this?

804
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,678
There's something here.

805
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:21,679
DATING TEST

806
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,848
"Subject: Marriage."

807
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,476
"Date we first met. January 2021."

808
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,230
They were having an affair.
It was an affair for sure.

809
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:35,109
Were Cho Yo-sep and An Marry
having an affair?

810
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,028
A wheelchair.

811
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,487
A WHEELCHAIR BY THE COUNTER

812
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,325
What's this?

813
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,452
"Noh Two Feet"?

814
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,120
Who's Noh Two Feet?

815
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,330
I think that's everything…

816
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,040
Wait, her phone.

817
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:52,001
AN MARRY'S PHONE

818
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,086
I got you now.

819
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,422
"You're actually divorcing her, right?"

820
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,591
"This better not be one of those lies
married men tell."

821
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:01,219
"Of course. I just need a little time."

822
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:04,180
"Okay. We'll get married
six months from now."

823
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,725
That was 8 p.m.

824
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:08,976
BIG HUBBY♥

825
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,186
He didn't pick up.

826
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,438
Ms. Marry.

827
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,398
A SMALL ROOM IN THE CORNER OF THE SALON

828
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,319
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?
WEDDING CONTRACT

829
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,946
A wedding contract?

830
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:20,947
No way.

831
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,741
She was preparing to marry Big Hubby
as in Cho Yo-sep?

832
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,954
Yo-sep was going to file for divorce.

833
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:31,582
Why does she have this?
An Marry, this woman…

834
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,753
Hold on, what's this?

835
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,048
What the heck?

836
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,635
-Mr. Billionaire.
-Yes?

837
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,053
You must leave.

838
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:46,472
-Your time is up.
-Got it.

839
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:50,434
-Where are you taking me? To jail?
-Are you guilty of something?

840
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,352
I'm not.

841
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,896
I did nothing wrong,
but you're taking me somewhere.

842
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,815
Get moving, will you?

843
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,817
Of course. Mr. Billionaire,
I see you're already here.

844
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,568
INITIAL EXAMINATION
OF CRIME SCENE CONCLUDED

845
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,617
Kim Detective, the swagger detective here.
Before we begin today's deduction…

846
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:07,535
Yes?

847
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:10,454
-Did you find a lot of evidence?
-Yes?

848
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,082
Well, I may be jumping the gun,

849
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,458
but I know who the culprit is.

850
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,376
-Already?
-Yes.

851
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:20,131
Since Ms. Kara claims to know who it was,
let's have her kickstart the briefing.

852
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,925
-Hello, it's a pleasure.
-Hi.

853
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,428
I'm Park Kara
of the global cosmetics brand Kara Okay.

854
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:26,804
-Sure.
-First of all…

855
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,389
She's still a mystery to me.

856
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,183
This was a murder,
so we should start with the body.

857
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,686
I'm sure you all saw
the abrasions on her forehead.

858
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:34,854
-Right.
-Of course.

859
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:39,025
Another thing I'd like to point out
is that the airbag was torn.

860
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,694
Is it not normal for an airbag to get torn
in an accident?

861
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:42,820
-No.
-I see.

862
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,990
Someone had deliberately cut it
with a knife after the crash

863
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,950
to stage it as an accident.

864
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,870
Why didn't the airbag
on the passenger's side go off?

865
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:51,954
-It didn't go off.
-Exactly.

866
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,874
It depends on the car's settings,

867
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:58,169
but airbags don't go off
when the seat belt isn't fastened

868
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,421
-in some cases.
-The seat's registered as empty.

869
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,591
Also, this was far
from a typical car accident.

870
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,801
Did you see the bloodstains
on the front bumper?

871
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,678
There were bloodstains?

872
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,555
-There were.
-On the bumper?

873
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:10,639
Yes, the front bumper.

874
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:14,060
Someone was run over by the car first.

875
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,144
Right.

876
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:19,690
If Ms. Park So-yun had died
from being run over by the car,

877
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,984
-we would've found blood on her clothes.
-That's true.

878
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,320
However, she only had abrasions
on her forehead.

879
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:27,156
-That's right.
-So someone else was run over.

880
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:30,368
There's another piece of evidence
that backs up my claim.

881
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,661
-Did you see the skid marks?
-Yes.

882
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:33,746
-The two sets.
-Tire marks.

883
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:34,914
How's the weather today?

884
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:37,208
It's extremely foggy.

885
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,751
Whether intentional or not,

886
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:42,713
the car ran over someone and stopped.

887
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,966
That's when the first set was made.
The car stopped and left straight lines.

888
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,803
The second set was made

889
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:53,224
when someone crashed into the guardrail
to stage the accident.

890
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,434
That caused the second set of skid marks.

891
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,062
I believe that's how
the curved skid marks were made.

892
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,272
-That's sharp.
-My thoughts are based on the assumption

893
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,774
that the couple didn't get along.

894
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:04,318
Why do you think the couple had problems?

895
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,530
That's because the suitcase
in the back seat

896
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,448
only carried a woman's belongings.

897
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:12,284
I assume she wanted to
run away from him in secret.

898
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,537
They were more like housemates
than a married couple.

899
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,831
There were two sets of bedding,
dividing the bed in half.

900
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,582
That clearly shows
they weren't on good terms.

901
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:25,005
The victim died on the 29th,
a few hours past midnight.

902
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,174
Here's a quick note regarding the 28th.

903
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,677
The victim's husband, Cho Yo-sep,

904
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,220
-had the night shift.
-Yes, the night shift.

905
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,180
He'd be tied up working the night shift.

906
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,849
What better time to run off?

907
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,642
DID SHE ATTEMPT TO RUN AWAY
WHILE HE WORKED THE NIGHT SHIFT?

908
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:40,563
Given all the evidence,
you might think the husband killed her.

909
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,648
-That's possible, right?
-Exactly.

910
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:43,732
However,

911
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,152
I shifted my attention to Jang Buddy.

912
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,445
PARK KARA'S TARGET IS JANG BUDDY

913
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:51,907
Jang Buddy kept a yearly planner
filled with women's names and times.

914
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:56,120
One with entries like "Ji-yun, 6 p.m."

915
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:58,497
-Are you talking about my planner?
-Yes, your planner.

916
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:01,250
It had names and times.
What else could they be but appointments?

917
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,835
-What's wrong with that?
-But who has appointments

918
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:04,211
with dozens of women?

919
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,796
They were always with a different woman.

920
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,214
Don't tell me you're a player.

921
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,091
What did you do with them?

922
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,384
We ate together,

923
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,802
went to the movies,

924
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,304
just chatted,

925
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,555
and went for a drink.

926
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,640
-I'll ask you this one last thing.
-Sure.

927
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,934
I found the Big Score Community
on your laptop.

928
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,353
The circumstances suggest

929
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,439
that you met Cho Yo-sep
through that online community.

930
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,441
If you go to "my comments,"

931
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:28,068
you'll see he commented on a post
written by a user named "yo_sep."

932
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:31,155
Did you meet through the online community
or were you already friends?

933
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:34,366
-Yo-sep's an old friend.
-An old friend?

934
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,451
From high school.

935
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:38,913
He just happened to be a member
of this community. I didn't know.

936
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,040
-So it was a coincidence?
-That's right.

937
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:46,003
Moving on,
I discovered Cho Yo-sep's secret.

938
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:49,048
It's a bit suspicious
that it was found in Jang Buddy's room.

939
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,383
The envelope I found contained

940
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,011
a news article, a copy of a bankbook,

941
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:57,723
and a photo of the Hangang Bridge.

942
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:01,227
The news story was about Lee,
a 32-year-old woman,

943
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:05,022
who died at the scene
in a fire following a car crash

944
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,024
on the Hangang Bridge.

945
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:10,486
Her husband, Cho, scrambled out to safety,

946
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:13,822
barely managing to save his own life.

947
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:18,077
There also seems to be a photo
that someone took of the Hangang Bridge

948
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,495
on October 4th.

949
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:20,913
The insurance money

950
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:23,791
from Heaven Sent Life Insurance
was deposited into the bank account.

951
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,793
But the very next day,

952
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,753
it was wired out to Gamblers House.

953
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,923
Cho Yo-sep was a career con artist

954
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:34,301
who carried out insurance scams
to fund his gambling habit.

955
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,637
And Jang Buddy

956
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,889
-was aware of this.
-He knew?

957
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,225
Are you certain
he committed insurance scams?

958
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,685
-Yes.
-Really?

959
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:43,811
Yes, I'm sure.

960
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,484
It's not much of a shocking reveal.
Don't be so dramatic.

961
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,819
-When did you find out?
-You're good at English.

962
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,737
I only found out recently.

963
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,781
Why were those things in your possession?

964
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:58,492
You had all this information
and did nothing?

965
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,494
Did you not bring it up
to Cho Yo-sep or anything?

966
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,954
I didn't say a word.

967
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:04,039
Were you in on it together?

968
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,708
Of course not.

969
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,377
If I were to ask follow-up questions
on this matter,

970
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,963
I would ask why
he took out an insurance policy

971
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:15,593
with Heaven Sent Life Insurance
and received a payout from them.

972
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,679
Was Jang Buddy working with Cho Yo-sep?

973
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:22,266
Or was he afraid that the victim,
whom he had set up with Cho Yo-sep,

974
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,935
would become a target?

975
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,103
That concludes my briefing.

976
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:29,148
Goodness, Ms. Park Kara.

977
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:31,400
-She's a sharp one.
-She terrifies me.

978
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,610
Ms. Park Kara.

979
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,903
It seems I should explain myself.

980
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,614
JANG BUDDY VOLUNTEERS TO GO NEXT

981
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,198
-Big Score Community.
-Yes?

982
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,117
What do you all think about it?

983
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,286
Isn't it a community of people
chasing a big win in life?

984
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,662
A community for scam artists.

985
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:46,040
I see it as an honest community.

986
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,792
What barking nonsense is that?

987
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,629
Even her dog Hubby
wouldn't bark such nonsense.

988
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:55,633
We all want to change something
in our lives, don't we?

989
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,343
-Sure.
-This online community

990
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,887
allows you to be honest
about your desires.

991
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,430
-You can be true to your desires, huh?
-Right.

992
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:06,685
The story of Vice President Hwang
is a dream scenario for the members there.

993
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,896
He quickly rose
in social standing overnight.

994
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,690
I looked into Vice President Hwang
not out of suspicion

995
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:15,944
but reverence, as he is our role model.

996
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,655
-"Reverence"?
-Must you take it that far?

997
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,657
-You must watch a lot of TV.
-I went to his office.

998
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,408
So, I went to his office,

999
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,786
and I was wondering
what kind of books he'd read.

1000
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:26,330
And there was a book
on how to become more cultured

1001
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,831
with an envelope inside it.

1002
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,291
It contained a New Year's card

1003
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,835
from his father-in-law,
Chairman Cheon Father-in-law.

1004
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:36,840
He wished his better half, his daughter,
and even his puppy a good year,

1005
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,176
but not his son-in-law.

1006
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,260
Really?

1007
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,805
Nothing.

1008
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:45,099
This is what it means
to be treated less than a dog.

1009
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,684
Come on now.

1010
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,602
-Did you have to say it like that?
-I was just saying.

1011
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,229
Sounds like you haven't won

1012
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:53,691
-his approval yet, Mr. Billionaire.
-I wonder why.

1013
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,401
I wanted to keep that private,

1014
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,486
but since you discovered the card,
I'll tell you about it.

1015
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:59,488
The photo at the front

1016
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:01,156
-is from a family gathering.
-Right.

1017
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,118
You can clearly tell I was the only one
who missed the dress code memo.

1018
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,494
EVEN THE DOG DRESSED FOR THE OCCASION

1019
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,413
He messed with you.

1020
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,832
-As you know,
-You're an outcast.

1021
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,875
I was once part of the Water Rescue Team.

1022
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:16,630
The chairman didn't think
I was good enough for his daughter.

1023
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,966
Chaebols tend to arrange marriages
among themselves.

1024
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,301
So giving me that book
was his roundabout way

1025
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,679
of insulting me for my lack of culture.

1026
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:26,348
Backhanded insults are the worst.

1027
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,391
How uncultured.

1028
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:32,020
Moving on, this performance report
was on your desk.

1029
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,105
I saw that too.

1030
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:37,151
Though you're far down the line
of succession,

1031
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:41,405
it looks like something
might turn things around for you.

1032
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:43,282
And that's your Hwang Billionaire Vlogs.

1033
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:45,033
-Please subscribe.
-Right.

1034
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,412
Is it Hwang Billionaire
or Hwang Like and Subscribe?

1035
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,914
Subscribe, like,
and turn on notifications.

1036
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,499
He also has the public's support.

1037
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,792
His popularity has skyrocketed.

1038
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,794
Things couldn't be better
for him right now.

1039
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,422
Is it enough to attract
the company's attention?

1040
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:01,175
-I don't know about these things--
-He revamped the corporate image.

1041
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,093
I don't know if it had been left there
for people to see,

1042
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:07,639
-but his phone was out in the open.
-Oh, his phone.

1043
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,642
-He was being blackmailed by someone.
-Blackmailed?

1044
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:13,228
There was a contract attached to the text.

1045
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,899
According to it,
one of the scenes in his vlogs was staged.

1046
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,109
-It was rigged.
-Yes, exactly.

1047
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:22,905
This appearance contract is proof
that the scene was staged.

1048
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:25,532
-That'll cost him all his subscribers.
-Oh dear.

1049
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,201
-It was staged?
-I only ask

1050
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,745
-because I'm clueless about all this.
-You're so done, Hwang Sham.

1051
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:32,623
Will he be in such big trouble
if people find out about this?

1052
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,666
-He'll be done for!
-It'll be over for him.

1053
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,460
-It was all fake.
-Will he be done for?

1054
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,754
-People will feel betrayed.
-He'll get divorced, thrown out,

1055
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:39,880
and end up broke.

1056
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,758
-Is he now Hwang Stager?
-No, Hwang Sham.

1057
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,385
-Hwang Sham.
-This is very offensive.

1058
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,179
Next. There's something else.

1059
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:51,183
Park Kara, you said you found
proof of insurance payout in my room.

1060
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:54,353
A copy of the insurance payment slip
was also in Vice President Hwang's office.

1061
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:58,106
-What's this, Vice President Hwang?
-A junior colleague of yours

1062
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,942
had taken out insurance policies.

1063
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:03,612
You knew he had claimed
the insurance payouts

1064
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:05,322
-after his wives' deaths.
-That's right.

1065
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:06,782
Did you say "wives"?

1066
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:09,076
-Yes, his two former wives.
-There were two?

1067
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,160
And both of them died?

1068
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,454
-Yes, and he collected two payouts.
-What the heck?

1069
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:15,040
There were photos too.

1070
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:17,084
-Photos?
-Photos of Yo-sep.

1071
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,253
And there was a memo on the back.

1072
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,588
It read, "blackmailer."

1073
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:25,384
So, Cho Yo-sep was the one
threatening to expose Mr. Billionaire?

1074
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,136
Here's the thing, everyone.

1075
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:31,598
This might not be related
to Park So-yun's death in any way.

1076
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,810
Clearly, he didn't have any issues
with Park So-yun.

1077
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:37,020
However, here's a possible scenario.

1078
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:39,815
While he was attempting
to kill Cho Yo-sep,

1079
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,234
Park So-yun could've also somehow
died along with him.

1080
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:44,611
Or perhaps, only she died.

1081
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,948
I think a short answer from him
will be enough.

1082
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,325
You knew, didn't you?

1083
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:54,663
You knew Cho Yo-sep
was the blackmailer, correct?

1084
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,290
-I'm afraid so.
-Okay.

1085
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,709
Then let's go back to the victim.

1086
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:02,129
Given what we have found out so far,

1087
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:05,007
it's hard to suspect anyone as her killer.

1088
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:10,053
However, I'm sure we'll find out more
about Park So-yun along the way.

1089
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:10,971
Next.

1090
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,390
There was a photo of his family

1091
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:16,476
and another one
with his fellow rescue team colleagues.

1092
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,561
Those speak for themselves.

1093
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,271
But what's with this one?
I'm dying to know.

1094
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:22,316
It's of someone drowning
and their hands reaching out of the water.

1095
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:25,110
-They're flailing.
-Who's this? Someone in need of rescue?

1096
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:27,070
-This--
-Who takes a photo in that situation?

1097
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,448
"Hold on. Let me take a photo first."

1098
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:31,992
No, that's not it.

1099
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:35,913
I make it a habit to look at those hands,
reminding myself of my duty

1100
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,581
and responsibility to save lives.

1101
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:38,665
A staged rescue.

1102
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,083
That's odd.

1103
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:42,294
You'd better watch out for yourself.

1104
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,545
Me? What about me?

1105
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,672
I went to her room in her salon next.

1106
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,425
-My salon?
-I was so shocked. Forget everything else.

1107
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,260
-There were divorce papers.
-What?

1108
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,554
Isn't she too young to be divorced?

1109
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,515
There was a wedding contract as well.

1110
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,684
What? A wedding contract between whom?

1111
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,436
Between Cho Yo-sep…

1112
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,272
-and An Marry.
-Seriously?

1113
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:03,565
You little minx.

1114
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,776
-On March 22nd--
-I knew it.

1115
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:07,778
-I told you it was a crime of passion.
-Check this out.

1116
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:10,238
The running crew
was a cover for your affair.

1117
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,323
An affair?

1118
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:13,200
Please call it love.

1119
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,953
-He had a wife, that's all.
-I see.

1120
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,537
He just happened to be married, huh?

1121
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:20,832
But like I said,
there were divorce papers.

1122
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,834
It was a divorce between Cho Yo-sep

1123
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,670
-And Park So-yun.
-and Park So-yun.

1124
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,088
The paper was crumpled up.

1125
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:27,005
And get this.

1126
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:30,175
The handwriting didn't seem like Yo-sep's.

1127
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:32,469
Who filled it in?
Marry Zzong Zzong, answer.

1128
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:34,554
I filled it in.

1129
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,643
-Was it a one-sided crush?
-I mean…

1130
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:41,520
-Are you his stalker?
-No, it wasn't.

1131
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:44,147
The two of us were in love,

1132
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,233
and he was going to
divorce her eventually.

1133
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,527
-You didn't throw it out after the murder?
-Of course not.

1134
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,445
I filled it in for him,

1135
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:54,616
but Yo-sep saw that and got mad.

1136
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,201
Did you kill them
thinking he wouldn't get a divorce?

1137
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,287
Maybe we should start calling her
An Home-wrecker.

1138
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:02,624
-Oh, because he was married.
-Mr. Billionaire's getting back at her

1139
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,459
for calling him Hwang Sham.

1140
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,629
Okay, then.
Now, I'm guessing Mr. Billionaire

1141
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,965
has a lot to say.

1142
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:11,383
Or should I call you Mr. Hwang Sham?

1143
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:13,176
I'm a bit of a perfectionist,

1144
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,221
so I'd appreciate it
if you could line up the photos straight.

1145
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:18,015
They're all over the place.

1146
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,307
PERFECTIONIST HWANG BILLIONAIRE'S BRIEFING

1147
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,892
He's quite fussy, isn't he?

1148
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,310
-You know what?
-He's such a pain.

1149
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,646
Blame it on
our not-so-straight upbringing.

1150
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,732
Like Ms. Kara…

1151
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:30,444
-The photos are identical.
-See? Leaders think alike.

1152
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:34,031
-He takes good photos too.
-They were shot from the same angle.

1153
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,992
I'm telling you, great minds think alike.

1154
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:39,703
Anyway, here's the windshield.

1155
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:42,539
Strands of hair were caught in the cracks.

1156
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,002
-They were there.
-Look here, Mr. Neighbor.

1157
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:48,503
It's a startling fact.

1158
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,964
Just like Mr. Buddy,

1159
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,050
I looked into Ms. Marry.

1160
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,677
-Me?
-I went through her drawers

1161
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:59,848
and found two copies
of a cringey dating test.

1162
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:02,017
On that test,

1163
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:06,438
Ms. Marry indicated that she wanted
to get married as soon as possible.

1164
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:08,148
But why was Cho Yo-sep

1165
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,817
insisting that they wait
at least six months?

1166
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,277
Honestly, I don't know why.

1167
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,029
I couldn't understand.

1168
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:16,364
I checked the texts on her phone next.

1169
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:20,619
Ms. Marry had been pushing him
so they could get married soon.

1170
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:24,498
Yo-sep, however,
insisted on waiting six months,

1171
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:25,957
which was suspicious.

1172
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,543
-They disagreed on the timing.
-Right.

1173
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:31,088
Here's something else I found.

1174
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:34,257
There was a wheelchair by the counter.

1175
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,259
-There was a wheelchair?
-That's right.

1176
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:40,138
In the pocket was a name tag
that read, "Noh Two Feet."

1177
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:41,389
-Noh Two Feet?
-Noh Two Feet?

1178
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:42,891
Noh Two Feet. What could it mean?

1179
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:44,768
-Noh Two Feet?
-Can't walk on two feet?

1180
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:47,479
-That may be it.
-Excuse me, Detective. May I?

1181
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:49,064
-For a bathroom break?
-No.

1182
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:53,235
I didn't exactly wait around
for the perfect moment

1183
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:55,695
to be in the same frame
as Mr. Billionaire.

1184
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,365
-Did it have to be right now?
-Tell me about it.

1185
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:02,536
-You're not doing yourself any favors.
-Why do something that'll only hurt you?

1186
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,663
-I've been holding something back.
-Which is?

1187
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:06,123
There was evidence under the carpet

1188
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:09,835
that she'd hired
Jang Private Investigator.

1189
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:12,587
-Jang Private Investigator?
-Is he still taking on jobs?

1190
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:14,589
-The man still hasn't retired?
-He's a legend

1191
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,216
-in his field.
-Jang Private Investigator.

1192
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,342
Who is this person?

1193
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:20,303
-A PI, but we haven't met him in person.
-He's well-known.

1194
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,055
He's been active for 12 years now.

1195
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,140
All right.

1196
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:27,310
There's a photo of Noh Two Feet,
the person who was brought up just now.

1197
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:29,563
Check it out.

1198
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:33,191
-Is Noh Two Feet a person?
-A photo of Park So-yun is in the middle.

1199
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:36,528
To the left is a photo of Yo-sep.

1200
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:39,030
Here's the important part.

1201
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,157
Look right here.

1202
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,035
It's the phrase,
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."

1203
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:46,872
Does this mean
she took Noh Two Feet from you?

1204
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:47,956
Ms. Marry?

1205
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:51,877
First of all, Noh Two Feet

1206
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,087
is my ex-boyfriend.

1207
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,382
-So he was taken from her.
-I used to

1208
00:52:57,465 --> 00:53:00,260
bring the wheelchair everywhere

1209
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,053
because he had difficulty walking.

1210
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:04,514
He couldn't walk, could he?

1211
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:09,102
That's why I cared for him so much,
pushing him around in his wheelchair.

1212
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:12,314
-You were devoted to him.
-I was a devoted girlfriend.

1213
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:15,609
However, Two Feet

1214
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:18,528
-had an affair with Park So-yun.
-What?

1215
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:21,907
So you approached Cho Yo-sep
with an ulterior motive?

1216
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:26,661
That's right. I wanted to get my revenge
by stealing Yo-sep from her.

1217
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:29,706
It's true I joined the running crew
just to get closer to him.

1218
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:32,542
But over time, I truly fell for him.

1219
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,169
-Really?
-Yes.

1220
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:35,962
You approached him
with an ulterior motive,

1221
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:39,799
-but you ended up falling for him.
-Yes, I fell in love with him.

1222
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,843
-Your love for him was real.
-That's right.

1223
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,428
-Really?
-Yes.

1224
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:45,639
-Are you touched by this?
-How touching.

1225
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,224
-I mean that.
-Is that so?

1226
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:50,185
-So, how is Mr. Two Feet doing these days?
-What?

1227
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:51,853
-Mr. Two Feet.
-Do you know how he's doing?

1228
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,897
I have no idea how he's doing.

1229
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,233
Is Mr. Two Feet's condition
something he was born with?

1230
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:58,151
Could this be
a real-life version of Misery?

1231
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,487
Maybe she traps every man
she gets involved with.

1232
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,865
-No, I don't think so.
-Can we please stop talking about my ex?

1233
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,742
Right now, Yo-sep's the only one for me.

1234
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:08,912
-The love runs that deep, huh?
-Yes.

1235
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:12,582
-I can't tell how much of it is a lie.
-I know.

1236
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:13,875
This would be a good point

1237
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,544
to move on to Ms. Kara.

1238
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:17,587
That came out of nowhere.

1239
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:18,797
-I looked into her as well.
-Ms. Kara?

1240
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:19,923
-Me?
-Park Kara?

1241
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:22,634
I found a VIP event invitation
in her desk drawer.

1242
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:27,138
Yo-sep had sent Ms. Kara
an invitation to a VIP event.

1243
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,598
Yes, he did invite me.

1244
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:30,976
When I gave my seminar
to the Water Rescue Team,

1245
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:34,729
he was very friendly
and said he'd invite me to an event.

1246
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:37,524
Now that I think about it,
he said he knew Mr. Billionaire well.

1247
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,693
They said they were good friends.

1248
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,778
As a businesswoman,

1249
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:44,114
would it be a good thing or a bad thing
to get to know Mr. Billionaire?

1250
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:46,908
-A good thing for sure.
-That's why I attended the party.

1251
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,952
What kind of party was this?

1252
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:52,580
It was a party to fulfill our duties
as privileged members of society,

1253
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,874
and there was an auction
we could participate in.

1254
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,002
As I kept looking,

1255
00:54:57,085 --> 00:55:01,548
I came across another printout
that explained how the art auction worked.

1256
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,216
When I read it,

1257
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:07,721
I realized it was written in a code
that reminded me of baccarat.

1258
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,056
-Isn't this gambling?
-Jeez.

1259
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,225
I found evidence

1260
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:17,731
that Cho Yo-sep and Park Kara
were clearly tangled up financially.

1261
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:21,401
I've never known anyone
who got rich through gambling.

1262
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:24,612
It looks like we need to
dig deeper into Ms. Kara.

1263
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:26,656
-Ms. Marry?
-Sure.

1264
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,159
Marry Zzong Zzong,
did you go through my stuff?

1265
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:30,827
First of all,

1266
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:34,164
I noticed
the back seat of the car was wet.

1267
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:37,751
-Right.
-I saw drops of water on the seat.

1268
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,045
Since the incident occurred by the river,

1269
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:42,297
the killer could've entered the car

1270
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,884
after being in the water themselves
or carrying something from the river.

1271
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:49,054
While we're on the subject of water,

1272
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:51,556
I'd like to ask
if Ms. Kara is a good swimmer.

1273
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:52,474
Can I swim?

1274
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:56,186
-Can you swim?
-Swimming's always been in my blood.

1275
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:58,897
-It seemed that way.
-How so?

1276
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,940
-She was a former female diver, haenyeo.
-Really?

1277
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:03,651
PARK KARA, A HAENYEO?

1278
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,820
-Where are you from?
-I'm just saying since it came up.

1279
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:08,198
But you know the popular TV series

1280
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:09,574
-When Life Gives You Tangerines?
-Sure.

1281
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:11,242
I thought I was watching my life story.

1282
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,453
I come from three generations of haenyeos.

1283
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,497
-You come from a family of haenyeos?
-Yes, apparently so.

1284
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:18,958
If the water on the back seat
came from the river,

1285
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:22,087
it could've been a mark left by Ms. Kara
since she's a skilled swimmer.

1286
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,755
There's something you've forgotten.

1287
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:26,508
-What's that?
-Someone here used to be

1288
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:28,259
on the Water Rescue Team.

1289
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:32,013
Also, a certain water taxi operator
is a certified lifeguard.

1290
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:33,390
LIFEGUARD

1291
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:36,101
Mr. Buddy also participated
in the Hangang River-Crossing Contest.

1292
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:39,104
One held at the Hangang Bridge, at that.

1293
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:41,064
Then, swimming there
must be a piece of cake for you.

1294
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:42,315
-Add one more suspect to the list.
-Listen.

1295
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:45,235
-People my age enjoy such activities.
-So, Detective.

1296
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:49,197
Everyone but me
is obviously a decent swimmer.

1297
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,698
-That's true.
-Please remember that.

1298
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:53,284
Let's circle back to Ms. Kara.

1299
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:55,537
I bet you all saw her seat cushion
with the money print

1300
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,330
and the 50,000-won bills
kept in a picture frame.

1301
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,791
I also noticed a sign
as I was passing by that said,

1302
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:02,335
"Your Money is My Money,
My Money is My Money."

1303
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,212
Your money is my money,
and my money is my money.

1304
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:07,298
-I suspect multi-level marketing.
-It's nothing like that.

1305
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:09,676
Let's talk about
that shady MLM company of hers.

1306
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:12,554
-What do you mean it's shady?
-Take a look at the organizational chart.

1307
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:13,847
-It's very questionable.
-An MLM company?

1308
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,391
Even the names of her employees
sound suspicious.

1309
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:18,768
There's even an employee named Pyramid.

1310
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,147
What the heck?

1311
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:23,731
Hold on.

1312
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,358
IS SOMETHING UNDERNEATH
THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHART?

1313
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,610
Oh boy. What's this?

1314
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,571
What's all this?

1315
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,739
She's one scary woman, isn't she?

1316
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,701
You can see a lock here.

1317
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:37,078
People appeared to have been confined.

1318
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:40,999
The photos showed a work environment
that definitely seemed unusual.

1319
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,625
-The employees--
-They were confined?

1320
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,795
Oh, come on. I think of them as family.

1321
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:48,173
How does a mother teach her children?

1322
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:50,341
She uses both the carrot and the stick.

1323
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,719
We're one big family.

1324
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:55,054
Don't you know the drama called
Family by Choice?

1325
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,973
-I heard it was very good.
-Right.

1326
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,933
The male lead is very handsome.
Do you not know him?

1327
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:00,059
-I don't believe I do.
-I see.

1328
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:03,188
Anyway, I was moved by that drama.

1329
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,398
Though I'm not related to my employees,
I consider them family.

1330
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,150
Here's how cruel she is.

1331
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:09,694
-She has a list of blacklisted employees.
-What?

1332
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:11,654
I checked their names

1333
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:13,406
and came across one I recognized.

1334
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,741
Ms. Park So-yun.

1335
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:18,453
Ms. Kara fired her
for filing a report to the Labor Office.

1336
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:21,623
When we first gathered
and introduced ourselves,

1337
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,833
she was asked if she knew Park So-yun.

1338
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:26,544
-She said she's only heard of her name.
-Yes, that's what I said.

1339
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:29,088
I never said that we were total strangers.

1340
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,216
Also, Ms. Kara

1341
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:33,927
-has no money in her bank account.
-None?

1342
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,721
Do you want to know
who took the last of her money?

1343
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:38,765
It was Gamblers House. And the amount?

1344
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:40,558
-One billion won.
-Jeez.

1345
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:41,643
My goodness.

1346
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:43,603
-What were you up to, Ms. Kara?
-She's also into gambling.

1347
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,230
As if you need to ask.

1348
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,899
-What else would I have done there?
-She played baccarat, of course.

1349
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,692
What game would I have played?

1350
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:51,653
-She had--
-You were given the wrong name.

1351
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:54,614
-She had 45.6 billion won in her account.
-What's wrong with Kara?

1352
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,866
-I didn't just lose a billion won.
-She's constantly been losing money.

1353
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,869
-I've lost all my savings!
-You lost 45.6 billion won?

1354
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:04,874
The VIP event is how I first stepped foot
into the world of gambling.

1355
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:07,502
So getting invited to the VIP event
got you into gambling?

1356
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:09,254
Yes. My name suggests otherwise,

1357
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,880
but I didn't even know
how to play baccarat.

1358
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,967
This wasn't her first time though.

1359
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,386
She was caught
at an illegal gambling den raid.

1360
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:18,054
-There was an article.
-Oh, she was arrested?

1361
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,931
-Yes, she was arrested on-site.
-I saw that too.

1362
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:21,558
It was the most embarrassing moment
of my life.

1363
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:23,977
There's a familiar face
in the photo in this article.

1364
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,895
My beloved Yo-sep

1365
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:28,439
was escaping the scene
with stacks of money.

1366
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,441
Yes, that bastard took it.

1367
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:32,819
Please mind your words.

1368
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:34,362
I was about to rake it all in--

1369
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:36,030
-Did the police burst in then?
-That's right.

1370
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:37,865
Then, that bastard
fled with the one billion.

1371
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:41,077
You lost 45.6 billion won
and ended up with a 1-billion debt.

1372
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,161
That's impressive.

1373
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:45,456
You're quite an impressive woman.
Your MLM business must've been lucrative.

1374
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:48,585
I could bounce back by keeping
a few more employees confined… Oh dear.

1375
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:49,919
Sorry about that.

1376
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:52,839
Next, I looked into Mr. Buddy.

1377
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:53,923
You're done with me now.

1378
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:57,051
First, I checked Mr. Buddy's laptop.

1379
00:59:57,635 --> 01:00:01,431
He was in touch
with both Yo-sep and So-yun.

1380
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:04,392
It was an absolute pain
being caught between them.

1381
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:06,603
-Neither of them was fond of the other.
-Exactly.

1382
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:10,148
So Mr. Buddy advised both of them
to bear with it.

1383
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:12,900
-What else could I have said?
-However, here's what's strange.

1384
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,694
Yo-sep wrote,

1385
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:17,697
"Why'd you set me up
with a woman like her this time?"

1386
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,781
"This time"?

1387
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,034
Doesn't "this time"
seem awfully suspicious?

1388
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:23,119
If this had been Mr. Buddy's first time
setting him up with someone,

1389
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:24,829
he wouldn't have said that.

1390
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:27,915
Well, he said he wanted to meet a woman,

1391
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:29,626
so I set them up, and they hit it off.

1392
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:31,377
-And before long, they got married.
-Right.

1393
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:32,837
That was with First Marriage.

1394
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,714
-That was with First Marriage?
-Yeah.

1395
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:37,258
But then, something unfortunate
happened to her.

1396
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:39,927
After months of heartache,

1397
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:42,263
he reached out
and said he needed someone to lean on.

1398
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:45,141
So I introduced him to Second Marriage.

1399
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:47,060
-But she died.
-They both died.

1400
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,062
One died, and then the other.

1401
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,396
Yet, you introduced another woman to him?

1402
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,024
But his last text said

1403
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,651
he was going to end it.

1404
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:56,402
Which meant he was going to kill her.

1405
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,862
I know nothing about that.

1406
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:00,615
How could you be so oblivious
when it happened twice?

1407
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:02,742
-In that case--
-He's a career con artist too.

1408
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:05,536
Mr. Buddy supplied Cho Yo-sep with women.

1409
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,997
-Exactly.
-After Cho Yo-sep got rid of them,

1410
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:10,708
-they split the insurance payout.
-Then they split the money.

1411
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:14,003
Here's an unexpected side of Mr. Buddy.

1412
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,546
In his lunch boxes,

1413
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:20,593
he's been cherishing notes
sent by a mystery lady.

1414
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:23,846
"Now I understand why the lady
only gave rice to her burly male servant."

1415
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,474
Who made you lunch?

1416
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:28,601
Who else? Just a woman I used to date.

1417
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:31,020
Exactly, and I'd like us all
to figure out who she was.

1418
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:32,897
-Let's find out who she was.
-Yes, please.

1419
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:33,981
Thank you.

1420
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:37,360
I'm not sure if someone like me

1421
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:39,946
should even be speaking
in front of such incredible people.

1422
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,030
Gosh, he's so creepy.

1423
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,324
Let's see how long
you can keep up the act.

1424
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:45,159
So…

1425
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:48,371
Let's take a look at the crime scene.

1426
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:51,499
I was able to piece together a story
of what happened.

1427
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:53,918
The driver was wearing a seat belt,

1428
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:58,381
but Ms. Park So-yun,
who was in the passenger seat, wasn't.

1429
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:00,591
The car's passenger side
was rammed into the guardrail.

1430
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:04,262
But the airbag didn't go off,
and she was thrown out of the windshield,

1431
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:06,681
landing in the Hangang River.

1432
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:08,850
After stepping out of the car,

1433
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:12,437
the culprit made their way down
to the river.

1434
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:16,482
When they reached the river,
they did something.

1435
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,360
And whatever it was,
they returned drenched.

1436
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:20,778
Then, using the emergency hammer,

1437
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:23,030
they smashed the windshield
on the driver's side

1438
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:25,241
to make it look like
they had also been thrown out.

1439
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:28,035
That's why the glass shards
were on the inside.

1440
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:30,455
With the box cutter
found on the passenger seat floor,

1441
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:32,957
they cut their seat belt

1442
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,917
-and tore the airbag.
-They tore it.

1443
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,461
-To stage an accident?
-Yes.

1444
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:37,837
And then,

1445
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,131
judging by the unlocked doors
and the water on the seat,

1446
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:42,216
they went to the back seat to do
something.

1447
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,134
Right.

1448
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:45,511
It had to be staged as an accident

1449
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,555
for the case to be closed
as a simple car accident.

1450
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:49,390
-Right.
-Listen.

1451
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:51,642
Cho Yo-sep got rid of First Marriage
and Second Marriage

1452
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:53,603
by staging accidents like this.

1453
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:55,062
-That's right.
-He killed them.

1454
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:56,689
If that's the case,

1455
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,775
I believe a third party was involved.

1456
01:02:58,858 --> 01:02:59,901
Someone who could've thought

1457
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:02,528
they could take advantage of it
to craft their perfect crime

1458
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,322
and get away with it.

1459
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:06,949
-After that--
-Then where could Cho Yo-sep have gone?

1460
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:08,075
I told you already.

1461
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:11,162
Why else would there be
bloodstains on the front bumper?

1462
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:12,622
-Right.
-Whose blood do you think that is?

1463
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:14,624
Cho Yo-sep's, of course.

1464
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:17,877
He was hit by that car
and killed off somewhere.

1465
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:21,631
And so, I checked Cho Yo-sep's place.

1466
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:23,549
In his garage,

1467
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:27,261
-I found a bunch of license plates.
-That's right.

1468
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:29,639
There was also a ledger.

1469
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:30,723
And for some time,

1470
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:34,185
Cho Yo-sep has been changing
license plates on foreign cars

1471
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:37,939
parked in parking lots near
the Hangang River for extended periods,

1472
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:43,027
then selling them
as unregistered vehicles.

1473
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:44,362
How would you know that?

1474
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:46,113
-There's a ledger.
-What was on it?

1475
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:47,865
-Hold on.
-Yes?

1476
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,700
-Mr. Buddy.
-Yes?

1477
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:53,371
I found similar license plates
at your place as well.

1478
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:55,832
-That's right.
-Oh, please. Come on.

1479
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:58,626
Cho Yo-sep and Jang Buddy
were in on it together.

1480
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:01,546
But at some point,
Cho Yo-sep stopped splitting the profits

1481
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:04,465
and kept all the money for himself.

1482
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:06,717
-See? How am I the bad guy?
-He drove a wedge between them.

1483
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:08,553
-You're just a sucker.
-It doesn't make you a good guy.

1484
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:11,514
Now, let's turn
to the Big Score Community.

1485
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:15,977
Someone with the username "yo_sep"
asked who was in for a big score.

1486
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,688
The laptop's owner, Jang Buddy,

1487
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:19,772
said he wanted in.

1488
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:22,692
What if the big score he had in mind

1489
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:25,778
was about sharing
the life insurance payout

1490
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:30,241
following the deaths of First Marriage
and Second Marriage?

1491
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:33,327
No, there's no need to investigate that.
He meant selling used cars.

1492
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:36,038
So the big score was about
selling used cars?

1493
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:37,707
-Yeah.
-So it wasn't about an insurance scam?

1494
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:41,460
I read a post written by someone
with the username "small_park."

1495
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,963
The Hanja character for "small" is "so."
Isn't that Ms. Park So-yun?

1496
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:46,549
COULD SMALL_PARK, THE USER JANG BUDDY
RESPONDED TO, BE PARK SO-YUN?

1497
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:49,010
I don't know what her username was,

1498
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:52,305
but I did meet So-yun
through the online community.

1499
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,932
-Oh, you did?
-Okay, fine.

1500
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:57,476
You pointed out something important.

1501
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,812
I have no reason to kill Park So-yun.

1502
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:03,107
I had nothing against her.

1503
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:06,736
The people who wanted
So-yun out of the picture

1504
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:08,112
were these two.

1505
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:09,822
-Right?
-Is that so?

1506
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:13,618
I noticed you kept paper cranes
someone gave you.

1507
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,369
I unfolded them

1508
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:17,079
and there were messages written on them.

1509
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:19,707
Such as, "I thought you were upstanding,
but you were far from it."

1510
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,210
"You stole my heart."

1511
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:28,132
They were all more or less crazy nonsense,
but there was one that was notable.

1512
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:34,805
"August 2, 2019, 6 p.m.,

1513
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:37,141
the moment I fell in love"?
It was something like that.

1514
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:38,643
Let's go back to his planner.

1515
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:42,980
The one that had countless notes
about who he was meeting and when.

1516
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:47,193
The last note was made on August 1, 2019.

1517
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:50,071
Did he stop going on dates
after meeting this mystery woman?

1518
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:51,238
Since then,

1519
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:54,033
-there are no records.
-Because he met his last love?

1520
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:57,244
She wasn't my last love.

1521
01:05:58,329 --> 01:05:59,956
She was my first.

1522
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:01,040
-Who was she?
-Okay?

1523
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:02,083
Who was she?

1524
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:03,501
-First Marriage or Second Marriage?
-Who was she?

1525
01:06:03,584 --> 01:06:04,877
You can't say who she is?

1526
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,879
Was she the one
who wrote the notes in lunch boxes?

1527
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,714
It's not that I can't say who she is.

1528
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,800
-It's just that--
-Okay, fine. We'll find out for ourselves.

1529
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:13,344
She's so precious to you
that you can't tell us, huh?

1530
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:16,681
Anyway, that's the deduction I made.

1531
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:19,767
-Stop acting innocent and sit back down.
-You people all scare me.

1532
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:20,851
Unbelievable.

1533
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:22,687
-All right, then.
-Nicely done.

1534
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:25,398
I guess I should reveal
Mr. Neighbor's true identity.

1535
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,733
-Can you hurry? I'm so frustrated.
-It's about time I did.

1536
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,151
What are you talking about?

1537
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:33,239
Mr. Neighbor,
you seem to live a rather eventful life.

1538
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:34,490
Me?

1539
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:35,616
Have you,

1540
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:37,368
at any point,

1541
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:39,537
formed a gang?

1542
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:40,830
No way.

1543
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:41,747
Me?

1544
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,291
There's a note here.

1545
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:47,753
What in the world is this guy's deal?

1546
01:06:49,046 --> 01:06:52,800
It's a photo of five people
who seemed close.

1547
01:06:52,883 --> 01:06:56,095
What's interesting is that
they all had stars on their foreheads.

1548
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:59,223
Each of the five had stars
numbered one through five,

1549
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:00,599
with this man having five!

1550
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:02,977
Mr. Neighbor had five stars
on his forehead,

1551
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:05,604
and he was standing in the middle
looking all cool.

1552
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:08,024
-His hairstyle was different too.
-Somebody get that wig off him.

1553
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:10,192
-Lift that fringe.
-Was he in the Five-Star Gang?

1554
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:12,403
REVEALING FOREHEAD

1555
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:15,740
HE STILL HAS HIS STAR TATTOO

1556
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:17,283
Those weren't just drawn on?

1557
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:18,451
Is it a tattoo?

1558
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:19,785
Oh, for goodness' sake.

1559
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:23,539
This is hilarious.

1560
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,750
I was trying to live a quiet life.

1561
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:27,626
Fine!

1562
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:30,546
Back in the day,

1563
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:31,964
that was the life I led.

1564
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:34,884
But now,

1565
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:37,219
I have nothing to do with my old ways.

1566
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:41,098
I'm just an ordinary man
making an honest living.

1567
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:42,725
I swear!

1568
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:43,976
-But--
-Lord Detective.

1569
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,311
-Yes?
-I swear.

1570
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:47,021
-Are you wearing a wig?
-"Lord" Detective?

1571
01:07:47,104 --> 01:07:48,689
-No, it's my hair.
-What year are you living in?

1572
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:50,399
-Why call him a lord?
-We went back 200 years.

1573
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:53,152
Back in the day,
I used to proudly flash my forehead…

1574
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:56,447
with its glorious five stars,

1575
01:07:57,865 --> 01:07:59,700
but not anymore. I mean it.

1576
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:02,536
Don't tell me you used to
sell stone beds or something.

1577
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,080
You see,

1578
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:06,457
I go by Jang Neighbor now,

1579
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:07,750
but my real name is…

1580
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:10,878
Jang…

1581
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:12,046
Yes?

1582
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:13,339
Stone Bed.

1583
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:19,512
You've got to be kidding me.

1584
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:24,225
Park Kara is way better.

1585
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:28,062
-I've been living an honest life.
-While living an honest life,

1586
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:30,606
you must've lived on the street
at some point.

1587
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:32,108
People rarely read newspapers now,

1588
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:34,652
but you keep newspapers
that could serve as a blanket.

1589
01:08:34,735 --> 01:08:38,739
You have a blanket and all the stuff
homeless people carry around.

1590
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:42,743
Also, Cho Yo-sep
filed a complaint against you.

1591
01:08:43,327 --> 01:08:46,455
He claimed you were the reason
the homeless lurked around the area

1592
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,040
and complained of their stench.

1593
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:50,835
He also claimed
they went through his mail.

1594
01:08:50,918 --> 01:08:52,545
This guy actually broke into his house.

1595
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:55,881
-Yo-sep's place?
-He was caught breaking and entering.

1596
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:59,510
The police summoned you for questioning
on stalking charges and others, no?

1597
01:09:00,052 --> 01:09:03,514
You seem to have
a lot of misunderstandings about me.

1598
01:09:03,597 --> 01:09:05,850
Five, to be precise!

1599
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:08,978
You're just unbelievable.

1600
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:13,357
This is all a misunderstanding.

1601
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,943
Right, sure thing. Anyway, here's this.

1602
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:18,779
I'm not sure if you're the moderator
or a member of this community.

1603
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:20,156
-A community?
-At any rate,

1604
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:22,074
it's called
"Five Viscera and Six Entrails."

1605
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,076
-It speaks for itself, no?
-Five Viscera and Six Entrails?

1606
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,953
-Exactly.
-It's not what you think.

1607
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:27,872
What would he do
with people's fresh organs?

1608
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:30,332
No, please. Don't say things like that.

1609
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:31,458
Here's the gist of it.

1610
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:35,588
Someone would post something like,
"I have someone new. Hit me up."

1611
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,464
The commenters would then say

1612
01:09:37,548 --> 01:09:40,718
they wired 35 million won
or 25 million won.

1613
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:42,845
Those are quite large sums.

1614
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:47,224
It's more or less the amount you'd expect
for the illegal sale of organs.

1615
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,935
Here's more evidence to support my claim.

1616
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:53,272
Eun Smuggler's business card.
I suppose this person's a career smuggler.

1617
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:55,191
How on earth did you find that?

1618
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:58,277
Then there was his calendar.
His business must've gone global.

1619
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:01,780
-It mentioned Russia, Brazil, and others.
-Yeah, "Brazil, three. Russia, five."

1620
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:04,325
It said, "India, three,"
for tomorrow or the day after that.

1621
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:07,953
Has your business gone global?

1622
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:10,581
Here's the truth
about Five Viscera and Six Entrails.

1623
01:10:11,081 --> 01:10:13,209
It's not what you think it is.

1624
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:15,211
It's not connected to organ trading

1625
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:18,047
or any other illegal activities.

1626
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:20,216
-What is it, then?
-Then what's it about?

1627
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:22,176
Five Viscera and Six Entrails

1628
01:10:22,259 --> 01:10:25,596
is a support group for people
who have nowhere else to go.

1629
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:31,101
We encourage and support them
as they discover their dreams

1630
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:34,521
so that they can achieve them.
We're like organs that keep them healthy.

1631
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:35,773
How, exactly?

1632
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:38,984
I would invite homeless people
to my house,

1633
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:41,737
let them shower, and cook them a meal.

1634
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:44,114
-They all have dreams, you know.
-Sure.

1635
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:47,034
If their dream was to be a soccer player,

1636
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:48,953
I'd help them go to Brazil.

1637
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:51,497
Are you kidding me?
As if we'd believe that.

1638
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:52,957
It's true!

1639
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:56,418
If they wanted to pursue ballet,
I'd help them go to Russia.

1640
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,462
But not in one piece, I presume.

1641
01:10:58,545 --> 01:11:00,714
No! It's not like that!

1642
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:04,343
-Unbelievable.
-I'm telling you the truth!

1643
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:09,056
The commenters you mentioned earlier
were kind people supporting our cause.

1644
01:11:09,139 --> 01:11:10,140
Sure.

1645
01:11:10,224 --> 01:11:13,227
And as for the smuggling,
since they're homeless,

1646
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:16,355
some of them aren't recognized as citizens
by the official system anymore.

1647
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:20,234
-Right.
-We still go out of our way

1648
01:11:20,317 --> 01:11:21,443
to support their dreams,

1649
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:24,196
-making all the arrangements
-You expect us to believe that?

1650
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,572
to help them leave the country.

1651
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:28,158
It's true! Please believe me!

1652
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:29,368
I'm telling the truth.

1653
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:32,913
-Do you know whether they're alive or not?
-That's why…

1654
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:34,164
It's true.

1655
01:11:34,248 --> 01:11:37,334
Those who are now ballerinas
and soccer players

1656
01:11:37,418 --> 01:11:40,879
left five-star reviews on our website!

1657
01:11:43,173 --> 01:11:44,174
It's true.

1658
01:11:44,883 --> 01:11:46,218
You have to believe me.

1659
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,387
-I'm--
-Then name one of them.

1660
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:49,972
Tell us how their dream came true.

1661
01:11:50,055 --> 01:11:51,724
You must be in touch with them.

1662
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:52,808
I'll…

1663
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:55,144
show you!

1664
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:56,353
Show us what?

1665
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:57,479
Right here, right now.

1666
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:00,566
For five minutes.

1667
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:05,529
One, two, three, four, five.
For five minutes,

1668
01:12:05,612 --> 01:12:07,072
I'll show you the proof.

1669
01:12:08,198 --> 01:12:09,950
I'll show you, all right?

1670
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:11,660
Please collect yourself.

1671
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:13,954
-Right. Here you go.
-Five Viscera and Six Entrails Community.

1672
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:15,998
I'll show you this
since you don't believe me.

1673
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:19,501
Here's a homeless boy
who went to Russia to pursue ballet

1674
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:20,794
and made it big.

1675
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:23,630
See?

1676
01:12:25,966 --> 01:12:27,217
There's a community chat room.

1677
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:28,594
"Thanks to Jang Neighbor,

1678
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:31,638
I got into
the Moscow Homeless Ballet Company."

1679
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:34,141
-Is this for real?
-What have I been telling you?

1680
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:37,019
Check out this young man who went
to Brazil to become a soccer player.

1681
01:12:37,102 --> 01:12:39,646
Is the online community
really just a support group?

1682
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:42,566
-That's what I've been telling you!
-Supporting the homeless and their dreams?

1683
01:12:42,649 --> 01:12:45,402
Yes, it is!
Why else would I be so frustrated?

1684
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:47,988
All right, fine.
Let's applaud him and move on.

1685
01:12:48,072 --> 01:12:49,865
-All right.
-Thank you.

1686
01:12:49,948 --> 01:12:51,867
However, there's more.

1687
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:54,370
-I'm not done.
-What?

1688
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:55,871
I looked through your closet,

1689
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:58,832
and I found women's clothes.

1690
01:12:59,416 --> 01:13:01,377
Expensive clothes, I might add.

1691
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,087
Jhanel.

1692
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:04,505
Noncler.

1693
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:07,466
-The tags were still on.
-That's right.

1694
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:09,426
I found credit card receipts

1695
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:12,012
in the pockets of those clothes,

1696
01:13:12,596 --> 01:13:14,348
-and they were signed by So-yun.
-Was he stalking her?

1697
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:16,892
He must've stolen them from her
while stalking her.

1698
01:13:16,975 --> 01:13:21,105
The lady next door
seemed to shop rather excessively.

1699
01:13:21,188 --> 01:13:24,274
She would throw out tons of clothes
that were in perfect condition.

1700
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:28,237
So I'd always collect them
from the clothing donation bin,

1701
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,198
thinking they'd be of use to the homeless.

1702
01:13:31,281 --> 01:13:32,783
-They still had tags on them.
-I know!

1703
01:13:32,866 --> 01:13:34,910
And she threw them out?
Clothes from Jhanel?

1704
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:36,829
-Clothes from Noncler?
-That's crazy.

1705
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:40,833
-It's true! I'm not one to lie.
-Okay, settle down.

1706
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:42,459
How much of this should we believe?

1707
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:44,211
-It's all true.
-How does that make sense?

1708
01:13:44,294 --> 01:13:48,132
Because the couple complained
about the homeless visiting my place,

1709
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:50,634
I kept an eye on them whenever I could

1710
01:13:50,717 --> 01:13:52,594
to keep the noise down
if they were around.

1711
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:55,222
But they took photos
and assumed the worst.

1712
01:13:55,305 --> 01:13:58,308
My house and Ms. So-yun's house

1713
01:13:58,392 --> 01:14:00,310
-look identical from the outside.
-That's right.

1714
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:03,188
A homeless person staying at my place

1715
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:06,733
accidentally went into Ms. So-yun's house.

1716
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,486
-A homeless person?
-Yes, I got so startled,

1717
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:13,157
and I went in after my guest
to get them to leave with me.

1718
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:16,618
But Ms. So-yun saw us,
freaked out, and called the cops.

1719
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:19,997
Oh, so that's why
you were mistaken for a stalker?

1720
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,290
That's right.

1721
01:14:21,373 --> 01:14:22,958
I'd believe you if it weren't for this.

1722
01:14:23,041 --> 01:14:25,919
I know. I'm having it removed though.
It hurts like crazy.

1723
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:28,172
-You're in the process of removing it.
-Yes.

1724
01:14:28,755 --> 01:14:30,591
He turned out to be nicer than I expected.

1725
01:14:30,674 --> 01:14:33,469
And we'd have to trust him, right?

1726
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:35,429
What's important right now

1727
01:14:35,512 --> 01:14:40,184
is that you have to vote for someone
who you believe to be the culprit.

1728
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:41,602
-Already?
-Yes.

1729
01:14:41,685 --> 01:14:42,978
But I'm so confused right now.

1730
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:46,940
What I know for certain is that the driver

1731
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:48,400
wasn't Cho Yo-sep.

1732
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:51,195
The killer drove the car.

1733
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:52,988
The bloodstains on the front bumper

1734
01:14:53,071 --> 01:14:55,741
suggest someone other than Park So-yun
was run over.

1735
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:57,201
It had to be Cho Yo-sep.

1736
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:59,912
In any case, the accident

1737
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:02,206
was staged to deceive all others,

1738
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:05,250
making it look like Cho Yo-sep
was the one driving.

1739
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:09,963
Only then will the police close the case
as another insurance scam by Cho Yo-sep.

1740
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:13,175
So, whoever staged this crime scene

1741
01:15:13,258 --> 01:15:16,303
had to have known that Cho Yo-sep

1742
01:15:16,386 --> 01:15:18,722
was killing his wives in fake accidents

1743
01:15:18,805 --> 01:15:21,350
for the insurance payouts.

1744
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:25,187
Judging by what I've learned so far…

1745
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:26,355
I have a hunch.

1746
01:15:26,438 --> 01:15:29,233
My first vote of the day goes to…

1747
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:31,235
WHO DOES KIM DETECTIVE
CURRENTLY THINK THE CULPRIT IS?

1748
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:33,195
-Who did he vote for?
-Yeah!

1749
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:35,822
-Who did he vote for?
-Yeah!

1750
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:38,992
Right, Jang Buddy.

1751
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:40,077
He does seem suspicious.

1752
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:41,328
KIM DETECTIVE CHOSE JANG BUDDY

1753
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:44,122
What does this case
have to do with the insurance scam?

1754
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:45,791
You people frustrate me.

1755
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:50,504
Mr. Billionaire, you come second
on my list of prime suspects.

1756
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:53,131
Mr. Billionaire

1757
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:57,636
also knew about Cho Yo-sep's past
to a certain extent.

1758
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:00,430
He knew Cho Yo-sep had collected
life insurance payouts.

1759
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:02,933
Well, as for now,

1760
01:16:03,016 --> 01:16:07,271
I think it's highly likely
that it's Cho Yo-sep's blood

1761
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:09,898
on the front bumper of the car.

1762
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:14,278
But we need to find out where he is
and whether he's dead or alive.

1763
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:18,490
This is by far the toughest case
we've faced so far.

1764
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:19,741
All right, then.

1765
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:22,536
Let's go figure out who did it!

1766
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:23,662
Let's go.

1767
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:25,831
Detective, you need to do better
this time around.

1768
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:28,041
-Guys, just trust me.
-I don't think I can trust that detective.

1769
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:29,501
THE SCENE OF THE CRIME
WILL REVEAL THE CULPRIT

1770
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,420
Detective, why don't we verify
Neighbor's story first?

1771
01:16:31,503 --> 01:16:32,796
He's so fishy.

1772
01:16:32,879 --> 01:16:35,382
-It's one or the other with him.
-What about me?

1773
01:16:35,465 --> 01:16:38,552
He's either the killer
or a complete nutjob.

1774
01:16:38,635 --> 01:16:41,763
First of all, I want to highlight
the importance of phones.

1775
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:43,223
-That's right.
-Earlier,

1776
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:46,184
whose phones did we find
apart from Mr. Billionaire's?

1777
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:47,144
(MINE)

1778
01:16:47,227 --> 01:16:51,773
Let's take the time to check the phones
belonging to the other suspects.

1779
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:53,692
-What did he say?
-"Give us your phone."

1780
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:56,737
-We should see what's inside Hubby.
-No way!

1781
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:59,573
-Shouldn't we cut it open?
-We should cut it open.

1782
01:16:59,656 --> 01:17:01,950
All right. Let's gather here.

1783
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:04,745
-We'll check while we're together.
-Let's check the phones.

1784
01:17:04,828 --> 01:17:06,496
-Whose is this?
-Mine.

1785
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:08,373
Oh jeez. Look at that photo.

1786
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:09,625
-They're my homeless friends.
-Wait.

1787
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:13,128
"My saviors.
I'll dedicate my life to them."

1788
01:17:13,211 --> 01:17:16,131
This could have a double meaning.
We need to be smart.

1789
01:17:16,214 --> 01:17:17,549
Wait, there's a text.

1790
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:21,178
"I'm so glad to be reunited
with the people who saved me."

1791
01:17:21,261 --> 01:17:22,971
-What's this?
-They were reunited?

1792
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:25,057
Can I share a theory of mine?

1793
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:26,642
Sure, go ahead.

1794
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:28,685
Have you ever seen movies

1795
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:32,314
where they use chickens to smuggle drugs?

1796
01:17:32,397 --> 01:17:34,858
Exactly. He sends people
to Russia and such.

1797
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:36,902
-Those people
-He hid something in their bodies?

1798
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:39,112
-are drug mules.
-Oh, please.

1799
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:41,782
-Come on. It's nothing like that.
-What else is there?

1800
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:46,036
His call log shows he talked to the
Hangang Bridge Water Rescue Team.

1801
01:17:46,119 --> 01:17:47,663
-That's today.
-Today.

1802
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:49,790
-Why did you talk to them?
-What was the call about?

1803
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:52,584
I just called them.

1804
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:54,795
-Who calls them without a reason?
-It's the Water Rescue Team.

1805
01:17:54,878 --> 01:17:56,713
-Did you need rescuing?
-No, I didn't.

1806
01:17:56,797 --> 01:18:01,218
There must've been a reason.
This was also right before the incident.

1807
01:18:01,301 --> 01:18:04,346
Fine, I called them, okay?

1808
01:18:04,888 --> 01:18:07,724
I asked to speak to Cho Yo-sep.

1809
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:08,809
-Why?
-For what?

1810
01:18:08,892 --> 01:18:11,144
-Why?
-I had something to tell him.

1811
01:18:11,228 --> 01:18:12,688
At 2:39 a.m.?

1812
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:14,356
Many people jump off the Hangang Bridge

1813
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:16,983
-to commit suicide.
-That's true.

1814
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:18,944
Jang Neighbor's the only one

1815
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:21,988
who can save those people
before the Water Rescue Team arrives.

1816
01:18:22,072 --> 01:18:23,907
By cruising around on his water taxi,

1817
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:27,953
he can easily collect drowned victims
to sell their organs on the black market.

1818
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:30,122
So, he didn't transport people
but collected bodies instead.

1819
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:31,623
He could be recovering corpses.

1820
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:32,999
Jeez. I said that wasn't it.

1821
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:34,793
He's out there fishing for bodies.

1822
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:36,837
Whose phone is this?

1823
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,422
Whose phone is this?

1824
01:18:38,505 --> 01:18:40,674
Whoever it was
called Park So-yun multiple times.

1825
01:18:40,757 --> 01:18:41,591
Whose is this?

1826
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:42,509
Isn't it…

1827
01:18:42,592 --> 01:18:44,469
-Buddy's, right?
-Buddy's.

1828
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,096
There are multiple phone calls.

1829
01:18:46,179 --> 01:18:49,015
-They even talked yesterday.
-Yesterday at 4:30 p.m.

1830
01:18:49,099 --> 01:18:50,767
-"Incoming call, Park So-yun."
-From Park So-yun.

1831
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:54,271
-She called him.
-What reason did she have for calling you?

1832
01:18:54,354 --> 01:18:56,356
She wanted out.

1833
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:57,899
She wanted out of the marriage.

1834
01:18:57,983 --> 01:18:59,943
Look at this.
"I'm running away. You deal with it."

1835
01:19:00,026 --> 01:19:02,195
-On Sunday, March 28th, at 4:49 p.m.
-I told her to bear with it.

1836
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:04,114
He knew she was planning to run away.

1837
01:19:04,197 --> 01:19:06,199
Jang Buddy knew Park So-yun

1838
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:09,327
was about to pack up and leave in a car.

1839
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:11,580
It's suspicious for sure.
Can we check his Agucci purse?

1840
01:19:11,663 --> 01:19:13,582
-Give me this!
-Let's see what's inside.

1841
01:19:13,665 --> 01:19:15,792
Come on, you're jumping the gun.

1842
01:19:16,501 --> 01:19:17,753
-What's that?
-What's in there?

1843
01:19:17,836 --> 01:19:19,087
A letter?

1844
01:19:19,963 --> 01:19:21,757
Wait, hang on.

1845
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,133
-Is there anything else?
-No.

1846
01:19:24,384 --> 01:19:26,386
The letter. That's most important.

1847
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:27,846
Are you kidding me? Look at this.

1848
01:19:28,805 --> 01:19:30,432
Are you kidding me? Look at this.

1849
01:19:31,641 --> 01:19:33,351
What the heck?

1850
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:34,436
Whose…

1851
01:19:34,936 --> 01:19:36,813
-That's the smoking gun.
-Whose…

1852
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:38,899
Whose sonogram is this?

1853
01:19:38,982 --> 01:19:40,734
Oh my gosh. Guys, don't be shocked.

1854
01:19:40,817 --> 01:19:42,235
I'll read this, so brace yourselves.

1855
01:19:43,403 --> 01:19:45,864
"To symbolize the time we spent together,

1856
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:47,574
I gift you this watch."

1857
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:51,369
"October 3, 2020."

1858
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:53,497
You remember what happened then, right?

1859
01:19:54,539 --> 01:19:55,540
"Yours…

1860
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:56,708
