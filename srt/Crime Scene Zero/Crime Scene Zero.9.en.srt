00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,035
My babies.

12
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:22,874
Guess I'm the first one here.

00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,709
CASINO HEOYOUNG LAND
5TH FLOOR, VVIP GAMING ROOM

14
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,086
When will the others get here?

15
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:29,047
They shouldn't keep
a VVIP waiting like this.

16
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,009
AN JEWELER
VVIP OF HEOYOUNG LAND

17
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,053
My makeup looks amazing today.

18
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,932
I could easily pass
for someone in their twenties.

19
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,311
Hello.

20
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:44,771
Hey.

21
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,065
What brings you here, Singer?

22
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,275
This is hardly your scene.

23
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,985
Tell me about it.

24
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,320
KIM SINGER
RESIDENT SINGER AT HEOYOUNG LAND

25
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,489
Isn't this place only meant for VVIPs?

26
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,954
IS HE AN ACTUAL VVIP?

27
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:03,748
Hello.

28
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,086
I've never been up here before.

29
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,337
JANG CHEF
CHEF AT HEOYOUNG LAND

30
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,297
-You must be a chef.
-I am.

31
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,800
So why are we gathered here?

32
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,888
I hope luck's on my side
with the cards today.

33
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,308
Looks like the players are here already.

34
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,893
It's a real pleasure to meet you.

35
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,937
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

36
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,940
JANG MONKFISH
HOUSE PLAYER AT HEOYOUNG LAND

37
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,608
This sure is awkward.

38
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:34,154
All the players are here,
so where's the dealer?

39
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,200
Wait, isn't that the mayor?

40
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:43,371
-Ms. Mayor, what brings you here?
-Ms. Mayor.

41
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,581
Hello, all.

42
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,708
Ms. Mayor, have you been well?

43
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,418
JEON MAYOR
MAYOR OF HEOYOUNG SPECIAL CITY

44
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,296
-What a surprise.
-I hope you've been well, Ms. Jeweler.

45
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,214
Goodness, Ms. Mayor.

46
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,341
AND YOU ARE…?

47
00:02:56,634 --> 00:03:00,305
-I didn't know the mayor would be here.
-This is a huge event, after all.

48
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:04,392
Even Ms. Mayor is here with us,
so this is a VVIP event for sure.

49
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,395
Oh jeez.

50
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,482
-Are you kidding me?
-Oh dear.

51
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,068
-Who coughs like that around people?
-That's a heavy cough.

52
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:19,199
Anyway, where's Bong-cheon?

53
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,534
Tell me about it.
Shouldn't he be here greeting his guests?

54
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,119
-He should be here by now.
-Bong-cheon…

55
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,579
SOMEONE HAS YET TO ARRIVE?

56
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:27,040
-Try calling him if you have his number.
-What's taking him so long?

57
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,250
-Hold on. I have his number.
-Please.

58
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,878
It's not like the big boss
to be running late.

59
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:32,795
Give me a second.

60
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:37,383
Could he have planned
something big for us?

61
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,094
TRYING TO REACH HIM ON HIS PHONE

62
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,056
He must be around here.

63
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,393
-Where?
-The ringtone's coming from behind there.

64
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,770
BEHIND THE CURTAINS?

65
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:49,979
Could he be on stage?

66
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,524
He must've planned
a surprise performance for us.

67
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,527
-He shouldn't have.
-Why hasn't he stepped out?

68
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,029
This is his number.

69
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:08,957
-Oh my!
-Oh gosh!

70
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,501
Bong-cheon!

71
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,503
What the hell?

72
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,046
What the heck?

73
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,096
What the heck is this?

74
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,889
-Blood!
-Oh my!

75
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,809
That's… That's the boss!

76
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:33,231
MURDER OF THE CASINO BOSS I

77
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:50,248
CRIME SCENE ZERO

78
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:53,710
-Oh my!
-Oh gosh!

79
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,129
Bong-cheon!

80
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,756
What the hell?

81
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,924
What the heck?

82
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,509
-What…
-Is that blood?

83
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,803
-What's going on?
-Is this part of a show?

84
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,138
-Boss?
-Bong-cheon?

85
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,889
CHAIRMAN KIM BONG-CHEON
FOUND DEAD ON STAGE

86
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,600
-Bong-cheon, are you all right?
-What the heck is this?

87
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,436
-Blood!
-Oh my!

88
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:12,937
What the hell?

89
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:14,439
Oh goodness.

90
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,358
Boss?

91
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,443
My heart's racing.

92
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:21,029
-What the heck is going on?
-What in the world…

93
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,323
-This is no way to treat a guest.
-What's going on?

94
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,243
My heart's racing.

95
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,370
-What's going on?
-Oh gosh.

96
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,790
-What in the world happened?
-I should go. I should leave.

97
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,500
IS SHE ATTEMPTING TO FLEE THE SCENE?

98
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,836
Not so fast.
Where do you think you're going?

99
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,046
LEAD INVESTIGATOR ON THE FIFTH CASE
PARK DETECTIVE

100
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,006
-Stop right there.
-I need to use the bathroom.

101
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,382
No, you're coming with me.

102
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,428
Please step back, everyone.
This is a crime scene.

103
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,679
Hands off.

104
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,805
First of all,

105
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:51,517
don't even think about leaving the scene
or getting too close to the body.

106
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,395
This is now a murder scene.

107
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,521
A murder?

108
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,398
What do you mean he was murdered?

109
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,192
As of this moment,

110
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:03,363
the five of you are considered suspects.

111
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,531
-What are you talking about?
-Are you kidding me?

112
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:09,160
-This is no way to treat us.
-I don't usually come to places like this.

113
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:14,457
You'll soon understand
why you're under suspicion.

114
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,793
Please step off the stage
and wait outside.

115
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,336
Step away and off the stage.

116
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,964
-Why would I bother to kill someone?
-I'm a busy woman.

117
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,884
I can't believe it.
So much for scoring big today.

118
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,136
Let me see.

119
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,014
Was he shot?

120
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:35,269
Those are clearly gunshot wounds.
One in the head, one in the shoulder.

121
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,314
The victim likely died instantly,
and there are no signs of struggle.

122
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,858
But his lips…

123
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:48,699
By the looks of it, this feels like
a murder designed for display.

124
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,619
Here he is in the center of the stage
in the VVIP gaming room.

125
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,204
-Detective.
-Oh, hey.

126
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,957
Hello, I'm Kang Minhee,
the assistant detective.

127
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,792
-Are you the AD?
-Yes, ma'am.

128
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,669
You come highly recommended.

129
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,671
-I'm honored to be working with you.
-Sure.

130
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,548
Do you have the case file for me?

131
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,049
I have the files on the victim

132
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,135
-and the five suspects.
-Good.

133
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,095
I hear it's your last day at work today.

134
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,055
-That's right.
-You must be sad.

135
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,976
Let's start with the victim, shall we?

136
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,353
The victim is Kim Bong-cheon,

137
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,980
a 60-year-old male.

138
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:22,191
Chairman of Heoyoung Land,
the largest casino in Asia.

139
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,277
Known as the big boss
of the casino industry.

140
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,779
His body was discovered
on stage in the VVIP game room,

141
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:30,950
where a celebratory event had been planned
to mark the casino's first anniversary.

142
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,119
The cause of death
was a gunshot to the head,

143
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:37,540
and the estimated time of death
is between 10 p.m. and midnight yesterday.

144
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,625
That would mean

145
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:44,005
his body was here for nearly 24 hours.

146
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:47,592
He was killed
at the casino's first anniversary event,

147
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:51,220
the grandest celebration of his career,

148
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,014
and displayed for all others to see.

149
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,476
Let's begin.

150
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:02,273

00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:41,187
of Chairman Kim Bong-cheon's murder.

168
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,649
First, tell me how you came to be here.
You all arrived here before me.

169
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,068
As you all know,

170
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,737
a VVIP game was scheduled for today.

171
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,031
Today's game was going to be huge.

172
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,950
-Seriously.
-How did the rest of you end up here?

173
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,077
Bong-cheon invited me.

174
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,245
Were you two close?

175
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,455
All right, let's leave it there for now.

176
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,958
I'm not here to gamble or anything.

177
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,793
I also received an invitation.

178
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,837
I received an invitation as well.

179
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:10,341
I'm just a guy
doing my thing in the kitchen,

180
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,385
so I don't understand
why I was invited here.

181
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,302
It is rather odd.

182
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,806
They're not the usual players
I go up against.

183
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,684
Then, please kindly introduce yourselves

184
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,478
and briefly describe
your relationship to the deceased.

185
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,313
Ms. Mayor, let's start with you.

186
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,857
As you all know, I'm Jeon Mayor,

187
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,609
mayor of Heoyoung Special City.

188
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,777
-Right.
-You all know me, don't you?

189
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,948
Isn't your father Mayor Jeon Four Terms?

190
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,660
-Am I right?
-Everyone from around here knows them.

191
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,037
You and your father
are known as quite the political duo.

192
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,456
You see, Heoyoung Land Casino

193
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,335
plays a vital role
in Heoyoung Special City

194
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:51,048
by attracting tourists
and boosting the local economy.

195
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,384
Mr. Kim Bong-cheon,
who invited me to the event,

196
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,886
was special to me.

197
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,140
So your partnership with him
was purely for the city's development?

198
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,600
-That's right.
-I see.

199
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,059
What about his so-called friend?

200
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:06,314
I'm An Jeweler, owner of a jewelry arcade.

201
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,483
I guess Bong-cheon and I were close.

202
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,485
Whenever he asked for a favor,
I never turned him down.

203
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,404
That's the kind of relationship we had.

204
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,740
You're not exactly on the younger side.

205
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,575
How long have you two
been on a first-name basis?

206
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,201
I know I don't look like it.

207
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,120
-What do you mean?
-I was actually born in 1969.

208
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,038
What?

209
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,540
People do say
I look like I'm in my twenties.

210
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,377
Anyway, whenever he asked for a favor,
you never turned him down.

211
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,046
Okay, that'll be all for now.

212
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,464
Mr. Jang Chef?

213
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:35,926
I'm the dedicated VVIP chef
at Heoyoung Land,

214
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,888
personally recruited by the big boss.

215
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,306
-"The big boss"?
-That's right.

216
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,391
You call him "the big boss"?

217
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,935
He's the best in Korea, isn't he?

218
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,481
-Is that so?
-The best in the casino business.

219
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,941
-So you cook for VVIP clients?
-Right.

220
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,277
I exclusively cook for VVIP clients.

221
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,654
Did you receive any Michelin Stars?

222
00:10:55,655 --> 00:11:00,368
Those who have an exquisite palate
don't care about things like that.

223
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,119
Have you ever been on Culinary Class Wars?

224
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:06,123
You see, chefs on my level…

225
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,876
-don't enter competitions like that.
-All right.

226
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,587
Are you saying
Culinary Class Wars is beneath you?

227
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,757
The show's not up to your level, is it?

228
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,843
Exactly. I honestly can't see
the appeal of such shows.

229
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,553
You must not understand
the producer either, then.

230
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,888
That's right.

231
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,265
You think the show
is only for untalented cooks. Got it.

232
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,767
Can you handle what you just said?

233
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,061
All right, we hear you.

234
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:31,565
Kim Singer, are you also employed
by the casino like Mr. Chef?

235
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,194
-Yes, I'm Kim Singer.
-Right, we know that.

236
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,947
Why have you been coughing?
Do you have the flu?

237
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,158
I've been singing so much lately

238
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,078
that it has strained my throat.

239
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,746
Are you employed by the casino?

240
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,207
Yes, I'm the resident singer here

241
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,253
and have recently been performing
for VVIPs and VIPs.

242
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,130
The VVIP clients

243
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,257
-absolutely adore Kim Singer.
-Is he that good?

244
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,260
Once he begins his performance,

245
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,345
everyone shouts, "Time to go all-in!"

246
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,139
That's the power his songs have.

247
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,433
All-in

248
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,644
All-in

249
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,105
Time to go all-in!

250
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,482
Players like us

251
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,776
can't resist going all-in.

252
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,278
Are you a player yourself?

253
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,780
I'm Jang Monkfish,

254
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:24,452
the professional gambler and house player

255
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,619
employed by Heoyoung Land.

256
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,789
How did you get that scar on your face?

257
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,166
Oh, this?

258
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,542
Do you have a sketchy past?

259
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:36,297
Everyone collects a scar or two
as they go through life, don't they?

260
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,590
Were you caught cheating?

261
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,176
As if that would fly in this day and age.

262
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,261
You were bottom dealing, weren't you?

263
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,763
I see your hand is still intact.

264
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,057
Doesn't that tell you something?

265
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,518
I'm not who you think I am.

266
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:55,232
I thought it my duty to support
the boss and his casino with my skills,

267
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,817
and that's what I've done so far.

268
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,319
Noted for now.

269
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:03,157
First, I need to gather your alibis
during the estimated time of death,

270
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,619
but the body wasn't discovered
for quite some time.

271
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,871
He appears to have been
murdered last night

272
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,916
-between 10 p.m. and midnight.
-At 10 p.m.?

273
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:15,377
His body went undiscovered
for almost a day,

274
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:19,215
so let me ask
what you were doing last night.

275
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,174
Ms. Mayor?

276
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:22,218
I had a very busy day

277
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,637
and stayed late working at the office.

278
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,847
Have you been working late these days?

279
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,349
Yes, state affairs are no joke.

280
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,811
-Mr. Singer?
-I returned to my room at around 9:20 p.m.

281
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,356
-I took my meds and had an early night.
-Right.

282
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,525
Mr. Chef,
wouldn't you be off work by then?

283
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,653
That's right.
I was in my room after clocking out.

284
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,530
Ms. Jeweler, where were you?

285
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,490
I was at the table on the third floor.

286
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:47,284
You were playing at the VIP table.

287
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,452
Mr. Monkfish?

288
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,747
I played at the table
until 10:10 p.m. or so,

289
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,332
then went to my room.

290
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,668
Your timelines overlap.
Did you two see each other?

291
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,129
I'm not sure. Did you happen to see me?

292
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,174
Of course.

293
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,594
-You saw me?
-You stayed at the table until 10:10 p.m.

294
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,054
I don't remember seeing you.

295
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,642
-The game can demand all your focus.
-That's understandable.

296
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:16,313
That means An Jeweler's alibi is confirmed
at least until 10:10 p.m.,

297
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,983
but no one saw Monkfish.

298
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,860
Okay, that'll be all for now.

299
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,779
Someone is obviously lying,

300
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,491
and the crime scene will have traces
left behind by the killer.

301
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:31,412
You need to find the evidence,
prove your theory,

302
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,414
and identify the killer

303
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,791
for us to part ways on good terms.

304
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,544
Should we get going, then?

305
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,004
Let's spread out.

306
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,673
-I'm still in shock.
-I'm seriously offended.

307

How long have you been a chef?

323
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,591
I believe I was born gifted.

324
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,551
TEAM 2: JANG MONKFISH & KIM SINGER

325
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,552
What is this all about, boss?

326
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,679
I honestly don't have the time for this.

327
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,598
-I know. Should we examine the body first?
-Sure.

328
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,099
EXAMINING THE BODY FIRST

329
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,227
How did the boss end up this way?

330
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,480
How could something like this happen?

331
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,858
-Why is he on the stage?
-Was he a born showman?

332
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,653
He's in the spotlight too.

333
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,781
Did he enjoy being on stage?

334
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,160
Wait, doesn't this remind you
of Money Heist?

335
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,495
MONEY HEIST?

336
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,663
Or House of Cards, perhaps?

337
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,373
A TOWER MADE WITH CARDS
(AKA HOUSE OF CARDS)

338
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,293
-Was he shot to death?
-What? He was shot?

339
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,046
Doesn't that injury on his forehead
look like a gunshot wound?

340
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,673
He was shot twice.

341
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,633
On his shoulder and on his forehead.

342
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,636
The shooter was probably
facing him, right?

343
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,430
He had to be shot from the front to…
Oh dear.

344
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,599
The larger exit wound confirms that.

345
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,727
Shouldn't the bullets
be somewhere around here?

346
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,688
They should, since they went through him.

347
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,023
What do you think that means?

348
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,275
Did he wear lipstick?

349
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,112
No, definitely not.
This isn't like him at all.

350
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,906
Could it have been a kiss of death
sealed with pursed lips?

351
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,785
Why would anyone kiss him
after shooting him twice?

352
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:35,995
As a way to say goodbye.

353
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:36,954
A GOODBYE KISS LEFT BY THE CULPRIT?

354
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,580
What's this?

355
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,833
Why is his belly swollen?
Could it be fluid?

356
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,711
-Oh dear.
-Check his pockets.

357
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,546
I found a phone.

358
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,589
KIM BONG-CHEON'S PHONE

359
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,425
Who's "Rude Little Bastard"?

360
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,510
-"Rude Little Bastard."
-"Rude Little Bastard"?

361
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,721
He talked to Rude Little Bastard
on his phone.

362
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,347
Let's see his messenger app.

363
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,182
-"Rude Little Bastard"?
-"Rude Little Bastard"?

364
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,600
Check this out, Ms. Mayor.

365
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,102
RUDE LITTLE BASTARD

366
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,521
"I already looked into it.
What do you know? Just do as I say."

367
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,899
(WHAT?)

368
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,110
"Is everything on track
for the casino's grand opening?"

369
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,487
"The vault…"
"Okay, but I may not have the time."

370
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,199
"The truth behind the Jeons."

371
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,202
Isn't this about you?

372
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,376
-Jeon is a common surname in Korea.
-Ms. Mayor. "The truth behind the Jeons."

373
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,003
What else is there besides the messages?

374
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,963
-He also texted Kim Secretary.
-What does it say?

375
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,673
"You can head home for the day."

376
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,635
Hold on. "Chump"?

377
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,222
-Oh, this…
-Who's An Chump?

378
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,348
-Hold on.
-I don't know.

379
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,184
-An Jeweler, isn't your surname also An?
-I have no idea.

380
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,351
Beats me.

381
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:42,853
"An Chump."

382
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,856
TEXTS EXCHANGED WITH AN CHUMP

383
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,942
"Bong-cheon, you know Chairman Cheon
of Heaven Sent Group, right?"

384
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:52,946
"I'll be there with him soon,
so please have my usual table ready."

385
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,615
She was a regular.

386
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,950
She was a chump for sure.

387
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,077
JANG MONKFISH

388
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,661
"The chump will be here."

389
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,705
"Sure. You can count on me as always."

390
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,040
He also texted Jang Chef.

391
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,918
"Tomorrow's the first anniversary,
so prepare a special meal."

392
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,669
"Of course.
I'll prepare something extra special."

393
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,213
Wait, extra special?

394
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,673
AN EXTRA SPECIAL DISH?

395
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,218
BACKSTAGE

396
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,097
-Detective.
-Yes?

397
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,809
There's a gas leak detector over here.

398
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:26,021
And this instruction card
was given to the cleaning crew.

399
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,981
"Cleaning Regulations."

400
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,276
"Carcasses are often found
on the hill behind the casino."

401
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,070
"During the summer,
the gases from decomposition

402
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,864
can cause them to burst,
so dispose of them immediately."

403
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,076
That's an odd instruction
for the cleaning crew.

404
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:40,994
VVIP GAMING ROOM

405
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,247
Gosh, silly me.
I should check their phones.

406
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,834
The event today
was exclusive to VVIP clients,

407
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,293
and to be completely honest,

408
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,547
only Jeon Mayor and I
are worthy enough to be invited.

409
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,134
I want to know if Bong-cheon
had actually invited the rest.

410
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,053
Who do you belong to?

411
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,098
Kim Singer, huh? Yeah, you are suspicious.

412
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,308
"J Mail."

413
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,228
It's the same invitation I received.

414
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,772
THE ATTACHED IS
A CASH-REDEEMABLE CHIP EXCHANGE COUPON…

415
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,359
Jang Monkfish

416
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:16,446
and An Jeweler were invited as well,

417
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,865
just like me.

418
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,700
"V-notebot"?

419
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:20,617
(KIM SINGER'S PHONE)

420
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:22,744
What's this?

421
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,621
AI-GENERATED SUMMARY OF RECORDED CALL

422
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,457
"I won't renew my contract
with Heoyoung Land."

423
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,210
"I'm leaving for Las Vegas
to realize my dream of performing there."

424
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,380
COME ON, DON'T BE LIKE THIS
I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME

425
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,798
Why couldn't he wait another week?

426
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,133
…ONLY FOR ANOTHER WEEK, UNTIL THE 8TH

427
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,428
HEOYOUNG LAND STAFF QUARTERS

428
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,764
Those who live at the casino

429
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,350
are Jang Monkfish,
Jang Chef, and Kim Singer.

430
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:46,935
KIM SINGER'S ROOM

431
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,645
Kim Singer, let's check you out.

432
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,024
Las Vegas, huh?

433
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,943
So you want to perform in the US.

434
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,156
What's this?

435
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,534
Are these gifts from fans?
The mic has his name on it.

436
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,498
Who are these from? Are they fan letters?

437
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,585
"Singer, you drive me crazy
with your all-in howl."

438
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:17,132
"You have the voice of an angel.
You're meant for a bigger stage."

439
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,426
"From Hwang Wife."

440
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,053
Looks like he has some fans.

441
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,514
What's in the drawer?

442
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,183
Oh, it's the restaurant ledger.

443
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,062
"Mackerel."

444
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,438
"Income and expenses."

445
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,690
"Wholesale market,
Jang Monkfish Fisheries"?

446
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,651
He must've worked at a fish market.

447
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:38,946
SINGSINGER FISH BAEKBAN

448
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,530
This is Singer from back in the day.

449
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,699
"My dear Singer,
you have the voice of a nightingale."

450
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,243
"Who could you have taken after?"

451
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,162
This must be a family photo.

452
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,872
KIM SINGER'S FAMILY PHOTO

453
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,166

"Ji Entertainment."

456
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:59,716
"You can be the next Jo Sung-mo.
All it takes is 50 million won."

457
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,137
There's a bankbook. This can be important.

458
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,806
Let's take a look.

459
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,141
KIM SINGER'S BANKBOOK

460
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,102
"Boom Boom Karaoke,

461
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,812
Anything and Everything…"

462
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:15,857
He worked hard to earn money
and sent it to Penniless Entertainment.

463
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,902
What's this?

464
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,989
"Dong Fertilizer, Secretive Chemicals,

465
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,657
Secret Agriculture, FR. Tilizer Chemical."

466
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,867
SUSPICIOUS BUSINESS CARDS?

467
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,327
What are these companies?

468
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,042
"Gazi Adult Nightclub."

469
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,877
He used to perform
at a place called Gazi Nightclub?

470
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,087
KING OF THE CATTLE-HERDING HOWL
KIM SINGER

471
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,131
Aren't I too old
to be snooping around someone's room?

472
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,383
A DOCUMENT ENVELOPE INSIDE THE DESK DRAWER

473
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,635

"Must provide singing services
all year round."

476
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,894
Let's check the trash can.

477
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:53,979
Oh, there's something in here.

478
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,566
"If you get caught,
I'll put a hole in you."

479
00:21:58,608 --> 00:21:59,818
Wait, is that a gun?

480
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,486
Was he being threatened by someone?

481
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,991
I should check his laptop next.

482
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,201
KIM SINGER'S LAPTOP

483
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,912
"Messages."

484
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,040
From La Vega. "Singer, I was disappointed

485
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:16,543
to hear from your agency
that you won't be auditioning."

486
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,338
(A PHOTO ATTACHMENT?)

487
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,467
A talent scout from Las Vegas.

488
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,968
EMAIL SCREENSHOT
BETWEEN LA VEGA AND KIM BONG-CHEON

489
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,679
"No, he won't be auditioning."

490
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,891
Let's go check Jang Chef's room.

491
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,809
JANG CHEF'S ROOM

492
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,646
"Staff appreciation card."

493
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,319
"Premium casino, premium meat."

494
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,112
"Umm, sexy food."

495
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,115
He must be quite the chef
to earn so many compliments.

496
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,285
What's this? Isn't this a yoga mat?

497
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,038
This is used during meditation.

498
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,750
MEDITATION ACCESSORIES?

499
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,085
"On Fleek Meditation Center."

500
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,169
A MEDITATION CENTER PAMPHLET

501
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,629
He must enjoy meditating.

502
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,589
"Director Na Cult Leader."

503
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:03,924
"Your message to the world."

504
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,760
"There's no hope left
for this filthy world. We need a new one."

505
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:10,013
"The root of my misery is Kim Bong-cheon"?

506
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,348
What's this?

507
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:15,685
Wait Patiently for That Day
by Na Cult Leader.

508
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:19,773
He's clearly far
from being mentally sound.

509
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,691
"Hear me,
followers of the Messianian Church."

510
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,319
"Greed is the source of all misery."

511
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,656
"How does one rid oneself of greed?
Offer them as a sacrifice."

512
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,950
Make an offering, huh?

513
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:34,955
I wonder how much he offered to this cult.

514
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,502
The answer will be in his bankbook.

515
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:46,466
He received three billion won
from Jeon Four Terms.

516
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,302
Isn't that Jeon Mayor's father?

517
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:53,181
He then withdrew three billion won
to open up a clinic.

518
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,225
Who is this guy? Is he a doctor?

519
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,310
Is something here? No.

520
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,480
Oh, there's a bag.
This could be a goldmine.

521
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,773
JANG CHEF'S BAG

522
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:02,774
Let's see.

523
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,610
Wait, what's this?

524
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,113
A CLINIC FLYER

525
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,073
Wait, this is Jang Chef.

526
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,366
And that's my dad.

527
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,577
What the heck? He must really be a doctor.

528
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,120
So what's he doing here as a chef?

529
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:16,830
Hold on.

530
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,499
"Plaintiff, Hong Public Figure."

531
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:24,004
He has five billion won in damages to pay.
That may be why he's slaving away here.

532
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:31,386
Let's see. Medical report for Oh Patient.

533
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,972
Aren't these local residents?

534
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,600
This person was diagnosed
with a common cold.

535
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,060
Again, a common cold.

536
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,812
Yet another one with a common cold.

537
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,689
They were all diagnosed
with a common cold.

538
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,942
You've been up to something shady,
haven't you?

539
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,569
SAMRYU UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL NEUROSURGERY
NAME OF DOCTOR: JANG CHEF

540
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,737
JANG MONKFISH'S ROOM

541
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,947
Staff quarters. Jang Monkfish's room.

542
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,993
Jang Monkfish
was the closest to Chairman Kim,

543
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,912
so I want to look into him more.

544
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,080
What's this?

545
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,791
Isn't this a police uniform?

546
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,546
What the heck?
Why is there women's clothing?

547
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,631
A DRESS?

548
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,341
What is this? Is he into cosplay?

549
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:12,052
What's in the drawer? No way.

550
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,347
"Card Shark's Secret Handbook."

551
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,432
I guess it takes work
to become a card shark.

552
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,101
"Monkfish, there's no telling
when I'll be gone,

553
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,187
so I'm leaving you
all my tricks of trade in here."

554
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,563
"Officer Hyeon"?

555
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,023
"Mental strength."

556
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,066
"Marking cards."

557
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,610
There's a whole list of techniques.
"Bottom dealing."

558
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,861
"Card shuffling."

559
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:30,987
Wait, "disguise technique"?

560
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,364
Oh, that explains it.

561
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,324
He disguised himself
with those clothes, huh?

562
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,117
There's a lot to examine here.

563
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,452
What's this?

564
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,995
Why is this so heavy?

565
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,122
What's in here?

566
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,209
Oh my. There's a wig.

567
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,795
Sunglasses.

568
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,255
Cards.

569
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,172
Hold on.

570
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,676
I don't know much about cards,

571
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,178
but are these easier to manage
when bottom dealing?

572
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,763
Are these marked or something?

573
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,308
(PUTTING ON THE GLASSES)

574
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,351
Oh my!

575
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,521
I was right. This guy is serious trouble.

576
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:05,772
MARKED CARDS
VIEW WITH SPECIAL GLASSES ON

577
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:08,149
What's this? What kind of cream is this?

578
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,442
What's this for?

579
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,612
Why does he have this?

580
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,535
This can be used to mark objects.

581
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,996
He must've marked cards with this.

582
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,205
What do we have here?

583
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,168
What's this? There's a photo.

584
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,588
Officer Hyeon must've passed away.

585
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,132
Hold on.
Isn't that a bullet hole in his glasses?

586
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,760
"The last person Officer Hyeon met
was a punk named Kim Bong-cheon,

587
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:36,970
and my guess is that it was him."

588
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:40,765
"He's a big shot in the gambling world
and even has protection from the mayor,

589
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,934
so it'll be difficult
to continue the investigation…"

590
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,895
This place is a goldmine.

591
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,440
It's Officer Hyeon's notebook.

592
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,941
What's this memo?

593
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,613
"Heading to Heoyoung Industrial City
for a game."

594
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,241
JEON FOUR TERMS
BRIBERY AND UNDERMINING THE OPPOSITION

595
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,285
"Nepotistic hiring
of high-ranking officials' children…"

596
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,245
"Hosting the 2002 World Ball…"

597
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,290
Who is this Officer Hyeon,
and who is he to Jang Monkfish?

598
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,291
CITY HALL RECORDS ARCHIVE

599
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,586
A STORAGE BOX FOUND

600
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,505
It's a scarf.

601
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,342
This scarf and hairpin are for women.

602
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,510
What's this?

603
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:19,804
What?

604
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,139
Was he in the fishing business?

605
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,808
JANG MONKFISH FISHERIES
THE MONKFISH

606
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:28,563
He bought the fishing boat in 2001.

607
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,524
One mackerel,
three mackerels, two mackerels.

608
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,567
His business was slow.

609
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,943
Wait, 100 mackerels?

610
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:37,697
On April 2, 2002,
he sold 100, 500, 300, and more.

611
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,032
APRIL 2, 2002

SINGSINGER FISH BAEKBAN, 300 MACKERELS

614
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,371
I should check out Jeon Mayor as well.

615
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:45,955
Sorry about this, Ms. Mayor.

616
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,458
JEON MAYOR'S OFFICE

617
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,627

THE 2036 JOLYMPICS TO THE CITY

00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,921
MAYOR OF HEOYOUNG SPECIAL CITY, JEON MAYOR

619
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:56,591
"Congratulations on Bringing
the 2036 Jolympics to the City."

620
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,012
CANDIDATE FOR THE 30TH MAYOR
OF HEOYOUNG INDUSTRIAL CITY

621
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,681
THE CITY'S FATHER-DAUGHTER POLITICAL DUO!

622
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,182
They look identical.

623
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:07,352
"I'll make sure you lack nothing
and live comfortably."

624
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,813
So her father developed the landfill.

625
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:18,029
"April 8th, Bong."

626
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,448
Again, it says "Bong."
What did she do on the 8th of every month?

627
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,325
"BONG" APPEARS ON THE 8TH OF EVERY MONTH

628
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,331
"Divination Records by Myeong Blade."

629
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,626
This must be that notebook
regarding the truth behind the Jeons.

630
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:34,003
"Advised my client to build a grave

631
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,381

for his political career to thrive."

636
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:48,518
"Advised my client to grow a larger flower
on the grave to become the king."

637
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,688
INSIDE THE DESK DRAWER

638
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,733
"Casino Development Agreement."

639
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:56,985
Let's check the photos.

640
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,612
It kind of looks like a flower.

641
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,865
"Grow a larger flower on the grave…"

642
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,951
Is that why they built the casino there?

643
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:07,787
What's this?

644
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,878
"To become the king…"
Oh, this must be a divination reading.

645
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:21,760
"To become the king,
grow a larger flower on the grave."

646
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:25,430
Doesn't someone have to die
for there to be a grave?

647
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,353
ENGAGEMENT AND RETAINER AGREEMENT

648

00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,683
"Landfill." Now, we're getting somewhere.

659
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:14,103
"Expected to receive
a government aid of 80 billion won."

660
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,815
"The greenbelt in Downfall Town
is too close to residential zones,

661
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,692
but omitting it from the report
could help us move forward."

662
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,030
Oh, the business proposal.
So what happened next?

663
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,448
LANDFILL PROPOSAL APPROVAL LETTER

664
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,741
LANDFILL-RELATED CLAUSES

665
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,993
There must be some secret
regarding the landfill.

666
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,454
AN JEWELER'S JEWELRY STORE

667
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,039
I wonder what I'll find.

668
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,877
She's a VVIP client at Heoyoung Land,

669
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:43,007
so I was curious why she was bending
over backward for Chairman Kim.

670
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,134
That's why I went to An Jeweler's store.

671
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,220
Come on, lady.

672
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,931
What do you have for me?

673
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,267
What's this?

674
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,935
When did they issue a card like this?

675
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,062
TRANSFER OR SALE OF THIS CARD
IS PROHIBITED

676
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,022
It provides access
to all parts of the casino.

677
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,611
Check out all this cash she has.

678
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,784
What's this? "Ministry of the Interior"?

679
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:10,952
Was she a government employee?

680
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,036
URBAN PLANNING SECTION,

681
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,705

00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,127
A SIX-DIGIT PASSCODE?

684
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,088
I'll try 690325.

685
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,425
ENTERING HER DATE OF BIRTH

686
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,599
I knew it.

687
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,102
Goodness gracious, this lady.

688
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,271
The money is one thing, but the rest?

689
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,856
Let's see what this is.

690
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:41,858
A DOCUMENT ENVELOPE INSIDE THE SAFE

691
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:42,942
What's this?

692
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,737
Of course.

693
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,739
DEATH CERTIFICATE (AUTOPSY REPORT)

694
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:51,492
"An Upright. Died on May 21, 2002."

695
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,536
The cause of death
was injury to her central nervous system?

696
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:58,166
"The patient sustained severe injuries
in a hit-and-run accident."

697
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,126
She died because
she couldn't afford the surgery.

698
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,210
Oh dear.

699
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,965
THE PHOTO INSIDE THE ENVELOPE

700
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,134
"My beloved little sister."

701
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,887
"Let's live an upright
and righteous life together."

702
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,639
This must've been Jeweler's older sister.

703
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,390
So something bad happened to her.

704
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,475
Poor woman.

705
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,353
What's this?

706
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,648
This was written in 2002.

707
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,651
"Upright, how can I live without you?"

708
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:29,030
In 2006, she wrote,
"I think I've found a lead on your death."

709
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,449
"I'm going to get rich and make them pay."

710
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:34,369
This is from 2009.
"Being upright didn't get me so far."

711
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,537
She wrote this in 2013.

712
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,622
I LIED ABOUT GOLD CONTENT…

713
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:40,291
This was 2018. So she continued
engaging in illegal activities.

714
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,252
There's something about Jeon Four Terms.

715
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,629
THE BASTARD'S DAUGHTER
IS SET TO BE THE NEXT MAYOR…

716
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,631
She obviously missed her sister.

717
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:52,261
"Jeon Mayor was actually elected
mayor of Heoyoung City."

718
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,513
"The daughter of our nemesis."

719
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:57,809
What's this?

720
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:01,396
"That bastard.
Undersea Story, Gamblers House."

721
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,982
"Every month on the 7th at 11 p.m."
What's this?

722
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,860
What the heck? Hold on.

723
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,368
She kept this really well hidden,
didn't she?

724
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,625
KIM BONG-CHEON
OPPOSED TO FORCED RELOCATION POLICY

725
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,460
This is from 2002.

726
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:28,131
"Following the landfill's construction,
soil and water pollution became severe."

727
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,008
"Pollution levels in the environment

728
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,719
surpass the average range
found in neighboring regions."

729
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,263
Mass fish deaths were reported.

730
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,933
All right, so something was up
with the landfill.

731
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:43,479
"Justice Town Upright Citizens Group,
Representative An Upright."

732
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,525
"Blacklist Concerning
the 2002 Relocation Policy."

733
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,610
An Upright had been blacklisted.

734
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,574
Kim Bong-cheon carried out
all kinds of dirty work from the shadows.

735
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:55,533
AN UPRIGHT

736
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:58,119
CHAIRMAN KIM BONG-CHEON'S OFFICE

737
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,372
What a shame, boss.

738
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,707
You had all that money,

739
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,209
but you died so soon
without getting to spend it all.

740
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,421
So this is how he made his fortune.

741
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:11,007
"Undersea Story." Yes, of course.

742
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:12,508
OPENING OF THE 30TH BRANCH
OF GAMBLERS HOUSE

743
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,136
The 60th branch of Gamblers House.

744
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,723
Did he run those businesses
with Ms. Mayor?

745
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,016
"Heoyoung Land Casino."

746
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,226
Were they close?

747
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,896
"High Roller List."

748
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,482
A LIST OF HIGH ROLLERS AT HEOYOUNG LAND

749
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,401
Man, these people are seriously loaded.

750
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,905
Should I even be looking through
the boss's drawer like this?

751
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,532
"Agreement."

752
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:41,370
An Jeweler was supposed to cut
the resettlement aid by 80%

753
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,790
and then split the embezzled money evenly
with the boss.

754
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:48,044
The date was changed
from May 6th to May 11th.

755
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,170
I wonder why.

756
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,508
There's something else in here.

757
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,886
RELOCATE THE MEEK ONES
AND BURY THE STUBBORN ONES IN THE LANDFILL

758
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,097
There's something under here.

759
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,560
"Commercial Land
Rezoning Approval Application."

760
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:07,897
What?

761
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,566
What the heck?

762
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,322
Wait, was the casino
going to be demolished?

763
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,450
This too.

764
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,537
It's a wanted poster.

765
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:25,331
This is Monkfish.

766
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:28,209
"Whoever captures this punk
will be rewarded with 50 million won."

767
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,253
He placed a bounty on Monkfish.

768
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:33,005
How were they still on good terms?

769
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,715
HOW DID THE WANTED FUGITIVE
BECOME THE HOUSE PLAYER?

770
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,554
Here we go. A résumé.

771
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,807
NAME: JANG CHEF

772
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,142
SAMRYU UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
NEUROSURGERY FELLOW

773
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,811
Why is a doctor… When was this?

774
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,437
Was he also the director?

775
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,273
What's this?

776
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,900
"IOU. Creditor, Kim Bong-cheon."

777
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,610
"Debtor, Jang Chef."

778
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,863
He borrowed three billion won?

779
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,407
Three billion won?

780
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,325
He was forced to work in the kitchen.

781
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,828
Seriously? Even if he borrowed money,

782
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:08,791
why would a clinic director from Gangdam
be working in the kitchen?

783
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:14,881
TA-DA

784
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:15,965
Oh my.

785
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,845
-Detective.
-Yes?

786
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,890
DID HE FIND SOMETHING BIG?

787
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,308
What is it?

788
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:28,561
I'm going to gather
as much evidence as possible.

789
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,773
Isn't this a button?

790
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,818
How did a button end up here?

791
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:43,826
THE DOOR TO THE ROOM IS LOCKED

792
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,245
It seems to be voice-activated.

793
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:55,755
But the chairman is dead.
How can we activate this?

794
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,216
Detective.

795
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,051
-What is it?
-It's time to go.

796
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,762
Do you think you can just order me around?

797
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,347
Did you find anything useful?

798
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:08,059
There was so much information
that I struggled to absorb it all.

799
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,857
COMBINE THE CLUES

800
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:18,778
I hope you worked hard
to clear your name as a suspect.

801
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:19,946
Did you uncover much evidence?

802
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,156
Since we're at a casino,
how about a game of cards?

803
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,784
-Singer, I see you took the most photos.
-Clear our names?

804
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:25,993
-Let's hurry.
-So you found a lot.

805
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,912
I just set the rice to cook.

806
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,539
All right, Mr. Monkfish.

807
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,500
-Yes?
-Why don't you start things off?

808
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,460
-You want me to start things off?
-Go ahead.

809
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,212
The culprit will be identified right away.

810
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,588
Monkfish, go ahead.

811
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,674
First off,

812
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:43,261
the cause of death is quite clear.

813
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:46,889
A gunshot through the forehead.

814
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:52,770
He was shot not only in the forehead
but also in the shoulder.

815
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:57,191
Since it's difficult to accurately
target someone with a gun,

816
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,859
there's a possibility

817
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,113
it was fired at close range.

818
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:06,242
Couldn't the killer have shot Chairman Kim
while he was already lying down?

819
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,535
-You know what?
-Kim Singer.

820
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:10,830
-I consider that a strong possibility.
-You nailed it.

821
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:16,460
Mr. Chef, the one who just said
he left the rice cooking!

822
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,586
Yes?

823
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:22,133
I thought you'd be the one to visit
when I'm craving good food,

824
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,467
but it turns out

825
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,804
you're the one to see when I'm ill.

826
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,931
Mr. Chef here

827
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:32,268
used to be a doctor.

828
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:35,313
In fact, he was a director

829
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:38,149
of a clinic in Gangdam for 20 years.

830
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,233
No wonder.

831
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,861
No wonder white looks good on him.

832
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:44,655
This is what I find puzzling.

833
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,325
This man used to be a hotshot doctor

834
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:50,870
who led his clinic successfully
for over 20 years.

835
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:53,414
So why did he accept
a loan of three billion won

836
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,083
that came with terms
that forced him to work as a chef

837
00:38:56,167 --> 00:39:00,338
and obey his creditor's every order?

838
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,964
Life is short,

839
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:05,843
-and I wanted mine to be dynamic.
-Sure.

840
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:09,555
With such a philosophy, going from doctor
to chef isn't so scandalous.

841
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,015
Is that so?

842
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:15,061
I had no doubt
you were a real VVIP client,

843
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,188
but forgive me
for not recognizing your worth sooner.

844
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,107
Next is Ms. An Jeweler.

845
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,651
There's a lot to discuss about her.

846
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,695
You have a VVIP card,

847
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:29,533
which grants you unlimited access
to Heoyoung Land.

848
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,451
Really?

849
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,536
-The boss--
-You have no idea how much I spent.

850
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:36,874
As you probably noticed,
she has over 70 billion won in deposits.

851
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,084
It's actually 73.4 billion won.

852
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,920
But you weren't born into wealth.

853
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:44,298
You engaged
in some questionable activities,

854
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:48,344
such as profiting from selling knock-offs

855
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:51,764
or selling gold-plated jewelry
disguised as solid gold pieces.

856
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,015
I'm sure you know

857
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,602
about "Snot of the Sun,"
the ridiculously valuable gem.

858
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:57,645
Isn't that worth billions?

859
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,647
-Seven billion won.
-Seven billion won?

860
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,525
She smuggled that into China.

861
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,735
Here's what's important though.

862
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:08,239
Your older sister was An Upright,
am I right?

863
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:11,075
She was a victim of a hit-and-run accident

864
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:14,203
and died because your family
couldn't pay for her surgery.

865
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:18,457
After your sister's death,

866
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:22,670
you spent over two decades
meticulously planning

867
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,256
and saving up for your revenge.

868
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,466
We should look into this.

869
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:31,345
It must be very uncomfortable
to face Ms. Mayor like this.

870
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,972
-No, I'm fine.
-Me?

871
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:36,976
In your diary, you named Jeon Four Terms
as your sister's murderer.

872
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:39,270
My father would never have done
anything like that.

873
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,480
-You got him wrong, then.
-Like father, like daughter.

874
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,732
Ms. Mayor, is this news to you?

875
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,401
I knew nothing about this.

876
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:46,402
Is your father still alive?

877
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,155
-He passed away.
-I see.

878
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,407
That brings me to my boss.

879
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,577
There were notes
that seemed to refer to him.

880
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,371
"That bastard," and mentions
of underground gambling dens.

881
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:01,500
As of now, there's no direct evidence
linking her sister's death

882
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:05,671
to Jeon Four Terms, Jeon Mayor,
or even the deceased chairman.

883
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:09,216
-Not yet, I'm afraid.
-We'll keep an eye out for that.

884
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,011
-Good job, Mr. Jang Monkfish.
-Thank you.

885
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,721
Ms. An Jeweler.

886
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:14,638
Sure.

887
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:18,476
What I first want to point out
is that I have 100 billion won in assets.

888
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,812
And you deposited
over 70 billion in the casino?

889
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,315
So 70% of her assets
were deposited in the casino.

890
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,734
-That's worth noting.
-Of course.

891
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,279
I started to think

892
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:33,032
-that the murder was designed for display.
-I agree.

893
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:36,994
The way the body was laid out
suggested that it was meant to be seen.

894
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,997
Honestly, I was baffled that people
like Kim Singer, Jang Monkfish,

895
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,084
and Jang Chef were invited
to the VVIP clients' event.

896
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,003
-Me too.
-What if we were invited here

897
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:49,131
the day after the murder
so that we could witness it together

898
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,634
as some sort of show?

899
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,761
-I have a question of my own.
-Ask away.

900
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,597
You all received invitations,
but from whom?

901
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,141
-Wasn't it Bong-cheon?
-I received an email from the chairman.

902
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,684
-That's right.
-When?

903
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:03,687
-It was timestamped this morning.
-This morning?

904
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,980
-Likewise.
-You too, Mr. Chef?

905
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:09,610
This suggests the killer invited everyone
impersonating the chairman

906
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:13,155
-so that you could witness the body.
-That's right.

907
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,950
I'll start with Kim Singer.

908
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:16,867
Me?

909
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,869
I enjoyed that photo of you as a kid,

910
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:22,581
singing into your makeshift mic
made of a soda bottle

911
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,292
-in front of Singsinger Fish Baekban.
-Did your parents run the eatery?

912
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,711
I didn't grow up with much money.

913
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,464
Even so, your family stuck together.

914
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,382
Of course.

915
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:34,927
With the photo, there was a business card
from an entertainment agency.

916
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:38,973
A note on it said 50 million won
could make you the next Jo Sung-mo.

917
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:42,059
There's something suspicious
about how you earned the 50 million.

918
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:44,979
You worked hard at fertilizer plants
and chemical plants,

919
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,648
earning five to ten million won per job.

920
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,608
But they didn't seem like monthly wages.

921
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,151
-Something was off.
-That's a lot of money.

922
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,612
I didn't actually
work at fertilizer plants.

923
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,489
I handled waste
that was hard to dispose of.

924
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,033
You mean heavy metals like cadmium?

925
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,536
I helped out with the disposal process.

926
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,454
I was their helper, so to speak.

927
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,958
You were involved
in illegal waste disposal.

928
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,751
All this technical jargon is scaring me.

929
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:11,630
-Ms. Mayor, isn't that punishable by law?
-Yes, absolutely.

930
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,925
Anyway, as you can see,

931
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,636
-Singer signed a contract.
-A contract?

932
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,555
It was with Heoyoung Land,

933
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,515
but the terms were unfavorable to him.

934
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,602
He had to perform 24/7 at the casino,

935
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,521
which is open 24 hours a day,
all year round.

936
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,608
I speak from experience,
having been a singer myself.

937
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:31,984
That violates labor laws.

938
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:35,613
If you force someone to sing 24/7,
they're bound to build up rage.

939
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,824
-Kim Singer, did he have something on you?
-I'd like to ask the same.

940
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:41,035
Maybe this was the reason.

941
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,036
What is it?

942
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,162
Ms. Hwang Wife.

943
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:46,957
She wrote,
"You're meant for a bigger stage,"

944
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,500
meaning Heoyoung Land.

945
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:51,170
How could you not know her
when you all work here?

946
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:54,757
She's the wife of our very own
Chairman Kim Bong-cheon.

947
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,009
-Was she your sugar mommy?
-That's preposterous.

948
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,219
Please don't make it sound
like we had a shady relationship.

949
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:02,514
Mr. Monkfish, take the vape outside.

950
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:04,350
Sorry about that.

951
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,061
-What do you think you're doing?
-Are you kidding me?

952
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,021
Don't you know indoor smoking is illegal?

953
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,814
-But he wasn't vaping.
-I see that now.

954
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,983
-I wasn't smoking.
-Do you have a sore throat?

955
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:18,280
Breathing that terrible air in the casino
took a toll on Mr. Monkfish's lungs.

956
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,658
-You don't have asthma, do you?
-I don't.

957
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,576
-Allow me to continue.
-Sorry about that.

958
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,245
When I was working hard at Gazi Nightclub,

959
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:29,583
Ms. Hwang Wife
recruited me for the casino.

960
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,919
-Taking note of "possibly a sugar mommy."
-"Possibly a sugar mommy."

961
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,045
-Moving on.
-What's next?

962
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:34,713
"If you get caught,
I'll put a hole in you."

963
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,508
-What?
-Someone is holding a gun to his temple.

964
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,385
-What could you be caught doing?
-Explain.

965
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,303
Did you get caught dating Ms. Wife?

966
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,430
He was acting just like you, Detective.

967
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:47,935
Chairman Kim kept thinking
something was going on between us.

968
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:51,355
I'm just a singer
with a passion for music,

969
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,732
and she's simply a fan
who adores my voice.

970
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,359
Here's a key piece of evidence.

971
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,153
I took a look at Kim Singer's phone.

972
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:02,157
You obviously couldn't wait
to leave for Las Vegas.

973
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,535
But Chairman Kim refused to let you go

974
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:06,704
and told you to work until the 8th.

975
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,747
Based on the email attached to a DM,

976
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:12,042
you were supposed to audition
in Las Vegas,

977
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:15,421
but Kim Bong-cheon declined it
on your behalf without consulting you.

978
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,839
He did?

979
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:21,176
This person, La Vega, heard my singing.

980
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:25,222
I was going to be recruited
after auditioning as a formality,

981
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:27,683
but Chairman Kim suddenly intervened.

982
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,768
He snatched the business card,

983
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,146
insisting that all offers go through him
because I was under contract.

984
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:35,065
I didn't even know about the audition,

985
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,693
and my chance to make my break in the US
was taken away just like that.

986
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:41,947
Wasn't that the end of the world for you?
It was a dream of a lifetime.

987
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,283
-Now, one last thing.
-Is there more on him?

988
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,576
-Enough, lady.
-My goodness.

989
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:48,746
I saw Singsinger Fish Baekban's ledger
that you kept from when you were young.

990
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:52,583
The restaurant bought small amounts
with only 4,000 to 11,000 won per fish.

991
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:55,169
But then I saw large purchases
from Jang Monkfish Fisheries.

992
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,879
Ring any bells?

993
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,380
Jang Monkfish Fisheries?

994
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:01,258
Records show
that hundreds of fish were purchased

995
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:04,720
at an unusually low price
from Jang Monkfish Fisheries.

996
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:06,263
-Is that so?
-Yes.

997
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:08,265
I wasn't the one who kept records.

998
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:12,311
I do remember fish coming in
much cheaper than usual at the time.

999
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:16,398
My parents were thrilled,
and business boomed for a while.

1000
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:19,276
-Were they from Jang Monkfish Fisheries?
-Jang Monkfish's fishery?

1001
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,695
Hold on. Are your parents fishermen?

1002
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:22,988
Mr. Monkfish, please answer.

1003
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:24,782
Do your parents
work in the fisheries business?

1004
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,200
-They don't.
-They don't?

1005
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,493
-Let's leave it there.
-Understood.

1006
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,745
Sure, but I looked into two people today.

1007
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:30,662
Is there more?

1008
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,955
-There's more?
-Jeon Mayor.

1009
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:32,998
Me?

1010
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:35,209
You managed to bring
the Jolympics to this city.

1011
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,211
That's quite the achievement.

1012
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,129
-You won the bid?
-That's right.

1013
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,882
-The global sports event filled with joy?
-That's right.

1014
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,717
-Yes, hence "Jolympics."
-I'm impressed.

1015
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,094
Yes, it's quite the achievement.

1016
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:49,223
Are you hoping this would take you
to the Blue House?

1017
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,808
Of course.

1018
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:55,103
I found a casino development agreement.

1019
00:46:55,187 --> 00:47:00,734
Chairman Kim Bong-cheon was obligated
to pay a monthly land use fee.

1020
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,736
Do you collect that
on the 8th of every month?

1021
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,946
-That's right.
-On the 8th?

1022
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:05,697
"Bong" was written
on the 8th of every month.

1023
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,449
-That's right.
-What's today's date?

1024
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,535
-It's the 8th.
-Yes, that's right.

1025
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:12,162
Today is when I receive
the payment in cash.

1026
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,664
-Is that so?
-Right.

1027
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,707
You receive it in cash?

1028
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:18,293
A career in politics
requires a lot of money.

1029
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:19,878
Was it like a political donation?

1030
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,713
-A forced donation?
-That's right.

1031
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:25,259
This is Bong-cheon's phone,
and here are the messages between them.

1032
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:27,845
"Rude Little Bastard."

1033
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,805
Were you aware of this?

1034
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:31,431
Did he save my number as that?

1035
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,225
-Yes.
-"Rude Little Bastard"?

1036
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,352
I must say I'm very offended.

1037
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,312
Here's what's important.

1038
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,564
Ms. Mayor

1039
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:43,026
ordered Chairman Kim to develop the casino
over the landfill site.

1040
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,238
You agreed to receive payments
on the 8th in cash.

1041
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:47,322
That's right.

1042
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,491
He then told you to meet him at the vault

1043
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:52,035
since it was secure and bulletproof.

1044
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,912
-Soundproof and bulletproof.
-Soundproof and bulletproof.

1045
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:56,081
-Really?
-It's completely sealed.

1046
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,041
Here's the last message he sent.

1047
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,502
-The Jeons' secret.
-What's that?

1048
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,629
-She believes in divination readings.
-What?

1049
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,924
It seemed your political choices
were guided by divination readings.

1050
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,551
Her politics are rooted in shamanism.

1051
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:09,636
-Exactly. What is that about?
-Really?

1052
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:13,515
Did you see the scrolls
in her jewelry box?

1053
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,058
One told her to grow a flower on a grave,

1054
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,728
and another told her
to ready the grave for quick destruction.

1055
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,855
On March 27, 2025,

1056
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:22,232
she was told
to grow a larger flower on the grave

1057
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,984
to become the king.

1058
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:24,902
"King"?

1059
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:27,696
Here, "king" likely refers
to the presidency.

1060
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:31,199
These readings are just a reference.

1061
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:34,119
Do you really think
I'd blindly trust them?

1062
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:35,996
Can you prove she blindly trusted them,
Ms. Jeweler?

1063
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,248
Yes, I can prove it.

1064
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:41,501
As you can see here,
she was told to grow a flower on a grave.

1065
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:44,421
The casino is shaped like a flower.

1066
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:47,507
That's true,
but it turned out beautifully.

1067
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,592
Don't you agree?

1068
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,010
What puzzled me most

1069
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,679
was the reading that said to fill a grave
with an offering.

1070
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,556
You probably know
what the grave refers to.

1071
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,766
It's the landfill.

1072
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:59,478
Does this imply
that you need to kill a person first?

1073
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,647
That was a reading

1074
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:05,609
my father received.

1075
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,486
So, did your father kill someone?

1076
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:12,074
My family has a long-standing relationship
with the shaman named Myeong Blade.

1077
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:15,953
We have sought a reading
from the shaman from time to time.

1078
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:19,748
When my father was building the landfill,

1079
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:22,292
there was an accident
with one of the workers.

1080
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,504
After receiving the reading,

1081
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:27,798
he buried a human body

1082
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:30,884
in the landfill as a form of sacrifice.

1083
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,135
That's all I know.

1084
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,929
-In the landfill?
-The worker?

1085
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,764
-He buried the worker's body?
-That's right.

1086
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:39,142
You just admitted
to the illegal burial of a dead body.

1087
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,520
That was my father's doing, not mine.

1088
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:44,690
-It's a disgrace to the family.
-You're pinning it on the deceased?

1089
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:47,359
I was too young at the time
to know anything about it.

1090
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:49,236
-I guess it was your father who did it.
-He did.

1091
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:52,781
As his daughter,
I sincerely apologize on his behalf.

1092
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:56,076
However, the offering
helped my father's career thrive.

1093
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,995
He went on to serve four terms, after all.

1094
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:01,039
I was then told
to plant a flower on a grave.

1095
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,834
Since my father
had buried the human offering there,

1096
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:06,920
I assumed that was the place
and built a casino on it.

1097
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,255
-Then, let me ask this.
-And so I did, and…

1098
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,423
Sure, what is it?

1099
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:13,176
I'd like to point out something else
that was in the notebook.

1100
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:17,097
People besides you and your father
had received readings too.

1101
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,392
We can assume the notes were written
by the shaman who gave these readings,

1102
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:23,979
and Bong-cheon sent Ms. Mayor
a photo of the notebook to blackmail her.

1103
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:26,606
So how did Jeon Mayor
end up with the notebook?

1104
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:31,862
It hit me that she could've killed him
and stolen the notebook.

1105
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,488
No way.

1106
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:34,781
I didn't kill him.

1107
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,534
To tell you the truth,
I stole the notebook in secret.

1108
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:39,995
-After you shot him twice?
-I didn't kill him.

1109
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:42,539
I don't even know how to fire a gun.

1110
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:45,208
-It's really not that hard.
-How do you shoot one?

1111
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,501
How do you…

1112
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,587
-I'm completely clueless.
-At any rate…

1113
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,005
That's even more suspicious.

1114
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,967
Our current mayor
just admitted to robbery.

1115
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,177
I had no other choice.

1116
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,679
Everything I had dreamed of
was going to collapse.

1117
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,598
All the crimes you admitted to

1118
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:02,059
would get you three times
the sentence for a single murder.

1119
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:05,103
Nonetheless,
please recognize my achievements.

1120
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:09,107
-There's also another issue.
-Another one? What did I do?

1121
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:13,570
Landfills can only be developed
for commercial use after 30 years,

1122
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:16,406
and this particular landfill
was constructed in 2000.

1123
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,824
What year is it now?

1124
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,034
-2025.
-2025.

1125
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:21,411
-It hasn't been 30 years.
-You built a casino

1126
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:22,829
before the 30-year period was over.

1127
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,081
A little too soon, don't you think?

1128
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:27,667
-Yes, that's true, but think about it.
-She admits to everything.

1129
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:28,627
Think about it.

1130
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:31,797
The landfill was an eyesore,
and the locals complained about it.

1131
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,507
-It was stinky and gross.
-I wouldn't know.

1132
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,968
I made this decision
for the sake of our city.

1133
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:39,096
However,

1134
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:43,475
Downfall Town was never
a suitable site for a landfill.

1135
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:46,436
But it says here,
"omitting it from the report

1136
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,729
could help us move forward."

1137
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:51,441
Oh, so the landfill was built after
withholding the environmental report.

1138
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:54,319
Your father also offered
a human sacrifice,

1139
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:58,240
and you built a casino on that site
to help your career thrive.

1140
00:51:58,323 --> 00:52:00,408
-Okay, consider that noted.
-But my family--

1141
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,285
Regardless of the murder case at hand,

1142
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,121
she should get the death penalty.

1143
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,873
Heoyoung becoming a special city
benefited your lives as well!

1144
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,875
-That's for the people to decide.
-Listen.

1145
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,128
-If not for the casino,
-You've said enough, Ms. Mayor.

1146
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,629
Heoyoung couldn't have made it so far.

1147
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,714
Ms. Jeweler,
are you done swinging at the mayor?

1148
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,091
Here's the last strike.

1149
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:18,468
-This hurts a lot.
-Ms. Mayor.

1150
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,262
You were obviously desperate,

1151
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:23,181
judging by how you had a PI look
into people connected to the landfill.

1152
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,307
Which PI, do you ask?

1153
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:25,767
-Jang Private Investigator?
-Yes.

1154
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:29,146
What were you trying to find out
about those people?

1155
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:33,817
In the event that the readings
in the notebook were exposed…

1156
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,443
-To kill them all?
-That's your only reason?

1157
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:36,361
Of course not.

1158
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:39,197
I was trying to clean up the mess
my father made

1159
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:41,116
by offering a public apology or something.

1160
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,910
But I had to know the facts
before taking action.

1161
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,829
-I see.
-Detective.

1162
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:50,959
I believe it's crucial for us
to look deeper into what happened in 2000

1163
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:53,962
when the landfill was built.

1164
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:57,507
-You think it all began with the landfill.
-That's right.

1165
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,928
Give it up for Ms. Jeweler, who displayed
the wisdom of a woman in her fifties.

1166
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,472
-Please applaud.
-Nicely done, Ms. Jeweler.

1167
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:07,475
-That's 50 years of wisdom.
-Wisdom of a rich woman, huh?

1168
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:10,103
At this point, I believe Ms. Mayor,

1169
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:14,900
who has been on the chopping block,
would have a few things to say.

1170
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,694
-That was a lot to handle.
-Should we even listen to a politician?

1171
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:19,946
First of all,
I'd like to address the lips.

1172
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,991
Did you have to
take a photo of his face so up close?

1173
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:25,118
-His lips.
-There was something odd about them.

1174
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:29,080
His lips were colored in a way
that made them resemble a penguin's beak.

1175
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:32,459
I first thought
that someone had kissed him.

1176
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:35,212
-Could someone have kissed him?
-But earlier…

1177
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:37,547
What else but a penguin
could've made a mark like that?

1178
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,424
-It was more of a peck.
-Someone could have lips shaped like that.

1179
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:44,012
-Look at Ms. Jeweler's lips.
-She must've done it.

1180
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:48,183
You think Bong-cheon and Jeweler
locked lips?

1181
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,602
That's not what happened.

1182
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:52,103
You've got to be kidding me.

1183
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:55,106
That's it for the body.
I'll now move on to Mr. Monkfish.

1184
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,150
I took a look around Mr. Maskfish's room.

1185
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,443
-Me?
-Yes.

1186
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:02,989
You seem to enjoy cross-dressing.

1187
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,282
Cross-dressing?

1188
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,825
-I found something odd.
-Cross-dressing?

1189
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:10,038
I found a woman's dress
and a uniform in his closet.

1190
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:12,123
A variety of items for disguise
were also found.

1191
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:15,835
I came across a wig,
sunglasses, and marking paste.

1192
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:19,297
The paste is used to mark cards
as a way to cheat in games.

1193
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,633
Mr. Monkfish, did you gamble in disguise?

1194
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:25,345
You probably know this,
but a card shark's success

1195
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,180
depends on his anonymity.

1196
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:31,351
They won't let you in on games
once they know who you are.

1197
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:37,774
That's why Ms. Jeweler said
she didn't see me at the table.

1198
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,276
We played at the same table,

1199
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,444
but there's a reason
you didn't recognize me.

1200
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,905
-Is that why…
-That was you?

1201
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:47,617
-So Ms. Jeweler didn't recognize him
-That crazy punk.

1202
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,119
because he was in disguise.

1203
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:51,288
He cleaned me out completely.

1204
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,039
I swear, I was playing against
a woman though.

1205
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:56,710
Jang Baby might be one of those people
who look good dressed as a woman.

1206
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,295
How do you change your voice?

1207
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:01,172
I have a device for that.

1208
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,882
-Really?
-Hang on.

1209
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:07,053
-"All right, I'm going all-in."
-He wasn't lying.

1210
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,180
-That's so real.
-No way.

1211
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,557
There's something I'd like to know.

1212
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,183
Why did Chairman Kim

1213
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:17,439
put a 50-million-won bounty on your head
and keep that flyer around?

1214
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:18,565
-A bounty?
-A bounty?

1215
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:21,609
Before being officially employed
by the casino,

1216
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:24,988
Monkfish had already been on their radar.

1217
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:27,699
-Were you blacklisted or something?
-I guess.

1218
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:31,369
He was hired by the casino
because of his exceptional talent.

1219
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,580
Let me add to what I discovered.

1220
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:37,292
You had a mentor
who taught you the art of disguise.

1221
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,544
Doesn't every student have a mentor?

1222
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:41,713
I found a notebook titled
"Card Shark's Secret Handbook."

1223
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:43,006
There's a secret handbook?

1224
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,966
It covers disguise, bottom dealing,

1225
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,926
shuffling techniques, and many others.

1226
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:51,806
The handbook was written
by someone called Officer Hyeon.

1227
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:52,766
"Officer Hyeon"?

1228
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:57,228
Yes, and I found a photo
and a memo concerning him.

1229
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,396
This all sounds very familiar.

1230
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,564
He must've passed away.

1231
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:02,067
-There was a photo of his urn.
-Wait.

1232
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,486
-Is he avenging his mentor?
-Didn't he get hit by a train?

1233
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:06,738
As mentioned earlier,

1234
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:10,158
Mr. Monkfish was in the fishing business.
He was a fisherman.

1235
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:13,620
-He was a fisherman, not his parents?
-That's right.

1236
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:17,290
Before he met Officer Hyeon
and trained as a card shark,

1237
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,959
-he was an ordinary fisherman.
-Yes, that's right.

1238
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,252
So he used to be a fisherman.

1239
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:24,089
He was indeed a fisherman
becoming a card shark.

1240
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:27,926
He was quite skilled
and caught more fish as time went on.

1241
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:30,261
Anyway, that was how he was.

1242
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:35,767
The last person
Officer Hyeon met before he passed

1243
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,435
was Chairman Kim Bong-cheon.

1244
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,813
The boss must've killed him.

1245
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,732
So what if he suspected
that Kim Bong-cheon killed Officer Hyeon

1246
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,609
and got employed at the casino
with a different identity,

1247
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:47,695
waiting for the right time to kill him?

1248
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:48,822
That's my theory.

1249
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:50,740
Fine.

1250
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:54,577
Officer Hyeon, my mentor,

1251
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:57,163
was actually a member of the police.

1252
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,666
-Was his rank actually an officer?
-Yes.

1253
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,794
Being a police officer,

1254
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:06,714
he investigated Jeon Four Term thoroughly.

1255
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,092
He must've dug really deep
to get dirt on him.

1256
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:12,220
I didn't realize it at first,
but I found out he was the police

1257
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:14,305
after seeing his notebook.

1258
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:17,851
On the day of his disappearance,
I only assumed he was after a big score.

1259
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,602
That's what I initially thought.

1260
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:22,689
But when days passed
and I couldn't get hold of him,

1261
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:25,108
I went out looking for him.

1262
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:26,025
Okay.

1263
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:29,404
And the search led me here
to Heoyoung Special City.

1264
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:33,366
Although I lacked hard evidence
that Chairman Kim was my mentor's nemesis,

1265
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,578
I had a gut feeling,
and I was 100% sure about it.

1266
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:40,331
Since the police were backing out
of the investigation,

1267
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:44,210
I knew I had to
uncover the truth on my own.

1268
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:48,339
So I played at every illegal casino
Kim Bong-cheon owned

1269
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:52,260
and completely cleaned him out.

1270
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:55,013
It wasn't long
before he put a bounty on my head.

1271
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:58,558
But that didn't faze me,
so I confronted him.

1272
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:00,685
-I like the look in your eyes.
-You only live once, right?

1273
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:01,978
I went to him and said,

1274
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:05,523
"Here I am,
and I'm ready to work for you."

1275
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:09,569
He lit up with joy
and welcomed me with open arms.

1276
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:12,280
-Of course.
-That's how I infiltrated the casino.

1277
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:13,323
All right.

1278
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:17,660
I assume you're trying to say Mr. Monkfish
saw Chairman Kim Bong-cheon as someone

1279
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:20,622
-who more or less killed his parent.
-Exactly.

1280
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:24,042
I understand that
he was trying to avenge his mentor,

1281
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,793
but was that all there was to it?

1282
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:29,130
He says he went from being a fisherman
to a vengeful card shark.

1283
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:33,635
I'm wondering
if there's more to the story.

1284
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:37,305
At this point, I want to uncover
the most unknown person among us.

1285
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,098
-The doctor.
-Oh, right.

1286
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:43,186
Let me give you a brief rundown
of how he became a chef.

1287
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:45,313
-Good idea.
-I'm so curious.

1288
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:46,314
How intriguing.

1289
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:50,026
I found a pile of medical reports
in his drawer.

1290
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:52,570
Apparently, the people of Downfall Town
had terrible health.

1291
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:58,201
The level of heavy metals in their blood
was twice the normal range.

1292
00:58:58,284 --> 00:59:01,704
However, everyone was diagnosed
with a common cold.

1293
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:06,376
He diagnosed patients suffering
from heavy metal poisoning

1294
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:09,629
as having a common cold,

1295
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:15,677
and he received a staggering
three billion won in his bank account.

1296
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,761
From Kim Bong-cheon?

1297
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:18,555
-Was it from Jeon Four Terms?
-It wasn't, huh?

1298
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:20,348
Will you pin it on your father
and play dumb again?

1299
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:21,558
Look, I swear…

1300
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:24,727
You might not believe me,
but I had no idea about this.

1301
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,604
-I had absolutely no idea.
-Sure, let's move on.

1302
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:29,607
-That's what all politicians say.
-I'll believe you for now.

1303
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:32,402
-Please don't identify me with my father.
-His bankbook shows the money

1304
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:34,988
came from Jeon Four Terms.

1305
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:39,033
He immediately spent three billion won
to open his own clinic.

1306
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,201
Oh, he opened his own clinic.

1307
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,745
The Waist-Shoulders-Knees-And-Toes Clinic.

1308
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:45,915
Even Park Ji-yoon, the anchorwoman,
seems to have been a regular.

1309
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,166
I saw that photo too.

1310
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,836
It's odd since she's known
for having strong and dense bones.

1311
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:52,046
She came in to shave down
those sturdy bones of hers.

1312
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,424
-Is that necessary to share?
-She said nothing fit her right.

1313
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:56,843
Don't you have a duty
to keep patient confidentiality?

1314
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,012
LET'S HOPE THE REAL PARK JI-YOON
DOESN'T FIND OUT

1315
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:03,224
Anyway, he was doing well for himself
after opening a clinic in Gangdam,

1316
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:04,559
but then things went south.

1317
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:05,810
-How so?
-What happened?

1318
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:08,563
-I came across a court ruling.
-A court ruling?

1319
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:12,442
The plaintiff developed a herniated disc
due to excessive gambling,

1320
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:15,236
but after surgery by Jang Chef,
he was left paralyzed from the waist down.

1321
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,904
-Oh dear.
-Oh my goodness.

1322
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:19,532
As a result of this major malpractice,

1323
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:22,869
he was ordered to pay
a whopping five billion won in damages

1324
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:26,581
and even had his medical license revoked.

1325
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:31,085
He must've taken out a loan
of three billion won to cover the damages.

1326
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:33,546
-Is that how you came to work here?
-He borrowed it from Kim Bong-cheon.

1327
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,174
-Of all the options, why a chef?
-Let me explain.

1328
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:37,967
I honestly don't know.

1329
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:40,303
He told me to come and cook at the casino,

1330
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:41,888
and so I did.

1331
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:44,140
But who would've thought
I'd be this good at it?

1332
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:47,143
What in the world are you on about?

1333
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:49,312
-Did you find your calling?
-That was so random.

1334
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:51,397
It wasn't easy for Jang Chef.

1335
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,316
I found signs in his room

1336
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:56,069
that he was trying to find peace

1337
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,945
-at On Fleek Meditation Center.
-Meditation Center?

1338
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:00,907
Anyway, I had a closer look
at the pamphlet.

1339
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,493
He said his life was already over

1340
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:05,453
and that the source of his misery

1341
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:07,872
-was none other than Kim Bong-cheon.
-Bong-cheon.

1342
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,792
Anyway, he found spiritual peace

1343
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:12,502
at a place run by Na Cult Leader.

1344
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:13,711
What was it called again?

1345
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:14,796
The Messianian Church.

1346
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,963
Yes, the Messianian Church.

1347
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:20,468
-The Messianian Church?
-I couldn't tell if he had converted,

1348
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:23,429
but he was turning to this religious group
for spiritual guidance.

1349
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,723
-I thought it was an amateur soccer club.
-That gave me goosebumps.

1350
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:28,685
-You thought it referred to Messi?
-We know the body was put on display,

1351
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:32,772
so what if it's connected
to some kind of religious ritual?

1352
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:35,858
-It's not, but believe what you want.
-The Messianian Church.

1353
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:39,779
Also, I don't think any of you guys
took a close look

1354
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:42,573
at Chairman Kim's phone.

1355
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:45,785
There were texts exchanged
between him and An Chump.

1356
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:46,953
-An Chump?
-I read those.

1357
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,831
This person was delivering
more suckers to the boss,

1358
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:53,793
such as the CEO of a construction company
and even an assemblyman.

1359
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,045
You brought in a lot of them, didn't you?

1360
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:57,505
-To your Bong-cheon.
-Are you An Chump?

1361
01:01:57,588 --> 01:02:00,091
Are you calling me a chump?

1362
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:03,636
You're the chump of all chumps.
Get a grip already.

1363
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:06,139
-There's no need to call me that.
-I read those texts too

1364
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:08,808
and thought the two were talking
about some unidentified sucker.

1365
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:11,686
Turns out they were talking
about An Jeweler, the chump.

1366
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:13,646
-"Chump" was the nickname he gave her.
-I was mistaken.

1367
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,190
-Here's another thing I'm curious about.
-I had no idea.

1368
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:20,403
I found a secret compartment
in the chairman's office

1369
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:22,572
behind the framed picture of a Joker.

1370
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:29,537
When I swung open the frame,
I discovered a box.

1371
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:31,789
There was a jewel-encrusted box.

1372
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:34,834
I opened the box and found this.

1373
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:41,591
This gun.

1374
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,051
There was a gun inside the box.

1375
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:45,887
Remember how the chairman died?

1376
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,847
-He was shot.
-Yes, he was shot.

1377
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,558
-I found a gun. A revolver, to be exact.
-There was a gun?

1378
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:54,979
And next to the gun were two bullets.

1379
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:58,775
They had clearly been fired
and hit a target or something,

1380
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,359
judging by their crushed state.

1381
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:01,861
I unloaded the revolver

1382
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:04,447
and discovered
that two out of six rounds had been fired,

1383
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,741
and the other four hadn't been fired.

1384
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:08,785
For that reason,

1385
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:12,663
I can confidently say that this gun
was used to kill Chairman Kim.

1386
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:15,958
Chairman Kim died by his own gun.

1387
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,460
It seems that way.

1388
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:20,880
All right. Then, we'll need to know
who had access to that gun.

1389
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:22,507
I have an answer to that question.

1390
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:25,259
There was a logo on the box

1391
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:26,761
-with the letter A.
-"A"?

1392
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:28,429
"A."

1393
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:30,932
-What about it?
-Doesn't that point to Ms. Jeweler?

1394
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:33,267
-A as in Jewelry Store A.
-Ms. An Jeweler.

1395
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:35,728
Do you sell things like that
at your jewelry store?

1396
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:36,938
Ms. Jeweler,

1397
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:39,774
this is a key piece of evidence,
so make your position clear.

1398
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:41,526
-I gave it to him as a gift.
-Even the gun?

1399
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:42,443
Yes.

1400
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,946
She's one scary lady.

1401
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:46,739
-How so? What's scary about gifting a gun?
-What?

1402
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,908
Do you sell guns at your jewelry store?

1403
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,993
You really think I gifted him a gun
just because I sell them at my store,

1404
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:52,537
you idiot?

1405
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:55,122
I bought the gun and gave it to him.

1406
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:57,708
-Man, you're so frustrating.
-Why a gun of all things?

1407
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:58,918
-Why a gun?
-Listen.

1408
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:00,711
Why do you think?

1409
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:03,589
Why would anyone need a gun?

1410
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:04,882
Was it to kill him with it later?

1411
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:06,509
Yes.

1412
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:09,554
I gave it to him
so I could use it to kill him.

1413
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:11,556
I thought if I gave him the gun,

1414
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:13,474
I'd be able to see where he'd store it.

1415
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:14,600
No way.

1416
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,143
Did you kill him?

1417
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,645
I couldn't.

1418
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:19,146
Some other jerk beat me to it.

1419
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:22,483
That means someone besides me
knew where the gun was.

1420
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:24,485
-All right.
-We'll know once we investigate further.

1421
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:26,153
There's also this.

1422
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:30,199
I couldn't quite figure out
what Ms. Jeweler did in the past.

1423
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:31,534
Couldn't you figure it out?

1424
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:33,703
She used to be a civil servant.

1425
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:34,829
-Really?
-That's right.

1426
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:37,874
She was a Grade 9 civil servant
at the Ministry of the Interior.

1427
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:40,751
I discovered an agreement
between you and Chairman Kim.

1428
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:43,629
You were supposed to
pay the residents five million won

1429
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,631
-to help them relocate.
-Yes, the resettlement money.

1430
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:49,719
You agreed to cut it down to a million
and split the profit with the boss, right?

1431
01:04:49,802 --> 01:04:51,804
-Yes, you read that right.
-Yes.

1432
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,139
-You're evil.
-You even stole that money?

1433
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:57,184
The two of you entered
into this agreement on May 6, 2002.

1434
01:04:57,268 --> 01:05:02,106
However, the date was changed
from the 6th to the 11th.

1435
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:04,817
I must say though,

1436
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:09,614
she would've absolutely loathed
doing any business with the chairman.

1437
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:11,949
But they have a close relationship.

1438
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,200
Why would you say that?

1439
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:18,581
I found the texts
they exchanged in 2002 on her phone.

1440
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:23,586
I found Chairman Kim
pressuring her to reconsider the offer.

1441
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:26,255
Ms. Jeweler, however, told him to back off

1442
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,925
or risk being reported to the police.

1443
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:31,218
So she was a civil servant with integrity?

1444
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:36,265
So what happened between May 6th and 11th
that made her change her mind?

1445
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:38,643
When did her sister die again?

1446
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:40,853
Do you care to know my story?

1447
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,689
Ms. Jeweler,
did you do anything for Chairman Kim

1448
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,192
while you were working as a civil servant?

1449
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:50,112
My sister always reminded me

1450
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:51,697
to be upright and righteous.

1451
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:55,284
That's why I told him
never to contact me again.

1452
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:59,121
Then, my sister
got in a hit-and-run accident.

1453
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:01,332
I desperately needed money
for her surgery.

1454
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:05,711
That's why I changed my mind
and signed the agreement on the 11th.

1455
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,546
-I see.
-That's what happened.

1456
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:11,217
Didn't you see the note
that was also in the envelope?

1457
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,468
I didn't catch that.

1458
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:14,095
She was ordered to relocate everyone

1459
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:16,639
and to bury anyone who resisted
in the landfill.

1460
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,892
The name of the person who wrote it
was written on the back of that note.

1461
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:22,269
-Jeon Four Terms.
-What?

1462
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:25,773
Jeez, Dad. How much more of your mess
do I have to clean up?

1463
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,525
Judging by that tone,

1464
01:06:27,608 --> 01:06:29,902
you would probably kill him yourself
if he hadn't passed away.

1465
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,655
Ms. Mayor, did you really not know
about your father's doings?

1466
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:33,781
Ms. Mayor,

1467
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:37,618
weren't you heavily involved
in building the casino on the landfill?

1468
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:38,536
I was.

1469
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:43,499
It seems you were applying
for the rezoning approval for that land.

1470
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:46,836
You planned to construct a stadium
on the site of the casino.

1471
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:48,504
Because the city is hosting the Jolympics.

1472
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:51,674
Oh, you're right. Anyway, the form
had only been signed by the mayor,

1473
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:54,844
and Chairman Kim crumpled it up
and tossed it on the floor.

1474
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,972
That's why I suggested
he move the casino elsewhere.

1475
01:06:58,055 --> 01:06:59,598
I even offered to forgo rent.

1476
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,475
-To run the business elsewhere?
-That's right.

1477
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:02,893
And give up his luxurious casino?

1478
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:06,480
There's no other site in the city
large enough to accommodate a stadium.

1479
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:08,941
-Where would he go?
-The stadium had to be built here.

1480
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,651
-It had to be built on the casino site.
-Sure.

1481
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:13,946
What's more important?
The Jolympics, of course.

1482
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:16,741
Jeon Mayor and the divination notebook.

1483
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:20,119
This isn't something
we should take lightly.

1484
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,039
She must've firmly believed

1485
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:28,127
that her father won four elections
because he followed the readings.

1486
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:30,921
The readings she got around the time
she was aiming for the presidency

1487
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:34,675
must've held
even greater significance for her.

1488
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:38,387
So her eye would've been set
on creating a bigger flower, the stadium.

1489
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:42,224
But Kim Bong-cheon got in her way
and blackmailed her with the notebook,

1490
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:46,020
so she might've felt the need
to get rid of him.

1491
01:07:46,103 --> 01:07:48,105
Her father buried someone
to get what he wanted,

1492
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:50,816
so she could've believed
she could kill someone too.

1493
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:55,488
Also, I discovered crucial evidence
in the chairman's office.

1494
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:59,408
Did anyone else notice
a button lying on the floor?

1495
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:00,659
No, I didn't.

1496
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,703
There was a button.

1497
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:06,665
That button is connected to the frame
that kept the gun's storage box hidden.

1498
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,417
So it fell off
of whoever was getting the gun?

1499
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:11,295
It likely fell while they were either
getting the gun or returning it

1500
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:13,380
because it was found right below it.

1501
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:14,757
Let's check your shirt.

1502
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,300
It was a different color.

1503
01:08:16,383 --> 01:08:18,511
-It was black.
-It looked like a button

1504
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:19,845
from the cuff of a man's suit.

1505
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:20,846
Jang Monkfish.

1506
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,765
-Jang Monkfish!
-Show us your jacket.

1507
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:24,642
Raise your arms where we can see them.

1508
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:28,604
Show us your arms,
or we'll bring the sledgehammer!

1509
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:31,273
Come on now. Must there be bloodshed?

1510
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:33,234
-How many buttons are there?
-He's missing one.

1511
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:34,568
He only has two on this side.

1512
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:36,821
Is bloodshed really necessary?

1513
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:39,073
Bring the sledgehammer.

1514
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:41,867
Unbelievable.
So that's who the button belonged to.

1515
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,119
What were you going to do with the gun?

1516
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:45,287
Fine. I'll tell you.

1517
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:48,707
I, too, made plans

1518
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,042
to kill

1519
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:52,336
Kim Bong-cheon.

1520
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:54,922
-I had a plan of my own,
-I knew it.

1521
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:58,676
and I knew where he kept the gun.

1522
01:08:59,343 --> 01:09:01,804
Here's how it went down.

1523
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:05,766
At 10:05 p.m., she started throwing a fit,
accusing the game of being a scam.

1524
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:07,476
-You mean Ms. Jeweler?
-Yeah.

1525
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,311
You finally figured out
you were being fooled.

1526
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:13,649
At around 10:10 p.m.,
the whole game fell apart.

1527
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,485
Since I was dressed as a woman,

1528
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:19,822
I went to my room
to wash up and get changed.

1529
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:22,533
Since it was right
before the first anniversary

1530
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:24,076
and the boss would be handling payouts,

1531
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:27,872
I decided to finally execute my plan.

1532
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:31,417
So I went to his office
at around 10:55 p.m.

1533
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,835
and grabbed the gun

1534
01:09:33,752 --> 01:09:35,296
to kill the chairman when he arrived.

1535
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:39,258
Every month on the 7th at 11 p.m.,
he came to his office to handle payouts.

1536
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:40,843
Even Ms. Jeweler knew that.

1537
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:42,595
-Yes, I did.
-To handle the casino payouts?

1538
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:44,388
He did that by himself.

1539
01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:46,724
So I waited, but he never showed up.

1540
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:50,144
He was nowhere to be seen
even by 11:10 p.m.,

1541
01:09:50,227 --> 01:09:53,355
and that's when I heard someone
calling for him.

1542
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,399
Someone else was at the door,

1543
01:09:55,482 --> 01:09:56,775
and I knew I was in trouble.

1544
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:58,611
-Who was it?
-Did you see who it was?

1545
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:01,906
I couldn't tell who it was,
but they were calling for the chairman.

1546
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:03,616
-Man or woman?
-Didn't you hear coughing?

1547
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,659
-It was a guy.
-A guy?

1548
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:06,702
That's it!

1549
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:08,913
Was it you?

1550
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:10,331
It was me.

1551
01:10:10,414 --> 01:10:11,957
-Why, you…
-Are you kidding me?

1552
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,835
The office has only one door,
so you would've had to cross paths.

1553
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:18,505
There's another door
leading out to the stage.

1554
01:10:19,423 --> 01:10:23,344
I figured it wasn't my day to kill him,

1555
01:10:23,427 --> 01:10:26,013
so I put the gun back in its place.

1556
01:10:26,096 --> 01:10:29,141
At the time, I didn't see anything else.

1557
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:32,561
There were no spent bullets in that case.

1558
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:34,396
-There were no spent bullets?
-No.

1559
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,814
The murder happened afterward, then.

1560
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:36,857
Okay.

1561
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:40,361
Singer, why did you
go to his office at 11:10 p.m.?

1562
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:42,488
-I went to see the chairman.
-What for?

1563
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:45,491
I wasn't feeling well,
so I took some meds and fell asleep.

1564
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:48,160
But then I woke up to a DM notification.

1565
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:51,205
I went to the chairman
to ask about the situation.

1566
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:52,706
But at the office--

1567
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:55,042
-His dream was at stake.
-You didn't see the chairman?

1568
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:56,252
-No.
-I didn't.

1569
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:57,711
Where on earth was the chairman?

1570
01:10:57,795 --> 01:10:59,797
Where was he? Someone must've seen him.

1571
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:00,881
An Jeweler.

1572
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:01,924
-Yeah, An Jeweler.
-Yes?

1573
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:03,384
-An Jeweler.
-Yes?

1574
01:11:03,467 --> 01:11:06,136
Why did you throw a fit
when you're not one to usually do that?

1575
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:08,055
Whatever you lose
must be chump change for you.

1576
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:12,685
I knew he handled payouts alone
on the 7th at 11 p.m.

1577
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:14,019
Are you two that close?

1578
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:17,022
-So I was the only one who didn't know.
-Ms. Mayor, I'm a VVIP at the casino.

1579
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:20,067
-She's acting like she isn't a chump.
-It was my plan all along.

1580
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:22,319
-She's acting like she knows everything.
-I let him take advantage of me.

1581
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:24,405
Anyway, I knew everything.

1582
01:11:24,488 --> 01:11:26,699
I had decided
to kill him on the 7th long ago.

1583
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:30,953
Ms. Mayor, didn't you show up
at around 9:40 p.m.

1584
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:32,496
-in a fit of rage?
-She did.

1585
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:36,166
I did. Since there were people
on the third floor,

1586
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:40,963
I asked the chairman to talk in private
in his office at 9:50 p.m.

1587
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:42,548
When did you leave his office?

1588
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:44,133
At 10 p.m.

1589
01:11:44,216 --> 01:11:45,676
-You only talked for ten minutes?
-That's right.

1590
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:50,180
I saw that as my cue
to throw a huge fit at the table.

1591
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:51,724
I did so at 10:05 p.m.

1592
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:54,727
-The game was broken up at 10:10 p.m.
-Exactly.

1593
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:57,730
At 10:10 p.m., Bong-cheon offered

1594
01:11:57,813 --> 01:12:00,190
to show me the vault.

1595
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:01,442
Did you go into the vault?

1596
01:12:01,525 --> 01:12:04,194
So, we went to check it together.

1597
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:05,404
Did you go inside?

1598
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:08,073
As you know, the framed Joker
is in a bit of a blind spot.

1599
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,034
My plan was to swing the frame open,

1600
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:12,911
quietly grab the gun, and shoot him.

1601
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:16,081
But then he suddenly told me
to go into the vault as well.

1602
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:19,877
I was planning to sneak up on him,
but he told me to go inside first.

1603
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:22,713
I figured it just wasn't
the right time to kill him,

1604
01:12:22,796 --> 01:12:25,049
so I gave up
and left his office at 10:30 p.m.

1605
01:12:25,132 --> 01:12:26,550
It wasn't your day either.

1606
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:32,389
Lastly, here's something
we should keep in mind going forward.

1607
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:34,892
Between the chairman's office
and the stage,

1608
01:12:34,975 --> 01:12:36,518
I noticed some cleaning supplies,

1609
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:38,645
and there was an instruction card
attached to the cart.

1610
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:40,564
What struck me as odd
was the note about the hill

1611
01:12:40,647 --> 01:12:42,274
-behind the casino.
-I noticed that too.

1612
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:45,152
Apparently, as carcasses decompose,

1613
01:12:45,235 --> 01:12:48,447
methane gas builds up,
which could burst and start a fire.

1614
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:52,034
It's very likely
that the casino's location on a landfill

1615
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:55,913
left the site vulnerable
to gas-related accidents.

1616
01:12:55,996 --> 01:12:58,916
Jang Chef found something
related to this matter,

1617
01:12:58,999 --> 01:13:00,793
-so let's hear from him next.
-Sounds good.

1618
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:02,920
-All right.
-Nicely done, Mr. Singer.

1619
01:13:03,003 --> 01:13:05,923
Despite not feeling well,
you delivered a clear briefing.

1620
01:13:06,006 --> 01:13:08,258
However, I would appreciate it
if you wore a mask.

1621
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:10,302
Goodness.

1622
01:13:11,845 --> 01:13:14,473
I'm Jang Chef. All right.

1623
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:18,727
The killer murdered the victim
and put the body on display.

1624
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:23,440
Did the victim collapse on the spot,
or was he placed there?

1625
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:28,487
I believe the victim
was already incapacitated.

1626
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,948
He was positioned there
before being shot twice.

1627
01:13:31,031 --> 01:13:32,324
It was as easy as that.

1628
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:33,992
But here's what I find strange.

1629
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:38,497
As per my deductions,
he must've been shot on stage.

1630
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,040
But the gun doesn't have a silencer.

1631
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:42,960
Shouldn't somebody
have heard the gunshots?

1632
01:13:43,043 --> 01:13:46,630
-Everyone should've heard it.
-Only the vault was soundproofed.

1633
01:13:46,713 --> 01:13:50,008
However, the body was discovered
somewhere other than the vault.

1634
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:54,972
We must not overlook
the possibility of the body being moved.

1635
01:13:55,055 --> 01:13:59,268
Who here went into the vault?

1636
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:00,978
-Did you go inside?
-Ms. Jeweler did.

1637
01:14:01,061 --> 01:14:01,895
I did.

1638
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:05,065
Ms. Mayor, don't you go to the vault
to receive your payout?

1639
01:14:05,649 --> 01:14:07,860
No, I receive it in cash the next day.

1640
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:10,863
Only Kim Bong-cheon's voice

1641
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:12,489
-can unlock the door, correct?
-Yes.

1642
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:15,033
Don't you think
all our answers will be in that vault?

1643
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:17,202
Yeah. I'd also like to point out

1644
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:20,289
that there's a gas leak detector
near the stage.

1645
01:14:21,373 --> 01:14:23,208
But it doesn't work.

1646
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:26,086
I couldn't get it to turn on,

1647
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:27,796
so I took it apart.

1648
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,883
There should be three batteries,
but one was missing.

1649
01:14:31,508 --> 01:14:33,010
-Someone took it out.
-Exactly.

1650
01:14:33,093 --> 01:14:35,262
Someone must've removed it beforehand

1651
01:14:35,345 --> 01:14:37,598
-to release the gas.
-Exactly.

1652
01:14:37,681 --> 01:14:40,225
There's a vent right next to it.

1653
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:42,394
Gas can either enter
or be released through there.

1654
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,646
If gas had leaked through the vent

1655
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:46,398
but the detector didn't go off,

1656
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:49,693
he could've passed out from the gas
before realizing what hit him.

1657
01:14:49,776 --> 01:14:53,447
That's a plausible theory.

1658
01:14:54,031 --> 01:14:57,451
I found a document envelope

1659
01:14:57,534 --> 01:15:02,080
hidden inside the table
in Ms. Jeweler's office.

1660
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:05,626
Inside was an environmental report.

1661
01:15:05,709 --> 01:15:10,005
It said the landfill had been causing
significant problems for the neighborhood

1662
01:15:10,088 --> 01:15:11,465
because of abnormal pollution levels.

1663
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:15,469
That's why many locals
suffered from heavy metal poisoning.

1664
01:15:15,552 --> 01:15:17,721
-There was a mass death of fish as well.
-Right.

1665
01:15:17,804 --> 01:15:19,765
There were many alarming signs.

1666
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:23,101
Based on the facts
in this environmental report,

1667
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:26,730
Ms. An Upright
led a protest as the representative

1668
01:15:26,813 --> 01:15:28,774
of the Upright Citizens Group.

1669
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:30,901
-Her accident must've been a hit.
-How righteous is that?

1670
01:15:30,984 --> 01:15:32,027
She was assassinated.

1671
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:36,698
There's a man from the protest
who was also photographed with her.

1672
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:37,950
-Who?
-It was…

1673
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:40,077
Who was it?

1674
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:41,119
It was Kim Bong-cheon.

1675
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:42,579
That's right.

1676
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:45,499
An Jeweler's dear Kim Bong-cheon
can be seen in the photo as well.

1677
01:15:45,582 --> 01:15:49,211
-Listen up, everyone.
-Unbelievable.

1678
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:51,505
Don't be so quick to assume

1679
01:15:51,588 --> 01:15:56,510
that only Mr. Four Terms
was involved in Ms. Upright's death.

1680
01:15:56,593 --> 01:16:00,222
Kim Bong-cheon,
who carried out Jeon Four Terms's orders

1681
01:16:00,305 --> 01:16:04,309
-Exactly.
-is directly tied to Ms. Upright's death.

1682
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:08,105
-Very well said.
-I'm pretty sure Ms. Jeweler knew.

1683
01:16:08,188 --> 01:16:09,147
I say this

1684
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:11,858
because of the blacklist
connected to the landfill.

1685
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:13,652
Ms. Upright was at the top of the list.

1686
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:19,283
And the blacklist had a signature on it
that belonged to Mr. Four Terms.

1687
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:21,994
-That being said,
-Seriously, Dad.

1688
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:23,662
everyone here

1689
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:27,249
has a motive strong enough
to kill Chairman Kim Bong-cheon.

1690
01:16:27,332 --> 01:16:29,251
Then there's the landfill.

1691
01:16:29,334 --> 01:16:33,672
All of you are connected
to the landfill in some way.

1692
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:37,843
-Right.
-But why did the killer feel the need

1693
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:40,721
to put the body on display
for all of you to see?

1694
01:16:40,804 --> 01:16:42,723
Who knew about the gun?

1695
01:16:42,806 --> 01:16:43,765
I didn't.

1696
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:47,185
-Singer, what about you?
-I had a gun pointed at my head.

1697
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:49,771
-Yeah.
-So I knew he had a gun,

1698
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:52,566
but I didn't know where he kept it.

1699
01:16:52,649 --> 01:16:54,401
I was too busy worrying
about the gun to my head.

1700
01:16:54,484 --> 01:16:55,611
I honestly had no clue.

1701
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:56,653
I knew about it.

1702
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:59,239
These two knew about the gun.
She's the one who gave it to him.

1703
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:02,034
Three of you knew about the gun,
while the other two didn't.

1704
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:03,368
This is a tough vote to make.

1705
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:04,620
THE DETECTIVE'S 1ST ROUND OF VOTING

1706
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:10,167
THE DETECTIVE CASTS 2 VOTES TOTAL,
1 OF WHICH IS CAST AFTER THE BRIEFING

1707
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:13,378
First of all,

1708
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,756
he screwed Singer over
by destroying his dream.

1709
01:17:15,839 --> 01:17:18,884
Meanwhile, there's Jang Chef,
who's become the servant of this casino.

1710
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:21,511
He's also had a rough life so far.

1711
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:24,598
-I've reached Nirvana.
-Jeweler wants to avenge her sister,

1712
01:17:24,681 --> 01:17:27,392
and Monkfish wants to avenge his mentor.

1713
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:30,604
Then there's the woman
who's on the cusp of finding out

1714
01:17:30,687 --> 01:17:33,023
whether or not
she can become the president.

1715
01:17:33,106 --> 01:17:36,568
No one here is as desperate as she is
to achieve her goal.

1716
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:38,820
While I can't say I'm sure…

1717
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:40,322
WHO WILL THE DETECTIVE VOTE FOR?

1718
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:47,329
PARK DETECTIVE CHOSE AN JEWELER

1719
01:17:47,412 --> 01:17:49,081
I had no other choice.

1720
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:50,582
-I can't say I'm surprised.
-Me neither.

1721
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:51,708
Given the evidence so far--

1722
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:54,169
I bet you think I did it
because a family member is involved.

1723
01:17:54,252 --> 01:17:55,420
That's right.

1724
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:57,547
-It's actually poetic.
-What is?

1725
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:00,759
Gifting someone a gun
only to use it to kill them later.

1726
01:18:01,468 --> 01:18:05,055
The message was,
"I will spill as much of your blood

1727
01:18:05,138 --> 01:18:06,890
as was spilled into this landfill."

1728
01:18:06,973 --> 01:18:07,974
How righteous of her.

1729
01:18:08,058 --> 01:18:10,143
Shut it already,
and let's get searching again.

1730
01:18:10,644 --> 01:18:13,522
Ms. Jeweler, if my accusation upset you,

1731
01:18:13,605 --> 01:18:16,233
channel that emotion
into finding more clues.

1732
01:18:16,316 --> 01:18:17,859
That being said,
let's put our heads together.

1733
01:18:18,443 --> 01:18:20,070
Let's head back out there.

1734
01:18:20,153 --> 01:18:20,987
Sounds good.

1735
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:22,489
Let's catch this killer.

1736
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:25,200
THE SCENE OF THE CRIME
WILL REVEAL THE CULPRIT

1737
01:18:25,283 --> 01:18:27,536
I'm going to check the places
I wasn't able to search earlier.

1738
01:18:28,412 --> 01:18:29,913
Let me see.

1739
01:18:31,248 --> 01:18:34,459
This is the first place we should check.

1740
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,294
But how do we get inside the vault?

1741
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:38,422
KIM BONG-CHEON'S VAULT IS LOCKED

1742
01:18:38,505 --> 01:18:39,756
How do we gain access to it?

1743
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:44,886
"Activate voice recognition
for user verification."

1744
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:47,013
I'm Kim Bong-cheon.

1745
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:48,765
Open the door.

1746
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:50,350
It won't work.

1747
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:52,978
Do we not have anything
with the boss's voice?

1748
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:57,190
SEARCHING JANG CHEF'S ROOM

1749
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:03,029
What's this?

1750
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:07,159
AN ITEM FOUND UNDER THE MATTRESS

1751
01:19:11,037 --> 01:19:13,915
"Jang Chef's Witch Soup Recipe."

1752
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:16,293
What the heck?

1753
01:19:17,878 --> 01:19:19,796
What in the world is his deal?

1754
01:19:20,672 --> 01:19:22,215
Seriously, who is this man?

1755
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:26,261
Detective, beware of him.

1756
01:19:26,344 --> 01:19:28,972
-Step away from him. He's dangerous.
-Who?

1757
01:19:29,055 --> 01:19:31,057
-Do you mean Jang Chef?
-He's a dangerous man.

1758
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:33,977
-Mr. Chef.
-For goodness' sake.

1759
01:19:34,644 --> 01:19:35,854
What the heck is this?

1760
01:19:36,688 --> 01:19:38,607
JANG CHEF'S RECIPE BOOK

1761
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:41,735
"Cut the fingers into an appropriate size
and add them to the pot."

1762
01:19:41,818 --> 01:19:44,780
"Chop fresh thigh meat
into bite-sized pieces."

1763
01:19:45,363 --> 01:19:47,282
"Prepare a thick cut of belly meat."

1764
01:19:47,365 --> 01:19:49,701
"Poke holes in the meat if it resists."

1765
01:19:50,368 --> 01:19:51,912
He adds fingers to his soup

1766
01:19:51,995 --> 01:19:54,289
and thigh meat to his salad.

1767
01:19:54,372 --> 01:19:57,959
-Why do you add fingers to your dish?
-What?

1768
01:19:58,043 --> 01:20:00,837
-You've got to be kidding me?
-Why make soup with thigh meat?

1769
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:02,172
-Why make a salad like that?
-Come on now.

1770
01:20:02,255 --> 01:20:04,883
RETCHING

1771
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:08,094
Did you start cooking humans
after joining the cult?

1772
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:09,763
A CULT FREAK WHO COOKS WITH HUMANS
AS INGREDIENTS?

1773
01:20:09,846 --> 01:20:11,223
You've got to be kidding me.

1774
01:20:12,682 --> 01:20:14,309
Explain this, then.

1775
01:20:14,392 --> 01:20:16,436
"Prepare a thick cut of belly meat."

1776
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,897
Kim Bong-cheon had a fat belly.
That's a thick cut.

1777
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:21,441
"Poke holes in the meat if it resists."

1778
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:24,778
-Is that why you made two holes?
-You made a hole in his forehead.

1779
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:27,697
Look at where it's bleeding out.
It's the same as the body.

1780
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:31,618
This looks exactly like the deceased,
especially with that fat belly.

1781
01:20:31,701 --> 01:20:34,704
-Look at the head and shoulder.
-They're identical.

1782
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:38,458
I was wondering why the body
was on display, and now I know why.

1783
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:41,002
Look at the shoulder, head, and the blood.

1784
01:20:41,586 --> 01:20:43,129
This guy is the most suspicious.

1785
01:21:31,761 --> 01:21:36,766
