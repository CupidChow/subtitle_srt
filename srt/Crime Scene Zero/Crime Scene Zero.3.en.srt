1
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:15,765
There has never been kimchi like this.

2
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,521
A historic annual revenue
of 500 billion won.

3
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:25,066
The driving force
behind the global kimchi craze.

4
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,861
KIMCHI, WHOLE RADISH KIMCHI

5
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:29,738
Do you even know
what real kimchi tastes like?

JANG BREADWINNER
CHAIRMAN OF JANG'S KIMCHI

7
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,325
Made with the love of serving it

8
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,745
at my family's dinner table.

9
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,625
Korea's best kimchi.

10
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,128
Jang's Kimchi.

11
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,850
THE LATE JANG BREADWINNER

12
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:07,859

JANG BREADWINNER'S FUNERAL PROCESSION

23
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,036
Have you seen Youngest?

24
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,288
How long do we have to wait for him?

25
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,332
-I'm sure he'll come soon.
-It's obvious.

26
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,251
He's probably passed out drunk somewhere.

27
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,711
When have you ever seen him drunk?

28
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,381
-Of all the things to be late for.
-Stop saying nonsense.

29
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,758
How can he be so careless today?

30
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:17,053
-I'm sure Father would love this.
-It's our final day with him.

31
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,722
He's at least coming
to his cremation, right?

32
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,641
Of course, he will.

33
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:22,892
Then let's just get going.

34
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,062
Everyone, it's time
to say farewell to the departed.

35
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,439
Gosh, honey…

36
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,774
Let's begin.

37
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:30,859
Father.

38
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,195
How could this have happened?

39
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,656
FUNERAL PROCESSION BEGINS
WITHOUT THE YOUNGEST SON

40
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:41,578
It's me, your youngest daughter.
Your favorite.

41
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,372
What are you talking about?
That's not true.

42
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,499
-Father.
-Please wait.

43
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,458
What?

44
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,377
-Breadwinner!
-Wait, who's this?

45
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,504
-Oh, Aunt.
-Aunt?

46
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,089
I thought she couldn't come.

47
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:57,594
How did you get here? Weren't all flights
canceled because of the snowstorm?

48
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,470
You made it somehow.

49
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,724
Please let me see
my brother's face for the last time.

50
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,142
I want to say goodbye.

51
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,311
-You should've come sooner for that.
-Oh dear.

52
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,938
She came all the way from the US.
What do we do?

53
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,523
Still, this is ridiculous.

54
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,317
Does everyone agree to this?

55
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,986
I don't think this is right.

56
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,822
-In that case…
-I don't know, do whatever you guys want.

57
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,408
Aunt. We'll let you see Father's face

58
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,368
-one last time.
-That's enough, Aunt.

59
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,495
Aunt, we get it already.

60
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,374
Do I have to do this?
Shouldn't you do it, Eldest?

61
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,461
I'm holding Father's portrait right now,
for goodness' sake.

62
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,922
What a mess this is.

63
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,757
-This is a first for me.
-Father…

64
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,302
Aunt, take a good look at him
for the last time.

65
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:43,556
Gosh, I can't bear to watch this.

66
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,434
We've already said our goodbyes

67
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,644
and all…

68
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,271
-What the heck?
-What?

69
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,398
-What the?
-What's this?

70
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,192
-Oh gosh!
-Oh my!

71
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,568
-This is insane!
-Oh my gosh!

72
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,238
-Isn't this Youngest?
-Why's this punk sleeping in here?

73
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,489
Oh my! Oh my gosh!

74
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,199
-What's wrong with him?
-Youngest!

75
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,660
-Stop joking around!
-Hey!

76
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,203
-What's going on?
-Oh my!

77
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,580
No, Youngest! Who would do this to him?

78
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,207
-What the heck is going on?
-Youngest!

79
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,918
Wake up, Youngest!

80
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,419
MURDER AT THE FUNERAL HALL I

81
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,713
THE DEATH OF THE YOUNGEST SON
OF A KIMCHI CHAEBOL FAMILY

82
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:31,729
CRIME SCENE ZERO

83
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,732
Wake up, Youngest!

84
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,943
-Wait.
-Excuse me!

85
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,361
-Excuse me!
-Where's Father?

86
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,487
What's going on here?

87
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,447
-Step away from the casket.
-Who are you?

88
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,284
-Hello, I'm An Detective.
-I can't believe this.

89
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,704
-Detective?
-Yes, this is now a homicide crime scene.

90
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,871
Homicide?

91
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,581
Are you saying someone killed my Youngest?

92
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,751
But first, what happened
to our father's body?

93
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,461
Where did our father go?

94
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,130
-What if the chairman is alive?
-That jerk.

95
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,882
Did he lose it?
What on earth was he doing in there?

96
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,344
-Don't call him jerk!
-So you found someone else's body

97
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,346
in the late Jang Breadwinner's casket?

98
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,599
Yes! But our father
was definitely in his casket.

99
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:12,520
-We all saw him when we said our goodbyes.
-All right.

100
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,896
She just arrived, right?

101
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,481
-That's our aunt.
-I see.

102
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,859
Apart from the person who just got here,

103
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,111
all the family members present
are now suspects.

104
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,238
-What nonsense is this?
-What, suspects?

105
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,825
-Unbelievable, she's so rude.
-That's my son right there!

106
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,702
Do you know what kind of family we are?

107
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,954
-How dare you call us suspects?
-Okay.

108
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,247
Please wait outside.

109
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,498
All of you suspects, please go.

110
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,792
-"All of you suspects"?
-But our father!

111
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,462
-Please leave.
-Fine, we'll do as you say for now.

112
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,838
This is ridiculous.

113
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,550
-Goodness.
-What is going on?

114
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,678
I can't see through the tears in my eyes.

115
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:49,766
How did he end up
in his dead father's casket?

116
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,934
Did someone switch the bodies?

117
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,062
-Hello, An Detective.
-Hey.

118
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,521
You're the assistant detective.

119
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,440
I'm Kang Minhee, the assistant detective.

120
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,067
Right.

121
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,985
I heard you were a smart one.

122
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,197
Do you know where this casket was
at the estimated time of death?

123
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,532
I checked
with the funeral director beforehand.

124
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,868
-I was told it was in the mortuary.
-The mortuary, huh?

125
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,162
Okay, then ask the funeral director

126
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:14,248
-to put this back where it was then.
-Sure.

127
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,625
Do we have that thing ready?

128
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:19,712
I've compiled details of the victim
as well as the five suspects.

129
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,130
Very impressive.

130
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,757
CASE FILE DELIVERED

131
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,300
Return the casket
and prepare for questioning.

132
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,343
I'll prepare right away.

133
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,346
What an obedient kid.

134
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,933
Victim, Jang Youngest.

135
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,851
A 33-year old male.

136
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,686
The youngest son of Jang Breadwinner

137
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,814
and the manager
of the Future Kimchi Strategy Department.

138
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,691
He was found dead
in Jang Breadwinner's casket

139
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,068
during the funeral procession.

140
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,820
The estimated time of death

141
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:47,031
is from 5 a.m., when the casket
was taken out of the freezer,

142
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,699
to 6 a.m., when the procession began.

143
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,537
A murder in a kimchi chaebol family?

144
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,164
Something smells here.

145
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,750
It smells spicy, all right.

146
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,877
WHAT IS THE TRUTH
BEHIND THIS SPICY-SMELLING CASE?

147
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,671

00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,347
The victim's eldest brother.

152
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,974
Third suspect, Jang Daughter.

00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,600

158
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,403
Fifth suspect, Kim Sweetheart.

159
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,821
A 33-year-old male.

Team Lead of Future Kimchi

161
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,702
The victim's subordinate
and Jang Daughter's fiancé.

162
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,662
I know you must be heartbroken

163
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:38,458
being at the funeral of a family member
and then losing another.

164
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,960
-Goodness, unbelievable.
-But don't worry.

165
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,671
I promise I'll find out

166
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,257
who murdered Mr. Jang Youngest and why.

167
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,927
By the way, I love Jang's Kimchi.

168
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,096
I'm a huge fan of your kimchi.

169
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,891
-You've got good taste.
-Our whole radish kimchi is very famous.

170
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:59,061
There isn't a single person in Korea
who didn't grow up eating our kimchi.

171
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,522
Our annual revenue right now
is nearly 500 billion won.

172
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,399
Wow, that's impressive.

173
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,651
How exactly have you contributed
to that success?

174
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,446
Man, that low-class lady is at it again.

175
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,032
By the way,
how did Chairman Jang pass away?

176
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,951
Dad.

177
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:17,622
-If he had a chronic illness or something…
-I still can't believe it.

178
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,957
…we'd have helped him
stay in good condition.

179
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:24,921
If his passing was unexpected,
did he perhaps not leave a will?

180
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,839
We'll follow the protocol

181
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,384
and have the will announced by our lawyer
once the funeral is over.

182
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,720
-You all better be nervous.
-Okay, then.

183
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:37,058
Please introduce yourselves
and your relationship to Jang Youngest.

184
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,559
Would you like to start, Ms. Park Wife?

185
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,438
I'm the lady of the Jang household,

186
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,816
and Youngest was my son.

187
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,027
-What's with her?
-I see.

188
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,572
My Youngest shouldn't have died this way.

189
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,326
He was so smart, capable, and polite
since he was little.

190
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,954
He excelled in his studies
and even studied abroad.

191
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,539
He then led
the Future Strategy Department.

192
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,040
You know who most companies

193
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,251
pick to lead their
future strategy departments, right?

194
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:06,379
In other words,
he was going to be the successor of…

195
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,089
Look here.

196
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,591
Is she allowed to spread lies like that?

197
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,885
-I was trying--
-They're all just nobodies.

198
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,221
I was trying to hold back,
given this situation.

199
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,683
But could you refrain from talking about
Youngest becoming the successor?

200
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:22,812
It was clear that he was slated to
be the successor.

201
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,815
-That was an undeniable fact.
-I suppose.

202
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,317
-But…
-Is that all?

203
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,194
You should also tell her your background.

204
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,322
-What background? Shut your mouth.
-Gosh, don't bring that up.

205
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,033
Why? Is there something unusual
about your background?

206
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:39,078
-It's nothing. Too embarrassing to say.
-I don't know exactly.

207
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,455
She's from a radish patch
or a cabbage patch or something.

208
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,332
Gosh, Eldest. She might hear you.

209
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,751
I already heard that.

210
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,421
Judging by the vibe here,

211
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,006
I'm guessing
they're not your biological children?

212
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,049
-They're awfully rude, aren't they?
-Come on, now.

213
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,260
They're not my children.

214
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,387
Look at their mugs.
Do they look related to me?

215
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,472
IT'S OBVIOUS THEIR DNA IS DIFFERENT

216
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,517
Then were you his mistress?

217
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,103
-What are you saying?
-She was his second wife.

218
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:07,273
-You're spot on.
-I'm legally on the family register

219
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,774
-as his current wife.
-At any rate,

220
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,611
if Mr. Youngest, the second wife's son
and youngest sibling,

221
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,946
was considered to be the successor,

222
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,532
you must've really wanted to kill him, no?

223
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,159
-You've got the wrong idea.
-Spot on.

224
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,077
You have an excellent grasp
of the situation.

225
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,371
This isn't just a kimchi household,

226
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,790
it's a dysfunctional household, isn't it?

227
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,792
-My goodness. Where's my lawyer?
-Am I wrong?

228
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,836
-She has a point.
-Hey, bring me my stun gun.

229
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,088
Why ask your lawyer for a stun gun?

230
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,632
Why do you need a stun gun?

231
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,635
See how dumb she is?
She couldn't have inherited the company.

232
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,054
-Please calm down. Now, Mr. Jang Eldest.
-How ridiculous.

233
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,889
-Please introduce yourself.
-All right.

234
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:41,932
I'm Jang Eldest,

235
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:45,436
the eldest son

236
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,937
of the late Chairman Jang.

237
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,940
I was what you'd call
the first in line for the succession.

238
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,195
I'm the Executive Director

239
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,781
-of Mr. Jang's Kimchi.
-Executive Director.

240
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:00,284
Whose kimchi is "Mr. Jang's Kimchi"?
Our is "Jang's Kimchi," kid.

241
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,286
-Yet he's the Executive Director.
-No wonder

242
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,830
-you're not the successor.
-You really are a dysfunctional family.

243
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,499
You can tell why he was set aside.

244
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,834
Next, Ms. Jang Daughter.
Can you introduce yourself?

245
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,002
Sure.

246
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:13,631
I'm the youngest daughter,

247
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:14,924
the apple of my father's eye.

248
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,510
-Probably a rotten apple.
-Looks rotten, yes.

249
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,262
But are you sure you're a daughter?

250
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,305
What did you just say?!

251
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,974
I get confused sometimes too,
but she's my little sister.

252
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:24,934
-You're gorgeous.
-Unbelievable.

253
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,269
I'm sorry, but she's my girlfriend.

254
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,980
-That's what makes you suspicious.
-Oh, babe.

255
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,649
You can't stop bragging about me, can you?

256
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,401
That's the main reason
why you're the most suspicious.

257
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,819
I want everyone to know.

258
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:38,531
Sure. Ms. Daughter,
what was Jang Youngest like?

259
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,907
What do you mean?

260
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,742
We didn't share a drop of blood.

261
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,245
He was self-centered just like his mom.

262
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:48,749
He lived a very comfortable life overseas

263
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,377
then crawled back home two years ago

264
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,131
-then started working…
-He came back after getting his MBA.

265
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,341
He went around watching NBA games.

266
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,594
-Yes, and?
-He went to the US

267
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,139
to spend all his time
watching basketball or whatever

268
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:07,101
and then started showing his face
around the company about two years ago.

269
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,228
But I refuse to acknowledge him.

270
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,730
Next, Mr. Kim Sweetheart?

271
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,858
I'm the team lead of the
Future Strategy Department.

272
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:18,154
I helped grow this company
along with Manager Jang Youngest.

273
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:23,159
I'll also become
a member of this family soon.

274
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,578
We're getting married
right after the funeral.

275
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,872
Maybe he didn't want this funeral to end

276
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,957
and made a reason for another one.

277
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,792
Because I'd have to get married
after the funeral?

278
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,627
Exactly.

279
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,920
-That's possible.
-That's not true.

280
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,298
Honestly, as her older brother,

281
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,967
I'm very grateful to this guy.

282
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,428
I'm grateful,
but I can't understand him at all.

283
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,555
-Next, Ms. Joo Daughter-in-law?
-Yes.

284
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,849
-Joo Belle-Fille.
-Joo Belle-Fille?

285
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,185
-Joo Belle-Fille.
-What a unique accent.

286
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,228
It means "daughter-in-law" in French.
You can call me Joo Belle-Fille.

287
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,481
-Or Joo Woodlouse.
-No.

288
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,733
-"Woodlouse"? What is that?
-Doesn't she look like one?

289
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:56,942
That's right.

290
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,445
-You're from overseas, right?
-Yes, that's right.

291
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,989
Do you know a city called Nice
in the south of France?

292
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,574
-I sure do.
-Yes, Nice.

293
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:04,617
-I'm from Nice.
-I know it.

294
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,871
I don't know what she's doing here
at our family gathering.

295
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,331
I don't think

296
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,750
that's something
the mistress should be saying.

297
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,084
Are you out of your mind?

298
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:15,503
I'm sorry.

299
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,506
-Do I need to slap some sense into you?
-I shouldn't laugh.

300
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,217
Anyway, I'm Youngest's sister-in-law.

301
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,134
-All right.
-Detective.

302
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,803
-Yes?
-I'll describe her in just two words.

303
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:27,014
-Widow and beggar. Write that down.
-Oh, I see.

304
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,977
Who could've known my husband's first wife
and her second son

305
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,479
would both die on the same day?

306
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,356
Daughter-in-law
unexpectedly became a widow.

307
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,691
The right thing to do then
is to leave the family

308
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,568
and remove herself
from our family register.

309
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,196
She's not related to this family by blood.

310
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,950
I should've realized she was up to no good
when she kept mooching off us.

311
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:50,287
What were all of you doing between 5 a.m.
and 6 a.m., the estimated time of death?

312
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,997
Mr. Jang Eldest, what were you doing?

313
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,958
I was the chief mourner,

314
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,460
so I kept vigil at the funeral parlor.

315
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,087
What about you, Ms. Jang Daughter?

316
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,840
I was here the whole time too.

317
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,800
She was pouring soju
down her throat earlier.

318
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:06,011
Well, how could I stay sober
when I was so sad?

319
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,805
So what if I had a drink or two?

320
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,723
-All right. Next, Ms. Park Wife?
-Yes.

321
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,643
I was obviously waiting
for the funeral procession.

322
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:16,105
Where else would I be?
I had to greet the mourners.

323
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,357
My Youngest
had his whole future ahead of him.

324
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,110
Right. Next, Joo Belle-Fille?

325
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,361
-Why thank you.
-Great pronunciation.

326
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,696
-Excellent pronunciation.
-Please go ahead.

327
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,824
I was collecting condolence money

328
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,909
and greeting the mourners.

329
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:32,663
-Probably to steal the money.
-Who assigned that task to that thief?

330
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,373
Okay. Next, Mr. Kim Sweetheart?

331
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:37,084
Well, as a future family member,

332
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,795
I was helping out at the funeral hall.

333
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,673
Then it was time for the procession,
so I was waiting for it to start.

334
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,592
-He worked hard, yes.
-Right.

335
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,051
So everyone's alibis are similar.

336
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,637
-But what about Chairman Jang?
-Yes?

337
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,764
-Where's his body?
-That's what I'm wondering too.

338
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,225
I think finding our father's body
is the top priority.

339
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,269
Where on earth is our dad?

340
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:58,272
We'll have to look for
Chairman Jang's body too.

341
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,399
-That's a must.
-Honey…

342
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:04,695
Now, we're going to pair up
and examine the crime scene.

343
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,363
Mr. Jang Eldest, come with me.

344
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,866
Ms. Jang Daughter and Mr. Kim Sweetheart,
you can team up.

345
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,285
-Okay.
-Are you leaving me with that woodlouse?

346
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,330
-You can go with Ms. Joo Daughter-in-law.
-Joo Daughter…

347
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,750
-Joo Belle-Fille.
-You two are perfect together.

348
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,960
I hope you all bring back lots of clues.

349
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,588
Whoever finds the fewest clues
will be regarded as the culprit.

350
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,548
-Okay. Let's go, babe.
-Let's go.

351
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,633
Oh man.

352
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,135
-Let's go.
-Let's move.

353
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,553

COLLECT CLUES FOR 15 MINUTES IN PAIRS

368
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,670
-Mother.
-Don't you even.

369
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,838
-There's something I want to tell you.
-What?

370
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,466
I think you really need to
know your place.

371
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,968
Why, you crazy…

372
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,719
-Babe.
-I'm…

373
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,805
Thank goodness I'm teamed up with you.

374
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,556
Whoever the culprit is,

375
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,058
what a piece of trash.

376
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,852
-How dare they drag my father out?
-Harsh words.

377
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,021
MORTUARY, LOBBY

378
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,732
We went to the lobby next to the mortuary,

379
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,860
and there was a schedule of the people
whose remains were taken away

380
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,363
and enshrined early this morning.

381
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:32,116
"Kang Descender, Drawer 4.
Procession at 5 a.m."

382
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,284
"Jang Breadwinner, Drawer 1.
Procession at 6 a.m."

383
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,412
Right, the funeral procedure.

384
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,830
FUNERAL HALL PAMPHLET

385
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,793
"Taken out of the mortuary freezer
an hour before the procession."

386
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:46,005
Right, then since the procession
was at 6 a.m.,

387
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,007
the body would've been taken out at 5 a.m.

388
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:52,302
The casket was in the mortuary then,
so the killer must've been there

389
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,804
around the estimated time of death.

390
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,889
MORTUARY

391
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,225
Good grief, Youngest.

392
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,270
Why are you there where Father should be?

393
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,606
WHERE CLEANING, SHROUDING, AND CASKETING
OF JANG BREADWINNER'S BODY TOOK PLACE

394
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,319
Oh goodness.
What's with this kid, seriously?

395
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,989
-Hang on.
-Why's he lying face down?

396
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,408
The casket was a lot bigger
than I expected it to be.

397
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,369
The body was clearly leaning to the right
for some reason.

398
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,831
-One hand is placed like this.
-The other hand is…

399
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,249
HIS LEFT HAND IS RAISED

400
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:25,502
Did he always wear this ring?

401
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,714
I don't think I've ever seen him
wear a ring like this before.

402
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,800
-Oh dear.
-Okay, now.

403
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,844
He died with his eyes open!

404
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,179
Jeez, that scared me.

405
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,764
For goodness' sake.

406
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:39,058
-Why are his eyes so sparkly?
-Oh gosh, he threw up.

407
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,393
Looks like he got fed something.

408
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,644
EYES WIDE OPEN AND TRACES OF VOMIT?

409
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,189
-This is vomit, isn't it?
-Looks that way.

410
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,857
I wonder what he vomited up.

411
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,486
I think I smell booze.

412
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,904
-What?
-Smell it.

413
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,073
It looks like…

414
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,908
Hey, what's that?

415
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,577
He got strangled.

416
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,329
Goodness.

417
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,789
-Hang on.
-How suspicious.

418
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,666
There are lots of cords here,
and he was strangled.

419
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,543
I see ropes as well.

420
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,004
There are so many things here
that could've been used to strangle him.

421
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,840
-This is…
-What's this?

422
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,050
"Methanol."

423
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,719
"Ethanol for disinfection. Methanol."

424
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,221
-It's alcohol.
-Alcohol?

425
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,263
Yes.

426
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,058
A BOX ON ONE SIDE OF THE LOBBY

427
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,351
Oh my, what's this?

428
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,728
Yes, methanol.

429
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,563
CONSUMPTION MAY LEAD
TO ACUTE ALCOHOL POISONING AND DEATH

430
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,065
Hold on.

431
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,525
Isn't this my son's jacket?

432
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,158
"Jang Youngest." It's his.

433
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,244
DID JANG YOUNGEST
TAKE IT OFF IN THE MORTUARY?

434
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,747
FOUND SOMETHING ELSE

435
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,873
"Fungmu Air"?

436
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,086
Was my dear son planning to go somewhere?

437
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,131
So this is where Chairman Jang was in.

438
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,508
Then where'd they put Dad?

439
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,717
-Maybe in here?
-Wait.

440
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,469
-He could be in here.
-They must've put him in here.

450
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,409
Father.

451
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,912
You're kidding me.
Who the hell did this to him?

452
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,082
Why is my husband labeled as a John Doe?

453
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,335
They stashed his body in here
on top of another body!

454
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,879
You're right.

455
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,256
Why did they put his body in this drawer?

456
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,508
Is there a particular reason
they chose this specific one?

457
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,469
The reception room.

458
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,806
When I asked what they were doing
at the estimated time of death,

459
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,891
they gave similar answers,

460
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,435
saying they were in the funeral parlor
or the reception room.

461
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,563
So I figured one of them must be lying.

462
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,983
All right, the trash can.

463
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,319
What the heck? Oh jeez.

464
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,822
Wait, what's this?

465
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,159
A BLOODY HANDKERCHIEF?

466
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:03,911
"MD"?

467
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,372

00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,405
A NOTE INSIDE THE LOST AND FOUND BOX?

515
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,365
"If you keep ignoring your mother

516
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,993
and don't come to the funeral parlor
15 minutes before the procession,

517
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,329
I'm going to burn to death
next to your father."

518
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,497
Did Park Wife write this?

519
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,624
Yeah, must be a note for Youngest.

520
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,169
Okay, Park Wife.

521
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,128
BREADWINNER AND WIFE'S ROOM

522
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:22,632
To be honest, I thought Youngest
and Park Wife were on good terms.

523
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,510
I had no idea
they had this conflict going on.

524
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:29,473
And she's being hounded
by all these debt collection texts,

525
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,224
which makes her very suspicious.

526
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,977
Why does she have this?

527
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,981
I guess her eyesight is going,
now that she's old.

528
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,860
"Lunch with Yeong-gi's mom."

529
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,988
"Premarital meeting between families
for Jang Youngest and Son Tofu."

530
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,782
So is this Son Tofu, then?

531
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,287
DIARY

532
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,708
"He's so cute. Who does he take after?"

533
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,543
"He learned the multiplication tables
by age seven."

534
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,671
"Youngest is back home."

535
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,632
"I'm the real lady of this household."

536
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,675
She calls this a diary?

537
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,472
TRASH CAN NEXT TO THE VANITY

538
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,101
CREDIT CARDS CUT IN HALF

539
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,519
These are all Park Wife's. What the heck?

540
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:18,480
Did Chairman Jang cut all these up
so she couldn't use them?

541
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,067
TIME TO DIG THROUGH THE VANITY

542
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,989
Oh my, a loan agreement.

543
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,950
CREDITOR: KO HIGH-INTEREST
DEBTOR: PARK WIFE

544
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,618
Three billion won?

545
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,370
Wait. 2.5 billion.

546
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,873
So 3 billion, 2.5 billion,

547
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:37,958
and another two billion.

548
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,586
These must be the people
who sent her all those texts.

549
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,924
"Per the Act for Designation
and Management of Green Belt,

550
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:49,553
the following area is being designated
as a development restriction zone."

551
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,597
Oh my.

552
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:55,851
My gosh.

553
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,771
"I, Park Wife,
swear on my son, Jang Youngest,

554
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,648
the successor to Jang's Kimchi."

555
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,860
JANG BREADWINNER'S STUDY

556
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,237
Who's this?

557
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,574
I guess he really adored Youngest.

558
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,742
He even had Youngest's picture here.

559
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,457
Even in this photo,
Youngest is right next to him.

560
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,377
I guess you're bound to have
a favorite child.

561
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:26,965
MARRY ME
VIP

562
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,133
"Marry Me."

563
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,302
Look at that.

564
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,887
Joo Daughter-in-law.

565
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,096
JOO DAUGHTER-IN-LAW'S PROFILE?

566
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,389
Why is her info here?

567
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,519
THROWN OUT IN THE TRASH CAN
NEXT TO THE DESK

568
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,397
JANG'S KIMCHI BANCHAN MENU LAUNCH PROPOSAL

569
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,191
I found a proposal by Jang Daughter
in the trash can.

570
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,234
SWEET-AND-SALTY BLUEBERRY KIMCHI PANCAKE

571
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,737
BRAISED KIMCHI MADE WITH ABC JUICE BROTH

572
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,197
Jang Daughter's proposal…

573
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,115
thrown out.

574
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,409
What could be in here?

575
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,535
All right.

576
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,458
"Report from Kim Secretary.
2 p.m., Kim Sweetheart."

577
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,086
"President of Master Cabbage.
Kim Sweetheart."

578
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,130
"Gwak Puppet of Fungmu Group.
Kim Sweetheart."

579
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,132
Why was he meeting
Kim Sweetheart so often?

580
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,099
There's a folder in here.

581
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,518
BUSINESS PLAN

582
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,894
"Tofu kimchi meal kit business."

583
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,479
"Submitted by Jang Youngest."

584
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,314
"Proposal to start a meal kit business."

585
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,775
"A tofu kimchi meal kit business
in collaboration

586
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,652
with Grandma Son's Handmade Tofu."

587
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:31,947
Manager Jang Youngest
was a very competent man.

588
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,533
ANOTHER FOLDER IN A DIFFERENT DRAWER

589
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,118
Oh, Delicious Daily.

590
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,704
"Machinery Entanglement Accident
at Jang's Kimchi."

591
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,122
ARTICLE ABOUT AN ACCIDENT
AT THE KIMCHI FACTORY

592
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,832
…WORKER A'S LEFT ARM GOT ENTANGLED
IN A MACHINE AT THE FACTORY…

593
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,918
So Jang Eldest

594
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:48,296
pinned everything
on a completely innocent employee.

595
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,839
I see he even committed assault.

596
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,219
So Manager Jang Youngest
ratted him out to the chairman.

597
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:57,430
If Eldest had known about this already,

598
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,182
I'd say that's a motive for murder.

599
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,935
JANG ELDEST'S ROOM

600
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,895
Okay, Eldest.

601
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,690
JANG ELDEST
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF JANG'S KIMCHI

602
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,818
What good is it
being born into a wealthy family?

603
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,863
All right, what do we have here?

604
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,408
"Three-Minute Tofu Kimchi."

605
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:19,160
The projected revenue
is a quadrillion won? Jeez.

606
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,829
This is why his ideas get rejected.

607
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,956
"Combining Jang's Kimchi

608
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,417
and the handmade tofu
from Grandma Son's Handmade Tofu."

609
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,835
Oh, Grandma Son again!

610
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:30,422
He had the same idea, but it got rejected.

611
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:35,760
They both wanted to collaborate
with Grandma Son.

612
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,846
But Eldest totally lost in a battle

613
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,598
over new business ideas.

614
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,890
Oh boy.

615
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:42,809
What's this?

616
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,105
"If you want to become the successor,
at least make the effort to learn."

617
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,942
"Eldest, it doesn't matter
what color the kimchi is."

618
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,862
"Always remember,
you're the Kimchi Prince."

619
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,573
"It doesn't matter
what color the kimchi is"?

620
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,493
I should check out all the drawers.

621
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,583
"Diploma."

622
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:10,253
So he attended Samryu University,
a low-tier university.

623
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,921
PRESIDENT OF SAMRYU UNIVERSITY

624
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,089
There's something else here.

625
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,008
HIDDEN UNDERNEATH THE DIPLOMA

626
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,429
Supply agreement form to the Blue House?

627
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,222
I doubt he did a good job
with this either.

628
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,308
Wait, what's this?

629
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:25,810
Oh man. This is…

630
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:26,728
(CAN HE NOT SEE?)

631
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:30,398
"Transfer all of Jang's Kimchi's shares
at no cost."

632
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,610
Oh wow,
this is a completely unfair contract.

633
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,696
JANG DAUGHTER'S ROOM

634
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,659
This has to be either Eldest
or Daughter's doing.

635
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,870
I mean, who stands to gain the most
by getting rid of Youngest?

636
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,831
That Daughter is disgustingly greedy.

637
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,292
I find her very suspicious.

638
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,087
"The Path to Become Number One
by Any Means Possible."

639
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,797
"I'm the Best." Jeez.

640
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,925
ON HER BOOKSHELF

641
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,301
"Jang Daughter."

642
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,844
"We played hide-and-seek after school."

643
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,138
"Gi-cheol tried to catch me,
so I cracked his skull with a rock."

644
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,473
Why, that crazy…

645
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,852
She's a total psychopath.

646
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,230
So she's always been like this, huh?

647
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,899
"I'll make you pay, Youngest"?

648
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,443
Oh, yes, I remember this.

649
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:18,697
What's this?

650
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,282
Try all you want. It won't work.

651
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,867
NEW MENU IDEA CONTEST
FOR JANG'S KIMCHI BANCHAN

652
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,083
"Made with the love of serving it
at my family's dinner table."

653
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,167
Of course.

654
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:32,711
Email inbox?

655
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,171
"Here is the tasting evaluation report."

JANG DAUGHTER'S NEW MENU ITEMS
TASTING EVALUATION REPORT

657
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,216
"Disgusting."

658
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,302
Who'd expect anything better from you?

659
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,596
KIM SWEETHEART: GLORIOUS
KIM AUTUMN: TRASH

660
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,100
Oh my goodness. Unbelievable.

661
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,647
So she played the piano too?

662
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,069
What's this?

663
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,364
Letter of appointment
issued to the Menu Development Team?

664
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,992
TEAM: MENU DEVELOPMENT
NAME: JANG DAUGHTER

665
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,953
JANG YOUNGEST'S ROOM

666
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,247
Oh, my son.

667
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,083
THE VICTIM, JANG YOUNGEST'S ROOM

668
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,960
Manager of the
Future Kimchi Strategy Department.

669
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,171
MBA.

670
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,006
MBA DIPLOMA, NOT NBA

671
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:21,468
What's this?

672
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,305
A TORN PIECE OF PAPER?

673
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,226
A written pledge?

674
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,771
Why did my son write something like this?

675
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,982
Hang on. What did I just see?

676
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,278
Hey.

677
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,575
Yes?

678
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,704
You.

679
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:51,915
-Did you knock out this wall?
-You…

680
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:54,876
-Did you seduce my son?
-Oh my goodness!

681
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,252
Oh my.

682
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,462
-My goodness.
-I'm onto you.

683
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,631
-Oh my.
-Did you seduce my son

684
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:00,965
and get caught by the chairman?

685
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,009
My goodness, what are you talking about?

686
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:05,136
Are you saying my son
wrote this pledge on his own?

687
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,180
"If Jang Youngest doesn't break up
with Joo Daughter-in-law,

688
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,140
his inheritance will be forfeited

689
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,683
and will be removed
from the family register."

690
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,938
Hang on a second.
Please let go of me first.

691
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:18,566
-Let go of me. Let go.
-No, I won't. I'll let go once you talk.

692
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,736
-Let go and I'll talk.
-Talk and I'll let go.

693
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,530
-Let go and I'll talk.
-You want this to go on forever?

694
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,782
-I don't feel like talking either.
-Then I'll keep holding on.

695
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:26,908
Okay, then. Shall we?

696
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,034
-Let's go.
-Fine by me.

697
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,370
-Let's go. Where should we look?
-This feels like a scalp massage.

698
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:33,414
You know, I should just shove you
in the mortuary freezer over there.

699
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,626
-Mother, I--
-Don't you dare call me that.

700
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:39,003
-Hey, old lady.
-Get down on your knees.

701
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:42,215
It'll be your portrait up there very soon.

702
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,842
But I've done nothing wrong.

703
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,469
-You wasted my time.
-Where's your room, you brat?

704
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,762
JOO DAUGHTER-IN-LAW'S ROOM

705
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,057
That sneaky little brat.

706
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,397
I'm so angry right now, my gosh!

707
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,571
Do you even have any hair left?

708
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,406
Why, that little…

709
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,911
Let's calm down. Calm down, Park Wife.

710
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,121
You can do this.

711
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,748
Why is there so much stuff around here?

712
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,460
What does she know about art?

713
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,420
What's this?

714
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,716
What? Wait, what's behind this?

715
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,178
Why, that bitch and bastard!

716
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,389
Are you serious?

717
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:32,682
HIDDEN BEHIND THE FRAME

718
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,145
A HOLE IN THE WALL?

719
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,981
SIGNS OF A SECRET AFFAIR

720
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,484
Honey! I should've just followed you

721
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,237
so I didn't have to witness this travesty!

722
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,615
Look what we have here?

723
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,617
They had this
secret little passageway, huh?

724
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,077
Must've been a lot of hard work.

725
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,455
They just had to crawl through a wall

726
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:58,166
to fool around together on this bed, huh?

727
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,168
This little bitch and bastard.

728
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,838
What's this? Are they perverts?

729
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:05,882
Why is there only one of them?

730
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,258
ONE FISHNET STOCKING?

731
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,470
So she crawled through this hole
from that room and then…

732
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,847
"I'm here."

733
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:17,226
"I only brought one stocking today."

734
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,479
Gosh, that's gross!

735
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:20,980
Let's see here.

736
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,315
I swear, you're…

737
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,108
IMMEDIATELY CAME TO LOOK THROUGH
JOO DAUGHTER-IN-LAW'S ROOM

738
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,152
See? I knew it.

739
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,029
The other one is right here.

740
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,156
Gross. How disgusting.

741
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,702
What are these?

742
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,415
"Prescription, Joo Daughter-in-law."

743
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:43,294
"Herbal medicine to warm the uterus
and induce pregnancy."

744
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:46,047
She got the same prescription
multiple times in 2008.

745
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,883
I guess she wanted a kid.

746
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,261
She was desperate to give birth to a son.

747
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,389
Look at all these peppers.

748
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,557
(TRASH CAN)

749
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,436
DISCARDED NOTES?

750
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,481
What's with this girl?
It's one thing after another.

751
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,233
What on earth?

752
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:08,361
"Let's slowly wither to death together"?

753
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:09,404
Unbelievable.

754
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,156
BOOKS ABOUT FRANCE

755
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,574
Why the books on exploring France?

756
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,284
Why would you read about French culture?

757
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,245
It's all a lie.

758
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,540
This is the bereaved family's lounge.

759
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,583
What's that?

760
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,420
Oh dear, who drank all this booze in here?

761
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,338
Who drank this?

762
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,548
ONLY DRANK THE SOJU?

763
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:29,841
Oh, the cabinet.

764
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,843
CABINET IN THE BEREAVED FAMILY'S LOUNGE

765
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,302
Looks like Youngest was using this one.

766
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,179
JANG'S KIMCHI
JANG YOUNGEST

767
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,347
Wait, but why…

768
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,266
Why is it locked?

769
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,977
Everyone else's is unlocked.

770
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,062
Huh? This one's locked too.

771
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,897
I didn't use any of these.
Who's using this one?

772
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,190
LOCKED, LOCKED, UNLOCKED

773
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,151
What's this?

774
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,485
PURSE FOUND IN THE OPEN CABINET

775
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,487
What's this? Whose is this?

776
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,323
Let's see. "Family counseling"?

777
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,450
Joo Daughter-in-law?!

778
00:33:55,533 --> 00:34:00,246
"Is it possible to marry
my deceased husband's younger brother?"

779
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,498
That f***ing bitch.

780
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,543
"Side effects
of an unidentified medicinal herb."

781
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,003
Are you kidding me?

782
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,798
Why'd she put all her makeup in the pouch

783
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,009
but leave her lip tint out in the bag?

784
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,344
It's a pretty color.

785
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,514
So this is Kim Sweetheart's house.

786
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,641
Kim Sweetheart.

787
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,186
How could he fall in love
with my little sister

788
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,563
and promise to spend
the rest of his life with her?

789
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,984
It means he's not all that strategic
when it comes to his future.

790
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,279
It's a bit strange,
which makes him the most suspicious.

791
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,655
HOW TO SMILE SEXY,
EVERYTHING ABOUT PLAYING HARD TO GET

792
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,783
Wow, he must be a genius at dating.

793
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,577
Hey, look at Sweetheart

794
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,370
in a green meadow.

795
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,081
GREEN MEADOW?

796
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,920
I guess he must've had a hard life.

797
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,171
Is this his mom?

798
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,802
What's this?

799
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:59,889
I may not have done much schooling,
but even I can read "Top Secret."

800
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,393
Joo Daughter-in-law?

801
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,146
"List of potential marriage partners."

802
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,066
What the heck was he up to?

803
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,237
Jeez, what else is here?

804
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,738
KIM SWEETHEART'S NOTEBOOK IN A DRAWER

805
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,616
What's this?

806
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:23,121
The secret behind the umami flavor
of our kimchi was MSG?

807
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,038
What?

808
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:28,417
Why was he digging into my family?
What is he, a detective?

809
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,710
Man, seriously.

810
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,963
This is confusing, all right.

811
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,844
This guy is ridiculous.

812
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,100
-Detective.
-Yes?

813
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,017
Are you busy?

814
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,145
Isn't this a certain someone we know?

815
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:49,939
This guy's just…

816
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,150
January 1999.

817
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,403
This guy's a mystery. What is this?

818
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,487
LOSER AND SWEETHEART'S REUNION

819
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,738
Your time is up.

820
00:35:58,656 --> 00:35:59,782
Ms. Park Wife?

821
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:02,326
Excuse me, is there space in the mortuary?

822
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,953
Book a spot for me.

823
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:06,205
A woman in her thirties
will be there soon.

824
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,332
I see you lost a lot of hair.

825
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,917
Really? Is there a bald spot?

826
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:10,877
Looks airy.

827
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,425
COMBINE THE CLUES

828
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,178
Okay, everyone. Did you find many clues?

829
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,890
Find what? We all know who the culprit is.

830
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,850
Why make us go through all that trouble?

831
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:29,061
Is there anyone who'd like to speak first?

832
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,022
Let's start with the kids.

833
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,982
Let's start with Ms. Park Wife.

834
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,525
You rude brat.

835
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,735
Young people these days.

836
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,445
You just look the youngest here.

837
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,404
Why thank you.

838
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:41,115
FIRST BRIEFING: PARK WIFE

839
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,034
First of all, my son.

840
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:46,412
He was lying face down.
It must've been so suffocating.

841
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,956
My son was very healthy.

842
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,251
But I found some brown vomit
around his mouth.

843
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,878
Someone clearly fed him something.

844
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:57,256
If my son went in the casket,

845
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,801
where was my husband,
the original occupant of the casket?

846
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,764
So I searched the mortuary refrigerator,

847
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:07,183
and he was in the second drawer

848
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,477
that was meant for a John Doe.

849
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,854
-I saw it too.
-But everyone, what can you tell

850
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,981
from the fact
that he was in the top drawer?

851
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,816
That a strong man must've put him there.

852
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,195
If you think about it, it's much easier
to put a body in the bottom drawers.

853
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,906
But wouldn't a strong woman
be able to do it?

854
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,115
I have the same suspicions.

855
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,118
-My girlfriend's really strong.
-She's at least stronger than me.

856
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,703
It's true that Jang Daughter

857
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,831
has been ruthless since she was a kid.

858
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,584
She kept her childhood picture diary.

859
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,753
When you played hide-and-seek back then,

860
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,338
did you or did you not crack
Gi-cheol's head open?

861
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,298
-Cracked his head open?
-I saw it, so I cracked it.

862
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,217
-What's wrong with that?
-And did you or did you not snap

863
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,219
Ha-ni's leg during a running race?

864
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:46,097
I saw it, so I snapped it.
What's wrong with that?

865
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,431
And during the treasure hunt,

866
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,976
did you or did you not take
the treasures Jeong-eun found?

867
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,270
I saw them, so I took them.
What's wrong with that?

868
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,729
-You take or break whatever you see?
-Yeah!

869
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,106
Oh, yeah? Is that why--

870
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,190
I'm the best!

871
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,026
Is that why you also slit
my Youngest's throat back then?

872
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,695
-She slit his throat?
-You never knew, did you?

873
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:01,696
She slit his throat?

874
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,155
-I knew about that.
-Right.

875
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,658
-Surely Eldest remembers.
-Eldest, tell them what happened.

876
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,703
-Years ago, when they were kids…
-Seems like you're the killer.

877
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,788
…my husband held a singing contest
at the kimchi factory.

878
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:13,874
And Youngest, who took after me,
was an incredible singer.

879
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,543
She slit his throat with the trophy

880
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,378
when she thought
she wouldn't get first place.

881
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,338
-My dear Youngest nearly died then!
-That's crazy.

882
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:22,425
-Well, I--
-I'm telling you, she's a psychopath.

883
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:26,345
I heard the sound of a pig squealing,
so I only took care of it.

884
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,723
I didn't know
you were such a troublemaker.

885
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,392
You should be grateful
that you're a terrible singer.

886
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,728
So you would've also slit his throat
if he had been a good singer, huh?

887
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,146
I don't discriminate.

888
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:38,733
My girlfriend is very nice
despite how she looks.

889
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,985
Kim Sweetheart compliments her a lot,

890
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:43,279
and it seems like
he does that a lot at work too,

891
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,323
which bothers me a bit.

892
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:48,534
I found a tasting evaluation report
for new menu items in the inbox.

893
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:53,289
But Daughter got a little carried away
and came up with too many items.

894
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:56,751
Everyone called them trash,
and some even said, "Who'd eat this?"

895
00:38:56,834 --> 00:39:01,756
But Kim Sweetheart went on and on
about the flavors and complimented her.

896
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,092
So the evaluator who came after
asked if the person above was crazy.

897
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:09,513
She came up with such creative ideas
using kimchi as the base.

898
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,182
Isn't that in itself pretty brilliant?

899
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:15,061
But my son works here too,
so he also evaluated these menus.

900
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:18,189
What if she had actually
resented him for that all along?

901
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,274
She's had violent tendencies
since she was little,

902
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,652
so maybe she snapped one day
and went after Youngest.

903
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,529
Jang Daughter is fully capable of that.

904
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:29,241
Plus, this is clearly a fight
over succession.

905
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,160
Isn't it obvious?

906
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,620
I found that Eldest

907
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,663
wrote some type of contract.

908
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:35,748
A contract?

909
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:36,957
It was in his room.

910
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:40,252
You see, he went to Samryu University
because his grades were terrible.

911
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:43,005
There was a supply agreement
with the Blue House

912
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,007
he secretly kept behind his diploma,

913
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:48,719
but he signed this contract
with a guy named Sa Conman, of all people.

914
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:49,637
Try repeating his name.

915
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,222
-Sa Conman.
-Sa Conman.

916
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,474
-As in, con man.
-You get what I mean, right?

917
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:57,603
It says, "If this agreement
is even slightly violated,

918
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:00,940
Jang Eldest will transfer
all of Jang's Kimchi shares at no cost."

919
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,858
Are you out of your mind?

920
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:07,363
I bet my husband
found out about this contract

921
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,198
or something along the lines of that.

922
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:11,575
Which is what got me thinking,

923
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,702
maybe my husband didn't die

924
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,246
of natural causes.

925
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,414
What?

926
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,208
-What brings on a heart attack?
-Unbelievable.

927
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,793
He'd have to be shocked.

928
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,670
Shocked enough to affect his heart.

929
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,339
Eldest, did your father
know about this or not?

930
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,551
What is there to hide?
Father knew about all of that.

931
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,302
-Father knew about that?
-Yeah!

932
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:31,971
-He must've been mad.
-Oh dear.

933
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,681
-Shocked enough to get a heart attack.
-Hey.

934
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:36,684
Do you think I did that
to destroy our company?

935
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,478
I was just trying my best in my own way.

936
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,440
When you do business, you sometimes
get tangled up with weirdos and stuff.

937
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,524
Detective.

938
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,526
-Yes?
-That's the kind of person he is.

939
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,612
This nobody from a radish patch
thinks she can just run her mouth.

940
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,115
Stop with the radish patch, okay?

941
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,033
She's just a nobody from a radish patch.

942
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,410
No wonder she's dumb.

943
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:55,953
-Hey.
-Good gracious.

944
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:58,831
How long has it been
since your husband died, Joo Woodlouse?

945
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,126
Could you repeat the question?

946
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,503
How long ago did your husband die,

947
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,880
Joo Woodlouse?

948
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,800
My husband and mother-in-law
both passed away in 2009.

949
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,678
It's been three years
since my younger brother died.

950
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:18,058
This is why they say not to let
just anyone into your family.

951
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:20,936
In that little French beggar's room,

952
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,689
I found a little hole in the wall.

953
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:24,690
Oh my.

954
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:25,858
Did anyone else see it?

955
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,777
Guess where that hole leads to?

956
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,821
My son… My son's room.

957
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,573
-What?
-A hole in the wall?

958
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,783
She was going in and out of that hole

959
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,369
-to try and seduce my son!
-What?

960
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,121
It wasn't a hole in the wall

961
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,206
but a tunnel of love.

962
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:43,792
-She seduced her own brother-in-law!
-Stop saying he's her brother-in-law.

963
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:47,546
-I have something to say.
-My brother's body isn't even cold yet!

964
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,509
I didn't seduce him.

965
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:54,970
This old lady bullied me every day.

966
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,805
She even slapped me with kimchi.

967
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,140
Because you deserved it.

968
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,851
Then my sweet Youngest came to me one day…

969
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:04,313
-"My sweet Youngest"?
-…and apologized on behalf of his mom.

970
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:07,233
Unlike his mom,
I'm actually a woman with class.

971
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,692
Which is why

972
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,653
he said he fell for me.

973
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,988
-So did you fall for him too?
-So…

974
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,073
Ma'am?

975
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:15,658
-So we dated in secret.
-You dated?

976
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:18,035
-How long? Since when?
-We couldn't get caught.

977
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,286
Since you were married?

978
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,872
-For about two years.
-Unbelievable.

979
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,040
-Two years?
-Two years?

980
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:25,584
You filthy brat!
Just a year after your husband died?

981
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,628
-Two years?
-We couldn't help it.

982
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,171
-The audacity.
-Two years?

983
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,132
-What about that ring?
-He found you that irresistible?

984
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,676
-The ring!
-I guess he did.

985
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,761
-Explain the ring.
-Was it a promise ring?

986
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:36,804
The ring?

987
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:37,805
The gold ring.

988
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,223
Let me take a look.

989
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:40,766
EXAMINING HER HAND

990
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,226
Where? Let's see.

991
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,853
I'm not wearing any rings.

992
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:48,440
So you married Second Son
and dated Youngest.

993
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:49,858
Was Eldest next in line?

994
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,654
-Is that even a question?
-Surely she has standards too.

995
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,322
Not him, right?

996
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,575
The reason I found her suspicious

997
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,411
was because my husband
had found out about the two.

998
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:02,788
-What?
-I found a written pledge torn into pieces

999
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,164
in Youngest's room,

1000
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:08,252
saying he'd give up his inheritance
if he started seeing her again.

1001
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:09,461
What's more,

1002
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:14,675
my Youngest was found
without his funeral suit jacket on.

1003
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,385
For some reason,

1004
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:19,263
his jacket was hanging
on a hanger in the mortuary.

1005
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,889
So I searched the pockets

1006
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:24,226
and found an envelope from Fungmu Air,
but no tickets inside.

1007
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,687
Were you two going to take off somewhere?

1008
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,733
He did ask me to run away with him.

1009
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:32,526
And did you say no?

1010
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,194
Because then all of it
goes down the drain.

1011
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,863
Well, I just put it on hold.

1012
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,782
Obsessive love affairs
can be a dangerous thing.

1013
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:43,203
Let me end my briefing by saying
that's what I find most suspicious here.

1014
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,997
-Thank you.
-That sort of thing…

1015
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:45,998
A round of applause.

1016
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,459
A round of applause for what?

1017
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,836
-She was about to clap just now.
-Applaud her.

1018
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:53,005
Ms. Jang Daughter, you're up next.

1019
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,006
-Me?
-Yes.

1020
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:56,133
Oh dear, I'm not prepared yet.

1021
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:00,721
-Goodness.
-That scared me.

1022
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,058
All right.

1023
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,436
First of all,
this is the ethanol and methanol

1024
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:08,979
I found in the mortuary.

1025
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,441
These also had warning labels

1026
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:16,987
that said they could be fatal
if they were used in excess.

1027
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:20,366
But I don't think we can definitively say

1028
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:23,911
that Youngest's cause of death
was drinking a poisonous substance.

1029
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:24,828
Why?

1030
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,830
Because there was
a clear strangulation mark

1031
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,833
-on his neck.
-That's right.

1032
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,960
-And he died with his eyes open, right?
-Right.

1033
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:34,046
-His eyes were wide open.
-That could mean

1034
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:37,216
that it's likely he died
while being strangled.

1035
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:39,677
How do you know so much about that?
I didn't know at all.

1036
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,097
In that case, let me give you
an audio-visual demonstration.

1037
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:47,685
You horrible brat.

1038
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,144
Now, Joo Daughter-in-law.

1039
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,189
-Joo Belle-Fille.
-Yeah, okay.

1040
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,774
-Joo Belle-Fille.
-Whatever.

1041
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,902
You'd better answer honestly from now on.
Got that?

1042
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:58,529
Okay.

1043
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:02,616
From the moment
Joo Daughter-in-law joined our family,

1044
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,160
she was almost obsessed

1045
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,829
with conceiving a child.

1046
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:09,832
There must've been pressure
to continue the Jang family line.

1047
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:13,293
I mean, I couldn't just sit back

1048
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:17,005
and let the son of a mistress
become the successor.

1049
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:20,634
Let me show you
how desperate she was for a child.

1050
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,929
From 2007 to 2008,

1051
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:26,849
-she got prescriptions…
-That's right.

1052
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:31,353
…and regularly took herbal medicine
that would help with conceiving.

1053
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:34,189
-I don't deny it.
-She tried hard to have a child,

1054
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,233
but after Second Son died,

1055
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:39,528
she fell in love with Youngest,
as childish as that sounds.

1056
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,573
But legally,

1057
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:46,243
since she was married to Second Son,

1058
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:48,871
she couldn't marry
her current brother-in-law.

1059
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:49,913
However,

1060
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:54,376
marriage would've been allowed
if she was pregnant.

1061
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:57,629
That's the advice she got from a lawyer.

1062
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:00,257
-Is that lawyer out of their damn mind?
-This woodlouse looked into that?

1063
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,926
-Joo Woodlouse looked into that too.
-Yes, this woodlouse did that.

1064
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,261
-I looked into it.
-However!

1065
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:05,554
However!

1066
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:08,724
Your plan failed.

1067
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:09,850
Why?

1068
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:12,978
She was diagnosed as infertile.

1069
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,230
What was the reason, you ask?

1070
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,608
The herbal medicine.

1071
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:21,487
The herbal medicine
caused her infertility.

1072
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,738
Infertility?

1073
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:25,407
-Let's just say "subfertility."
-Subfertility?

1074
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,910
-It might not be completely impossible--
-No.

1075
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,912
-She was diagnosed as infertile.
-She was?

1076
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:31,705
Do you think I knew when I took it?

1077
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,124
-That I'd become infertile?
-Of course, you didn't.

1078
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:38,253
But what if someone had tampered
with that herbal medicine?

1079
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:39,296
Who would do that?

1080
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:41,882
-Probably her, no?
-This is what I think.

1081
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,593
The only person
who could've messed with that medicine

1082
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:46,428
-is the old lady here.
-Me?

1083
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:47,971
The one person

1084
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:50,974
who can't allow any more male heirs
being born into this family.

1085
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,684
Who else could it be but you?

1086
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,102
Who made the medicine?

1087
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:56,230
Well, you'd get Western medicine
from a pharmacist

1088
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,981
and herbal medicine
from Korean medicine doctors.

1089
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:00,609
That doctor named "Ha K-Doctor"

1090
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:02,945
must've had ties with someone here.

1091
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,197
-But you don't know who it is?
-Not yet.

1092
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,283
We'll have to dig deeper into this
to find out.

1093
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,409
But here's a twist.

1094
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:12,913
You went on about
how you loved each other so much,

1095
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:17,209
but I found four notes in your trash can.

1096
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,794
One of them said,
"I'm going to destroy you."

1097
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:21,004
Who was that meant for?

1098
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,256
I never wrote anything like that.

1099
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,174
Compare the handwriting. It wasn't mine.

1100
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,386
So were things good between you guys
up until his death?

1101
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,429
-With whom? My sweet…
-Youngest.

1102
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,889
-My sweetie pie?
-Yeah.

1103
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:33,934
-Who?
-What?

1104
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,978
I used to call him my sweetie pie.

1105
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:37,229
-Is that so?
-"Sweetie pie."

1106
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,815
So you're saying you two
were on good terms until the end.

1107
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:43,527
Our feelings were just like
any other couple's.

1108
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:44,820
Okay, then. Old lady.

1109
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:47,447
-Were you on good terms with Youngest?
-What?

1110
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,325
-Are you serious? Of course. He's my son.
-Nonsense!

1111
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,286
Why are you shouting?

1112
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:57,165
I found a note
written by Youngest's mom, Park Wife.

1113
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:59,501
It looked like it was just thrown away.

1114
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,670
-Why'd he throw it out?
-The note said

1115
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:04,548
"If you don't come to the funeral parlor
15 minutes before the procession,

1116
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,466
I'm going to burn to death

1117
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,719
-next to your father."
-Oh my!

1118
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:11,763
Don't you know what moms say the most?

1119
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,682
"If you keep this up, I'll die early."

1120
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:15,434
"I'll bite my tongue and die."

1121
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:17,185
It was just an empty threat.

1122
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:20,397
An Detective,
I hope you catch the real killer.

1123
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,315
-Okay.
-That was random.

1124
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,525
-Applause, everyone.
-So sexy.

1125
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:24,735
Thank you.

1126
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:26,028
AN DETECTIVE IS FAIR WITH HER APPLAUSE

1127
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,071
-Joo Belle-Fille.
-Oh, yes, that's me.

1128
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:31,158
Let's see what kind of crap
you pull this time.

1129
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:36,038
I started with our old lady,
Ms. Park Wife.

1130
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:39,207
You really made my life so miserable.

1131
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:42,544
It seems you invested in some land.

1132
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:47,591
This is a notice
about a development restriction zone.

1133
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:51,511
You invested in some land
in Maniac Province,

1134
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,889
but it ended up being designated
as a green belt.

1135
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:54,932
Oh my.

1136
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,351
How much did you invest? I'm just curious.

1137
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:00,395
Not much, just 10 billion won.

1138
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:03,732
Oh dear. You just paid for crap.

1139
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:08,153
And she borrowed that ten billion
from a lot of people.

1140
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:12,282
So she received a lot of messages
demanding that she pay them back.

1141
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,785
Of course, Father would
never give her that much money.

1142
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,536
What were the contents of the messages?

1143
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,748
"Give me my money back, you damn bitch."

1144
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:22,209
Oh my. She just…

1145
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,878
-That feels weirdly offensive.
-That was a vivid reenactment.

1146
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,380
-Right to her face too.
-What else was there?

1147
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:29,758
There was even a text from someone
who said they came to the funeral hall.

1148
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:30,759
-Oh my.
-Goodness.

1149
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:34,763
So this woman actually wrote a pledge
swearing on her son.

1150
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:36,223
"I, Park Wife,

1151
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:39,226
swear on my son, Jang Youngest,
the successor to Jang's Kimchi,

1152
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,269
that I will repay my debts

1153
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:45,357
once Jang Breadwinner's will
is made public."

1154
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,484
-Listen, everyone.
-Then she can't have her son die.

1155
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:50,946
Use your brains
even if you have peas for brains.

1156
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:53,156
Youngest was my last hope.

1157
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,034
-Would I destroy that with my own hands?
-That's not it.

1158
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:58,870
Do you know how her last hope reacted?

1159
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:00,414
His text to her says,

1160
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,874
"You pay back your own debts."

1161
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,585
-He was only saying that.
-And to that text,

1162
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:10,048
Ms. Park Wife responded,
"Do you want to see your mom die?"

1163
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,633
-You got caught for that?
-Is that why…

1164
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,427
Is that why you left that note to him?

1165
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,638
Yes, she got caught for that too.

1166
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:19,850
She spoke with an inheritance law attorney

1167
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:23,020
for about 30 minutes from 1:40 a.m.

1168
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,312
Of course, I did.

1169
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:26,398
-What did you talk about?
-I obviously had questions

1170
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:28,066
after my husband's passing.

1171
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:32,154
-I see. You even recorded the phone call.
-Oh my. What was it about?

1172
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:35,699
My memory's no good anymore.
Remind me what it was.

1173
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:37,492
-You said your son had to die.
-My gosh!

1174
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,910
I said that?

1175
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,328
I had no idea.

1176
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:42,581
-I don't remember saying that.
-She's insane.

1177
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:45,709
I'm still the biological mother
of the inheritor.

1178
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,836
Isn't there a legal way
I can claim some assets,

1179
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:51,089
even if my son refuses
to share any of his inheritance?

1180
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:56,136
Your son is an adult, not a minor.

1181
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:59,306
So if he doesn't wish to share,
there's nothing we can do.

1182
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:01,141
Unless your son dies, that is.

1183
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,225
What?

1184
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,270
Unless my son dies?

1185
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,565
Yes. Since he's still unmarried,

1186
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:12,652
you would receive all his inheritance
as his direct ascendant.

1187
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,572
To that, she said, "Unless he dies, huh?"

1188
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,074
That's just the lawyer's way

1189
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:19,576
-of telling me there was no way.
-"So he has to die."

1190
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:22,579
She said it like she was considering it.

1191
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,623
-Anyway, Detective.
-She's the craziest one here.

1192
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,166
They say in life,

1193
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:29,419
fortune and misfortune come hand in hand.

1194
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:33,548
-I can't sit here. She's freaking me out.
-Look at her acting.

1195
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:34,925
Unbelievable.

1196
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:37,010
Honestly,

1197
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:42,265
I find it hard to picture Park Wife
committing such a heinous act

1198
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:45,310
of murdering her own son.

1199
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:47,145
But come to think of it,

1200
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:49,397
she had a long-term plan in place

1201
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:52,776
ever since she gave birth to Youngest.

1202
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:55,529
She wanted to
take over this household through him.

1203
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,280
Circumstantially,

1204
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:00,450
she would've been the most furious

1205
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:04,162
to see her grand plan fall through.

1206
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:07,165
I think we could even find
a conclusive lead

1207
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:11,545
that takes us one step closer to the truth
and reveals why she had to kill him.

1208
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,338
Now, moving on.

1209
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:16,925
Jang Daughter,
I noticed you played the piano.

1210
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:19,928
I opened up the piano bench, and--

1211
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,138
Why the hell did you do that?!

1212
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:25,267
There was a letter appointing you
as the CEO of the subsidiary,

1213
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,685
Jang's Kimchi Banchan.

1214
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:29,229
But the font used to write your name

1215
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:32,107
was slightly different
from all other sections.

1216
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,359
It was as if someone wrote it out by hand.

1217
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:35,694
Who wrote that?

1218
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,905
Fine, I wrote it.

1219
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,073
What's it to you?

1220
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,367
Because you couldn't get the job
on your own?

1221
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:44,578
Okay.

1222
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:45,620
I said to Father,

1223
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:49,416
"What have you ever done for me?
Give me a position too."

1224
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:52,711
-But he wouldn't, so I got angry.
-Because you're not capable enough.

1225
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:55,505
Right, so I took it.

1226
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:58,091
And I filled it in myself
but not to make myself the CEO.

1227
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,468
I just kept it
in my piano bench afterward.

1228
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:04,639
Was Youngest perhaps a threat to you
in getting that position?

1229
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,099
-That position?
-Yeah.

1230
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,726
That position's got nothing to do with it.

1231
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:10,604
I only did that two days ago.

1232
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,857
I just…

1233
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:17,110
-I see you're stammering a bit.
-I know, right?

1234
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:20,030
Two days ago is very close
to the day of the murder.

1235
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:22,073
-I mean…
-You seem too worked up.

1236
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,658
What, did I say I became the CEO?

1237
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:26,620
-Can't I just hold on to a keepsake?
-I'm just saying.

1238
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:30,165
What about you?
You want a kid but can't have one.

1239
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:32,334
That doesn't make you a murderer, does it?

1240
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:35,962
-What nonsense is that?
-You can't just attack her like that.

1241
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,547
-You keep bringing up…
-That's hurtful.

1242
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,507
-…something painful for me.
-That's not right.

1243
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:41,259
-You're a woman yourself.
-I'm hurting too!

1244
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:42,344
-I'm hurting too.
-Babe.

1245
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:43,762
-You're in the wrong here.
-I'm done.

1246
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:46,264
-He's right.
-Apologize to her, babe.

1247
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:48,350
-Yeah, let's end on a good note.
-Listen to him.

1248
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,352
-Sorry about that.
-You have to show some respect.

1249
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,645
All right, you si bel homme.

1250
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,605
What did you call me?

1251
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:56,358
I know it sounds like "mofo" in Korean,
but it means "handsome man" in French.

1252
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,692
A beautiful man.

1253
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:00,654
-I don't think she's even been to France.
-Thanks for that.

1254
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,614
Let's hear from Mr. Kim Sweetheart next.

1255
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:03,949
Okay.

1256
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:08,286
I will now uncover the secrets
of the Jang family.

1257
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,122
-What a ridiculous preface. Secrets?
-Sure, go ahead.

1258
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:15,919
I thought you might say that,
so I dug very thoroughly into you, Eldest.

1259
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:18,421
-Why bother wasting your time?
-Jeez, Eldest.

1260
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:19,422
First of all,

1261
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,634
I found a note.

1262
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:24,135
-Written by whom?
-I wonder who would've…

1263
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:27,347
One was from his mom
that sounded like she was comforting him.

1264
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:30,475
And the other was from his dad
telling him off.

1265
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,894
It sounds like he was getting scolded
for not doing something properly.

1266
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:34,980
It's all in the past.

1267
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,731
I had to do what Father told me.

1268
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:39,943
-He wrote that ages ago.
-So did you start from the bottom or what?

1269
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:43,321
I would've gotten an earful
if I hadn't shown up to the factory,

1270
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,240
so how could I not be there?

1271
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:46,908
-Are you sure?
-You did?

1272
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:50,120
-As if you actually worked there.
-I don't buy it.

1273
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:52,455
-She's right.
-While his dad's note was all wrinkled,

1274
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,624
his mom's note was all nicely laminated.

1275
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,584
-Really? How sad.
-When I read the note,

1276
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:59,296
it said, "It doesn't matter
what color the kimchi is."

1277
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:03,133
So I thought, "Who doesn't know
what color kimchi is?"

1278
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:06,344
Then I remembered the documents
I found in Chairman Jang's study.

1279
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:09,347
There was an accident a while ago

1280
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,891
-at the kimchi factory.
-Oh my.

1281
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,518
An employee was injured

1282
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:17,147
because someone mixed up
the "Go" and "Stop" buttons

1283
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,024
-and pressed the wrong one.
-Oh no.

1284
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:20,483
Right, I remember that.

1285
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,736
Stop buttons are usually red,

1286
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,113
-and start buttons are usually green.
-Oh my.

1287
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:28,783
Next to the news article,
there was a report made to Chairman Jang

1288
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,493
written by Manager Jang Youngest.

1289
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:35,165
He tattled that Eldest
was the one responsible for the accident

1290
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:38,501
and that he also verbally
and physically abused

1291
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:41,087
and mistreated the employees.

1292
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,756
Please, that's ridiculous.

1293
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,341
You did all that stuff, Eldest?

1294
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:45,342
What?

1295
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,551
-What was that all about?
-Eldest.

1296
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:48,636
-Do you remember this book?
-That's rich coming from…

1297
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,389
What's that?

1298
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,392
What color is this book?

1299
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:55,685
Come here, you bastard.

1300
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:57,312
What color is this book?

1301
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:58,772
Come here, you bastard.

1302
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,231
-He doesn't know.
-Oh my.

1303
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:03,318
It's not that I don't know.
How dare you disrespect your elder?

1304
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:05,820
-I'm just asking. Just answer me.
-My gosh.

1305
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:07,364
-What color is this?
-Eldest, what color is it?

1306
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:08,823
-You guys are ridiculous.
-Just tell him.

1307
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:09,949
Tell him what?

1308
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,702
-Don't you know how important color is?
-Wait.

1309
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,162
-Oh my.
-So you're…

1310
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:15,538
Eldest…

1311
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,166
you have red-green color blindness, right?

1312
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:19,751
Are you looking down on me?

1313
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:22,837
-That's why he almost got conned.
-Hey, you.

1314
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:26,466
He signed a contract with the Blue House.

1315
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,009
But that contract…

1316
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:30,136
-Right!
-…had a very harmful clause.

1317
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,888
Wait, what's this?

1318
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:34,474
Oh man. This is…

1319
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:35,475
THE WRITING THAT WASN'T EASY TO READ

1320
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:38,770
"Transfer all of Jang's Kimchi's shares
at no cost."

1321
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:39,687
This is…

1322
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:42,065
It was printed in red letters
and highlighted in green.

1323
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:43,024
No way.

1324
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,860
My eyesight's fine,
and even I struggled to read it.

1325
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,695
Someone who couldn't tell
these colors apart

1326
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:49,572
-like Eldest here…
-I wondered why.

1327
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,866
-…could easily get scammed by this.
-Goodness.

1328
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,369
-That damn con man.
-Oh dear.

1329
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:58,081
-But they're the real bad guys here, no?
-He just made a silly mistake.

1330
00:56:58,164 --> 00:56:59,624
Yes, my brother just…

1331
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:01,000
How could they?

1332
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,919
My brother can't tell colors apart.

1333
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:04,671
He can't even tell up from down.

1334
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:07,715
-Hey, that's enough.
-Oh, I feel so bad for him.

1335
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,551
Stop bringing that stuff up, okay?

1336
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:11,302
-Stop bringing up my struggles.
-I see.

1337
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:14,931
Also, Eldest and Youngest

1338
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:17,267
were in a bit of a business competition,

1339
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,145
but only Manager Jang Youngest's proposal
was approved

1340
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:22,355
while Eldest's was rejected.

1341
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,732
They're basically the same thing.

1342
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,192
-They're different.
-How are they the same?

1343
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,653
"Three-Minute Tofu Kimchi,"
"Kimchi Meal Kit," same difference.

1344
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:31,823
How come Youngest got all the support
when he was doing the same thing?

1345
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:35,034
Also, I saw the calendar
in Ms. Park Wife's bedroom,

1346
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,661
and there was a photo on it.

1347
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:39,956
I'm guessing
it was of Grandma Son's daughter.

1348
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,625
There was a premarital meeting
scheduled with Ms. Son Tofu.

1349
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,003
My husband pushed hard for that marriage.

1350
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:47,338
Don't you have a connection
to them too, Eldest?

1351
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,382
Aren't you acquainted…

1352
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,468
-Were you into her?
-…with her family?

1353
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,803
Did you like her?

1354
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:57,515
She's a sweet person.

1355
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:01,269
-Did you really like her?
-Even someone like you has taste.

1356
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:03,938
-You're a guy after all, huh?
-Wait, so you liked her,

1357
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:08,276
but Chairman Jang arranged for her
to be matched with Manager Jang Youngest.

1358
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:10,069
That's about it.

1359
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,696
But the important thing is

1360
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:14,449
that I was the one who came up
with that business idea.

1361
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:17,494
-I was the one--
-So he took your business idea,

1362
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:19,287
-the woman you like…
-Right.

1363
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:21,539
-…and everything, even the company.
-And the company.

1364
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:23,458
-Would you kill him if you were Eldest?
-Of course.

1365
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:25,001
-Exactly.
-I'd kill him immediately.

1366
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:28,087
-Strangle him and shove him in a casket.
-Exactly.

1367
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,548
-Please keep this in mind, Detective.
-Detective.

1368
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:31,883
-Yes?
-We have our killer.

1369
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:32,884
I'll keep that in mind.

1370
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:36,471
-Are you done?
-It's not Youngest's fault he's better.

1371
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:40,266
You little punk.

1372
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,685
-You're dead meat now.
-Is this a food chain or something?

1373
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,187
Mr. Red-Green Color Blindness.

1374
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:46,231
Kim Sweetheart,

1375
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:49,400
-he's about to be our brother-in-law.
-Yes.

1376
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,486
-Hey, sis.
-Yeah?

1377
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:52,820
Think it over again.

1378
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:56,324
-Really, Eldest?
-I was so shocked, okay?

1379
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:58,952
I saw Sweetheart's bookshelf,

1380
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,788
and it was filled with books
on dating techniques.

1381
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:04,082
-Books on dating techniques?
-Dating techniques?

1382
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:06,209
That's what I found so strange.

1383
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:09,837
If he's dating my sister
and even planning to marry her,

1384
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:12,840
you'd think
he'd be reading books on patience

1385
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:15,009
or self-discipline
to learn to control himself better.

1386
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:18,388
-I never knew Eldest was so funny.
-Like books on meditation or something.

1387
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:19,973
-He's witty.
-Have you lost your mind today?

1388
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,810
-Why are you interested in such things?
-He's hilarious.

1389
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,062
This has nothing to do with my girl.

1390
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:28,022
-Is it just an interest or what?
-What?

1391
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,732
-It's just--
-Are you trying to date some other girl?

1392
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:33,111
Not at all. They're just techniques
to build relationships with people.

1393
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:34,821
What does that have to do with dating?

1394
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,781
-Okay.
-I'm getting a bit angry.

1395
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:39,075
Hey, sis, don't be so offended.

1396
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:41,327
Do you really think Sweetheart
hasn't dated before you?

1397
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,538
-He told me he hadn't.
-Come on.

1398
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:45,164
-You believed that?
-You believed it?

1399
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:48,585
Okay, so let me tell you
about the person he dated in the past.

1400
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:50,795
She has a pretty name.

1401
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:51,879
It's Loser.

1402
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:53,172
-Loser?
-Loser?

1403
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,424
"My Loser."

1404
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:56,092
-Loser?
-Sounds a bit lame.

1405
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:57,510
THE BOX CONTAINING MEMORIES WITH LOSER

1406
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:01,347
She seemed to have worked
at the same factory as you in the past.

1407
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,808
That's right. When I was about 20,

1408
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:06,769
I worked at a defense company
instead of doing military service.

1409
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:09,772
She was a bookkeeper there,
and we had a whirlwind romance.

1410
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:12,358
But I guess you broke up at some point

1411
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,944
because I saw a photo from 2006,

1412
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:17,447
and written on it
was something about them reuniting.

1413
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:18,573
You got back together?

1414
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:20,617
-I got dumped.
-Oh, I see.

1415
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:24,329
But I met her again
at an English cram school.

1416
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:25,246
I see.

1417
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,123
I'm sorry, babe.

1418
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:29,626
-That's all in the past, you know.
-Cover your ears.

1419
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,462
I'll just commit premeditated murder now
and go to prison.

1420
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:35,882
There's more.

1421
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:38,134
I also found a woman's employee ID card.

1422
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:40,053
-So I took a look, and--
-What now? There's another woman?

1423
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,888
No, it's the same woman.

1424
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,097
-Loser.
-Loser?

1425
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,474
-Loser's her first name, right?
-Right.

1426
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:45,808
Her last name was on the card.

1427
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:46,934
Her full name is Joo Loser.

1428
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,312
-Joo Loser?
-Joo Loser?

1429
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:50,688
-Joo Loser.
-Joo Loser.

1430
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:51,648
Joo Loser?

1431
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:54,233
-Then, I also found a list of sorts.
-Joo Loser.

1432
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:57,820
It was a list of
potential marriage partners.

1433
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:59,364
-What?
-A list of potential marriage partners.

1434
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:02,200
And the last name on the list was…

1435
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:03,743
ALL SEMI-CHAEBOL POTENTIAL PARTNERS
WHO WAS THE LAST ONE?

1436
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:06,412
…your second brother, Jang Second Son.

1437
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:08,289
-Seriously?
-What?

1438
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,583
-Wait, so Joo Loser is…
-Are you serious?

1439
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:11,584
She's Joo Woodlouse?

1440
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,795
-What? What's going on between you two?
-It's time.

1441
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:15,088
Tell us the truth.

1442
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:18,174
I'm Joo Daughter-in-law's…

1443
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:20,593
I mean, I'm Joo Loser's first love.

1444
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,970
I'm Joo Loser's first love.

1445
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:24,889
-I can't even.
-What the heck is going on?

1446
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:26,724
How dare you? I'll rip your jaw off.

1447
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:29,519
-How many guys has she seduced so far?
-The two of them…

1448
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:33,022
I got used to dating someone
with a bad personality because of her,

1449
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,982
so I'm fine with dating Daughter.

1450
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,734
Are you some kind of black widow?

1451
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:38,986
What, is it a crime to be charming?

1452
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,571
Did you sleep with him? Did you?

1453
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:41,823
-Why do you want to know that?
-Did you?

1454
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:44,242
I told you I can openly commit
premeditated murders, you bitch.

1455
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:47,954
-This family's totally dysfunctional.
-No, that woman is dead.

1456
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,957
-Quit saying ridiculous things.
-How many men have you seduced, exactly?

1457
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,418
Okay, if you look at this photo,

1458
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,044
you'll find a note

1459
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:56,879
that said something along the lines of

1460
01:01:56,963 --> 01:02:01,217
"Loser is gone now. I'm going to be
the daughter-in-law of a chaebol family."

1461
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:04,470
It was dated April 2007.

1462
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,681
-No wonder.
-I met him

1463
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:09,183
-properly through matchmaking.
-Second Son was pathetic too.

1464
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:11,519
We met, and he said he was into me,
so we dated.

1465
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:13,479
Look, there was this photo

1466
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,398
of young Daughter-in-law with her mother.

1467
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:18,818
They were selling fish at a market.

1468
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:21,988
Her mother was a fishmonger
when she was young.

1469
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:25,700
I grew up poor too,
but I wasn't really that ambitious.

1470
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:26,826
I wasn't--

1471
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:28,786
A man should have ambition.

1472
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:31,289
I dumped you because you were poor
and had no ambition.

1473
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:32,623
You had no substance.

1474
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,542
Were your feelings for me
not genuine back then?

1475
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:36,377
I went on matchmaking dates
while we were together.

1476
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:37,712
-While we were dating?
-Yeah.

1477
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:39,797
So you used that agency, Marry Me,

1478
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:41,048
-to find a partner, right?
-Yes.

1479
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:42,508
-Wait--
-I got some help from them.

1480
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:45,762
They'd never match a fishmonger's daughter
with a man with this background.

1481
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:47,388
Her profile actually says,

1482
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:49,974
"Thinks she'd be a good match
for a rich man."

1483
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:51,726
-Okay, let me just ask one question.
-Sure.

1484
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:53,770
Have you ever even been to France?

1485
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,938
You haven't, have you?
I searched her room.

1486
01:02:56,022 --> 01:03:00,610
Why would anyone who lived in France
have books on France and French culture?

1487
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:02,320
-Can you even speak French?
-I knew it.

1488
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:03,362
Joo Loser.

1489
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,031
All you know is si bel homme.

1490
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:06,115
Si bon.

1491
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,325
SI BON = SO GOOD

1492
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:10,077
Okay, but what we need to focus on

1493
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:12,747
is Kim Sweetheart himself.

1494
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:16,292
Why did Kim Sweetheart
come to this company?

1495
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:18,085
And has he truly

1496
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:20,087
gotten over this woman?

1497
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:22,298
He needed to get rid of my Youngest

1498
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:24,634
so he could reclaim Joo Daughter-in-law.

1499
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:25,927
Joo Loser…

1500
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,386
Joo Daughter-in-law!

1501
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,638
Do you love money that much?

1502
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:30,765
-See? He's not over her.
-You've got to be kidding me.

1503
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:32,558
-He's still very much--
-I'm going to destroy you.

1504
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:34,852
-That's it!
-That's it.

1505
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:37,522
-Exactly.
-You idiot! You should be angry right now.

1506
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:39,774
Is that so?

1507
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:41,734
I'm going to destroy you.

1508
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,152
Those notes!

1509
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:44,654
Did you write them?

1510
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:45,988
I'm going to destroy you.

1511
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:47,323
I'M GOING TO DESTROY YOU…

1512
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:49,951
-This has got to be some sort of joke.
-"If I get it? Earthly punishment."

1513
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:52,787
To top it off, why did he collect

1514
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:56,165
photos of Joo Daughter-in-law
getting bullied and write,

1515
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:59,877
"The secret behind the umami flavor
of Jang's Kimchi

1516
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,170
was MSG"?

1517
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:05,132
He called our father
a diced radish kimchi fan.

1518
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:06,050
Seriously?

1519
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:08,219
But he only ate
cabbage kimchi all his life.

1520
01:04:08,302 --> 01:04:10,137
But he liked diced radish kimchi more.

1521
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:13,474
Were you planning
to spread that information out there?

1522
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:15,768
What's the use of spreading all that?

1523
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,396
-What's the point?
-This is an embarrassment to our family.

1524
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:20,982
-We have to keep it a secret.
-There's no point.

1525
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:23,734
I joined Jang's Kimchi

1526
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:25,194
because of Joo Loser right here.

1527
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:26,571
I'm Joo Belle-Fille.

1528
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:28,406
No, I like your old name.

1529
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:30,199
You Loser! How cute is that?

1530
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:31,576
Loser-Loser!

1531
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:33,244
It's all because of you, you idiot.

1532
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:34,328
Hey, Daughter-in-law.

1533
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:36,664
-You put a star next to my name.
-Stop it.

1534
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:39,125
Gosh, you put a star next to my name.

1535
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:41,419
-Just kill them now.
-What the hell are you doing?

1536
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:44,463
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1537
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,549
-I'm so uncomfortable right now.
-Unbelievable.

1538
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:48,259
Seriously, what the fuck?

1539
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:51,971
Hey, mind your French.
I'm really sorry, Daughter.

1540
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:54,265
I'm so into my character right now.

1541
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:55,808
You realize I'm right here, don't you?

1542
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:57,935
-Even I'm offended.
-You shouldn't be like that.

1543
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:58,853
Detective.

1544
01:04:58,936 --> 01:05:00,563
I'm allowed to kill him for that, right?

1545
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:02,815
Just wait until the case is closed.
You can kill him then.

1546
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,902
It's all in the past. I'm serious.

1547
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:08,446
He's definitely after something.

1548
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:10,197
-It's ancient history.
-How could you…

1549
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,283
How could you move on from me
to someone like her?

1550
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:13,868
Seriously.

1551
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:15,161
Joo Daughter-in-law.

1552
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:16,871
She didn't have a mole

1553
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:20,166
under her eye in her picture as Joo Loser.

1554
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:23,294
But she completely changed
after drawing on one mole.

1555
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:26,923
She's really desperate
to climb the social ladder.

1556
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:30,259
And she was even involved with Youngest.

1557
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:33,179
That's just utterly messed up.

1558
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:36,265
But what does she stand to gain
from Youngest's death?

1559
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:38,100
Nothing yet, as far as we know.

1560
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:41,687
There are still so many more secrets
we need to uncover.

1561
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:43,981
Another thing.

1562
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:46,442
I last saw Youngest at 3 a.m.

1563
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:48,694
He was drinking soju straight by himself.

1564
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:49,820
He was?

1565
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:52,281
-Where?
-He was. I saw it too.

1566
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:54,116
-In the lounge.
-But my son…

1567
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,785
-He wasn't really a drinker.
-Listen up.

1568
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:58,162
-He was drinking soju straight.
-Okay.

1569
01:05:58,245 --> 01:06:00,247
-There was methanol there, right?
-Yeah.

1570
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:01,374
And there was vomit.

1571
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:04,669
We don't know if the vomit
was from drinking three bottles of soju

1572
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:07,129
or because of the methanol.

1573
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,508
But is that the direct cause of death?

1574
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:12,468
-I'm not sure about that.
-Exactly.

1575
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:15,638
He was strangled to death, and there were
two lines marked on his neck.

1576
01:06:15,721 --> 01:06:18,849
One was a straight line,
and the other was curved upward.

1577
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:22,853
So we need to figure out
what kind of position he was killed in.

1578
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:26,857
Also, what's left
once the funeral procedure is over?

1579
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:27,900
-The will.
-The will.

1580
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:31,612
Someone obviously wanted
Youngest gone from this world

1581
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:34,240
-by the time the will was made public.
-Right.

1582
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:36,575
So who exactly would've wanted that?

1583
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:39,537
But there was someone
who said herself earlier

1584
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:41,580
that she was second in line
for the inheritance.

1585
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:45,960
If the son dies,
the inheritance goes to his parent.

1586
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:47,378
But think about this.

1587
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:49,880
Youngest was missing,

1588
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:52,049
and nobody knew he was dead.

1589
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:55,386
In that case,
I can't inherit anything, you idiots.

1590
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:58,848
No, after reporting someone missing
and going through the process…

1591
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:00,266
If it really had been my doing,

1592
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:02,935
I wouldn't have been able to wait
for months while he was still missing.

1593
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,437
I'm a very impatient person.

1594
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:07,982
FINAL BRIEFING: AN DETECTIVE

1595
01:07:08,065 --> 01:07:10,568
Okay, so in the reception room,

1596
01:07:10,651 --> 01:07:14,113
I found a bloody handkerchief
in the trash can.

1597
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:16,157
Huh? A bloody handkerchief?

1598
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:19,118
And stitched at the bottom was "MD ♡."

1599
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:20,745
-M what?
-MD?

1600
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:22,038
-Doesn't it remind you of anything?
-MD?

1601
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:23,706
-MD?
-Yes, MD.

1602
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:25,291
For "Mak Dung," meaning "Youngest."

1603
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:27,418
That's Youngest's handkerchief?

1604
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:32,048
We can't assume it belonged to Youngest
just because it had those initials on it.

1605
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:33,883
-Right.
-It's either Youngest's,

1606
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:36,469
-or he got it from someone.
-Yes.

1607
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:38,846
Either way, that means
Youngest was either bleeding

1608
01:07:38,929 --> 01:07:40,765
-or coughed up blood.
-Did he have a chronic illness?

1609
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:42,641
Not at all.

1610
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,894
The blood was concentrated in the middle.

1611
01:07:44,977 --> 01:07:47,438
-It was?
-It looked like it was coughed up.

1612
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:48,773
Oh dear.

1613
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:51,275
I wouldn't even have recognized it
as blood.

1614
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:54,737
It's just a white handkerchief
in Eldest's eyes.

1615
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:57,114
There's another thing I'm curious about.

1616
01:07:57,198 --> 01:07:58,949
-Mr. Kim Sweetheart.
-Yes?

1617
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:01,660
What's your relationship
with Mr. Jang Breadwinner?

1618
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:02,912
He's the chairman.

1619
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:05,331
I took a look at Chairman Jang's schedule,

1620
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:07,708
and it looked like
he met with you quite often.

1621
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:09,752
-How come?
-Here's the funny thing.

1622
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:13,422
It might've been a coincidence,
but after he met with you four times,

1623
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:16,759
he had a meeting with his lawyer.

1624
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:20,763
I have a feeling Mr. Kim Sweetheart
might be an interested party to the will.

1625
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:22,098
Actually,

1626
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:27,686
I also saw him
around 12:30 a.m., on the 30th.

1627
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,980
-What did you see?
-He was talking with the lawyer.

1628
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:30,981
Who was?

1629
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:32,316
This guy.

1630
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:33,400
-My boyfriend?
-Yes.

1631
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:36,237
The lawyer told me

1632
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,447
that I should learn the details
about the will too.

1633
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:39,782
But why should you?

1634
01:08:39,865 --> 01:08:43,077
Well, I wouldn't know
since I wasn't told any specifics.

1635
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:46,831
I'm also very curious
to find out about the will's content.

1636
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:48,124
I see.

1637
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:49,250
Thanks for answering.

1638
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:51,085
That's it for me.

1639
01:08:51,168 --> 01:08:53,003
-Thank you.
-Hang on.

1640
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:54,463
-Applause, please.
-I don't have

1641
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:56,924
the slightest idea
where she'll place those handcuffs.

1642
01:08:57,007 --> 01:08:57,883
Applause.

1643
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:01,345
Oh, is she voting already?

1644
01:09:01,428 --> 01:09:02,555
THE DETECTIVE'S 1ST ROUND OF VOTING

1645
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:04,056
My dear Detective.

1646
01:09:08,435 --> 01:09:09,770
Oh my, what's that?

1647
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:11,480
Oh my, what's that?

1648
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:12,857
-Oh my.
-What's that?

1649
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:13,941
BALLOT BOXES OPEN

1650
01:09:14,024 --> 01:09:16,944
-All our names are on it.
-Fascinating. Oh, so pretty.

1651
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:20,239
-Lovely.
-Yes?

1652
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:21,866
SHE COULD PASS AS A K-POP IDOL

1653
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:22,950
Lovely.

1654
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:25,161
Don't do that, Detective.

1655
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:26,662
THE DETECTIVE CASTS 2 VOTES TOTAL
1 OF WHICH IS CAST AFTER THE BRIEFING

1656
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:28,497
-Think it over carefully.
-You got the wrong person.

1657
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:31,917
-Detective!
-This vote might make it or break it!

1658
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,919
-What color are these?
-Good one.

1659
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,254
Oh, you little!

1660
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:38,174
-I'm sure he sees those fine.
-I guess so.

1661
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:41,385
WHO DOES AN DETECTIVE THINK
IS THE CULPRIT?

1662
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:43,804
Think carefully from around that area.

1663
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:46,515
-What?
-That's right.

1664
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,185
-What?
-That's right.

1665
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:50,519
-What?
-Of course.

1666
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:53,147
AN DETECTIVE CHOSE KIM SWEETHEART

1667
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:54,440
-Of course.
-That's it.

1668
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,233
-Is this for real?
-It's for real.

1669
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:57,943
I haven't felt this satisfied in a while.

1670
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,445
It can't be helped

1671
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:02,656
that we're inclined to think
it's much more likely

1672
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,533
that a man did it.

1673
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:06,035
Yes, I think so too.

1674
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:09,747
First of all,
the culprit took Jang Breadwinner's body

1675
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:11,832
and placed Jang Youngest's in there.

1676
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:15,127
I think that's too challenging
for most women.

1677
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,464
Or maybe…

1678
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:20,841
When the funeral director
first brought out the casket,

1679
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:22,927
it was on some kind of dais with wheels,

1680
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:26,013
allowing her to wheel the casket over.

1681
01:10:26,096 --> 01:10:29,808
I wonder if its height can be adjusted,

1682
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:32,436
or if it's just something for support.

1683
01:10:32,519 --> 01:10:35,356
I'll know for sure
once I take a look at that.

1684
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:37,524
-All right.
-Let's head outside and keep looking.

1685
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:39,526
-Sounds good.
-Gosh, I'm dying to find out.

1686
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:41,654
You're dead meat.

1687
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:44,949
BACK TO THE SCENE
IN SEARCH OF CLUES THEY MISSED LAST TIME

1688
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,953
If there's a will, where would it be?

1689
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:51,080
The lawyer must have it.

1690
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:52,998
Let's all be honest here.

1691
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:55,793
Who among us knows
the content of the will?

1692
01:10:55,876 --> 01:10:58,254
I feel like our dear Sweetheart
would know.

1693
01:10:58,337 --> 01:10:59,171
-Me too.
-About the will?

1694
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,590
-If I lie, that'd make me the culprit.
-Yeah.

1695
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:03,634
-I really don't know.
-Okay, you're the culprit.

1696
01:11:03,717 --> 01:11:04,635
I really don't.

1697
01:11:04,718 --> 01:11:06,470
-You said the lawyer told you.
-Bingo.

1698
01:11:06,553 --> 01:11:08,305
No, he told me to come check it out.

1699
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:09,932
-Check what out? Forget it.
-Babe.

1700
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:11,141
-Hey, did you just hear that?
-Babe.

1701
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:13,227
She just called him "our dear Sweetheart."

1702
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:15,020
Wait a minute.

1703
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,273
-There should be a club here somewhere.
-Joo Loser.

1704
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:18,357
I swear I saw one.

1705
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:21,402
There's no time for this.
I need to open that cabinet.

1706
01:11:21,485 --> 01:11:23,904
Babe, I want to open this.

1707
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:25,489
-That?
-Come look.

1708
01:11:25,572 --> 01:11:28,742
-Two of these are locked.
-Youngest's is locked too.

1709
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:30,911
Is this yours, Eldest?

1710
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:32,830
Is this cabinet yours, Mr. Jang Eldest?

1711
01:11:32,913 --> 01:11:34,707
-Yeah, that's mine.
-Open it, please.

1712
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:38,419
-Eldest!
-Hey.

1713
01:11:38,502 --> 01:11:41,547
-Search his pockets, hurry.
-Don't pretend you didn't hear.

1714
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:45,259
-Why are you pretending you can't hear?
-Eldest, what the heck? What's going on?

1715
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:46,760
FORCIBLY SEIZING THE KEY?

1716
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:48,512
Man, what's with you kids?

1717
01:11:51,515 --> 01:11:54,018
ELDEST'S CABINET OPEN

1718
01:11:54,101 --> 01:11:55,394
There's a lot of stuff.

1719
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:56,478
-Oh wow.
-Figured.

1720
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:57,771
What's with this outfit?

1721
01:11:57,855 --> 01:12:00,149
-I want to look in his bag.
-The bag, yes.

1722
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:02,234
What a fancy bag he carries around.

1723
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:05,362
-Here's the bag. Wait, what's this?
-Would you look at that?

1724
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:06,488
And what's this?

1725
01:12:07,781 --> 01:12:10,284
-A travel bag? What's all this?
-A necklace? What's this?

1726
01:12:10,367 --> 01:12:13,162
-What's this?
-Why is there a women's shoe here?

1727
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:15,622
-Hold on, why is this here?
-A necklace? What is this?

1728
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:17,583
-What's this?
-What is it?

1729
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:18,709
-Wait.
-What the heck?

1730
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:21,503
What's the matter with you, Eldest?

1731
01:12:22,087 --> 01:12:23,255
IN THE ENVELOPE

1732
01:12:24,048 --> 01:12:25,132
-"To Tofu."
-What?

1733
01:12:25,215 --> 01:12:26,133
Oh, Soft Tofu!

1734
01:12:26,216 --> 01:12:27,760
Were you into her?

1735
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:28,677
Did you like her?

1736
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:30,429
She's a sweet person.

1737
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:32,348
ELDEST GENUINELY LIKED SON TOFU

1738
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:35,059
"I, Jang Eldest, made my resolve."

1739
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:36,643
"I made up my mind now."

1740
01:12:37,394 --> 01:12:39,521
"I'll protect Son Tofu starting today."

1741
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:41,023
"I love you, Tofu."

1742
01:12:41,106 --> 01:12:42,566
"Yours only, Eldest."

1743
01:12:42,649 --> 01:12:44,443
-Eldest!
-This must be Soft Tofu's.

1744
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:46,737
-Such pure love.
-You two must've been serious!

1745
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:49,490
"I can't disobey my parents' wish
for me to marry

1746
01:12:49,573 --> 01:12:51,116
the Jang family's successor."

1747
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,787
"I really loved you, Eldest,
but we're not meant to be."

1748
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:56,330
Oh my.

1749
01:12:56,413 --> 01:12:58,040
-This is a pretty necklace.
-Eldest, care to explain?

1750
01:12:58,123 --> 01:12:59,625
-Looks expensive.
-Oh my.

1751
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:01,919
Can't your older brother

1752
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:04,380
be in true love?

1753
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:06,799
You should act your age!
You're too old for that.

1754
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:09,426
-Why are you going on about love?
-What's age got to do with anything?

1755
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:11,136
It's our years together that counts.

1756
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,930
Also, you're not supposed to read that

1757
01:13:13,013 --> 01:13:14,807
in such a deadpan voice.

1758
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,392
-Okay, show us.
-You read it, then.

1759
01:13:18,143 --> 01:13:19,103
"Tofu."

1760
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:22,606
"I, Jang Eldest, made my resolve."

1761
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:25,234
"I made up my mind now."

1762
01:13:26,151 --> 01:13:29,488
"I'll protect Soft Tofu starting today."

1763
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:31,365
-Is her last name "Soft"?
-You seem too excited.

1764
01:13:31,448 --> 01:13:33,700
"I love you, Tofu."

1765
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:35,244
Gross.

1766
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:38,330
-Is that why you killed him?
-He's Corny Prince, not Kimchi Prince.

1767
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,666
-Is that why you killed him?
-The important thing is,

1768
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:44,169
-did you know she was matched…
-Did you kill him? Did you?

1769
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,046
…with Youngest as a marriage partner?

1770
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:48,048
-Of course, he knew.
-That's why he killed him.

1771
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:50,592
-That's why he said he'd protect her.
-Of course, he did!

1772
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:53,095
-What's wrong with him?
-He killed him because he knew, babe.

1773
01:13:53,178 --> 01:13:55,222
He's the prime suspect now.

1774
01:13:55,305 --> 01:13:57,891
But why's there only one shoe?
Is she Sonderella?

1775
01:13:57,975 --> 01:14:02,146
Tofu came to the funeral the other day.

1776
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:04,982
Someone bumped into her then

1777
01:14:05,065 --> 01:14:06,984
and spilled some kimchi juice on her shoe.

1778
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:08,735
Oh, so it's kimchi juice.

1779
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:10,988
So I said, "Oh, sorry."

1780
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:14,575
-"Some white kimchi fell here."
-White kimchi?

1781
01:14:14,658 --> 01:14:17,703
-Yeah.
-Oh, white kimchi. I see.

1782
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:20,998
I thought the kimchi juice
was from white kimchi,

1783
01:14:21,081 --> 01:14:22,708
but I guess it wasn't.

1784
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:26,670
So she just left
after leaving that note and one shoe.

1785
01:14:26,753 --> 01:14:29,339
When a man is blinded by love,

1786
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:31,717
he becomes terrifying.

1787
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,887
He had his girl stolen from him
by his younger brother

1788
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:37,347
and was falling behind him at work too.

1789
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:39,475
Who could resist killing Youngest
in Eldest's situation?

1790
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:42,686
I mean, that was his one true love
in all 48 years of his life.

1791
01:14:42,769 --> 01:14:43,687
Don't you agree?

1792
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:45,606
WHILE THEY WERE FUSSING OVER
ELDEST'S BREAKUP

1793
01:14:45,689 --> 01:14:49,276
What's going on?
Jeez, what's with all the fuss?

1794
01:14:51,111 --> 01:14:53,864
AN DETECTIVE SEARCHES
JANG BREADWINNER AND PARK WIFE'S ROOM

1795
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:58,535
What else… What? That scared me.

1796
01:14:59,703 --> 01:15:00,746
What's this?

1797
01:15:02,247 --> 01:15:04,041
A CAMCORDER

1798
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,170
Everyone!

1799
01:15:08,795 --> 01:15:10,506
-What is it?
-Come over here.

1800
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:12,508
-What is it now?
-Does anyone know what this is?

1801
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:13,592
SUMMONING THE SUSPECTS

1802
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:16,011
Why are you touching my personal item?

1803
01:15:16,094 --> 01:15:17,930
-Whose is it?
-It must be the old lady's.

1804
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:20,557
-Leave my personal item alone.
-Let's take a look.

1805
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:22,559
Why do you have such an old camera?

1806
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:25,229
-Where did you get it?
-We're in the old days right now.

1807
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:27,523
-Let's play it.
-Play it already.

1808
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:30,567
Maybe there's footage of her
as a country bumpkin!

1809
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:32,027
-Come on, don't look.
-Whose is it?

1810
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:34,488
-Come on, Detective.
-Let's see it.

1811
01:15:34,571 --> 01:15:36,907
Hey! Do you want to be handcuffed?

1812
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:38,742
-Then you watch first, Detective.
-All right.

1813
01:15:38,825 --> 01:15:41,870
-I'll watch it myself.
-If you think it's appropriate to share…

1814
01:15:41,954 --> 01:15:45,040
-What's with her?
-She must feel guilty about something.

1815
01:15:45,123 --> 01:15:47,459
What could be on it
for her to be so protective?

1816
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,378
There are some things
you can't make public.

1817
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:51,672
-Here it is, the SD card.
-Hang on.

1818
01:15:51,755 --> 01:15:53,507
-I have to see it.
-You're going to watch it on the laptop?

1819
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:55,467
Everyone, please stop her for me.

1820
01:15:56,843 --> 01:15:58,345
I can't stop this lady.

1821
01:15:58,428 --> 01:16:01,348
-Okay, here it is.
-You know what privacy is, don't you?

1822
01:16:01,431 --> 01:16:03,892
Just let An Detective watch first.

1823
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:06,770
I think we need to
approach this carefully.

1824
01:16:06,853 --> 01:16:08,855
-What is it?
-It could be misused.

1825
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:09,856
Turn up the volume.

1826
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:11,441
"Park Wife."

1827
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:14,403
-Oh dear.
-What's this?

1828
01:16:14,486 --> 01:16:15,737
-What the heck?
-Who is it?

1829
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:16,905
-Hang on.
-What the hell?

1830
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:21,493
-Oh dear.
-What's this?

1831
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:22,995
-What the heck?
-Who is it?

1832
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:24,288
-Hang on.
-What the hell?

1833
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:27,207
PARK WIFE AND KIM SWEETHEART?

1834
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:30,210
I want to record
every single moment I spend with you.

1835
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:32,504
-What did she say?
-"I want to record every moment with you."

1836
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:36,967
-Are they crazy?
-This is insane.

1837
01:16:37,509 --> 01:16:39,845
-What on earth were they thinking?
-No way.

1838
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:42,264
You've got to be kidding me right now.

1839
01:17:43,116 --> 01:17:48,121
