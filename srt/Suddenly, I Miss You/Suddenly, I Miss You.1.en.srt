1
00:00:08,955 --> 00:00:10,222
Hello there!

2
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,488
You’re back with me, Kade, once again!

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,888
Today, I’m going to take you guys to tour my house.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,933
Coz many have been asking me.

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,333
“Why are you surrounded by so many men?”

6
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,777
Actually, they are all my beloved buddies.

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,022
Let’s start with umm…

8
00:00:29,288 --> 00:00:30,977
The first dude here.

9
00:00:30,977 --> 00:00:32,970
Frank.

10
00:00:45,555 --> 00:00:48,044
With this one, we could actually die for each other.

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,466
Despite how he looks.

12
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,977
He’s a bakery chef who graduated from France.

13
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,977
He has recently been relocated back here.

14
00:00:54,977 --> 00:00:56,970
That’s why I invited him to stay over here, too.

15
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,533
Ahh, he has some strange habits also.

16
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,377
Look at him.

17
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,555
Such a perfectionist.

18
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,955
Don’t ever let him spot any grain of dust in his kitchen.

19
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,933
He will be extremely pissed.

20
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,577
If you don’t believe me, come check this out.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,555
What are you making today, Cheft?

22
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,377
What’s wrong with you?!

23
00:01:28,177 --> 00:01:29,577
Are you really my mate, dude?

24
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,555
Let’s move on to the next one.

25
00:01:44,622 --> 00:01:48,688
Oh, always at the perfect timing.

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,755
An artistic, fashionist and professional photographer.

27
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,377
He looks the most grown up under this roof.

28
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,155
This guy is Big.

29
00:01:56,777 --> 00:02:00,466
Sometimes he also turns into model himself.

30
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:02,460
That’s because he’s this good-looking.

31
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,460
How could he stay behind the camera only?

32
00:02:08,844 --> 00:02:12,066
Actually.. he is quite perfect.

33
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,977
Except that…

34
00:02:14,511 --> 00:02:18,622
He is that kind of person that needs to drink black coffee with orange before working.

35
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,933
Isn’t it true, Big?

36
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:25,911
Stop messing around and get out, you! I have to take some photos here.

37
00:02:26,844 --> 00:02:29,466
I got scolded. Let’s get outta here.

38
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:34,733
Meh…

39
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,155
When he took photos of me, he was never this focused.

40
00:02:43,355 --> 00:02:44,977
Ohhh…

41
00:02:45,622 --> 00:02:48,888
So much touch-up right there, Mr. Big.

42
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,555
What are you doing standing over there?

43
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:06,133
Yea, you, get out, I have to take photos.

44
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:17,355
Here, take photos of my plant, too, then.

45
00:03:28,377 --> 00:03:30,266
I thought they were gonna fight.

46
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:32,260
I forgot to mention one more thing.

47
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,933
Big has a younger twin brother named Boss.

48
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,133
But they don’t get along well, as you can see.

49
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,311
I kinda get Boss actually.

50
00:03:40,311 --> 00:03:42,310
He has been compared with since he was a kid.

51
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,911
Boss loves freedom.

52
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,133
Loves to travel, and loves plants.

53
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,622
His main job is to keep on making game broadcasting.

54
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,466
And his parents are not so happy about that.

55
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,355
The main reason why these two came to live here in my house is because.

56
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,333
They are my cousins.

57
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:06,733
Now you guys got to know all of my roommates.

58
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,933
Let me introduce you to the most handsome guy of this house.

59
00:04:13,244 --> 00:04:14,777
Who else is it going to be?

60
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,533
Me, Kade!

61
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,422
I am handsome, playful and intelligent.

62
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,755
I am the most perfect man of this house.

63
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,088
Any of you girls interested.

64
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,777
You can comment in the clip to chat with me.

65
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,066
In the next clip, what will I review or where will I take you to?

66
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,200
Don’t forget to turn on the notification and subscribe to my channel.

67
00:05:08,355 --> 00:05:10,933
Hi there, Gibsy!

68
00:05:16,444 --> 00:05:20,288
For you, Gibsy, I am free every night.

69
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:27,422
Sure, see you.

70
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:38,088
How should I dress up?

71
00:05:55,777 --> 00:05:58,422
Are you rearranging the garden?

72
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,200
Yea, I got some good stuff.

73
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,333
This rose is really rare in Thailand.

74
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,666
You are expert about flowers.

75
00:06:11,444 --> 00:06:13,422
I have to hurry to grow it up.

76
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,177
Or else suddenly, someone moves in as our new neighbor.

77
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,800
And then has the same problem as the previous one again.

78
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,955
Oh true. I heard that someone is moving into our village.

79
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:28,044
But if it’s a pretty and hot girl, I am totally fine with that.

80
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:31,555
Give it a break. You are too much about girls.

81
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,555
You may have unwanted encounter among them girls just like Kade did.

82
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,955
Kade always has his guards down when it comes to girls.

83
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,044
Just let him be.

84
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,022
Here, a cake of new recipe, help me try it, please.

85
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,933
Wow, lookin’ so yummy.

86
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,311
Less-sweet recipe.

87
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,800
Aha, out of my way, guys.

88
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,933
I was thinking of going out.

89
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,044
Where are you going hunting?

90
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,088
Prestigious casanova.

91
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,977
Huh, be careful, you.

92
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,711
Girls nowadays are not that stupid anymore.

93
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,800
Lessons are there to learn and to help develop yourself or not.

94
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,822
This one is rare item.

95
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:50,666
Her eyes are even sweeter than my dessert.

96
00:07:53,755 --> 00:07:58,177
Gosh, how I wanna get to know her!

97
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:25,466
Hey Preen, how did you get here?

98
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,866
Hey, Big!

99
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:32,688
How come you are around here?

100
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,777
This here is my house. It’s just I forgot something, so I came back for it.

101
00:08:36,777 --> 00:08:38,770
Mhmm..

102
00:08:39,377 --> 00:08:41,400
We haven’t seen each other in such long time.

103
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,700
A long time indeed.

104
00:08:44,444 --> 00:08:48,088
I miss you, Big.

105
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:51,800
Big!!

106
00:09:07,822 --> 00:09:09,333
Mr. Big!

107
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,511
Well, this morning, I saw that you were...

108
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,622
Hugging with the new girl that just moved in.

109
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,533
Here is a thing..

110
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,844
A four-day mission with which we are going to hit on Preen.
