1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,800
(Preen: I still miss you.)
(Preen: Let's reconcile, okay?)

2
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,960
Just like that. Nice shot.

3
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,200
Hey, hey, hey!

4
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,680
Man, you are doing this again.

5
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,000
Wait up!

6
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,760
What? I am not as good as Boss.

7
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,720
Wait up!

8
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,840
Ok, ok, come quickly.

9
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,800
Yea, yea. Wait a second.

10
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,560
Boss.

11
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,640
How is it between you and Preen?

12
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,320
I didn’t wanna butt in.

13
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,720
I just want to be updated.

14
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,840
Both of you, stop saying that name.

15
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,640
And about the game to hit on the girl that you guys were making up.

16
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,640
I quit, from today on.

17
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,560
Boss, what happened?

18
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,080
Well…

19
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,560
I don’t know what your reason is that makes you want to quit.

20
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,520
But men don’t take back their own words.

21
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,120
Yea, a man like me will stick to my words.

22
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,600
I am never going to get myself hurt over Preen again.

23
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,800
C’mon, man. Don’t overthink.

24
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,600
A good, handsome guy like you.

25
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,320
Can get a new girl anytime. Trust me.

26
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,400
I know what you are thinking.

27
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,560
Get out.
I know what you are thinking.

28
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,960
Just looking into your eyes, I know it already.

29
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,240
I will kick you one more time then.

30
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,080
I see it, I know it.

31
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,080
So what? Get outta here.

32
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,240
I’m here. Here you go.

33
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,240
Does it look yummy?

34
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,760
Hey.

35
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,120
Cooking for you reminds me of the time before.

36
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,280
Preen.

37
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,680
Stop holding yourself onto me.

38
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,320
Did you already forget

39
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,720
the promise you gave me?

40
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,320
Saying that we will love each other forever.

41
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,600
You know what, Big? The past two years.

42
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,560
I haven’t forgotten you at all.

43
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,760
Please stop holding on to those old promises.

44
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,160
Also.

45
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,200
We were just kids back then.

46
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,120
It’s my fault.

47
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,200
That I couldn’t fulfill all that I said.

48
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,400
You think that I moved to this house.

49
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,840
The one next to yours.

50
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,320
Is a coincidence?

51
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,960
Our story can no longer go way back.

52
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,560
Give yourself a chance to restart anew.

53
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,680
Big.

54
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,440
Cut it out, Preen.

55
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,200
I don’t want you to get hurt because of me again.

56
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,640
Those guys from your house.

57
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,400
Have been coming to see me everyday like this.

58
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,480
Is because of you or not?

59
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,560
Let me guess.

60
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,120
I don’t think you ever told them about us, right?

61
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,240
Because they really like you, Preen.

62
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,800
I want you to find a nice guy.

63
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,720
So I didn’t tell them anything about us.

64
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,680
Please start all over.

65
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,520
No.

66
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,280
I came back to Thailand.

67
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,400
I came here. I did everything just for you.

68
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,360
I don’t wanna be with anybody else.

69
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,760
Ok, if you are going to keep being this mean to me.

70
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,440
I don’t promise.

71
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,880
That those in your house won’t know about us.

72
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,400
The fact that we broke up.

73
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,000
Was because of who, Preen?

74
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,520
Hi.

75
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,200
All good, thank you.

76
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:42,840
Big.

77
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,360
Preen, stop messaging me.

78
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,760
Leave our story behind.

79
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,080
And give yourself a chance to restart anew, please.

80
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,000
There, there, there. Take that one.

81
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,680
Good!

82
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,800
Nice!

83
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,120
Let me teleport back to base one second.

84
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,840
There, there. Another one.

85
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,840
Get them.

86
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,320
Nice.

87
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,320
Let me teleport back to base one moment.

88
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,200
Frank.

89
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,280
Frank.

90
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,120
Frank!

91
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,120
What are you doing walking back and forth?

92
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,200
Yea, we wanna play games.

93
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,240
Or.. what’s up with you?

94
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,200
Friends don’t have secrets among one another.

95
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,120
Well…

96
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,760
Umm, well…

97
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,280
Well what? Just say it.

98
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,040
I saw Big and Preen together.

99
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,440
I thought it was something surprising.

100
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,920
What’s wrong with that? Today is his day.

101
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,600
But I think there is something odd between them.

102
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,880
What do you mean?

103
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,840
I don’t know if it’s just me. But…

104
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,880
I heard Big saying this to Preen.

105
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,320
Leave our story behind.

106
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,600
What’s that supposed to mean?

107
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,600
Or is it that..

108
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,440
Those two are hiding something from us.

109
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,200
You, Boss, don’t you know anything about your twin?

110
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
No.

111
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,200
Big, Big.

112
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Big.

113
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,760
Umm, the light in my bedroom is broken.

114
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,040
I don’t know what’s wrong with it.

115
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,920
I don’t even know if I can get a professional to look at it now.

116
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,080
But…

117
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,080
I just moved here, Big.

118
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,160
Besides you, I know nobody else.

119
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,240
Ok, I will go help out.

120
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,000
Sorry for the trouble.

121
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,760
It’s not that it’s not working anymore.

122
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,400
Its pole was just loose.

123
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,960
I gotta excuse myself.

124
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,040
Sorry, I have no ideas about this kind of stuff.

125
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,000
That’s why I had to bother you.

126
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,040
Anyway.

127
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,120
Thank you so much.

128
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,320
I love you, Big.

129
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,440
But I…

130
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,040
Can you not yawn?

131
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,320
Or we all get sleepy.

132
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,240
Stop being sleepy.

133
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,840
Doesn’t matter what, tonight…

134
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,400
We have to hear the truth from Big.

135
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,760
But I am sleepy.

136
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,040
What time is it now?

137
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,080
Why the heck are you sleeping?! Stay up with me!

138
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,480
Let me tell you guys something.

139
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,520
Stop waiting for him.

140
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,160
He will not come back tonight.

141
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,800
Look, he went there and they are one on one now.

142
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,440
If it was you, would you come back?

143
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,240
Damn Big!

144
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,520
I cannot take it anymore.

145
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,920
Come on!

146
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,120
Ah, ah, I will start first.

147
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,320
Come continue, quickly.

148
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,960
Slap me, slap me.

149
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,920
Wait, wait.

150
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,240
People in this house are so lucky.

151
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,200
Getting to eat something yummy.

152
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,920
Big.

153
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,560
Big, Big!
