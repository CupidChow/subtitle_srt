1
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,800
(Preen: Love you.)

2
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,840
Umm… Are you here for Big?

3
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,040
Yes, err… but you are?

4
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,320
Oh, I am Frank.

5
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,240
I am Big’s housemate.

6
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,960
Should I go get Big for you?

7
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,640
It’s fine. But…

8
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,800
Can I go to wait inside the house?

9
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,160
Err…

10
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,600
Please.

11
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,360
Ok, then. C’mon in.

12
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,560
Thanks.

13
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,680
Please go ahead.

14
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,560
You can taste this first.

15
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,880
And I will go get Big for you.

16
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,880
You did all this yourself, Frank?

17
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,880
Yea, I like to try to bake new recipes.

18
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,480
The guys at this house have already become my lab rats.

19
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,040
People in this house are so lucky.

20
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,880
Getting to eat yummy desserts.

21
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,120
It’s not that great.

22
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,680
Anyway, I will go get Big for you.

23
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,080
It’s fine, I can wait.

24
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,480
But if you need to go do something..

25
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,600
You can go ahead, I will wait just right here.

26
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,800
Well, okay, then. Please make yourself at home.

27
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,640
What kind of dessert are you baking?

28
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,320
Oh, I’m making souffle pancake and honey sauce.

29
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,840
Whoa, that’s my favourite when I was abroad.

30
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,120
Really?

31
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,560
Good. Then you can help me taste it.

32
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,240
To see how the real souffle should taste like.

33
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,400
But, I don’t want to just taste it.

34
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,880
I wanna try making it, too.

35
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,280
Well, can I go in to do it?

36
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,520
Yea, yea, please come try.

37
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,760
First, let’s put an apron on.

38
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,920
Sure.

39
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,160
What are you doing now?

40
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,720
Umm… whisking eggs.

41
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,200
Mhm…

42
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,920
You wanna try?

43
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,960
Sure.

44
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,800
Err, excuse me, but you have to hold it like this.

45
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,920
Like this? Is it correct?

46
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,200
Yes.

47
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:32,320
Then we put in a bit of sugar, to add some sweetness.

48
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,840
Ok.

49
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,480
Normally, do you bake often?

50
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,560
Umm… yes.

51
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,560
I bake desserts and sell them.

52
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,600
Mmm…

53
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,440
What is this one?

54
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,480
This is flour. We will add it once we finish beating.

55
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,760
Sorry. Come, I will wipe it off for you.

56
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,400
I will go get Frank first.

57
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,720
Fr…

58
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,960
Err… Boss.

59
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,640
Let’s go see plants in the garden, better. Hurry up.

60
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,120
Err.. Let’s continue.

61
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,240
Sure.

62
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,440
Big.

63
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,600
Big!

64
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,880
Big.

65
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,640
Big!

66
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,640
Big, hear me out first.

67
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,000
About last night, I’m sorry.

68
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,040
Whatever I should do for redemption, I’m up for it.

69
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,440
But I don’t love you anymore.

70
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,600
You don’t love me anymore?

71
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,440
Then why did you do that?

72
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,680
Why did you do that?

73
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,800
Well, last night.

74
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,040
I didn’t mean to.

75
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,000
Why did you do it, Big?

76
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Why did you…

77
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,680
How can you say that you didn’t mean it?

78
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,720
How can you say that!?

79
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,800
How can you…

80
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,600
How can you say it like that?!

81
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,520
Calm down.
Take her out.

82
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,840
Calm down, calm down.

83
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,480
Preen, enough now.

84
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,000
But from now on.

85
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,760
We really are going to be apart, Preen.

86
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,120
Coz I will bring you the guy who loves you.

87
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,760
Be right back.

88
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Hi Preen.

89
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,720
You must know him well.

90
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,280
Why did you do this?

91
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,800
Oh, we are at this point.

92
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,760
Where you don’t need to say anything anymore.

93
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,440
She is your girlfriend right?

94
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,880
No, She is my wife.

95
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,600
Wow... That's cool.

96
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,960
So, are they your friends?

97
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,560
Yes, but...

98
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,440
Right now I just want to go back home.

99
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,400
Ok guys, nice to meet you all.

100
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,880
Nice to meet you too.

101
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,440
Finally, it’s over. But wait a second.

102
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,360
You are such a badass, Big.

103
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,760
Why baddass? I wasn’t doing anything, right?

104
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,240
And why didn’t you tell us about the issue abroad?

105
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,000
Coz I saw that you guys liked her so much.

106
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What could I say?

107
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,120
That’s why she seems familiar.

108
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,000
Good that you told me to try to contact that white dude first.

109
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,840
Wait. You knew the whole plan all along?

110
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,480
What? I just found out before you not long ago.

111
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,000
I didn’t wanna help you out, Big.

112
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,360
I just wanted peace in this house.

113
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,600
Whoa.

114
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,200
Siblings’ love, you guys.

115
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,120
Come, how about this?

116
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,000
Since all the evilness has been over.

117
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,280
Why don’t we have a bachelor celebration party tonight? Are you guys up for it?

118
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,560
Why not? It has been a while since we had the same free time.

119
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,160
What are we waiting for?

120
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,520
I think I wanna have some barbecue.

121
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:40,920
Let’s go.

122
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,400
Ok, let’s go.

123
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,600
Yea, I come with you, wait up.

124
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,400
Followed by Chef Frank.

125
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,600
Oh, do I have to bake for you guys, too?

126
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Absolutely.

127
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,480
Come, quickly.

128
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,720
Do you order from the same restaurant?

129
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,320
Plong sook. My mouth is the one that is sook (happy).

130
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:01,920
Floating?

131
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,960
Ok, since...

132
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,680
Since our house has found its happiness once again.

133
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,880
We get along well once again.

134
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,680
I think we should make a celebration toast. Ain’t that awesome?

135
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,160
Let’s get it.

136
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,240
C’mon! Three two one.

137
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,240
Cheers!

138
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,240
Hey, hey, not yet. There is one more thing.

139
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,600
Today is the day that the siblings have had a ceasefire.

140
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,360
Your faces are red now. Look, the faces are all red now.

141
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,280
Let’s make them another toast!

142
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,040
Shall we?
Do you wanna make a toast?

143
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,120
Come, come.

144
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,360
Cheers!

145
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,680
So, what I was saying about baking.

146
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,680
Just forget about it for now.

147
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,640
No worries.

148
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,760
Oh, nothing.
