1
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,925
You’re bringing Preen that plant?

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,125
Wanna eat something first? I prepared some breakfast for you.

3
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,700
One second.

4
00:00:43,725 --> 00:00:46,275
Today, Preen might go out to see her friends.

5
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,500
Whatever you wanna do, just go for it now.

6
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,875
How did you know?

7
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,600
Coz Preen’s friends are my friends.

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,950
You, cheater!

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,900
Cheater?

10
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,125
I haven’t done anything.

11
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,175
But it’s not your day today, how come you talked to her?

12
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,975
Hey, you’d better spend time
making your scores rather than scolding others.

13
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,775
I gotta warn you with one thing. Someone like Preen.

14
00:01:10,775 --> 00:01:12,770
Is not as ordinary as you think she is.

15
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,825
You have never cared about anyone.

16
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,050
However Preen is, I will decide about that myself.

17
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,975
Here comes the breakfast.

18
00:01:24,775 --> 00:01:27,975
Yea, leave it there, I will eat it myself.

19
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:40,150
Boss is as serious as Kade, don’t you think?

20
00:01:40,925 --> 00:01:43,325
Yea, he’s like that.

21
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,925
Since he was a kid.

22
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,125
He has always been serious about stuff like this.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,166
Hey, Big!

24
00:02:57,066 --> 00:02:59,466
What are you here for?

25
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,900
Big!

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,333
Yea?

27
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,000
Uhh, my name is Boss.

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,533
I am Big’s twin.

29
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:13,530
Ahh..

30
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,000
Well, I wanted to bring you a plant.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,933
As housewarming’s gift.

32
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:25,500
But it is all broken now.

33
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,533
But.. I have known Big for a long time.

34
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,233
I never knew he had a twin also.

35
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,500
Regarding the plant, don’t worry, Mr. Boss.

36
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,066
But no...
Yea?

37
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,833
Umm, at home I have been taught that.

38
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,966
At least, our houses should have some lucky charm as decoration.

39
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,866
And the plant that I brought.

40
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,100
Is beautiful, and also a lucky charm.

41
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,433
That’s why I wanted you to have one, Miss Preen.

42
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,600
Ok.

43
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,933
By the way, you all know my name?

44
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,966
Of course we do. You’re our new neighbor.

45
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:07,433
Uhh, if you are not in a hurry to go somewhere..

46
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,666
Would you like to go check out some plants at my garden?

47
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,033
Hmm…

48
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,533
It’s just that, those at my house already know you anyway.

49
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,866
It’s gonna be safe, I promise.

50
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,533
Can we do that another day? I gotta go outside with Big.

51
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,033
I just don’t know if Big is already dressed up.

52
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,200
Err..

53
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,900
From what I saw before I left.

54
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,200
Big wasn’t ready yet.

55
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:35,433
In the meantime, why don’t you come pick a plant at the garden first?

56
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,233
If you say so, ok then.

57
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,066
This way please.

58
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,566
Okay.

59
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:44,600
And what should we do about this?

60
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,266
I will clear it up for you.

61
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,100
Wow.

62
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,966
The roses have blossomed beautifully.

63
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,766
I never thought that a guy would plant roses in his house, too.

64
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,533
I love planting trees.

65
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,133
Those that are easy to be planted, I try planting them all.

66
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,133
After some time, then they have become what you see now.

67
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,166
You are so different from Big, Khun Boss.

68
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,300
That guy doesn’t like to plant flowers nor trees at all.

69
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,500
Please stop addressing me with Mister, just Boss is fine.

70
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,900
Big and I are not the same at all.

71
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,700
Big is calm, and I am hot-tempered.

72
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,433
Big has lots of cool hobbies.

73
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,233
And I like to play games day by day.

74
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,266
And plant trees like other ordinary people.

75
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,933
I have nothing outstanding actually.

76
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,466
I feel kinda sad about that.

77
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:51,233
And who told you that…

78
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:54,700
Planting these trees are not cool?

79
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,533
Each person has different types of skills.

80
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,400
Twins don’t always have to have the same, either.

81
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,666
Therefore, stop overthinking, please.

82
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,066
There’s only you who says something like that to me.

83
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,166
Maybe because…

84
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,533
I understand you?

85
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,033
You also have siblings?

86
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:20,266
I used to have one older sister.

87
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,433
But she got into an accident.

88
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,166
Uhh, if you don’t wanna talk about it. No need to…

89
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:33,300
Her name was Ploy.

90
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,133
She was just one year older than me.

91
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,700
When we were kids, we always fought.

92
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,866
Up to the point where I thought, without her...

93
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,500
My life would be way happier.

94
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
I understood the feeling of.

95
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,333
Siblings being compared by others.

96
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,233
I knew how it felt.

97
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,666
And I didn’t like that feeling at all.

98
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:11,000
But maybe I thought that out too loud.

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,333
That’s why she went before.

100
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,266
She must be resting in peace right now.

101
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,433
She must be around you watching you grow. Please don’t be sad.

102
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:21,033
Men’s tricks!

103
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,566
This twin is quite evil.

104
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,900
Boss!

105
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,000
Why do you have to shout!? He will hear.

106
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,166
Look at him! He already gets a hug on the first day.

107
00:08:56,566 --> 00:08:58,633
Thank you for dropping me.

108
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,866
Well, I don’t know when Big left.

109
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,366
I called but he didn’t pick up the phone.

110
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,600
I had to bother you to drop me here instead.

111
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,966
No worries.

112
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,400
I was not doing anything at home anyway.

113
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,633
Anyway, do you want me to wait to bring you back, too?

114
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,266
Are you sure? I don’t know when I am going to finish.

115
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,666
I can wait.

116
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,333
In case Big gets wasted anyway. Then you guys wouldn’t be able to drive home anyway.

117
00:09:23,766 --> 00:09:25,500
If you say so, okay then.

118
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,533
Can I have your number then?

119
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,766
So I can call you when I’m finished.

120
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,966
Yea, sure.

121
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,633
When you’re finished, you can call me anytime.

122
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,800
How sweet.

123
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,360
Well, I will call you then.

124
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,120
I gotta go, bye.

125
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,720
C’mon, cheers!

126
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,840
Can I have a toast with you?

127
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,120
I go to the restroom.

128
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,200
Good luck.

129
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,800
Hi.

130
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,120
How old are you?

131
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,640
Umm…

132
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,040
Can’t tell.

133
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,000
How old on earth?

134
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,520
Look, look, Preen got a guy again.

135
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,320
Damn, such a loss!

136
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,320
Can you take care of her then? I go now.

137
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,240
Yea, yea.

138
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,240
Whoa.

139
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,200
What's the matter, man?

140
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,280
Preen is so drunk. You go have a look.

141
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,400
Hey, Boss!

142
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,760
Boss, what are you doing?!

143
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,200
Why are you doing this?

144
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,960
What do I do?

145
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,280
What's the matter? We are nothing to each other.

146
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,360
Get out.

147
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,440
What about what you did to me at the parking lot.

148
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,800
What does it mean?

149
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,720
What did I do?

150
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,800
Ah, kissing on the cheek?

151
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,960
It’s just a normal thing to do.

152
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,240
Go now, go.

153
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,520
Let’s go home.

154
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,000
Hey, Big?

155
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,160
Are you okay?

156
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Just keep on driving.

157
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,760
Do you think that me moving to this house.

158
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,360
The one next to your house.

159
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,360
Is a coincidence?

160
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,360
The thing between us can’t go back to what it used to be anymore.

161
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,760
I don’t promise that those in your house won’t know what we are.
