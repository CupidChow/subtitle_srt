1
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,620
Shiiit! Some macaroons, too?

2
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,620
I will go first.

3
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:01,260
And why are you guys sitting down here at this time?

4
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,550
You don’t go up to talk to the girls?

5
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,400
Err…

6
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,770
I am thinking about some new contents.

7
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,770
And…

8
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:13,860
You?

9
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,530
Well, I have to know.

10
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,330
How Big got to know that pretty girl.

11
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,260
Right!?

12
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,660
Man, the girl is so young and pretty.

13
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,860
When did they get to know each other?

14
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,060
Why a gamer like me.

15
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,060
Never gets to see such beautiful girls, too?

16
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,370
Hey, hey, hey.

17
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,370
Wake up, you guys!

18
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,310
You always see girls as toys.

19
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,060
And we are neighbors.

20
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,860
Be more careful about it.

21
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,280
Dude, what about you, Frank?

22
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,400
Don’t you normally have to go to bed early and get up to bake, hmm?

23
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,750
True, normally about this time, you are already asleep.

24
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,820
I am just waiting for answers from Big.

25
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,280
In short, all of us.

26
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,620
Are waiting for answers from Big.

27
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,680
Big…

28
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,870
Whoa, Big brother, come here. Come, come.

29
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,970
please have a seat first.

30
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,220
Hey, let me put the bag down. Come, come.

31
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,570
Massaging, massaging.

32
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,470
What’s up with you guys?

33
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,970
Is my face strange today?

34
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,250
Special-recipe macaroons, just for you, Big.

35
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,370
Open your mouth, Big. Ahmm, take a small bite.

36
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,720
Ahh…

37
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,970
Mr. Big, well, this morning.

38
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,320
I saw that you were.

39
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,720
Hugging with the girl next door that just moved in.

40
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,970
When did you get to know her?

41
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,570
And if I told, what would I receive in return?

42
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,950
I will get out of your way to go for Dada.

43
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,370
I don’t like Dada anymore.

44
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,900
How about Gibsy?

45
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,600
Deal!

46
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,570
Err.. and I will make you a premium breakfast.

47
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,900
May I have honey toast with fruit salad and bacon?

48
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,670
Yes, sir.

49
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,870
And the remaining one..

50
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,650
Err…

51
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,420
I will do big cleaning day of your bedroom for three days.

52
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,870
Perfect!

53
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,800
Here is the thing.

54
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,350
The girl, her name is Preen.

55
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,800
A few years ago.

56
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,270
She was model for the Project I was taking photographs of.

57
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,820
Because she is cute and friendy.

58
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,700
So we became close.

59
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,500
But after the Project, we never saw each other again.

60
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,450
She went to continue her studies in Switzerland.

61
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,950
And she disappeared.

62
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,550
I just got to see here again this morning just like you guys.

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,500
And you and her are….

64
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,650
Hey, stop your evil thoughts.

65
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,150
Work was work.

66
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,550
There was nothing between me and her.

67
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,000
Yes that’s right.

68
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,470
So..

69
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,420
If there is nothing between you and her.

70
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,200
Can I hit on her?

71
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,970
No!

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,020
Ok, so.

73
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,870
The 4-day mission.

74
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,200
With which we will hit on Preen.

75
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,020
All of us are four now.

76
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,150
The total is four days.

77
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,300
And on Friday, we will leave it so she gets to decide.

78
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,770
Then on the weekend, it’s time for her to choose.

79
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,120
Who she wants to date with.

80
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,120
Regarding this, I need all of you buddies.

81
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,270
Please be fair.

82
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:31,250
Nobody will invite her on a date first.

83
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,070
And we will be in an order to go hit on her.

84
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,200
From the lucky draw just now.

85
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,770
Since I..

86
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,770
I am the first.

87
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,500
Boss, the second.

88
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,270
Big, the third.

89
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,800
And you, Chef Frank, the last one.

90
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,420
And regarding this point, I would like to say one more thing.

91
00:05:54,420 --> 00:06:00,350
Please follow the rules.

92
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,270
And men like us.

93
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,820
If we lose, we cannot be mad at one another later.

94
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,800
A man like me would always follow the rules.

95
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,100
And this whole mission that I have been talking about.

96
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,120
Will start tomorrow.

97
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,470
And are you sure that she doesn’t have a boyfriend yet?

98
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,500
At that time, no.

99
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
But now, I’m not so sure.

100
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,050
Give me your hand. Dude, give me your hand.

101
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,500
We hit on her, not on her boyfriend, yea?

102
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,300
But if she already has a boyfriend.

103
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,550
I’m out.

104
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,520
Yea, yea, okay.

105
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,700
So, tomorrow, I will try to find out if she already has a boyfriend or not.

106
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,250
Let’s go, move, move.

107
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,350
I have to go review some facial masks.

108
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,070
So I am look handsome to go see Preen.

109
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,970
I get going now, see ya.

110
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,100
Kade, wait up!

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,270
Err… the hotel order more snack boxes tomorrow.

112
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,770
I will excuse myself.

113
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,770
See you then.

114
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,500
Hey, I will take a shower first.

115
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,500
No, I get to shower first!

116
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,650
Err… Hi.

117
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,650
Anybody there?

118
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,520
Err…

119
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,000
I am Kade, I live next door.

120
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,250
Ah, Kade. You need something?

121
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,400
Well, I’m Vlogger.

122
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,600
My channel is called Kade Area.

123
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,000
Now I have new contents on house decoration.

124
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,970
And warm welcoming to the new house, stuff like that.

125
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,500
And I saw that you just moved in.

126
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,100
So I would like to invite you to join my content on house decoration.

127
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,370
Something like that.

128
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,470
I would like to invite you to be…

129
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,020
A VIP guest for one clip, is it possible?

130
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:08,000
Ah, but how did you know my name, Kade?

131
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,670
Oh, umm…

132
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,650
You are this pretty, I had to do some homework before.

133
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,920
Ok…

134
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,170
Oh, I’m just joking around.

135
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,850
Actually, I am Big’s friend.

136
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,400
And I saw you just moved in as our new neighbor.

137
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,950
So I wanted to come greet.

138
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,520
But about the clip, I am serious, too.

139
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,920
Are you interested?

140
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,950
Mhm…

141
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:40,620
How about you come in to talk more in details?

142
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,050
Okay.

143
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,270
Yep.

144
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,800
Can you?

145
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,050
No worries, I will take care of it.

146
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,770
Please, thank you.

147
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,700
Does it have to slide?

148
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,420
Oh, here it is.

149
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,820
Don’t worry, I will take care of it, Preen.

150
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,520
Kade.

151
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,370
Anything wrong?

152
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,900
Nope. Please keep walking.

153
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,350
What are you doing here?

154
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,270
What about you? What are you doing here?

155
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,950
I came here to water the plants.

156
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,300
I am here to wait for the hotel car to come pick up some stuff, too.

157
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,050
Here.

158
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,600
Why are you picking up here?

159
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,350
And why are you watering at this time?

160
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,670
Hey, the plants need to be watered.

161
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,550
Yea, then keep on watering the plants. And I will..

162
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,250
Go pick up there, in front of the house.

163
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:47,350
Where, oh, and where is the car?

164
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,050
Umm, Kade, here’s some water.

165
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,920
Thanks.

166
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,300
And you are here all alone, Preen?

167
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,620
We are four in my house.

168
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,850
Now I’m live alone.

169
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,850
Because I just got back from abroad.

170
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,970
So I haven’t gotten in touch with anyone.

171
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,800
Oh, so if you needed something…

172
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,950
Please let me know.

173
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,950
Sure.

174
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,250
What about what you wanted to talk about, Kade?

175
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,200
Oh, I totally forgot. One second.

176
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,400
Let me show you my channel.

177
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,400
Here it is.

178
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,950
Mainly, normally…

179
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,950
My clip lasts around 10 to 20 minutes.

180
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:57,020
Mostly are about products review and travelling, stuff like that.

181
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,450
Relaxing and easy-listening.

182
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,500
And now people are interested in.

183
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,025
House decoration, house welcoming party, stuff like that.

184
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,850
We are four in my house.

185
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,550
To decorate anything, it’s not gonna be that easy.

186
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,750
And this is lucky that…

187
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,525
You moved in now.

188
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,025
So I wanted to invite you to join this work.

189
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,650
Ah, but I have to apologize to you, Kade.

190
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,450
I am better at still photographs, not at video-making.

191
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,175
Oh, regarding that, I think it’s totally fine.

192
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,600
I can train you for that.

193
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,300
You can just stay still and you are already cute in your own way.

194
00:12:31,425 --> 00:12:33,225
Okay.

195
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:41,075
How about this, don’t hurry to give me answers.

196
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,150
Think over it first.

197
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,850
And once you decide, you can text me in Line.

198
00:12:48,475 --> 00:12:50,100
So..

199
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,150
Can I have your Line, Preen?

200
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,750
Actually, I can just walk to tell you, Kade.

201
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,825
I think in here it’s more convenient, so you don’t have to walk.

202
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Thank you.

203
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,225
Mhmm…

204
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,800
And since we are going to be partners.

205
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,050
Can I take this opportunity to buy you a meal?

206
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,850
Umm, but I have other commitments today.

207
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,450
I don’t wanna go outside.

208
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,525
No worries, I can order some delivery food.

209
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,675
5-star dishes from a hotel will be delivered to your house.

210
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,575
Err, ok, then…

211
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,250
OK, as you wish, Kade.

212
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,000
Ok.

213
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,975
Umm, I will prepare the table.

214
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,325
Oh, sure, please take your time.

215
00:13:53,225 --> 00:13:53,700
Yes, yes.

216
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,050
Yes, yes.

217
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,700
Why?

218
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,850
You’re afraid his scores will surpass yours?

219
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,375
No.

220
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,700
I’m just afraid he is not being fair.

221
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,050
You acting like this must mean that Kade is still not back yet.

222
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,350
You know him so well.

223
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,925
That’s why you guys are twins.

224
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,575
What’s wrong with you?

225
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:10,025
I am chilled. I am from another level.

226
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:16,225
Hey, Big, come sit.

227
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,975
Please help try the cake. I was trying out the new recipe.

228
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,400
Lookin’ good.

229
00:15:27,675 --> 00:15:29,850
Lala, lala.

230
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,475
Such a good mood you’re in!

231
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,950
Huh…

232
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,075
You seem so confident, Kade.

233
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,600
Huh, I guess.

234
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,900
Just the first day and I already…

235
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,400
Got her Line.

236
00:15:45,775 --> 00:15:50,500
I go now, lala, lala.

237
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:53,850
Wait until tomorrow, man!

238
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,725
Let me give you a warning.

239
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,075
Someone like Preen is not as ordinary as you may have thought of.

240
00:16:10,075 --> 00:16:12,070
You never care about anyone.

241
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,070
However Preen is going to be.

242
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,475
It's my business.
