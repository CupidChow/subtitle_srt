1
00:00:00,064 --> 00:00:02,099
(I am a kidnapper) My name is Masamune Shinjo

2
00:00:02,099 --> 00:00:04,136
Became a kidnapper for some reason

3
00:00:04,136 --> 00:00:06,679
(Take the genius girl Xiao Rin and prepare to surrender) I and the kidnapped genius girl Nanase Rin

4
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:09,194
About to surrender to the police

5
00:00:09,194 --> 00:00:10,264
Danger

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,121
You run away quickly

7
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:14,811
Lifesaving Masamune

8
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:16,394
Xiao Lin

9
00:00:16,431 --> 00:00:18,714
(Xiao Lin was kidnapped again) Xiao Lin was taken away by a mysterious man again

10
00:00:18,714 --> 00:00:20,906
Xiao Lin also wears that pendant around her neck

11
00:00:20,906 --> 00:00:22,750
Is the ingredient list in there?

12
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,489
(The ingredient list of the potion is hidden in the pendant) Fuzhu finally found the ingredient list.

13
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,158
first meeting

14
00:00:31,203 --> 00:00:33,130
I want to eat one last thing

15
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,303
She may be allergic to eggs

16
00:00:35,303 --> 00:00:37,248
Oyakodon rice bowl with lots of eggs

17
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:38,291
(Nanase family monitor file)

18
00:00:41,354 --> 00:00:43,264
(The Day of Kidnapping) (Episode 8)

19
00:00:44,434 --> 00:00:49,587
(The heart-wrenching finale is like the farewell of a biological father and daughter)

20
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:58,480
Sorry please look at my child

21
00:00:58,512 --> 00:01:00,447
She lost consciousness after vomiting

22
00:01:23,805 --> 00:01:25,514
are you okay

23
00:01:25,563 --> 00:01:27,251
Fortunately, I caught up

24
00:01:27,332 --> 00:01:30,033
why did you come here

25
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:34,879
Is there any way you can open this file?

26
00:01:35,674 --> 00:01:37,473
(Nanase family monitor file) This

27
00:01:48,504 --> 00:01:51,054
are you looking for this

28
00:01:54,835 --> 00:01:56,558
where did you get it

29
00:01:56,687 --> 00:01:59,046
God gave it to me

30
00:02:04,228 --> 00:02:06,636
Xiaolin, run away quickly

31
00:02:06,675 --> 00:02:08,316
Xiao Lin

32
00:02:08,917 --> 00:02:10,819
Run away quickly

33
00:02:25,785 --> 00:02:28,959
Anyway, thank you very much

34
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:31,791
billion

35
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:36,167
It's cheap compared to the value of the things inside.

36
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:40,916
You really dare to speak

37
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:44,001
Mr. Police

38
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:51,238
If you're unhappy, I'll hand it over to the police.

39
00:02:56,942 --> 00:02:59,534
I just came to say hello

40
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:02,621
Let me know when the money is ready

41
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,454
This gentleman seems to want to see you for something.

42
00:03:08,513 --> 00:03:10,117
What's wrong?

43
00:03:10,968 --> 00:03:12,184
etc.

44
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:18,598
(When Nanase Rin fell ill, I sent her to a nearby hospital)

45
00:03:28,377 --> 00:03:30,612
Where did you get this video?

46
00:03:32,328 --> 00:03:34,945
that...

47
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:59,170
Hey Xili?

48
00:04:00,303 --> 00:04:02,209
July 1st

49
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,066
It was a week before the murder.

50
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:13,441
Hello

51
00:04:13,472 --> 00:04:15,472
I am Sunouchi from the Central Kawasaki Bureau

52
00:04:15,771 --> 00:04:17,803
I have some questions to ask

53
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,687
I'm just outside your office now

54
00:04:25,261 --> 00:04:27,261
Hide quickly

55
00:04:33,957 --> 00:04:35,515
Hello

56
00:04:35,562 --> 00:04:36,999
Sorry to bother you so early in the morning

57
00:04:37,045 --> 00:04:40,424
I want to know about the research that Dean Nanase Mamoru is doing

58
00:04:40,424 --> 00:04:42,914
sorry i'm busy

59
00:04:44,564 --> 00:04:48,870
That was the research he inherited from his former dean, Mr. Eisaku Nanase.

60
00:04:48,901 --> 00:04:51,503
Kidnapper Shinjo Masamune and his wife

61
00:04:51,513 --> 00:04:53,598
It seems that this was also involved in my childhood

62
00:04:57,241 --> 00:04:59,528
This is the first time I've heard of it

63
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:05,575
Can I go in and talk?

64
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:08,231
Find time later

65
00:05:08,401 --> 00:05:10,401
-Excuse me-Hello

66
00:05:10,926 --> 00:05:12,755
Shinjo

67
00:05:13,002 --> 00:05:14,675
-Hello-Mr. Xinzhuang

68
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,939
Stop at Xinzhuang for me

69
00:05:20,046 --> 00:05:23,546
Xinzhuang, why are you here?

70
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:28,502
Where is Xiaolin?

71
00:05:29,032 --> 00:05:30,561
kidnapped

72
00:05:30,561 --> 00:05:32,454
Kidnapped by whom?

73
00:05:32,472 --> 00:05:34,738
Z Capitals

74
00:05:34,862 --> 00:05:37,865
It is a company that funded the research project of Dean Nanase Mamoru.

75
00:05:37,865 --> 00:05:41,961
They also attacked me just now. Fortunately, Mr. Xinzhuang

76
00:05:41,961 --> 00:05:43,890
They were the ones who took Xiao Lin away

77
00:05:50,052 --> 00:05:52,940
Mr. Xinzhuang, are you okay?

78
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,271
yes

79
00:06:00,268 --> 00:06:02,268
There was a text message saying that Nanase Rin fell ill.

80
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:04,062
To be sent to a nearby hospital

81
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:05,288
Xiao Lin?

82
00:06:05,307 --> 00:06:07,543
Xiaolin...go and save her quickly

83
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:09,808
Mr. Detective, please

84
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:12,317
Please go save Xiao Lin, please

85
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:15,435
Mr. Detective, please...

86
00:06:15,464 --> 00:06:17,781
(Special Investigation Headquarters) This case

87
00:06:17,914 --> 00:06:19,914
The case has been closed

88
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:26,018
Please, Mr. Detective, please...

89
00:06:27,362 --> 00:06:29,620
Please...

90
00:06:31,148 --> 00:06:33,148
come with me

91
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,971
Do you want to save Xiao Lin?

92
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:42,193
I didn’t expect that the person I trust the most now is actually the kidnapper.

93
00:06:42,237 --> 00:06:43,617
Mr. Detective

94
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:45,986
-Okay, let's go. -Yes

95
00:06:46,312 --> 00:06:48,773
The situation is under control

96
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:51,540
Fortunately, immediate treatment was available

97
00:06:52,235 --> 00:06:53,641
alright

98
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,920
Please go to the counter

99
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,440
Rin Nanase

100
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,056
It's useless for you to run away

101
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,615
Think carefully

102
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:55,719
if you run away

103
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,949
Someone will get hurt again

104
00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:07,891
Do you want to continue this cycle?

105
00:09:07,994 --> 00:09:09,994
What should be done better

106
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,430
You know it yourself, right?

107
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:16,696
I will definitely protect you. I will definitely protect you.

108
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:22,345
Xiao Lin

109
00:09:26,264 --> 00:09:28,293
Stop resisting

110
00:09:29,698 --> 00:09:31,683
come out

111
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:34,334
come back with me

112
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:49,832
Xiao Lin

113
00:09:51,281 --> 00:09:53,281
Xiao Lin, don’t come out

114
00:09:53,858 --> 00:09:55,858
hide well

115
00:09:58,002 --> 00:09:59,781
you listen

116
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:03,631
even if someone gets hurt

117
00:10:03,749 --> 00:10:06,923
That's not your fault

118
00:10:08,727 --> 00:10:10,609
Xiao Lin

119
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,432
You don't need to blame yourself

120
00:10:24,221 --> 00:10:27,415
Feed the shark bastards

121
00:10:27,474 --> 00:10:29,474
Listen to me

122
00:10:31,618 --> 00:10:35,219
I will never hand over Xiao Lin to you

123
00:10:36,106 --> 00:10:37,839
So Xiaolin

124
00:10:40,293 --> 00:10:42,902
You can rest assured and hide

125
00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:53,901
I will definitely find you

126
00:12:03,763 --> 00:12:05,861
-Korin... -Masamune

127
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:09,669
I'm sorry, Xiaolin

128
00:12:09,691 --> 00:12:11,199
sorry

129
00:12:22,462 --> 00:12:24,179
Meet again

130
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:50,492
Hey Xinzhuang

131
00:12:50,991 --> 00:12:52,198
are you okay

132
00:12:52,198 --> 00:12:53,334
Where is that person?

133
00:12:53,334 --> 00:12:54,707
He slipped away

134
00:12:55,752 --> 00:12:57,371
finally met you

135
00:12:57,905 --> 00:12:59,817
Just be fine

136
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:02,135
Come back to the office with me and explain things clearly.

137
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:05,747
That detective Mr.

138
00:13:05,758 --> 00:13:07,377
Excuse me

139
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:09,201
I'm really... really sorry

140
00:13:09,201 --> 00:13:10,785
-What are you doing? -I'm really sorry.

141
00:13:10,808 --> 00:13:12,170
what are you doing

142
00:13:12,181 --> 00:13:14,356
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, I'm sorry

143
00:13:14,465 --> 00:13:17,085
-I'm sorry... -What did you do to me?

144
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:19,423
sorry...

145
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,303
-What are you doing... -I don't want to do this either.

146
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:24,478
-You...what did you do?-I had objections...

147
00:13:24,497 --> 00:13:25,578
what did you do

148
00:13:34,306 --> 00:13:35,658
here it is...

149
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:38,432
Sorry to bother you

150
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,890
Why are you at my house?

151
00:13:41,002 --> 00:13:43,358
you...your pocket

152
00:13:43,395 --> 00:13:46,777
There's a driver's license and keys inside.

153
00:13:46,812 --> 00:13:49,010
Sorry we don't have anywhere else to go

154
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,316
this

155
00:13:52,152 --> 00:13:54,404
Anyway, let me go first

156
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,675
Before that, promise me

157
00:13:58,316 --> 00:14:00,548
Masamune is not allowed to be arrested

158
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,934
I can't let the kidnapper go

159
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:07,792
It’s not like I’m talking about a lifetime

160
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:10,805
He will turn himself in when the problem is solved.

161
00:14:10,824 --> 00:14:13,291
- Right - Of course

162
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:15,875
never mind

163
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:18,428
I'm grounded now anyway

164
00:14:18,428 --> 00:14:20,428
Grounded...

165
00:14:21,867 --> 00:14:25,661
Because you chased us many times

166
00:14:27,789 --> 00:14:28,986
Xiao Lin

167
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,350
Don't do this

168
00:14:32,274 --> 00:14:35,230
Hello, Lawyer Yamazaki, how are you?

169
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,760
No serious injuries

170
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,915
Very good

171
00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:45,879
Please help me loosen my ties.

172
00:14:46,456 --> 00:14:48,674
Is this really your home?

173
00:14:49,111 --> 00:14:51,447
Not a warehouse?

174
00:14:51,936 --> 00:14:55,254
It’s just sleep anyway

175
00:14:55,254 --> 00:14:58,468
I quite like it. It feels very safe.

176
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,014
All turned yellow

177
00:15:02,413 --> 00:15:03,669
What

178
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:06,824
How long have you bought this? Do you use an iron to iron it?

179
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:09,766
Also, could it be a quilt?

180
00:15:09,804 --> 00:15:12,605
You sleep on something like a rag

181
00:15:12,656 --> 00:15:14,771
Can't believe it

182
00:15:16,824 --> 00:15:18,939
And there's a smell

183
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:22,851
I like this room very much

184
00:15:23,942 --> 00:15:26,840
Forget it, I'm used to it

185
00:15:27,674 --> 00:15:29,248
By the way, Mr. Detective

186
00:15:29,287 --> 00:15:31,971
Xiao Lin, you guys are watching this too

187
00:15:39,837 --> 00:15:41,554
you idiot

188
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:45,840
It sounds like we must bring Xiao Lin back.

189
00:16:09,477 --> 00:16:12,388
Why did auntie come to my house?

190
00:16:14,188 --> 00:16:17,273
Why does she have this video file?

191
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,352
I have no idea

192
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:22,097
I don't know what's going on either

193
00:16:22,144 --> 00:16:24,144
Why would Shiori...

194
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:29,858
By the way, Mr. Detective, you just said

195
00:16:29,927 --> 00:16:35,086
Shiori and I were related to research in the past.

196
00:16:35,456 --> 00:16:37,855
You really don’t remember

197
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:43,406
You were Nanase Eisaku's adopted son for a time.

198
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,099
say so

199
00:16:46,748 --> 00:16:49,839
Was Masamune also used as an experimental subject?

200
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,440
Experimental subject...

201
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,802
My grandfather wanted to do research

202
00:16:54,802 --> 00:16:56,872
Not willing to adopt extreme experimental methods

203
00:16:56,872 --> 00:16:59,107
Operating on a child's brain

204
00:16:59,107 --> 00:17:01,386
Injection of medicine

205
00:17:03,727 --> 00:17:06,725
And my father took over his research

206
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,804
Continue to treat me as his experimental subject

207
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:16,648
you and aunt

208
00:17:16,715 --> 00:17:19,047
Same as me...

209
00:17:30,426 --> 00:17:32,019
Masamune?

210
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,106
fine

211
00:17:43,422 --> 00:17:47,043
The Minister of Criminal Affairs has packed up outside.

212
00:17:57,996 --> 00:18:01,283
Do you want to disband the search headquarters?

213
00:18:01,283 --> 00:18:03,840
The kidnapping case has almost been investigated.

214
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,244
It's a pity

215
00:18:05,282 --> 00:18:09,080
Xiao Lin has fallen into the sea with the kidnappers

216
00:18:10,469 --> 00:18:13,674
Senior said she should still be alive

217
00:18:14,475 --> 00:18:16,475
Senior said...

218
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:18,033
nothing

219
00:18:19,652 --> 00:18:22,543
There is indeed someone who said such nonsense

220
00:18:22,543 --> 00:18:24,394
result

221
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:28,247
But turned into a stupid detective who was grounded

222
00:18:39,101 --> 00:18:40,771
Yeah

223
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,802
You help the eldest lady and Mr. Xinzhuang hide their whereabouts?

224
00:18:45,489 --> 00:18:47,964
Not really

225
00:18:48,765 --> 00:18:50,634
about that study

226
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,545
I'm not sure either

227
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,508
only

228
00:18:55,786 --> 00:19:00,335
I remember the eldest lady always looked in pain

229
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:06,183
She was never taken seriously at home

230
00:19:06,526 --> 00:19:09,148
Dean Amoru only has research in mind

231
00:19:09,246 --> 00:19:12,114
My wife is dissatisfied with this all day long

232
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:16,961
The eldest lady is always alone

233
00:19:18,103 --> 00:19:22,150
How do you plan to handle this case?

234
00:19:22,555 --> 00:19:24,704
Of course, we need to find out the truth of the case

235
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,635
Then the eldest lady will become the focus of society

236
00:19:29,142 --> 00:19:30,929
this for her

237
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:33,193
Will it be a kind of happiness?

238
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:40,035
Your parents...

239
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:43,188
seems to be quarreling

240
00:19:44,954 --> 00:19:47,052
I'm done

241
00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:50,281
Doing research from morning till night

242
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:51,810
I only have eyes for Xiaolin

243
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:54,460
Don't care about my life or death at all

244
00:19:57,631 --> 00:20:02,041
That child is an excellent experimental subject

245
00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:04,253
None of my business

246
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,106
I...

247
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:10,592
I don't live for Xiao Lin

248
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:16,449
Xiao Lin?

249
00:20:17,642 --> 00:20:20,697
Memories are so cruel

250
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:24,690
If only I could remember the happy things

251
00:20:30,234 --> 00:20:31,666
welcome home

252
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,279
where you go

253
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,329
I'm going to see Lawyer Yamazaki

254
00:20:37,374 --> 00:20:39,374
Is he okay?

255
00:20:39,434 --> 00:20:42,839
Well, he's worried about you

256
00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:48,929
Thanks to you, the mystery is gradually taking shape.

257
00:20:48,944 --> 00:20:50,808
The key to this case

258
00:20:50,823 --> 00:20:54,073
Sure enough, it was that study and your wife.

259
00:20:54,492 --> 00:20:55,894
Shiri?...

260
00:20:55,894 --> 00:20:57,102
right

261
00:20:57,372 --> 00:20:59,673
Xinzhuang Xili thirty years ago

262
00:20:59,673 --> 00:21:03,198
-Infected with HIV due to Matsuda -Nurse

263
00:21:03,273 --> 00:21:07,969
Later, Matsuda was very concerned about Shiori and continued to provide financial aid.

264
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:10,576
On July 8th, thirty years later

265
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,264
Matsuda commits murder at Nanase's house

266
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:21,892
At the same time, the aunt encouraged Masamune

267
00:21:21,892 --> 00:21:24,027
Ask him to kidnap me

268
00:21:24,057 --> 00:21:28,424
This girl can solve all problems

269
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,951
These two things happened at the same time

270
00:21:30,951 --> 00:21:32,951
It really doesn't look like a coincidence

271
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:35,489
So Xinzhuang Xili not only planned the kidnapping case

272
00:21:35,489 --> 00:21:37,908
It's very likely that it's also involved in a murder case

273
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:42,031
But that day Shiori said that she had been in the hospital for examinations all day

274
00:21:42,076 --> 00:21:43,605
She does have an alibi.

275
00:21:43,605 --> 00:21:45,665
But don’t you think it’s weird?

276
00:21:46,398 --> 00:21:49,256
On the other hand, only that day

277
00:21:49,256 --> 00:21:52,661
She just favors her alibi

278
00:21:52,885 --> 00:21:56,342
Why did she go to see Nanase Mamoru?

279
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,809
Why does she have this video file?

280
00:21:59,198 --> 00:22:01,721
There are really too many unexplained doubts

281
00:22:02,185 --> 00:22:06,552
But how could Xi Li be related to the murder case?

282
00:22:07,884 --> 00:22:10,990
She may have a side you don't know about

283
00:22:12,651 --> 00:22:16,988
I heard that it was you who the Nanase family wanted to adopt at first.

284
00:22:17,093 --> 00:22:20,648
But it was she who was chosen as the adopted son in the end.

285
00:22:20,768 --> 00:22:24,184
Why did you choose her instead of you?

286
00:22:38,352 --> 00:22:41,785
Do you really know Xinzhuang Xili?

287
00:22:41,871 --> 00:22:44,101
At that time I thought

288
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:47,498
This is the best approach

289
00:22:51,831 --> 00:22:55,884
All in all, it is necessary to check it thoroughly again.

290
00:23:00,007 --> 00:23:01,228
Xiao Lin

291
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,397
By the way, you haven't eaten anything, right?

292
00:23:03,412 --> 00:23:05,702
Xiaolin, your belly...

293
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,215
-Wait for me.-My stomach is growling.

294
00:23:14,177 --> 00:23:15,752
What's wrong

295
00:23:15,752 --> 00:23:16,998
senior

296
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,540
sorry

297
00:23:21,663 --> 00:23:24,619
I'm too stupid

298
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:26,583
After senior left

299
00:23:26,618 --> 00:23:29,495
I just found out what mistake I made

300
00:23:29,513 --> 00:23:33,124
I really don’t know how to apologize.

301
00:23:33,668 --> 00:23:35,792
The call came just in time

302
00:23:36,002 --> 00:23:38,710
I have a confidential task that I can only entrust you with.

303
00:23:39,271 --> 00:23:40,669
what task

304
00:23:40,898 --> 00:23:42,544
Go buy me food

305
00:23:44,262 --> 00:23:47,412
If you are included in the three-person portion, it will be four-person portion.

306
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,816
Leave it to you

307
00:23:48,816 --> 00:23:50,086
yes

308
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,893
Coming

309
00:23:56,156 --> 00:23:58,616
- Come on in - Okay

310
00:24:01,393 --> 00:24:02,627
Excuse me

311
00:24:06,827 --> 00:24:09,166
Raise your hands high...

312
00:24:09,856 --> 00:24:11,946
Lie down... lie down on the ground

313
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:14,812
Hands...Hands behind my back

314
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,510
arrest you are arrested

315
00:24:18,534 --> 00:24:19,977
He can't shoot

316
00:24:19,988 --> 00:24:21,954
Stop playing and come sit down.

317
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,180
do you want to eat this

318
00:24:27,385 --> 00:24:28,550
Yours, Xiaolin

319
00:24:33,863 --> 00:24:35,569
Really

320
00:24:35,692 --> 00:24:37,760
Eat slower

321
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,243
Bukchon, what do you want to drink?

322
00:24:39,243 --> 00:24:40,838
Juice or coffee

323
00:24:40,951 --> 00:24:42,725
It's me who drinks...

324
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,525
Then... that Sunouchi-senpai

325
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:48,821
If you call the police now, I guarantee you will be promoted to a class.

326
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:53,555
I'm not thinking about that anymore

327
00:24:53,555 --> 00:24:55,148
What's new?

328
00:24:55,722 --> 00:24:59,150
It was me who investigated Matsuda's bank account.

329
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:02,890
On July 11, he remitted three million

330
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,656
And it is remitted to Yongjin Memorial Hospital.

331
00:25:06,728 --> 00:25:10,235
Remit in the name of Shinjo Masamune

332
00:25:10,235 --> 00:25:11,904
In the name of Xinzhuang?

333
00:25:11,904 --> 00:25:13,808
Three million...

334
00:25:13,982 --> 00:25:16,493
The fee has been paid

335
00:25:16,995 --> 00:25:19,477
All hospitalization and medical expenses

336
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:23,014
Also prepaid for the next three months

337
00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:26,093
So that person paid for it?

338
00:25:26,574 --> 00:25:30,539
You need to recover quickly

339
00:25:31,946 --> 00:25:34,634
He is really dedicated to his aunt

340
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:37,212
And you know nothing

341
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,825
If you don't want it, can you give it to me?

342
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:45,464
OK

343
00:25:46,888 --> 00:25:48,596
You have a great appetite

344
00:25:48,963 --> 00:25:51,984
I haven't eaten since yesterday

345
00:25:52,216 --> 00:25:54,370
I vomited later

346
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,139
Almost starving to death

347
00:25:56,776 --> 00:25:58,391
Right

348
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:00,315
After I kidnapped Xiao Lin

349
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:02,872
She also kept complaining that she was hungry and asked me to cook something to eat.

350
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:07,293
I want to eat first. I'm hungry.

351
00:26:07,312 --> 00:26:10,977
It's like a bear waking up from hibernation

352
00:26:11,067 --> 00:26:13,953
Keep telling me to cook and hurry up

353
00:26:13,993 --> 00:26:15,492
really

354
00:26:17,113 --> 00:26:20,272
I really haven't eaten anything all day

355
00:26:24,229 --> 00:26:27,785
Feed the exact time my parents died

356
00:26:27,823 --> 00:26:30,000
do you know

357
00:26:30,058 --> 00:26:32,797
Actually we don't know

358
00:26:33,048 --> 00:26:35,716
When the body was found

359
00:26:35,716 --> 00:26:38,008
Because the windows are closed

360
00:26:38,008 --> 00:26:39,561
This house is so boring

361
00:26:39,561 --> 00:26:41,306
-Yes-Thank you for your hard work...

362
00:26:41,306 --> 00:26:44,404
The windows were all closed when the housekeeper discovered the body.

363
00:26:44,597 --> 00:26:47,561
And it's extremely hot in the house

364
00:26:47,561 --> 00:26:49,811
The remains were badly decomposed

365
00:26:49,811 --> 00:26:53,449
Therefore, the correct time of death cannot be found

366
00:26:53,565 --> 00:26:55,141
say so

367
00:26:55,141 --> 00:27:00,648
It’s possible that the murder didn’t happen on July 8th...

368
00:27:00,898 --> 00:27:04,112
It could also be the day before, July 7th

369
00:27:05,463 --> 00:27:07,658
if so

370
00:27:07,735 --> 00:27:10,688
I finished my dinner on the evening of the 7th

371
00:27:10,688 --> 00:27:13,886
Being knocked unconscious by the prisoner for a whole day

372
00:27:13,886 --> 00:27:17,477
Until I woke up on the night of the 8th

373
00:27:17,477 --> 00:27:19,747
then met me

374
00:27:19,766 --> 00:27:23,554
No wonder I was so hungry

375
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:30,174
Let’s re-examine on the premise that the murder occurred on the 7th.

376
00:27:30,174 --> 00:27:33,393
Yes, I will go now

377
00:27:35,283 --> 00:27:37,853
-Excuse me.-Wait a minute.

378
00:27:37,969 --> 00:27:39,736
Wait

379
00:27:39,756 --> 00:27:41,402
What about Shiori?

380
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,848
I'm back

381
00:27:50,523 --> 00:27:52,523
Masamune?

382
00:28:39,431 --> 00:28:44,568
At present, it is just a hypothesis that the murder occurred on the 7th.

383
00:28:46,189 --> 00:28:49,402
It would be nice if Xiao Lin could think of something

384
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:52,831
that...

385
00:28:53,642 --> 00:28:56,926
Can you take Xiaolin to your home?

386
00:28:57,447 --> 00:28:58,814
Are you going to Nanase's house?

387
00:28:58,848 --> 00:29:00,187
right

388
00:29:01,113 --> 00:29:04,164
Maybe she can remember something

389
00:29:08,662 --> 00:29:10,601
I'm up to now

390
00:29:10,655 --> 00:29:17,176
Still can't believe that Shiori was involved in the murder

391
00:29:17,238 --> 00:29:20,224
I want to confirm this

392
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:22,878
want to know the truth

393
00:29:23,355 --> 00:29:25,430
Of course it’s also for Xiao Lin

394
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,209
I hope the case can be solved soon

395
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:34,877
Let Xiaolin live a happy life

396
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,845
If this wish can come true

397
00:29:39,002 --> 00:29:41,378
I'm happy to be punished

398
00:29:45,136 --> 00:29:46,846
ok i got it

399
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:50,203
I will do what I have to do

400
00:29:50,692 --> 00:29:53,030
Just carry out your own justice

401
00:29:53,469 --> 00:29:54,476
yes

402
00:29:56,385 --> 00:29:57,855
Let's go

403
00:30:19,649 --> 00:30:21,120
I'm back

404
00:30:25,932 --> 00:30:28,897
Xiaolin tomorrow...

405
00:30:29,978 --> 00:30:31,840
Let's go to Nanase's house

406
00:30:34,379 --> 00:30:36,557
Mr. Detective will help us

407
00:30:36,946 --> 00:30:38,946
Hope it reminds you of something

408
00:30:39,674 --> 00:30:41,776
Are you okay?

409
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,055
Have you lived in that home before?

410
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:51,225
Being used as a test subject by my grandfather

411
00:30:51,414 --> 00:30:52,482
Um

412
00:30:53,337 --> 00:30:54,971
I'm also surprised

413
00:30:56,076 --> 00:30:58,552
But it's also because of that past

414
00:30:59,181 --> 00:31:01,181
That’s why I am now

415
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:05,686
You Yasheng met you again

416
00:31:06,682 --> 00:31:08,115
So I'm not afraid

417
00:31:09,711 --> 00:31:11,340
I'm sure you'll be fine too

418
00:31:14,223 --> 00:31:16,688
Go to sleep and I'll turn off the lights

419
00:31:16,703 --> 00:31:17,886
Masamune

420
00:31:21,188 --> 00:31:22,831
Whether it's tomorrow or the day after tomorrow

421
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:26,049
You will be by my side when I wake up

422
00:31:30,213 --> 00:31:31,319
sorry

423
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,044
Good morning

424
00:31:40,052 --> 00:31:42,348
-Good morning-Senior, long time no see

425
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:45,557
-Be careful-Xiao Lin and Xinzhuang...

426
00:31:45,883 --> 00:31:47,981
It's me...

427
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,768
Mu, what's wrong with you? Do you have a cold?

428
00:31:50,136 --> 00:31:52,418
Yes, his voice is weird

429
00:31:53,456 --> 00:31:55,864
If anything happens, I'll take charge and leave it to you.

430
00:31:55,864 --> 00:31:57,801
Yes, we will work hard

431
00:32:10,468 --> 00:32:12,483
With the police?

432
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:16,922
Hello

433
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,124
ok i got it thank you

434
00:32:52,376 --> 00:32:53,777
What happened to Bukchon?

435
00:32:53,777 --> 00:32:55,584
About what I said last night

436
00:32:55,584 --> 00:32:57,082
According to Kesouyan

437
00:32:57,082 --> 00:33:00,750
It is suspected that the heater was used at Nanase’s house on the night of the 7th.

438
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,101
Heating?

439
00:33:02,604 --> 00:33:04,855
It seems that they want to speed up the decomposition of the body.

440
00:33:04,855 --> 00:33:07,465
Disturbing the determination of the presumed time of death

441
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:08,532
should be

442
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:12,153
It must be set to automatically shut down

443
00:33:14,922 --> 00:33:18,659
Then Xinzhuang Xili has no alibi.

444
00:33:18,703 --> 00:33:19,936
Yes

445
00:33:19,966 --> 00:33:22,412
But we have no definite evidence

446
00:33:23,286 --> 00:33:26,558
Bei Cun went to do something

447
00:33:26,676 --> 00:33:27,867
yes

448
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,732
Masamune

449
00:33:40,204 --> 00:33:43,193
My name is Fujisawa from Eishin Memorial Hospital.

450
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,710
Yasheng woke up

451
00:33:45,902 --> 00:33:47,289
Wait a mininute

452
00:33:47,329 --> 00:33:49,884
Yasheng is the mother

453
00:33:50,313 --> 00:33:52,013
Mother?

454
00:34:00,262 --> 00:34:03,103
No sound

455
00:34:06,982 --> 00:34:08,623
Have you hung up?

456
00:34:36,596 --> 00:34:38,649
So cute today

457
00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:41,156
-You all are here to help.

458
00:34:42,088 --> 00:34:44,462
- don't shoot - why

459
00:34:44,521 --> 00:34:47,635
-Why don't-don't...

460
00:34:49,288 --> 00:34:51,967
Stop chasing me

461
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,093
Don't come over

462
00:35:10,907 --> 00:35:12,484
where are you going

463
00:35:12,587 --> 00:35:14,370
Let’s talk about it later

464
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:18,057
Can you take a walk with me?

465
00:35:18,706 --> 00:35:21,354
I'll take you to meet the person you want to see most right now

466
00:35:29,692 --> 00:35:31,203
Excuse me

467
00:35:33,376 --> 00:35:34,578
Mr. Matsuda?

468
00:35:34,681 --> 00:35:37,424
Why didn't you say you wanted to ask questions?

469
00:35:37,709 --> 00:35:40,883
I bought some time before asking questions

470
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:42,269
Please sit down

471
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,844
Have you known each other since thirty years ago?

472
00:35:51,754 --> 00:35:53,709
about this matter

473
00:35:53,937 --> 00:35:56,703
I want to hear your detailed explanation

474
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,846
Feel sorry

475
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:11,993
Is this okay?

476
00:36:12,095 --> 00:36:14,266
Yeah, the timing is just right

477
00:36:15,551 --> 00:36:19,095
It's not good to search without permission again, isn't it?

478
00:36:19,163 --> 00:36:21,072
Leave it alone and leave it to me

479
00:36:21,402 --> 00:36:23,902
She will definitely reveal her flaws

480
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:27,289
Mr. Matsuda

481
00:36:27,983 --> 00:36:30,370
I didn't expect things to turn out like this...

482
00:36:31,326 --> 00:36:32,697
It doesn't matter

483
00:36:33,618 --> 00:36:36,186
I did it voluntarily

484
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:40,018
thirty years ago

485
00:36:40,052 --> 00:36:44,579
My life was over after I lost my wife and child.

486
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:47,429
But

487
00:36:47,975 --> 00:36:51,317
I caused irreparable harm to you

488
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:57,336
I will spend my whole life paying for this sin

489
00:37:00,737 --> 00:37:03,510
Yasheng’s hospital bills have been paid in full, right?

490
00:37:03,715 --> 00:37:06,367
Yes I am very grateful to you

491
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,918
My savings and pension have also been remitted to you.

492
00:37:11,001 --> 00:37:14,805
And the file where you were photographed

493
00:37:21,624 --> 00:37:26,120
So...how much do the police know?

494
00:37:26,234 --> 00:37:28,464
Wasn't that thing discovered?

495
00:37:31,012 --> 00:37:33,890
That video file was stolen

496
00:37:33,947 --> 00:37:35,148
What

497
00:37:35,148 --> 00:37:39,116
I guess Masamune took it.

498
00:37:39,842 --> 00:37:42,977
In case he watches the video, I will...

499
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:11,530
Mr. Matsuda, why...

500
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:17,297
Why did you want to kill Dean Nanase?

501
00:38:17,368 --> 00:38:22,129
And not even his wife was spared.

502
00:38:36,957 --> 00:38:38,093
What are you doing

503
00:38:38,093 --> 00:38:40,759
You're obviously grounded

504
00:38:41,172 --> 00:38:42,856
Wait a moment

505
00:38:43,443 --> 00:38:44,540
Hello

506
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,493
-Take the suspect back -Yes

507
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,975
come over

508
00:38:53,338 --> 00:38:55,129
listen to my explanation

509
00:38:56,025 --> 00:38:58,154
Miss Shiori

510
00:39:14,114 --> 00:39:15,080
Hello

511
00:39:15,104 --> 00:39:17,851
What you want is ready

512
00:39:17,908 --> 00:39:20,559
I'll give you one billion in exchange for that pendant

513
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:23,305
Not a dime less

514
00:39:23,384 --> 00:39:24,978
before that

515
00:39:25,901 --> 00:39:27,619
Where is Masamune?

516
00:39:29,463 --> 00:39:31,242
please tell me

517
00:39:31,814 --> 00:39:33,498
where is he now

518
00:40:10,772 --> 00:40:14,194
What's wrong? Did Xiaolin remember anything?

519
00:40:16,584 --> 00:40:18,508
July 7th...

520
00:40:19,414 --> 00:40:21,389
what's going on in this house

521
00:40:31,366 --> 00:40:32,579
Xiao Lin

522
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,789
I don't know, I don't remember anything.

523
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,984
-Xiao Lin-go tell the police

524
00:40:40,984 --> 00:40:43,301
It seems like my memory will never come back

525
00:40:43,842 --> 00:40:45,624
This house takes my breath away

526
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:47,727
Take me somewhere else tomorrow

527
00:40:48,188 --> 00:40:50,026
I want to go to a happy place like an amusement park

528
00:40:50,026 --> 00:40:51,332
Xiao Lin

529
00:40:54,071 --> 00:40:55,965
Have you remembered?

530
00:40:57,458 --> 00:41:00,171
But because I dare not say it

531
00:41:01,688 --> 00:41:04,681
Xiaolin, you are so gentle

532
00:41:05,936 --> 00:41:07,442
thank you

533
00:41:09,182 --> 00:41:11,685
But we have to tell the truth

534
00:41:11,685 --> 00:41:13,271
I don't care

535
00:41:13,659 --> 00:41:15,624
I don't care about the truth

536
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:17,730
Shinjo Masamune

537
00:41:18,154 --> 00:41:20,096
Please come out immediately

538
00:41:23,718 --> 00:41:26,929
we know you're in there

539
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:29,835
Senior class ran to Nanase's house...

540
00:41:34,865 --> 00:41:37,477
I just received the notification

541
00:41:38,053 --> 00:41:41,229
Said the kidnapper and the detective were at Nanase's house

542
00:41:41,276 --> 00:41:43,861
Wait a minute and listen to my explanation first

543
00:41:43,878 --> 00:41:45,606
Lieutenant Uchiji Suno

544
00:41:47,769 --> 00:41:49,899
I'm charged with harboring a suspect

545
00:41:49,911 --> 00:41:51,473
arrest you

546
00:41:56,468 --> 00:41:57,746
stand up

547
00:42:02,707 --> 00:42:04,013
Go out the back door

548
00:42:04,036 --> 00:42:07,065
If not, climb the wall to the road

549
00:42:08,394 --> 00:42:10,077
Forget it, Xiaolin

550
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,816
Run away quickly, Masamune, hurry up.

551
00:42:15,793 --> 00:42:17,594
Wait where are you going?

552
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,583
We need to end all this before we can return to the right path

553
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:20,909
Can't

554
00:42:20,917 --> 00:42:23,847
You clearly promised to stay with me forever

555
00:42:23,858 --> 00:42:26,787
I am a kidnapper and must be punished

556
00:42:26,927 --> 00:42:29,308
I don’t want to see you imprisoned

557
00:42:29,331 --> 00:42:32,328
Then who is going to cook for me?

558
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,003
my wish

559
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:40,388
It’s about watching Yasheng regain his health

560
00:42:41,508 --> 00:42:43,855
And to see you return to a place where you can live a peaceful life

561
00:42:45,452 --> 00:42:47,058
wish has come true

562
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:49,506
