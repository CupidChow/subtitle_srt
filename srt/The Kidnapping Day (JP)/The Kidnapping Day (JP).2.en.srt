1
00:00:00,741 --> 00:00:03,121
It's the child she wants to kidnap

2
00:00:03,186 --> 00:00:04,889
My name is Shinjo Masamune

3
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:06,773
Became a kidnapper for some reason

4
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:07,616
Who are you

5
00:00:07,616 --> 00:00:09,304
I'm dad...

6
00:00:09,356 --> 00:00:13,163
The Nanase Rin I kidnapped is a genius girl who has lost her memory.

7
00:00:13,163 --> 00:00:14,567
(English) "Do you understand what I'm saying?"

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,805
Is this some kind of spell?

9
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:16,838
later...

10
00:00:16,853 --> 00:00:18,853
The number you dialed is currently unavailable

11
00:00:18,889 --> 00:00:22,026
Why didn't you answer the phone when your daughter was missing?

12
00:00:22,026 --> 00:00:23,961
I was involved in a shocking case

13
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:27,196
The police are investigating the murder of Nanase and his wife.

14
00:00:27,209 --> 00:00:28,308
Who killed the person?

15
00:00:28,317 --> 00:00:30,923
The most suspicious person... is me?

16
00:00:30,923 --> 00:00:34,628
I became a murderer wanted by the police

17
00:00:34,628 --> 00:00:36,797
His name is Shinjo Masamune

18
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,446
He has been arrested before

19
00:00:38,446 --> 00:00:39,900
murder?

20
00:00:41,893 --> 00:00:44,048
(date of kidnapping)

21
00:00:44,126 --> 00:00:46,669
It's time for you to tell me the truth

22
00:00:53,008 --> 00:00:54,891
Who are you

23
00:00:56,262 --> 00:00:58,262
There was a thief at home yesterday

24
00:00:58,262 --> 00:01:00,730
You haven't called the police yet

25
00:01:00,756 --> 00:01:04,190
It looks like he's hiding from the police

26
00:01:06,589 --> 00:01:08,469
Who are you

27
00:01:09,168 --> 00:01:11,168
who am i

28
00:01:15,022 --> 00:01:16,394
Xiao Lin

29
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:22,493
Rin Nanase

30
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:26,094
it's me...

31
00:01:29,276 --> 00:01:31,419
kidnapped you

32
00:01:33,062 --> 00:01:34,552
What's the meaning

33
00:01:34,604 --> 00:01:37,085
To be precise, I picked you up

34
00:01:37,124 --> 00:01:39,661
My parents are their real parents

35
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:41,024
where are they

36
00:01:43,908 --> 00:01:45,816
No longer here

37
00:01:46,915 --> 00:01:48,365
What

38
00:01:54,224 --> 00:01:55,397
this

39
00:01:59,113 --> 00:02:01,391
(The remains of the dean and his wife were found)

40
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,755
did you kill them

41
00:02:03,771 --> 00:02:06,016
No...it's not me, it's not me

42
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:08,808
I don't know what's going on either

43
00:02:09,506 --> 00:02:10,765
Xiao Lin, wait a minute

44
00:02:10,783 --> 00:02:14,047
Wait, wait, don't run

45
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:17,092
- I won't hurt you, wait - I want to go home

46
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:19,588
-Wait... -Let me go home

47
00:02:19,588 --> 00:02:21,792
-You calm down first. -I won't tell anyone else.

48
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:22,835
Xiao Lin

49
00:02:23,828 --> 00:02:25,996
Yasheng has heart disease

50
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,280
Treatment costs a lot of money

51
00:02:31,543 --> 00:02:33,039
So I just...

52
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,435
really sorry

53
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:40,580
sorry...

54
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:50,927
What's wrong

55
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,600
there are police there

56
00:02:57,696 --> 00:02:59,145
Give me the backpack

57
00:03:08,503 --> 00:03:11,082
I'll wait five minutes dad...

58
00:03:13,495 --> 00:03:15,095
Just run away

59
00:03:15,123 --> 00:03:16,476
I want to go too

60
00:03:16,504 --> 00:03:18,252
What about your child?

61
00:03:18,697 --> 00:03:20,426
Could it be that you lied to me?

62
00:03:20,445 --> 00:03:22,090
that's true

63
00:03:22,322 --> 00:03:24,537
He is also receiving treatment in the hospital now

64
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,537
Discuss how to operate

65
00:03:26,537 --> 00:03:29,545
Then you can escape until the child is in stable condition.

66
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:32,058
Surrender later

67
00:03:40,356 --> 00:03:41,798
thank you

68
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:45,174
Let's go

69
00:03:46,204 --> 00:03:47,401
Then I'm leaving

70
00:04:26,872 --> 00:04:29,225
What's wrong? What's wrong with you?

71
00:04:29,253 --> 00:04:31,956
Xiaolin, what's wrong with you?

72
00:04:38,286 --> 00:04:39,777
cruiser?

73
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:42,270
It was only for a moment but I remembered it

74
00:04:42,309 --> 00:04:45,673
I seem to be hiding from something

75
00:04:46,388 --> 00:04:49,901
There is the light of the patrol car at the door of the house

76
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,116
So the murderer is...

77
00:04:53,595 --> 00:04:55,203
Someone from the police?

78
00:04:55,227 --> 00:04:57,140
Or maybe it's you

79
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,544
really not me

80
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:01,449
Do you have anyone you can turn to?

81
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,000
I?

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,243
I don't trust the police

83
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:11,407
I don’t know where the murderer is hiding

84
00:05:11,407 --> 00:05:12,879
But I'm a kidnapper

85
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,188
To be precise, you didn't succeed in kidnapping me either.

86
00:05:17,967 --> 00:05:19,967
you have to take responsibility

87
00:05:20,408 --> 00:05:25,176
Keep me safe and help me regain my memory

88
00:05:26,013 --> 00:05:28,437
And food

89
00:05:31,843 --> 00:05:33,628
I'm hungry

90
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:39,001
I taught them several times but they still didn't know how to do it...

91
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:43,374
She helped us translate Chinese, Korean and English. She can speak it

92
00:05:43,393 --> 00:05:44,980
I see

93
00:05:46,285 --> 00:05:47,769
Sunouchi-senpai

94
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:51,106
Xinzhuang has been changing jobs in the past few years

95
00:05:51,106 --> 00:05:53,363
Recently, I have been working in the shipyard here.

96
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:54,761
Found this in the house

97
00:05:54,903 --> 00:05:57,174
- Photo album? - Yes

98
00:05:57,202 --> 00:06:00,093
My wife ran away from home a few years ago

99
00:06:00,178 --> 00:06:03,153
Later, he raised the child alone

100
00:06:03,678 --> 00:06:05,536
And his daughter

101
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:07,694
due to severe heart disease

102
00:06:07,694 --> 00:06:09,977
I heard that medical expenses cost hundreds of millions of yuan.

103
00:06:10,928 --> 00:06:12,928
This should be the motive for the kidnapping.

104
00:06:12,928 --> 00:06:15,140
But why kill two people for this?

105
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,575
Don't be so arbitrary

106
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,705
We still have no evidence that Xinzhuang committed the murder.

107
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:22,793
He has a history of murder

108
00:06:27,064 --> 00:06:30,246
There is a slight gap between the information currently available and the actual situation.

109
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,545
Check Xinzhuang’s criminal record in detail

110
00:06:32,942 --> 00:06:33,924
yes

111
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,473
Very good

112
00:06:57,095 --> 00:06:59,812
Sorry about that

113
00:06:59,911 --> 00:07:02,167
If you don't mind...

114
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:22,818
You see I borrowed the pot

115
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:24,784
There are also vegetables, I'll cook them right away

116
00:07:24,784 --> 00:07:27,622
Only...vegetables?

117
00:07:27,637 --> 00:07:30,471
Is there any way to tell us that we have no money?

118
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:33,994
My wallet and backpack were all left there.

119
00:07:34,065 --> 00:07:36,438
But it’s a lot like camping and it’s fun, right?

120
00:07:36,537 --> 00:07:39,690
You are so optimistic Masamune

121
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:42,896
Masamune?

122
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:45,122
Isn’t your name Masamune?

123
00:07:45,179 --> 00:07:46,691
I am an adult

124
00:07:46,705 --> 00:07:48,590
Is title important?

125
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:51,270
Masamune, go cook quickly

126
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,729
OK

127
00:07:55,878 --> 00:07:59,017
Okay, please eat

128
00:07:59,754 --> 00:08:01,453
I started

129
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,082
You must have eaten well before, right?

130
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:09,941
After all, she is the dean’s daughter

131
00:08:09,941 --> 00:08:11,585
Masamune

132
00:08:11,883 --> 00:08:14,198
Do you know my parents well?

133
00:08:14,354 --> 00:08:15,596
Not sure at all

134
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,310
It just happened to be the place where Yasheng was hospitalized.

135
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,244
But I've been late on hospital bills

136
00:08:23,272 --> 00:08:25,442
Will be kicked out at any time

137
00:08:25,726 --> 00:08:27,897
And even though you kidnapped me

138
00:08:27,911 --> 00:08:30,519
In the end, no ransom was collected

139
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:33,245
Really stupid

140
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:39,824
It's time for Yasheng to take medicine

141
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:42,985
I can't go see her because there are police there.

142
00:08:43,297 --> 00:08:45,025
I know

143
00:08:48,004 --> 00:08:49,212
Public search?

144
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:51,728
Inform the public about the child's kidnapping

145
00:08:51,737 --> 00:08:53,704
This is also a way to solicit witness information.

146
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,906
Wait, the other party has a murder record.

147
00:08:56,906 --> 00:08:59,404
It would be dangerous for his child if he was irritated.

148
00:08:59,404 --> 00:09:01,275
No, the risk is too high

149
00:09:01,293 --> 00:09:04,055
Hospitals and transportation agencies have deployed personnel

150
00:09:04,055 --> 00:09:05,835
-That's enough-Qin...

151
00:09:05,835 --> 00:09:07,743
I leave all the on-site judgment to you

152
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:10,804
But the final decision is up to me

153
00:09:11,107 --> 00:09:12,694
No need to hear it

154
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,192
I've washed it

155
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:19,202
Seniors have replaced you

156
00:09:19,202 --> 00:09:20,881
knew

157
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:25,897
Kitamura, what are you doing?

158
00:09:26,872 --> 00:09:29,121
The appearance of a detective is very important.

159
00:09:29,544 --> 00:09:30,836
Senior, do you want to apply it?

160
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:31,615
OK

161
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:34,490
Idiots, if you have this kind of time, you might as well do something

162
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,224
No, you guys need to rest first

163
00:09:37,061 --> 00:09:38,673
You haven't slept for several days, right?

164
00:09:38,673 --> 00:09:41,303
Indeed, rest is also a part of work

165
00:09:41,891 --> 00:09:43,761
Yeah, then I'm going to rest

166
00:09:43,761 --> 00:09:45,182
Sunouchi-senpai, do you want to apply it?

167
00:09:45,182 --> 00:09:46,291
No

168
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:49,678
Sunouchi-senpai

169
00:09:49,678 --> 00:09:52,128
Find out where Xinzhuang’s wife is

170
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:54,715
Xinzhuang Xili is a freelance financial planning consultant

171
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:56,043
Work in Tokyo

172
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:56,873
Where is the location?

173
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:58,502
here

174
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:00,282
Do you want to report to Lesson 1?

175
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,685
No need yet

176
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:03,943
Excuse me

177
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,243
Thank you for this

178
00:10:07,904 --> 00:10:10,384
Please...how much does that cost?

179
00:10:10,891 --> 00:10:11,931
that

180
00:10:12,134 --> 00:10:14,099
This is not for sale

181
00:10:15,702 --> 00:10:18,966
I just...wanted to ask how much

182
00:10:22,677 --> 00:10:24,677
three...

183
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:30,110
Three...three...

184
00:10:30,136 --> 00:10:31,644
Masamune

185
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,224
what

186
00:10:35,122 --> 00:10:37,887
Masamune, what are your plans next?

187
00:10:38,435 --> 00:10:40,369
I can only hide.

188
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,026
What if you can't hide?

189
00:10:42,026 --> 00:10:44,633
What are the plans after the kidnapping is discovered?

190
00:10:44,964 --> 00:10:48,702
Didn't your accomplice teach you?

191
00:10:49,393 --> 00:10:50,496
What accomplice

192
00:10:50,496 --> 00:10:53,186
You must have someone to help you

193
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:56,773
Can prepare a car and mobile phone that cannot be traced

194
00:10:56,811 --> 00:10:59,058
It's not like something you can do

195
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:00,841
That's not the case

196
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:02,049
who is

197
00:11:09,873 --> 00:11:11,406
It's Shiori

198
00:11:11,794 --> 00:11:13,250
Shiori?

199
00:11:13,648 --> 00:11:17,008
I mentioned before that she is Yasheng's mother

200
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:19,964
We were separated before

201
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:22,172
But after she learned about Yasheng's condition, she came back to help me.

202
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:26,139
kidnapping plan car cell phone

203
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,170
It was all prepared by Xi Li

204
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:30,246
You go call her

205
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,803
I am Kitamura from Central Sichuan Bureau

206
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,273
Is this Ms. Xiri Xinzhuang?

207
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,976
you are so beautiful

208
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:42,017
-Thank you for the compliment, please come this way -Okay

209
00:11:42,398 --> 00:11:44,277
You mean Xinzhuang?

210
00:11:44,277 --> 00:11:45,732
Yes

211
00:11:47,032 --> 00:11:51,020
You may be shocked to hear this

212
00:11:51,037 --> 00:11:53,211
A murder occurred four days ago

213
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:56,525
He is an important person in a certain case and we want to find him

214
00:11:56,525 --> 00:11:59,118
Do you have any news about him?

215
00:12:00,315 --> 00:12:03,957
We met about a month ago

216
00:12:04,238 --> 00:12:06,901
Learn about my daughter’s condition

217
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,731
I couldn't sit still, so I went to see him

218
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,257
I said I also wanted to help pay for the medical expenses.

219
00:12:14,452 --> 00:12:18,405
But he refused

220
00:12:19,116 --> 00:12:22,189
reject? Why

221
00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:26,018
He is very stubborn every time he encounters Mei Sheng.

222
00:12:26,884 --> 00:12:29,005
and

223
00:12:29,804 --> 00:12:34,224
He will definitely not be able to forgive me for abandoning my family and my son.

224
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,123
He said he would find a way to raise money on his own

225
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,614
Specifically, what is the method?

226
00:12:41,308 --> 00:12:44,190
No he didn't tell me

227
00:12:46,409 --> 00:12:48,028
(public phone)

228
00:12:52,168 --> 00:12:53,593
You take it

229
00:12:54,096 --> 00:12:56,323
It's okay, that's a work phone number

230
00:12:56,323 --> 00:12:57,588
I'll come back later

231
00:12:57,588 --> 00:13:00,140
Do you know how to contact your husband?

232
00:13:00,185 --> 00:13:03,990
I don't know, he won't tell me anything.

233
00:13:04,109 --> 00:13:06,334
Including that I don’t know where he is right now?

234
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:08,033
Yes

235
00:13:09,404 --> 00:13:12,359
The last time I saw him

236
00:13:12,985 --> 00:13:15,522
I said I hope I can atone for my sins

237
00:13:15,611 --> 00:13:19,401
Please let me stay with my daughter

238
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,901
maybe it's too late

239
00:13:24,765 --> 00:13:26,840
But I want to do it for that child

240
00:13:27,258 --> 00:13:31,391
Start working hard again for your family

241
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,016
Please use

242
00:13:35,867 --> 00:13:37,080
if you don't mind

243
00:13:37,143 --> 00:13:38,526
Feel sorry

244
00:13:42,894 --> 00:13:46,923
She must regret abandoning her family

245
00:13:47,815 --> 00:13:49,319
What's wrong

246
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:51,774
Do you know where Xinzhuang’s daughter is hospitalized?

247
00:13:51,808 --> 00:13:55,081
This is the hospital where the deceased, Director Nanase, lived.

248
00:13:55,096 --> 00:13:56,529
what's it called

249
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,108
Rongjin Memorial Hospital

250
00:13:58,124 --> 00:14:01,348
Rongjin Memorial Hospital? I understand.

251
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,990
(public phone)

252
00:14:12,956 --> 00:14:14,452
(Shiori)

253
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:21,458
Where did you run to, Xili?

254
00:14:24,843 --> 00:14:26,793
Didn't she answer?

255
00:14:26,873 --> 00:14:29,232
Is there no way to find her at all?

256
00:14:29,262 --> 00:14:30,330
Hospital

257
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,222
I asked Shiori to help me take care of Meisheng

258
00:14:33,222 --> 00:14:35,113
-So... -So you want to go to the hospital?

259
00:14:35,113 --> 00:14:37,372
Didn't I say there would be police there?

260
00:14:37,372 --> 00:14:39,084
Do you want to see Xili?

261
00:14:39,134 --> 00:14:42,541
And you might think of something when you go to dad's hospital.

262
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,621
So what if there are police?

263
00:14:44,771 --> 00:14:46,891
Long time no see Mei Sheng

264
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:49,320
Do you know how lonely I am?

265
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:53,772
I want to see Yasheng I want to see Yasheng...

266
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:54,566
How old are you?

267
00:14:54,566 --> 00:14:56,863
I want to see Yasheng...

268
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,366
Is it just a coincidence?

269
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:06,564
What if it wasn't this?

270
00:15:06,633 --> 00:15:08,432
Nanase Mamoru and Shinjo Masamune

271
00:15:08,688 --> 00:15:10,688
There is an intersection here

272
00:15:12,859 --> 00:15:14,906
Sorry to keep you waiting.

273
00:15:14,906 --> 00:15:17,255
I am consultant lawyer Yamazaki

274
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:20,315
Please let the Vice Chairman receive you here.

275
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:22,636
Excuse me

276
00:15:24,308 --> 00:15:26,747
Excuse me. My name is Kitamura from Sichuan Central Bureau.

277
00:15:26,766 --> 00:15:29,999
Where is Xiaolin? Where is Xiaolin?

278
00:15:30,024 --> 00:15:32,007
Haven't found anyone yet?

279
00:15:32,301 --> 00:15:34,032
We are searching for whereabouts

280
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:39,891
The person who killed Mamoru must have taken her away.

281
00:15:41,084 --> 00:15:42,670
That being the case

282
00:15:42,757 --> 00:15:47,366
I don’t know if Xiaolin... is still alive now

283
00:15:48,272 --> 00:15:52,225
It is not yet certain that the kidnappers killed Nanase and his wife.

284
00:15:52,225 --> 00:15:54,809
We are fully investigating

285
00:15:56,762 --> 00:16:00,198
Please be careful

286
00:16:15,843 --> 00:16:17,624
what is that

287
00:16:17,765 --> 00:16:19,495
soda candy

288
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:24,270
I used to get headaches when I was nervous

289
00:16:24,488 --> 00:16:26,751
Eat this to calm down

290
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:29,973
- Do you want to eat? - You really look like a child.

291
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,192
I want you to take care of it

292
00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:34,847
Good thing no one is leaving, right?

293
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:37,472
Wait a minute, that person is the police

294
00:16:37,472 --> 00:16:38,853
What

295
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,447
And that person and that person too

296
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,361
how do you know

297
00:16:44,408 --> 00:16:46,158
Don’t you understand yet?

298
00:16:46,158 --> 00:16:49,705
This means that your daughter's hospitalization here has been exposed.

299
00:16:49,783 --> 00:16:51,736
true or false

300
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:55,870
what to do...

301
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,900
If you go, you will be arrested

302
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,269
If I don’t go, I won’t be able to see Yasheng. What should I do?

303
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,555
This is it

304
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:06,383
Why don't we take the initiative to call the police?

305
00:17:06,383 --> 00:17:08,210
What

306
00:17:08,574 --> 00:17:10,710
Do you really want to fight?

307
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:13,344
Then fight

308
00:17:22,673 --> 00:17:24,207
So stinky

309
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:26,658
What are you doing to kill someone?

310
00:17:26,676 --> 00:17:28,257
I'm very nervous

311
00:17:35,776 --> 00:17:37,856
Hey, this is the Criminal Division

312
00:17:38,466 --> 00:17:41,865
Asahina Wharf Park is...

313
00:17:46,644 --> 00:17:48,065
What's wrong

314
00:17:48,322 --> 00:17:49,859
Someone saw it at Asahina Pier Park

315
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,558
A strange man took a girl about eight years old

316
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,926
feels strange

317
00:17:53,926 --> 00:17:55,764
Where is Asahina Pier Park?

318
00:17:55,766 --> 00:17:56,955
Asahina Wharf Park...

319
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:02,326
(Asahina Marine Terminal)

320
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:04,383
He wanted to escape by boat

321
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:06,509
Report to Sunouchi-senpai quickly

322
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:08,840
Senior went to the hospital

323
00:18:09,069 --> 00:18:11,777
The suspect appears at Asahina Pier Park

324
00:18:11,777 --> 00:18:13,651
-You guys go and have a look right away -Yes

325

326
00:18:15,902 --> 00:18:17,717
Send the investigators from the hospital there as well.

328
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:26,052
Pretty successful

329

345
00:19:55,286 --> 00:19:57,010

Where are the people from Xili?

361
00:21:23,024 --> 00:21:24,463
-Sorry-Mr. Xinzhuang

362
00:21:24,463 --> 00:21:27,444
- I'm sorry... - That's great, you scared me.

363
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:28,821
I just came to see Yasheng

364
00:21:28,845 --> 00:21:32,145
-You can stay with her. -I'll definitely pay.

365
00:21:32,161 --> 00:21:35,793
Mr. Xinzhuang's fees have been paid in full

366
00:21:35,853 --> 00:21:37,037
What

367
00:21:37,073 --> 00:21:39,526
All hospitalization and medical expenses

369
00:21:43,373 --> 00:21:46,604

Founded by Eisaku Nanase

371
00:21:52,355 --> 00:21:58,734
After his death, his son Amoru inherited the position of dean.

372
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:03,507
My uncle is here to help him run the business

373
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,354

374
00:22:05,354 --> 00:22:06,589
That's right

375
00:22:06,603 --> 00:22:09,612
She is Mamoru's only daughter

376
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,458
Then Dean Nanase Mamoru

377
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:15,256
Have you ever done something that would be resented?

378
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,269
Hello are you there?

379
00:22:17,478 --> 00:22:21,203
Dean Nanase is always immersed in research

380
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,386
Rarely interact with people

381
00:22:23,386 --> 00:22:25,301
What research is he doing?

382
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,108
Don't know

383
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:31,917
he is a secretist

384
00:22:32,126 --> 00:22:34,418
-Bukchon-Yes

385
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:37,192
Have you seen this man?

386
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:41,280
-Who is he - Shinjo Masamune

387
00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:45,897
His daughter is currently hospitalized here

388
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:48,122
Can we go and ask questions?

389
00:22:48,212 --> 00:22:49,651
please

390
00:22:49,651 --> 00:22:51,440
I'll notify the staff

391
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:54,705
Then it should be none of my business, right?

392
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:58,548
Because I just started learning piano

393
00:22:58,757 --> 00:23:00,217
Okay, thank you for your cooperation

394
00:23:04,757 --> 00:23:06,399
Right

395
00:23:06,732 --> 00:23:10,130
Does Nanase Rin have any other relatives besides you?

396
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:13,278
After Mamoru and the others passed away

397
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:17,104
I should be the only relative left.

398
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:21,015
It turns out that if even Xiaolin dies unfortunately

399
00:23:21,101 --> 00:23:24,080
This hospital and the legacy of the Nanase family

400
00:23:24,129 --> 00:23:25,919
Will you inherit them all?

401
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,302
Mr. Detective

402
00:23:35,276 --> 00:23:37,388
I'll come back another day

403
00:23:42,097 --> 00:23:44,258
Mr. Detective, you are so rude.

404
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:45,657
sorry

405
00:23:45,781 --> 00:23:47,880
But I am stating the facts

406
00:23:48,102 --> 00:23:51,656
Everything in the Nanase family will become the vice chairman's property

407
00:23:52,087 --> 00:23:54,173
That's not necessarily the case

408
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:56,613
nothing

409
00:23:56,697 --> 00:23:59,831
I'm going to arrange the patient I just mentioned

410
00:24:02,864 --> 00:24:04,439
How about ten o'clock?

411
00:24:04,447 --> 00:24:07,847
I look at the night shift schedule and I'll get off work at nine o'clock.

412
00:24:08,201 --> 00:24:09,993
Doctor, your phone is ringing

413
00:24:14,701 --> 00:24:16,031
Hello

414
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,845
Police?

415
00:24:19,092 --> 00:24:22,576
Xinzhuang Yasheng is my patient

416
00:24:23,414 --> 00:24:25,749
Now?

417
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,674
knew

418
00:24:49,332 --> 00:24:51,763
Yes I know

419
00:24:51,911 --> 00:24:55,395
Senior, we received a piece of witness information about the suspect.

420
00:24:55,407 --> 00:24:58,462
It was reported by the general public and nearby police officers rushed to the scene.

421
00:24:58,561 --> 00:25:01,666
The kidnapper’s information hasn’t been made public yet, right?

422
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:04,701
The timing is too coincidental

423
00:25:04,763 --> 00:25:06,393
Where did they send the police officers there?

424
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,996
I'll ask right away

425
00:25:14,196 --> 00:25:16,208
Where is Xinzhuang Yasheng's ward?

426
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,270
Ward on the sixth floor

427
00:25:18,442 --> 00:25:20,442
You come with us

428
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:22,516
Follow me, please

429
00:25:23,675 --> 00:25:27,649
After the baby is born, he will be transferred to a single room

430
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:30,957
All the money has been paid

431
00:25:31,733 --> 00:25:34,695
Did Xili pay it off?

432
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,942
Shiori?

433
00:25:36,942 --> 00:25:38,597
my wife

434
00:25:38,659 --> 00:25:42,976
She should come to accompany Yasheng sometimes

435
00:25:43,296 --> 00:25:45,377
-Have you seen it? -No

436
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,648
I've never met the person you're talking about

437
00:25:47,722 --> 00:25:50,154
What?

438
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:52,832
Masamune

439
00:25:53,189 --> 00:25:55,189
-Xiao Lin-It's time to go

440
00:25:55,275 --> 00:25:56,695
Where are you going?

441
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,325
-Let's go-Hey

442
00:25:59,163 --> 00:26:00,505
you are...

443
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:02,393
where to go

444
00:26:02,714 --> 00:26:04,369
Hey, where are you going?

445
00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:07,232
Shinjo

446
00:26:10,449 --> 00:26:13,318
Hey, stop

447
00:26:13,367 --> 00:26:15,216
Are you Xinzhuang?

448
00:26:18,014 --> 00:26:19,721
suspect found

449
00:26:22,272 --> 00:26:23,951
On the sixth floor

450
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:25,596
Hello

451
00:26:27,223 --> 00:26:29,161
He has entered the stairwell. Come upstairs.

452
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,171
This way

453
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:41,744
Hello

454
00:26:51,347 --> 00:26:53,175
Want to continue going downstairs?

455
00:26:53,298 --> 00:26:55,664
-Sunouchi-senpai-Come up here

456
00:26:55,678 --> 00:26:56,691
yes

457
00:26:58,675 --> 00:27:01,863
-They're coming-They're coming...

458
00:27:03,712 --> 00:27:05,290
Coming...

459
00:27:07,115 --> 00:27:08,416
stop

460
00:27:10,412 --> 00:27:13,066
Kitamura went to borrow a pass from the nurse

461
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:14,433
- Go quickly - Yes

462
00:27:22,617 --> 00:27:24,728
Not here

463
00:27:26,984 --> 00:27:29,505
-What time is it - now?

464
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:31,333
1:59

465
00:27:31,543 --> 00:27:33,638
-This way-This way?

466
00:27:33,899 --> 00:27:35,366
(Entry is prohibited during construction ahead)

467
00:27:37,586 --> 00:27:39,154
open the door

468
00:27:44,244 --> 00:27:47,138
Move faster

469
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:50,201
- Come on, go ahead. - Got it.

470
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,532
-This way-This way?

471
00:27:54,111 --> 00:27:56,601
- Open that door - here?

472
00:27:56,699 --> 00:27:58,761
It's not the door next door.

473
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:00,675
Any one will do

474
00:28:02,573 --> 00:28:04,412
-Here? -Yes

475
00:28:07,691 --> 00:28:09,490
open window

476
00:28:12,687 --> 00:28:14,157
carry me up

477
00:28:14,251 --> 00:28:17,302
-Go up? -Stop asking and hurry up.

478
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:21,946
What's next?

479
00:28:22,371 --> 00:28:24,261
-Are you going to jump? -Jump?

480
00:28:24,308 --> 00:28:26,024
No way

481
00:28:26,024 --> 00:28:27,742
Gotta jump from here

482
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:28,950
What

483
00:28:29,006 --> 00:28:30,175
keep up

484
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:03,108
Shouldn't you have settled it earlier?

485
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:06,080
Well, it's all in my calculations

486
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,801
(Reconstruction Project Notice) The old building here is currently closed.

487
00:29:08,801 --> 00:29:11,343
(The truck leaves at 14:00) Today is the day to recycle old hospital beds

488
00:29:11,343 --> 00:29:13,722
The truck will leave at 14:00

489
00:29:13,722 --> 00:29:17,364
We only have three minutes left

490
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:20,341
calculate...

491
00:29:20,436 --> 00:29:24,380
You should also use your brain a little bit.

492
00:29:34,302 --> 00:29:36,159
Was set up

493
00:29:36,206 --> 00:29:38,645
I actually watched the suspect slip away.

494
00:29:38,723 --> 00:29:40,645
Really unlike you

495
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:43,445
I have to explain to my boss later

496
00:29:43,445 --> 00:29:46,314
At least save the child.

497
00:29:47,935 --> 00:29:50,235
I saw the kid pulling Xinzhuang

498
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,179
something isn't quite right

499
00:29:55,179 --> 00:29:57,351
Within the feed

500
00:29:57,901 --> 00:30:01,450
Senior, I'm sorry, it's all our fault

501
00:30:01,497 --> 00:30:02,954
sorry

502
00:30:02,989 --> 00:30:06,303
It's too early to be depressed now, hurry up and regain your composure

503
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,062
Find Xinzhuang's hideout

504
00:30:09,062 --> 00:30:10,572
yes

505
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:14,325
By the way, senior, please take a look at this

506
00:30:15,615 --> 00:30:18,173
When I checked Dean Nanase Mamoru's account,

507
00:30:18,173 --> 00:30:19,891
Found hundreds of millions of remittance records

508
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,955
- Hundreds of millions? -That's right

509
00:30:23,685 --> 00:30:27,218
Why is this amount actually worth one billion?

510
00:30:27,218 --> 00:30:29,999
We are trying to contact the remitter

511
00:30:30,172 --> 00:30:32,327
Yukiko Mizuhara

512
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:36,786
The police department just called

513
00:30:36,881 --> 00:30:38,360
police?

514
00:30:38,374 --> 00:30:42,811
Yes they want to talk to you

515
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,658
Yukiko Mizuhara

516
00:30:49,674 --> 00:30:53,509
She is developing new drugs to treat pituitary gland tumors

517
00:30:53,509 --> 00:30:57,422
Therefore, the MD who created huge profits in the US market

518
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:59,691
Currently established consortium

519
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:03,494
Operating pharmaceutical-related businesses

520
00:31:03,525 --> 00:31:05,764
Why would such a person send one billion to Dean Nanase?

521
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:07,796
What's going on, Sunouchi-senpai?

522
00:31:07,796 --> 00:31:09,270
Look at this quickly

523
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:12,355
Someone posted this online

524
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:20,052
so hungry

525
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:22,169
(Miso Ramen)

526
00:31:23,739 --> 00:31:26,997
Let’s be extravagant and eat ramen today

527
00:31:27,264 --> 00:31:28,573
I want ramen

528
00:31:30,163 --> 00:31:31,001
show me

529
00:31:32,946 --> 00:31:33,961
Masamune

530
00:31:34,117 --> 00:31:34,955
OK

531
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:39,581
What happened in a residential area in Kanagawa Prefecture on the 8th of this month?

532
00:31:39,623 --> 00:31:41,758
Murder case of hospital director and his wife

533
00:31:41,758 --> 00:31:43,851
It is reported that they have an only daughter

534
00:31:43,874 --> 00:31:47,686
Currently suspected of being kidnapped

535
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:52,708
And the male kidnapper has a murder record

536
00:31:54,637 --> 00:31:56,614
kill?

537
00:31:58,303 --> 00:32:00,570
(Another incident behind the murder)

538
00:32:01,728 --> 00:32:03,578
Hello, this is the Criminal Division of Sichuan Police Station.

539
00:32:03,579 --> 00:32:06,194
I'm very sorry I can't disclose

540
00:32:06,237 --> 00:32:07,733
- Goodbye - Yes...

541
00:32:07,819 --> 00:32:09,690
Sorry, really sorry

542
00:32:09,808 --> 00:32:11,415
-Hello, this is Kawanaka Police Station. -I'm sorry.

543
00:32:11,453 --> 00:32:13,580
-The crime team searches for Kitamura from the first department-Sorry

544
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,875
Gossip magazines publish reports without permission

545
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:19,553
This will not suppress other media outlets that abide by reporting agreements.

546
00:32:19,588 --> 00:32:21,137
who leaked the news

547
00:32:21,137 --> 00:32:22,235
I just wanted to ask you

548
00:32:22,235 --> 00:32:24,825
Could it be that someone in your department leaked the secret?

549
00:32:24,836 --> 00:32:26,258
What nonsense are you talking about?

550
00:32:26,258 --> 00:32:27,553
In short

551
00:32:28,093 --> 00:32:30,886
Now the only option is to change it to a public search.

552
00:32:30,932 --> 00:32:34,703
In addition, family members also protested

553
00:32:34,771 --> 00:32:36,482
I'll leave it to you

554
00:32:39,187 --> 00:32:42,911
This photo is our monitor screen, right?

555
00:32:43,233 --> 00:32:46,658
Images we kindly provided to the police

556
00:32:46,658 --> 00:32:48,658
Why is it being made public?

557
00:32:49,657 --> 00:32:52,860
Sorry, we are also investigating

558
00:32:52,884 --> 00:32:55,528
I guess it was you who leaked it.

559
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:59,849
Success...Yamazaki

560
00:33:00,136 --> 00:33:03,297
The police are also very troubled.

561
00:33:04,998 --> 00:33:06,882
But Mr. Detective

562
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:11,915
Can Xiaolin still be safe after things have turned like this?

563
00:33:12,317 --> 00:33:14,317
that kidnapper

564
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:18,822
Don’t you have a murder record?

565
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,429
Hello

566
00:33:27,647 --> 00:33:30,003
Have you really killed anyone?

567
00:33:31,623 --> 00:33:33,060
answer me

568
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:37,599
right

569
00:33:39,909 --> 00:33:41,389
is true

570
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,986
sixteen years ago

571
00:33:42,986 --> 00:33:46,757
Xinzhuang rescues a woman who is entangled by a drunkard

572
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,194
Argue with each other

573
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,867
Hey, where are you going?

574
00:33:49,867 --> 00:33:51,559
Stop it quickly

575
00:33:55,178 --> 00:33:57,852
The opponent hit the fatal spot when he fell

576
00:33:57,933 --> 00:33:59,806
In the end, there was no way to save the day

577
00:33:59,943 --> 00:34:01,943
Is this considered legitimate defense?

578
00:34:01,989 --> 00:34:04,345
That man is the son of a congressman

579
00:34:04,494 --> 00:34:06,887
Witnesses were bribed

580
00:34:08,404 --> 00:34:11,421
Xinzhuang itself did not fight back in court.

581
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:15,144
Accept the sentence and leave a criminal record

582
00:34:17,994 --> 00:34:21,327
So what

583
00:34:21,533 --> 00:34:25,047
Of course he is indeed the kidnapper in this case

584
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,527
I don't sympathize with him at all

585
00:34:28,262 --> 00:34:29,869
Just this matter

586
00:34:29,892 --> 00:34:32,880
Can we judge based on surface facts alone?

587
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,486
It still needs to be carefully clarified

588
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,383
this is my point of view

589
00:34:38,406 --> 00:34:39,972
I...

590
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:45,822
I plan to bear my sins for the rest of my life.

591
00:34:47,384 --> 00:34:48,760
can you swear

592
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,372
Swear you didn't kill my parents

593
00:34:53,004 --> 00:34:55,153
Of course the murderer is not me

594
00:34:55,785 --> 00:34:57,209
Then you swear

595
00:34:57,246 --> 00:35:00,323
OK I swear

596
00:35:00,782 --> 00:35:02,954
I definitely didn't kill your parents

597
00:35:02,989 --> 00:35:04,376
That's not it

598
00:35:04,537 --> 00:35:07,369
Swear to me you will never kill me

599
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,505
I swear

600
00:35:11,216 --> 00:35:14,019
I would never do that

601
00:35:14,168 --> 00:35:15,921
Absolutely not

602
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:24,344
Okay, eat it quickly

603
00:35:27,188 --> 00:35:29,673
Don't blow it. It's dirty.

604
00:36:04,889 --> 00:36:06,043
Printed

605
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,325
(Wanted order for Nanase Rin kidnapping case)

606
00:36:08,356 --> 00:36:10,817
A public investigation into a kidnapping case is unprecedented.

607
00:36:10,817 --> 00:36:12,878
So you must not fail

608
00:36:12,878 --> 00:36:14,011
That's right

609
00:36:14,286 --> 00:36:15,654
Sunouchi-senpai

610
00:36:17,203 --> 00:36:19,172
Dr. Mizuhara is here

611
00:36:19,172 --> 00:36:20,326
What

612
00:36:31,024 --> 00:36:32,348
My surname is Mu

613
00:36:34,043 --> 00:36:36,530
Please come over here

614
00:36:37,164 --> 00:36:38,265
It's hot outside, right?

615
00:36:39,107 --> 00:36:40,914
My surname is Xuunai

616
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:44,079
Thank you for coming all the way

617
00:36:44,108 --> 00:36:47,324
After all, it's a big deal and I want to help.

618
00:36:47,507 --> 00:36:49,182
Thanks for your cooperation

619
00:36:50,354 --> 00:36:51,715
Please sit down

620
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:02,740
I just said that I wanted to ask about this matter

621
00:37:04,607 --> 00:37:06,994
Nine months ago you gave Dean Nanase

622
00:37:07,021 --> 00:37:09,376
(Remittance of one billion yen to Yukiko Hara) A remittance of one billion yen

623
00:37:09,669 --> 00:37:11,669
I feel very strange

624
00:37:12,186 --> 00:37:16,678
Dean Nanase is not as famous as you are.

625
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:19,096
Majors are also different

626
00:37:19,308 --> 00:37:21,502
Why did you give him so much money?

627
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:25,290
It's a research fund for Dean Nanase.

628
00:37:25,386 --> 00:37:27,950
taking into account his contribution

629
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,479
This is a reasonable amount

630
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:32,315
What kind of research is it?

631
00:37:33,028 --> 00:37:36,415
I can't disclose details

632
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:41,786
I'd like to ask how much you know about it

633
00:37:44,602 --> 00:37:48,104
I want to help

634
00:37:52,501 --> 00:37:54,732
Kitamura, bring that

635
00:37:54,922 --> 00:37:55,749
What

636
00:37:55,749 --> 00:37:59,283
The Nanase family built a research room underground

637
00:37:59,651 --> 00:38:01,933
Please look at something

638
00:38:05,469 --> 00:38:06,809
Please see

639
00:38:06,841 --> 00:38:08,883
I brought it

640
00:38:11,296 --> 00:38:13,310
I put this here

641
00:38:14,009 --> 00:38:15,804
Don't be slow

642
00:38:17,513 --> 00:38:19,411
Not good

643
00:38:19,411 --> 00:38:21,499
Is it okay to show her this information?

644
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:23,352
Will you be angry after a lesson?

645
00:38:24,156 --> 00:38:27,270
-Senior, it’s okay as long as you say it. -Hey Bei Cun

646
00:38:27,343 --> 00:38:30,606
The ice cubes in the coffee melted. Go get another cup.

647
00:38:31,338 --> 00:38:33,547
Don't procrastinate

648
00:38:33,576 --> 00:38:35,983
He's so exaggerated

649
00:38:37,225 --> 00:38:40,220
Hurry up, it's too slow

650
00:38:44,006 --> 00:38:46,006
If you don’t know, don’t touch it

651
00:38:46,064 --> 00:38:47,360
OK

652
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:59,832
Is that all the information? What about the others?

653
00:38:59,922 --> 00:39:01,761
Not sure

654
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:04,509
are you looking for something

655
00:39:06,151 --> 00:39:07,982
Kesouyan said these documents

656
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:11,683
These are all basic information on Dean Nanase’s major.

657
00:39:12,007 --> 00:39:14,551
nothing special

658
00:39:16,404 --> 00:39:21,434
Then why did you invest one billion yuan?

659
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:26,528
What kind of research is Dean Nanase doing in that basement?

660
00:39:30,072 --> 00:39:32,072
Even if I say it

661
00:39:32,248 --> 00:39:35,293
You can't understand either

662
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:40,631
Is the kidnapped girl's name Nanase Rin?

663
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:43,630
I hope you can find her safely

664
00:40:03,616 --> 00:40:05,794
The police are asking for information

665
00:40:06,926 --> 00:40:09,415
Catch that kid quickly

666
00:40:15,856 --> 00:40:17,665
where are you going

667
00:40:19,577 --> 00:40:21,189
Phone call Shiori

668
00:40:21,189 --> 00:40:24,204
Didn't she answer the question? You were probably abandoned.

669
00:40:25,336 --> 00:40:28,130
Now there are reports all over the place about you

670
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:31,034
She thinks she can no longer have anything to do with you, right?

671
00:40:31,152 --> 00:40:34,329
You must have been abandoned again

672
00:40:35,756 --> 00:40:39,357
I'll try one last time

673
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,434
Masamune

674
00:40:50,111 --> 00:40:51,918
You must remember to come back

675
00:40:52,654 --> 00:40:54,506
Of course

676
00:40:54,992 --> 00:40:56,992
You go to sleep first

677
00:41:02,683 --> 00:41:04,164
Oops

678
00:41:05,164 --> 00:41:07,268
ten yuan...

679
00:41:20,312 --> 00:41:22,694
Xiao Lin, run away

680
00:41:24,092 --> 00:41:26,946
Xiao Lin, run away quickly

681
00:41:52,904 --> 00:41:54,593
Xiao Lin

682
00:41:55,254 --> 00:41:57,180
Run away quickly

683
00:42:54,143 --> 00:42:55,713
Hello

684
00:42:57,066 --> 00:42:59,156
What are you doing

685
00:43:21,729 --> 00:43:23,258
Xiao Lin

686
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:30,436
So you are here

687
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:32,754
Shiori

688
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,180
first meeting

689
00:43:39,768 --> 00:43:41,768
Sister Nanase Rin

690
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,693
ok i got it

691
00:43:45,693 --> 00:43:46,704
Please rest assured

692
00:43:46,709 --> 00:43:49,293
I will definitely bring Nanase Rin to you

693
00:43:56,784 --> 00:43:58,405
Will it hurt?

694
00:43:58,461 --> 00:43:59,924
Won't

©ASTORY & KT Studiogenie/tv asahi

696

(Is the missing wife the murderer?) Did the aunt kill my parents?

697
00:44:10,405 --> 00:44:11,998
I'll tell you

698
00:44:12,558 --> 00:44:15,137
-Who confessed first? -You are a gossip reporter.

Absolutely
