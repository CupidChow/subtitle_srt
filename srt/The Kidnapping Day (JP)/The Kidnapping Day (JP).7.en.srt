1
00:00:00,056 --> 00:00:02,085
(I am a kidnapper) My name is Masamune Shinjo

2
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:04,192
Became a kidnapper for some reason

3
00:00:04,192 --> 00:00:07,910
(The genius girl who lost her memory) The Nanase Rin I kidnapped was a genius girl who lost her memory.

4
00:00:07,932 --> 00:00:10,222
-And... -I killed the person

5
00:00:10,222 --> 00:00:14,435
(The guard was the prisoner who killed his parents?) The police arrested Matsuda, the guard suspected of killing Xiao Rin’s parents.

6
00:00:14,456 --> 00:00:16,864
Please feel free to give me your orders, madam.

7
00:00:17,014 --> 00:00:20,229
(Dr. Mizuhara and Lawyer Yamazaki become allies) We win over Dr. Mizuhara and Lawyer Yamazaki to become allies

8
00:00:20,248 --> 00:00:21,666
Launch a desperate counterattack

9
00:00:21,685 --> 00:00:23,152
this video

10
00:00:23,152 --> 00:00:26,204
From now on, it is revealed to the whole world

11
00:00:26,204 --> 00:00:27,071
knew

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,391
An escape plan to extort three billion yuan

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,889
Everything went as planned and it was a great success

14
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:35,304
I remember one more thing

15
00:00:35,547 --> 00:00:37,431
That's my identity

16
00:00:37,697 --> 00:00:39,803
I'm the kidnapper you bastard

17
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,318
(The Day of Kidnapping) (Chapter 7)

18
00:00:43,883 --> 00:00:45,845
I'm a policeman

19
00:00:45,897 --> 00:00:49,296
(The real murderer behind the scenes is about to appear in the final chapter)

20
00:00:51,174 --> 00:00:53,930
Don't move, put down your weapon

21
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,848
Mr. Xinzhuang, I brought it

22
00:01:06,374 --> 00:01:09,004
Take him to my office first

23
00:01:09,004 --> 00:01:11,978
-Xiao Lin, your room has been arranged. Let's go. -Okay

24
00:01:11,978 --> 00:01:14,563
-I'm here-I'm sorry to bother you

25
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:18,643
Is everything going well on the other side?

26
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,900
Well, Mr. Police, they will definitely take care of it.

27
00:01:22,684 --> 00:01:25,927
It seems that I got the mobile phone smoothly. It’s great.

28
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,087
Then proceed as planned

29
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:33,693
(number not shown)

30
00:01:35,948 --> 00:01:38,386
-Hi-I'm Xinzhuang

31
00:01:41,795 --> 00:01:44,661
Where are you now, Xiaolin, are you okay?

32
00:01:44,661 --> 00:01:47,932
Xiao Lin is fine but she needs rescue

33
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,243
I don't have time to explain it carefully

34
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,446
The ransom will be exchanged at midnight tonight

35
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:55,286
The people who put us under house arrest will show up then

36
00:01:55,286 --> 00:01:56,580
Please arrest them

37
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,175
Xiaolin and I will find a way to escape at that time

38
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,549
Do you think I will believe you?

39
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:06,804
Yasheng will have surgery tomorrow

40
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,146
I will turn myself in after her operation is over in the hospital.

41
00:02:10,146 --> 00:02:12,938
I promise to please you

42
00:02:13,488 --> 00:02:16,022
I only believe in you

43
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:18,146
please

44
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:21,415
Later, I will explain carefully where you are from.

45
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,837
- take away - yes

46
00:02:55,152 --> 00:02:56,951
Hello, doctor

47
00:03:00,623 --> 00:03:04,885
Can you help me untie it or...

48
00:03:04,906 --> 00:03:08,616
disappear from us immediately

49
00:03:08,626 --> 00:03:11,932
I'm sorry, but the company won't allow it.

50
00:03:12,586 --> 00:03:14,586
Then I will let you disappear

51
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:19,622
I've been excluded from the plan, right?

52
00:03:19,642 --> 00:03:21,216
How could it be?

53
00:03:21,282 --> 00:03:24,020
We still have room for negotiation

54
00:03:24,365 --> 00:03:27,234
But if you kill me now

55
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:30,143
This will completely cut off this escape route.

56
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,448
In that case

57
00:03:31,508 --> 00:03:35,967
What are you going to do with your precious son?

58
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:11,023
You must think I'm shameful

59
00:04:12,206 --> 00:04:14,578
But I...

60
00:04:14,606 --> 00:04:17,624
I still don’t know what your son’s name is?

61
00:04:20,306 --> 00:04:23,215
your son's name

62
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:28,897
Natsuki

63
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,305
Natsuki Natsuki

64
00:04:31,799 --> 00:04:34,038
It's a good name

65
00:04:36,465 --> 00:04:40,639
Could it be because I was born in the summer...

66
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,016
Yeah

67
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,933
My Yasheng was born in May

68
00:04:46,963 --> 00:04:49,342
So take the English pronunciation of May

69
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:52,150
The idea is very simple, right?

70
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:58,175
Yasheng was born with a bad heart

71
00:05:00,182 --> 00:05:02,785
The doctor said she wouldn't survive a year

72
00:05:04,642 --> 00:05:06,506
Later I had surgery

73
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:10,178
I also stay with her as much as possible

74
00:05:13,338 --> 00:05:16,619
Every May I thank God

75
00:05:17,368 --> 00:05:19,263
thank god

76
00:05:19,323 --> 00:05:21,517
May Yasheng be alive

77
00:05:23,974 --> 00:05:25,974
Wait until I come to my senses

78
00:05:27,472 --> 00:05:29,363
She is already so old

79
00:05:31,491 --> 00:05:35,465
I just realized that children are really strong

80
00:05:37,652 --> 00:05:43,009
On the contrary, I have been encouraged by my children

81
00:05:47,608 --> 00:05:49,141
He is...

82
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:53,297
Born on a hot day in summer

83
00:05:56,713 --> 00:05:58,877
from the ward window

84
00:06:02,293 --> 00:06:04,876
You can see a big tree

85
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:08,849
I hope

86
00:06:10,122 --> 00:06:12,675
He can grow and thrive like a big tree

87
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:15,902
So named Xia Shu

88
00:06:18,688 --> 00:06:22,977
My thoughts are also very simple

89
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:28,080
Parents’ hearts are so simple

90
00:06:53,785 --> 00:06:55,785
(Kawanaka Police Station)

91
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:04,113
Why should we let go the prisoner we finally caught?

92
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,183
You are the one

93
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:09,328
Why did you act without reporting?

94
00:07:09,643 --> 00:07:11,643
Because there is no time to hesitate

95
00:07:11,703 --> 00:07:15,692
What matters most is what you arrest them for.

96
00:07:15,692 --> 00:07:19,915
They all said they prepared the ransom.

97
00:07:22,082 --> 00:07:25,739
This was recovered from the seized garbage bags.

98
00:07:25,784 --> 00:07:27,743
All...

99
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:30,891
Stacks of white paper

100
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:33,566
According to their confessions

101
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:37,600
They just take the rubbish to the collection site

102
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,602
How is this a crime?

103
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,762
I've seen that guy before

104
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:47,645
It was he who let go of Xinzhuang who was arrested by me

105
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,675
Are you dazzled?

106
00:07:51,323 --> 00:07:53,504
Xiaolin should still be alive

107
00:07:55,317 --> 00:07:57,360
this case

108
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,993
The case has been closed

109
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:06,782
Then again, where did you get the news this time?

110
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:10,849
Shinjo himself

111
00:08:12,812 --> 00:08:14,842
He promised me he would surrender

112
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:17,912
His daughter is going to have surgery this afternoon

113
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:20,316
He will appear with Xiao Lin

114
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,768
What if Xinzhuang doesn’t show up?

115
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:33,828
and you…

116
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:37,237
Just prepare to be punished

117
00:08:43,002 --> 00:08:44,730
it's me

118
00:08:44,765 --> 00:08:46,818
You are indeed alive

119
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,517
Of course

120
00:08:48,517 --> 00:08:51,588
You haven't forgotten that Yasheng is going to have an operation today, right?

121
00:08:51,588 --> 00:08:54,290
Well, of course I didn’t forget

122
00:08:54,343 --> 00:08:57,133
I will also go to the hospital with Xiaolin

123
00:08:59,102 --> 00:09:01,102
There should be police guarding there.

124
00:09:01,102 --> 00:09:02,610
I know

125
00:09:04,754 --> 00:09:06,843
When I see Mei Sheng, I will surrender

126
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:09,628
Of course I won't mention you a word

127
00:09:10,489 --> 00:09:13,436
So I will leave Yasheng in your care.

128
00:09:14,613 --> 00:09:17,109
I will end everything today

129
00:09:19,324 --> 00:09:21,324
Masamune

130
00:09:22,783 --> 00:09:25,438
I will wait for you with Yasheng

131
00:09:28,091 --> 00:09:29,687
good

132
00:09:36,403 --> 00:09:38,122
Xiaolin from now on

133
00:09:38,338 --> 00:09:40,295
No longer anyone’s experiment

134
00:09:40,295 --> 00:09:42,883
Will live as an ordinary child

135
00:09:43,544 --> 00:09:46,693
This is what the uncle kidnapper can do for her

136
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:51,657
Come with me to redeem your sins

137
00:09:56,144 --> 00:09:58,130
Then let's go

138
00:09:58,158 --> 00:09:59,416
good

139
00:10:00,753 --> 00:10:02,277
Wait a moment

140
00:10:03,672 --> 00:10:05,512
Are you going to wear this?

141
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,977
Wearing that kind of morality when you go to see your daughter?

142
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:09,628
No?

143
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,843
Today is an important day, right?

144
00:10:11,843 --> 00:10:13,843
You have to act like your dad.

145
00:10:14,332 --> 00:10:15,873
lawyer

146
00:10:16,247 --> 00:10:17,645
receive

147
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:24,971
This and this

148
00:10:27,338 --> 00:10:28,727
How about it

149
00:10:30,538 --> 00:10:31,672
next set

150
00:10:35,338 --> 00:10:36,717
How about it

151
00:10:38,859 --> 00:10:40,186
How about it

152
00:10:46,283 --> 00:10:48,138
-How's it going? - It's beautiful.

153
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:49,911
very suitable for you

154
00:10:50,098 --> 00:10:53,552
Really? But it's expensive, right?

155
00:10:53,597 --> 00:10:55,117
Don't worry

156
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:57,958
I'll pay for it, right?

157
00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:09,569
How is Xiaolin delicious?

158
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:15,547
This is very hot

159
00:11:21,824 --> 00:11:23,581
Isn't this delicious?

160
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,630
This store is so quiet

161
00:11:32,687 --> 00:11:34,687
Are there no other guests?

162
00:11:35,003 --> 00:11:38,100
Yes, I've booked the venue just to be cautious.

163
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,121
Money paid by the eldest lady

164
00:11:41,538 --> 00:11:43,669
How rich are you?

165
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:46,115
- tell him - yes

166
00:11:46,144 --> 00:11:50,384
The real estate includes Dr. Nanase’s residence and hospital.

167
00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:54,580
Plus corporate bonds, foreign bonds, securities and deposits

168
00:11:54,593 --> 00:11:58,213
Current assets are approximately 12 billion yuan

169
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,658
What a hundred...

170
00:12:00,658 --> 00:12:02,413
my ransom

171
00:12:02,413 --> 00:12:06,090
At least three billion is required

172
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:09,389
-Otherwise you would be looking down on me too much. -I'm sorry.

173
00:12:11,704 --> 00:12:14,620
Hundreds, millions, hundreds, thousands, millions…

174
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,922
Hello

175
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:17,746
Hello Doctor

176
00:12:17,775 --> 00:12:19,746
Masamune, let’s eat

177
00:12:19,746 --> 00:12:21,660
we are having a meal

178
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:23,987
Is this restaurant?

179
00:12:25,927 --> 00:12:27,927
Are you coming over now?

180
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,101
No

181
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:34,269
Please help me convey my best wishes to his daughter for successful surgery.

182
00:12:52,349 --> 00:12:54,081
Then it's time for us to set off

183
00:12:54,103 --> 00:12:55,237
OK

184
00:12:57,896 --> 00:12:59,679
Broken

185
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,865
After all, you have been using it for a long time

186
00:13:01,937 --> 00:13:03,894
Always concerned about the time to take medicine

187
00:13:06,137 --> 00:13:08,995
Does this mean that you don’t have to worry about Meisheng anymore?

188
00:13:09,053 --> 00:13:12,298
Give it to me and I'll fix it for you

189
00:13:13,248 --> 00:13:14,864
Thanks

190
00:13:28,245 --> 00:13:29,308
Very helpful

191
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:31,969
It would be bad if we go to the police station.

192
00:13:37,077 --> 00:13:40,145
I thought this matter had been resolved

193
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:42,016
you really disappoint me

194
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:10,706
Your method is too much

195
00:14:12,623 --> 00:14:14,378
This is the final warning

196
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:17,948
Get the formula and bring the research results to Rin Nanase.

197
00:14:19,328 --> 00:14:20,848
obey

198
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,465
Where is dad?

199
00:14:24,588 --> 00:14:28,075
He must be praying for you somewhere

200
00:14:28,363 --> 00:14:31,624
Yes, keep working hard

201
00:14:31,868 --> 00:14:33,331
good

202
00:14:34,112 --> 00:14:37,079
The surgery time is coming soon. Let's prepare first.

203
00:14:37,295 --> 00:14:38,699
good

204
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,839
The operation starts in another hour

205
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:50,621
Will Xinzhuang really come?

206
00:14:53,282 --> 00:14:55,282
Employee entrance and exit

207
00:14:56,993 --> 00:14:58,993
Xinzhuang said he would come from that way

208
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:02,625
We have to catch the person before the first lesson and hand it over to you.

209
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,115
knew

210
00:15:09,622 --> 00:15:12,445
According to this time, you can see the sprout before the surgery.

211
00:15:13,782 --> 00:15:15,366
Ah little bear

212
00:15:16,157 --> 00:15:18,845
I'm going to buy a doll for Yasheng

213
00:15:18,845 --> 00:15:20,902
-Then I'll drive. -Okay

214
00:15:25,016 --> 00:15:27,365
Xiao Lin…

215
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:30,072
Lend me money Lend me money

216
00:15:38,627 --> 00:15:41,032
I will definitely pay it back. I will definitely pay it back.

217
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,511
Let's go

218
00:15:57,381 --> 00:15:59,843
I was about to call you

219
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:06,252
do you know what you are doing

220
00:16:06,252 --> 00:16:10,317
You are betraying your biological father

221
00:16:10,878 --> 00:16:15,466
I always listen to you

222
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:19,091
because i'm scared

223
00:16:19,364 --> 00:16:21,566
will be abandoned by you

224
00:16:22,989 --> 00:16:24,416
But

225
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:29,164
You should decide your own life

226
00:16:29,341 --> 00:16:33,872
This is what the eldest lady and Mr. Xinzhuang taught me.

227
00:16:37,688 --> 00:16:39,879
thank you so far

228
00:16:41,242 --> 00:16:44,735
Goodbye dad

229
00:16:45,661 --> 00:16:48,803
You are no longer my son

230
00:17:03,381 --> 00:17:04,662
Danger

231
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,407
lawyer

232
00:17:22,206 --> 00:17:24,082
You run away quickly

233
00:17:25,908 --> 00:17:29,219
Run away quickly

234
00:17:31,793 --> 00:17:34,298
Help

235
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:46,205
-Thank you. -Thank you for coming.

236
00:17:46,736 --> 00:17:49,946
Lifesaving Masamune

237
00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:59,611
let me go...

238
00:17:59,675 --> 00:18:01,265
Xiao Lin

239
00:18:05,566 --> 00:18:08,584
Hey, I miss you so much, rubbish

240
00:18:14,564 --> 00:18:17,967
It's you who messed up my plan

241
00:18:18,168 --> 00:18:19,787
you bug

242
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:54,765
Xiao Lin

243
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,596
-Xiao Lin-Stop

244
00:18:58,608 --> 00:19:01,487
Hey, call an ambulance quickly...

245
00:19:12,572 --> 00:19:16,653
Doctor, please put this doll next to Meisheng

246
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:18,719
Sorry to trouble you

247
00:19:24,422 --> 00:19:26,561
The operation is about to begin

248
00:19:26,561 --> 00:19:28,023
Where are her family members?

249
00:19:28,023 --> 00:19:29,954
Already arrived

250
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:48,610
Is there any news from Xinzhuang?

251
00:19:49,674 --> 00:19:52,098
He called me this morning

252
00:19:52,126 --> 00:19:53,841
Said he was coming to the hospital

253
00:19:54,054 --> 00:19:55,727
What happened later?

254
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:09,774
What kind of person is Xinzhuang?

255
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,733
What

256
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:14,426
Him as a child

257
00:20:15,107 --> 00:20:17,767
Have you ever stayed in the same kindergarten?

258
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:23,672
He's a crybaby

259
00:20:25,743 --> 00:20:27,983
always alone

260
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,063
I have no friends and am not good at studying.

261
00:20:32,943 --> 00:20:36,018
It can be said that there is no merit

262
00:20:37,608 --> 00:20:40,855
And will you always help him?

263
00:20:47,342 --> 00:20:49,774
You have always been very good friends, right?

264
00:20:50,447 --> 00:20:52,576
Even got married

265
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,709
Not always

266
00:20:58,354 --> 00:21:02,097
Since I was adopted by the Nanase family

267
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,752
Been disconnected from him for a while

268
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,823
How did we meet again later?

269
00:21:11,969 --> 00:21:14,738
Met by chance

270
00:21:15,739 --> 00:21:19,551
After I was kicked out of Nanase's house

271
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:22,388
Wandering between relatives' homes

272
00:21:24,128 --> 00:21:26,318
After leaving society

273
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:28,967
There was a time when I couldn’t make any money.

274
00:21:30,697 --> 00:21:33,314
-Stay with me. -I have to go back to the store.

275
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:36,808
-I asked you to accompany me. -Please stop.

276
00:21:36,824 --> 00:21:38,834
Hey, can you give me a kiss?

277
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:41,210
Sir, if you don't want to, don't force it.

278
00:21:41,221 --> 00:21:43,273
What you do is none of your business

279
00:21:43,273 --> 00:21:44,613
OK

280
00:21:44,613 --> 00:21:46,290
Stop, she doesn't want to go

281
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,976
what are you

282
00:21:49,915 --> 00:21:51,157
hateful

283
00:21:51,751 --> 00:21:53,468
Hey, where are you going?

284
00:21:53,718 --> 00:21:56,055
Wait a minute...

285
00:21:57,981 --> 00:22:00,189
please stop sir

286
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,918
gentlemen…

287
00:22:13,731 --> 00:22:15,325
are you okay

288
00:22:20,617 --> 00:22:23,183
Ambulance, call an ambulance for me

289
00:22:23,246 --> 00:22:25,162
are you ok is anyone there

290
00:22:25,164 --> 00:22:26,831
Can someone call an ambulance for me?

291
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:30,400
I kept telling the police it was self-defense.

292
00:22:30,408 --> 00:22:31,858
They don't listen

293
00:22:34,846 --> 00:22:36,499
Result Shinjo…

294
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,659
So jailed

295
00:22:43,352 --> 00:22:45,823
He remains the same as before

296
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:49,053
Very kind

297
00:22:49,821 --> 00:22:52,084
Regardless of yourself

298
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:55,358
You can't just sit back and do nothing when you encounter people who are in trouble

299
00:22:57,989 --> 00:23:00,179
He is so stupid

300
00:23:04,219 --> 00:23:06,219
Are you a family member?

301
00:23:06,293 --> 00:23:07,404
yes

302
00:23:07,425 --> 00:23:09,038
The operation ended successfully

303
00:23:09,607 --> 00:23:11,282
thank you doctor

304
00:23:11,282 --> 00:23:13,769
I want to talk about future arrangements

305
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:14,901
OK

306
00:23:24,087 --> 00:23:26,415
The Minister of Criminal Affairs is looking for you

307
00:23:32,172 --> 00:23:35,077
(Kawanaka Police Station)

308
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,238
senior

309
00:23:44,484 --> 00:23:46,903
Close the door and think about it for the time being

310
00:23:47,305 --> 00:23:49,273
He'll probably be suspended.

311
00:23:49,872 --> 00:23:51,362
sorry

312
00:23:51,425 --> 00:23:53,599
We should help more

313
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,425
It's my own responsibility

314
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:57,150
I'm causing trouble for you

315
00:23:57,176 --> 00:23:58,512
No such thing

316
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:01,852
I want to go home and have a good sleep after a long absence

317
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:03,081
Take it to Bukchon

318
00:24:07,695 --> 00:24:10,274
Senior is gone...

319
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,142
Where is Yasheng...

320
00:24:28,061 --> 00:24:30,568
The operation ended successfully

321
00:24:31,163 --> 00:24:33,362
Very good

322
00:24:33,362 --> 00:24:35,631
so good

323
00:24:35,865 --> 00:24:37,865
Very good

324
00:24:38,658 --> 00:24:42,046
Great she's okay

325
00:24:44,497 --> 00:24:46,805
What about the kid?

326
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:49,850
was taken away

327
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:52,751
People from Z Capitals

328
00:24:57,906 --> 00:25:02,628
They seem to be looking for the drug formula developed by Xiao Lin's father

329
00:25:02,952 --> 00:25:05,441
Xiaolin and I were caught by them

330
00:25:05,693 --> 00:25:07,567
captured

331
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:12,129
Z Capitals…

332
00:25:12,904 --> 00:25:15,622
Everything would have ended today

333
00:25:16,091 --> 00:25:18,960
Xiaolin returns to a safe place

334
00:25:21,212 --> 00:25:25,078
Seeing the successful completion of the budding surgery with my own eyes

335
00:25:25,348 --> 00:25:27,841
Once these two things are done

336
00:25:29,283 --> 00:25:31,685
It doesn't matter what happens to me after that.

337
00:25:33,145 --> 00:25:34,768
But now...

338
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,740
But now...

339
00:26:04,381 --> 00:26:06,381
(Kawanaka Police Station)

340
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,440
where is that

341
00:26:09,554 --> 00:26:12,573
Sunouchi-senpai went home obediently

342
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:16,961
He seems to have finally recognized his point.

343
00:26:16,986 --> 00:26:19,283
Yes, where...

344
00:26:19,542 --> 00:26:22,350
I got it ok

345
00:26:22,572 --> 00:26:23,868
goodbye

346
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,769
OK…

347
00:26:37,426 --> 00:26:39,426
Sure enough it's you

348
00:26:42,353 --> 00:26:45,968
our recent actions

349
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:48,116
All learned in one lesson

350
00:26:48,252 --> 00:26:50,088
So I was in the hospital just now...

351
00:26:50,103 --> 00:26:51,972
Employee entrance and exit

352
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,522
Xinzhuang said he would come from that way

353
00:26:54,596 --> 00:26:55,764
knew

354
00:26:58,221 --> 00:27:00,656
I deliberately spread false news

355
00:27:01,941 --> 00:27:03,336
result…

356
00:27:04,793 --> 00:27:07,283
Got it, go to the employee entrance

357
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:08,181
yes

358
00:27:13,602 --> 00:27:15,602
Why Bukchon

359
00:27:17,355 --> 00:27:20,993
Did the Minister of Criminal Affairs ask you to be an undercover agent?

360
00:27:21,244 --> 00:27:24,368
As long as you are willing to cooperate, will you be promoted to a class?

361
00:27:27,764 --> 00:27:30,739
I can't understand senior at all

362
00:27:32,727 --> 00:27:34,616
Finally went in to search for a lesson

363
00:27:34,727 --> 00:27:36,665
But he resisted his superiors and was demoted to another place.

364
00:27:36,665 --> 00:27:38,429
I'm being watched even here

365
00:27:39,145 --> 00:27:41,269
I think you are stupid

366
00:27:42,924 --> 00:27:46,323
Creating trouble in an organization will only lead to your own destruction.

367
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:49,134
Why can't I study well?

368
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:52,540
You're so stupid, Sunouchi-senpai

369
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,740
That's it

370
00:27:57,246 --> 00:27:59,246
Am I too stupid?

371
00:28:01,815 --> 00:28:03,590
What's so funny

372
00:28:03,627 --> 00:28:05,416
Do you understand your current situation?

373
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:08,658
You were suspended because I snitched to my superiors.

374
00:28:08,744 --> 00:28:10,235
No

375
00:28:11,643 --> 00:28:13,643
you didn't do anything wrong

376
00:28:14,989 --> 00:28:18,162
It is the duty of the police to report to their superiors

377
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,039
Instead, I was careless in doing things.

378
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,039
Even resist orders

379
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,530
your approach

380
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:28,795
Only in compliance with organizational norms

381
00:28:33,747 --> 00:28:35,932

382
00:28:37,339 --> 00:28:39,339

383
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:41,944

397
00:29:40,567 --> 00:29:41,771
Hey

398
00:29:47,188 --> 00:29:48,942
This pendant…

399
00:29:53,175 --> 00:29:55,450
Do you have any impression?

400

Since you don't answer

401
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:07,338

423
00:31:28,193 --> 00:31:30,126

Is this mine?

427
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:42,786
Maybe it’s important items that need to be put away

428

I'm really happy

488
00:36:35,705 --> 00:36:40,744
Did Miss Shiori often help Xinzhuang at that time?

489
00:36:40,792 --> 00:36:43,257
Not exactly the opposite

490
00:36:43,257 --> 00:36:45,612
When Shiori first came here

491
00:36:45,612 --> 00:36:47,711
Can't keep up with other kids at all

492
00:36:47,894 --> 00:36:50,816

But starting from a certain period, his grades gradually got worse.

502
00:37:45,192 --> 00:37:47,235
Do you mean Mr. Eisaku Nanase?

503
00:37:47,277 --> 00:37:49,334
Yes, do you know that too?

504
00:37:49,376 --> 00:37:52,081
