1
00:00:00,053 --> 00:00:01,953
(I am a kidnapper) My name is Masamune Shinjo

2
00:00:01,953 --> 00:00:04,071
Became a kidnapper for some reason

3
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:05,004
Who are you

4
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:08,826
(The genius girl who lost her memory) The Nanase Rin I kidnapped was a genius girl who lost her memory.

5
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:09,511
But...

6
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:11,750
The police are investigating the murder...

7
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,463
(The girl’s parents were brutally murdered) Xiao Lin’s parents were actually murdered.

8
00:00:15,131 --> 00:00:17,591
(Masamune and Xiao Rin were taken away) Xiao Rin and I were taken away by a mysterious organization

9
00:00:17,657 --> 00:00:20,290
So I learned the secret of Xiaolin becoming a genius

10
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,411
(Artificial genius) She is the first...finished product of this project

11
00:00:24,672 --> 00:00:26,936
Although Xiaolin and I tried to escape

12
00:00:26,936 --> 00:00:30,025
(Successfully escaped but fell into trouble again) But fell into a corner with no way out.

13
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,397
found you

14
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,330
The suspect was caught

15
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,217
(The Day of Kidnapping) (Episode 5)

16
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:46,515
(The murderer of his parents was finally arrested)

17
00:00:46,544 --> 00:00:48,726
Meeting Xiaolin for the first time

18
00:00:49,822 --> 00:00:51,579
I'm here to pick you up

19
00:00:53,205 --> 00:00:54,336
Huh?

20
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,657
Are you disliked?

21
00:01:10,218 --> 00:01:12,759
(If the plan fails, run away)

22
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,113
(delete)

23
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:38,222
Xiao Lin

24
00:01:38,924 --> 00:01:41,604
Are you okay? Are you injured?

25
00:01:43,523 --> 00:01:45,636
Don't do this again

26
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:49,202
You are our light of hope

27
00:01:49,202 --> 00:01:51,706
Don't blame it on me

28
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:54,819
Who cares about the light of hope?

29
00:01:56,161 --> 00:01:59,580
Don't be angry, Doctor, nothing happened anyway.

30
00:01:59,603 --> 00:02:01,716
Xiaolin is still intact

31
00:02:02,744 --> 00:02:06,281
Where is Masamune? Is he okay?

32
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:12,871
Bring him here I need him

33
00:02:12,896 --> 00:02:14,470
Xiao Lin

34
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:18,999
Instead of worrying about that stupid kidnapper, you have more important things to do...

35
00:02:19,007 --> 00:02:21,252
Nothing is more important than him

36
00:02:21,277 --> 00:02:23,653
What if you kill him?

37
00:02:23,653 --> 00:02:25,540
I will also die to show you

38
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,694
Where is Masamune?

39
00:02:33,165 --> 00:02:34,721
please help

40
00:02:35,273 --> 00:02:37,916
Xiao Lin is in danger and must be rescued immediately

41
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:40,194
-Aren't you with her? -Yes...

42
00:02:40,305 --> 00:02:43,952
But it's more like...picking her up or something like that

43
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:45,866
Were you the one who killed the dean and his wife?

44
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:48,811
No, I didn't do it

45
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:51,693
I ran away in panic and was chased by a weirdo

46
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:54,210
Xiaolin and I were both kidnapped by him

47
00:02:54,235 --> 00:02:55,921
-It's... -Kidnapping?

48
00:02:55,934 --> 00:02:57,671
Are you the kidnapper?

49
00:02:57,671 --> 00:02:59,671
yes and no

50
00:02:59,671 --> 00:03:03,430
All in all, Xiaolin is now in the other party's villa

51
00:03:03,468 --> 00:03:04,864
-villa? -right

52
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,843
Where

53
00:03:05,843 --> 00:03:07,463
I don't know the exact location

54
00:03:07,463 --> 00:03:09,936
- But the owner's name is... - What's his name?

55
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,481
I remember it was water... water...

56
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:36,341
Are you here to kill me?

57
00:03:36,455 --> 00:03:39,627
What about Xiao Lin? Is she okay?

58
00:03:58,344 --> 00:04:00,256
Who are you

59
00:04:21,633 --> 00:04:23,282
stop

60
00:04:23,545 --> 00:04:25,658
Don't kill him

61
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,668
Let's go to Xiaolin's place

62
00:05:05,118 --> 00:05:06,467
Masamune

63
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,395
Xiao Lin, are you okay?

64
00:05:09,696 --> 00:05:12,616
I am so scarred that I still ask others

65
00:05:12,616 --> 00:05:15,568
It's so good. I thought I couldn't see you again.

66
00:05:16,546 --> 00:05:20,335
Didn't you run away?

67
00:05:21,928 --> 00:05:24,972
Got caught. You got caught.

68
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:27,252
You're useless, right?

69
00:05:29,885 --> 00:05:32,059
But luckily we're all fine

70
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:35,298
fine?

71
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,665
It caused injuries all over the body

72
00:05:37,665 --> 00:05:40,301
How can you protect me if you are so weak?

73
00:05:40,457 --> 00:05:42,147
Don't worry

74
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,093
Until you find a place where you feel safe

75
00:05:45,109 --> 00:05:46,459
I will never die

76
00:05:49,221 --> 00:05:51,597
Just talk big words

77
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,350
But you are really angry

78
00:05:57,661 --> 00:06:00,172
Find a way to solve the problem yourself

79
00:06:00,187 --> 00:06:02,187
survived

80
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:07,070
He was hunted down and brought back again

81
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,423
It's really baffling

82
00:06:09,423 --> 00:06:10,951
Do you want to meet him?

83
00:06:10,989 --> 00:06:14,881
The mastermind behind the trick on us

84
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,395
The mastermind?

85
00:06:16,527 --> 00:06:19,604
You will definitely be very angry. You must hold it back.

86
00:06:19,722 --> 00:06:22,791
Never hit anyone

87
00:06:23,012 --> 00:06:24,306
ok i got it

88
00:06:24,336 --> 00:06:25,702
Absolutely

89
00:06:29,544 --> 00:06:31,796
Mr. Shinjo

90
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:37,212
Waiting for a long time

91
00:06:37,242 --> 00:06:39,227
You are really lucky

92
00:06:39,227 --> 00:06:41,227
Do you want to have a cup of coffee together?

93
00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:43,702
Hey, who is he?

94
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:46,852
Z Capitals Japan Branch Fukuzumi Kevin

95
00:06:46,852 --> 00:06:51,084
Coordinator of the next generation intelligence development project

96
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:55,010
He's the one who tried to kill you several times.

97
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,331
Follow the person who gave the order

98
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:04,200
Just treat those things as a "misunderstanding"

99
00:07:05,304 --> 00:07:07,165
Please forget it

100
00:07:07,336 --> 00:07:08,521
please

101
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:10,980
OK

102
00:07:34,232 --> 00:07:36,103
So stinky

103
00:07:37,388 --> 00:07:38,787
Wait

104
00:07:39,408 --> 00:07:40,893
I'm so sorry

105
00:07:40,925 --> 00:07:43,288
Misunderstanding, misunderstanding, please forget it

106
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,728
What a savage

107
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,828
never mind

108
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:52,370
Just think that we are reconciled

109
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,250
I have fulfilled your request

110
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,609
Now it's our turn to take care of business

111
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:09,517
Well done Masamune

112
00:08:12,086 --> 00:08:13,798
you did very well

113
00:08:14,966 --> 00:08:16,455
Xiao Lin

114
00:08:30,262 --> 00:08:33,270
Mr. Sunouchi, you really know how to get into trouble.

115
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:36,029
This can no longer be considered a mistake

116
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,674
But the shame of the police

117
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:42,824
And this is the second time you let Xinzhuang slip away

118
00:08:43,195 --> 00:08:45,716
Shouldn't you...

119
00:08:46,513 --> 00:08:48,829
He's an accomplice, right?

120
00:08:49,076 --> 00:08:50,411
How is it possible...

121
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,525
What kind of police officer are you?

122
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:58,147
Is this the justice in your heart?

123
00:09:02,695 --> 00:09:04,764
Why is he there too

124
00:09:04,764 --> 00:09:07,524
If you kick him out, I will leave too

125
00:09:07,524 --> 00:09:09,030
are you sure

126
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:11,374
are you sure

127
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:20,679
That's it

128
00:09:23,537 --> 00:09:26,413
Make a genius potion

129
00:09:26,427 --> 00:09:29,021
That was developed by Dean Nanase Mamoru

130
00:09:29,021 --> 00:09:32,692
Agents that control brain hormone secretion

131
00:09:33,242 --> 00:09:35,242
Nervous System X Injection

132
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,547
Isn't that...

133
00:09:37,547 --> 00:09:42,247
Dad gave me the medicine several times

134
00:09:42,292 --> 00:09:44,140
Is there anything besides these?

135
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,798
The only sample left by the dean was that one

136
00:09:46,798 --> 00:09:49,646
There is only one jar and this potion

137
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:52,088
The scientific structure is quite complex

138
00:09:52,088 --> 00:09:56,105
The correct components cannot be decomposed by ordinary analysis methods.

139
00:09:57,534 --> 00:09:59,534
How to make this potion?

140
00:09:59,534 --> 00:10:04,214
Must obtain the original composition list prepared by the dean

141
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:07,516
Is it the same as the "ingredient list" of the medicine?

142
00:10:07,846 --> 00:10:09,335
where is the thing

143
00:10:09,362 --> 00:10:13,875
The Nanase family’s computers and documents are in the hands of the police

144
00:10:15,203 --> 00:10:19,192
But there is no information about this study

145
00:10:19,346 --> 00:10:21,705
I have no idea where the ingredient list is.

146
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:23,233
Doctor, listen to me

147
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:27,581
This plan involves huge interests around the world

148
00:10:27,636 --> 00:10:30,368
It's not something that can be solved by just saying "I can't do it" now.

149
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:33,675
I know it's the same for me

150
00:10:34,142 --> 00:10:36,888
Although I don’t quite understand it, it seems serious

151
00:10:36,888 --> 00:10:40,781
As long as money is involved, humans will fight to the death.

152
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,698
What about you?

153
00:10:49,151 --> 00:10:51,552
Any clues about the ingredient list?

154
00:10:51,552 --> 00:10:52,784
I?

155
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,879
Didn't you promise to help?

156
00:10:56,102 --> 00:10:57,951
This is it

157
00:10:57,992 --> 00:11:00,312
my father is a secretist

158
00:11:00,312 --> 00:11:05,171
The really important information must still be hidden somewhere at home.

159
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:08,957
Such as underground laboratories

160
00:11:09,177 --> 00:11:13,774
Or a place where others can’t find it

161
00:11:13,898 --> 00:11:16,510
Are the clues hidden in your house?

162
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,261
We can't get into that room

163
00:11:18,288 --> 00:11:21,852
There are police manpower there to strictly prohibit outsiders from entering or exiting.

164
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:24,608
Leave it to me

165
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:35,166
(Rongjin Memorial Hospital)

166
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,166
Really high-end clubs

167
00:11:37,838 --> 00:11:39,465
What's going on today?

168
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:42,196
Actually I'm looking for something

169
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:45,659
Need assistance from the Vice Chairman

170
00:11:45,824 --> 00:11:47,410
Looking for something?

171
00:11:47,534 --> 00:11:49,920
before talking further

172
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,456
Please avoid it first

173
00:11:52,964 --> 00:11:54,539
What

174
00:12:03,964 --> 00:12:05,674
Say it

175
00:12:06,361 --> 00:12:09,953
How much do you want to donate to us this time?

176
00:12:09,983 --> 00:12:13,116
That's just some fractions.

177
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:16,139
what you really want

178
00:12:17,453 --> 00:12:20,383
Is it the property left by Dean Nanase?

179
00:12:22,505 --> 00:12:24,779
What a discourtesy

180
00:12:26,396 --> 00:12:28,946
Let's open the skylight and talk openly.

181
00:12:31,228 --> 00:12:32,859
develop according to the current situation

182
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,640
Nanase family’s real estate bond deposit

183
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,394
Hospital operating rights

184
00:12:37,683 --> 00:12:40,435
All will be inherited by Xiao Lin

185
00:12:40,788 --> 00:12:42,449
This is really unreasonable

186
00:12:42,673 --> 00:12:46,021
He was actually occupied by a mere eight-year-old girl

187
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:48,937
But what if...

188
00:12:49,096 --> 00:12:51,788
There is no such child

189
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,991
The situation is very different

190
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,255
That's right

191
00:12:59,948 --> 00:13:01,126
So awesome

192
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:04,655
Finished painting

193
00:13:09,384 --> 00:13:11,074
Make your chin thinner

194
00:13:11,096 --> 00:13:12,126
OK

195
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:15,339
Is he an accomplice of Xinzhuang?

196
00:13:15,743 --> 00:13:17,418
Not sure yet

197
00:13:17,888 --> 00:13:19,686
It’s just that Xinzhuang said

198
00:13:20,372 --> 00:13:22,285
He was kidnapped by this man

199
00:13:22,307 --> 00:13:24,307
Kidnapped?

200
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,483
What's the meaning

201
00:13:25,498 --> 00:13:29,089
Kidnappers kidnap kidnappers?

202
00:13:29,095 --> 00:13:33,118
Kidnapping, kidnapping...kidnapping?

203
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:36,579
No, kidnappers kidnap kidnappers...

204
00:13:36,593 --> 00:13:39,312
Senior, it’s terrible, look at this

205
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:43,470
Regarding the kidnapping case of Rin Nanase that occurred on the 8th of this month

206
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:48,781
Police arrest a man who helped wanted criminal Masamune Shinjo escape

207
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:53,868
The 62-year-old suspect named Soma Takuya

208
00:13:53,868 --> 00:13:56,095
According to the confession of the suspect Soma

209
00:13:56,138 --> 00:13:58,166
He was entrusted by the suspect Xinzhuang

210
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:01,229
Let him and Rin Nanase board a fishing boat

211
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,806
But then there was a huge wave

212
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,587
Both men fell into the sea from the boat and disappeared.

213
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:10,053
They found this in this man's possessions

214
00:14:10,426 --> 00:14:13,443
Aren’t these the clothes Xinzhuang and Xiaolin wear?

215
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:15,190
where to go

216
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:18,292
Shinjo?

217
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:25,159
Although the Kanagawa Prefectural Office and Coast Guard continue to search and rescue

218
00:14:25,183 --> 00:14:26,808
- but no news yet - what

219
00:14:26,808 --> 00:14:29,157
Are we apparently dead?

220
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,705
That captain is...

221
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:36,391
(Takuya Soma who assisted the suspect Shinjo in escaping) I found a man who was in debt

222
00:14:36,391 --> 00:14:39,774
Then the police will relax a little bit.

223
00:14:42,693 --> 00:14:45,277
When I think of Xiao Lin

224
00:14:45,373 --> 00:14:48,708
I feel heartbroken

225
00:14:48,816 --> 00:14:51,526
Is he your relative?

226
00:14:51,742 --> 00:14:53,742
So pitiful

227
00:14:54,391 --> 00:14:57,101
I really want to tell him that you are actually still alive

228
00:14:57,173 --> 00:15:02,265
I hope the police can continue to look for her

229
00:15:04,006 --> 00:15:06,559
Xiao Lin is a good boy...

230
00:15:06,595 --> 00:15:08,365
Thanks for your hard work

231
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,810
You should have to deal with the media for a while longer

232
00:15:10,858 --> 00:15:13,163
Waiting for the storm to calm down

233
00:15:13,172 --> 00:15:17,515
You take that Fukuzumi to Nanase's house

234
00:15:18,332 --> 00:15:21,066
He seems to be interested in that house

235
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:23,342
Be well received

236
00:15:23,967 --> 00:15:26,894
Why do you do so many things for him?

237
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:33,474
Is the eldest lady of the Vice Director really dead?

238
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:36,225
Prepare for a funeral

239
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,768
Xiao Lin is no longer here

240
00:15:40,225 --> 00:15:43,856
We must swallow our sorrow and look to the future

241
00:15:44,013 --> 00:15:48,368
I will be the one to inherit the Nanase family from now on...

242
00:15:51,674 --> 00:15:53,345
and you

243
00:15:55,895 --> 00:15:57,705
am i right

244
00:16:00,003 --> 00:16:01,595
Sunouchi-senpai

245
00:16:01,595 --> 00:16:03,959
Do you still have concerns?

246
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,580
Shinjo said he did not kill Nanase and his wife

247
00:16:10,264 --> 00:16:14,147
Of course I won't listen to his one-sided remarks

248
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:18,313
Stop and don't kill him

249
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:22,996
Who is this person?

250
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,199
Sunouchi-senpai about that matter

251
00:16:27,214 --> 00:16:31,158
I found the nurse who worked at Rongjin Memorial Hospital thirty years ago

252
00:16:36,784 --> 00:16:39,000
-Please use it slowly-Thank you

253
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,141
About that incident thirty years ago

254
00:16:41,141 --> 00:16:43,931
Can you please tell us the details?

255
00:16:44,986 --> 00:16:47,682
Mr. Matsuda's wife

256
00:16:48,611 --> 00:16:51,364
Because the placenta blocks the birth canal

257
00:16:51,364 --> 00:16:54,512
The laparotomy procedure is quite difficult

258
00:16:55,008 --> 00:16:57,620
Originally this operation

259
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,411
It is scheduled to be performed by former dean Nanase Eisaku.

260
00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:03,411
Reserve?

261
00:17:04,036 --> 00:17:08,383
Actually...it's because Dean Eisaku is too tired

262
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:13,388
He asked another young doctor with less qualifications to perform the surgery for him

263
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,662
Then Matsuda’s wife and unborn baby

264
00:17:16,673 --> 00:17:19,026
Did the young doctor die because of his mistake?

265
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:21,828
Mr. Matsuda was quite resentful about this.

266
00:17:39,207 --> 00:17:42,423
But it was not the dean who was injured at that time.

267
00:17:42,435 --> 00:17:45,415
Which nurse, please go get a lot of gauze

268
00:17:45,505 --> 00:17:47,717
Is he the dean's child?

269
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,553
Fortunately, I was able to save my life through first aid.

270
00:17:52,225 --> 00:17:57,005
Later I heard that Mr. Matsuda had reached a settlement with the dean.

271
00:17:57,595 --> 00:18:00,271
The injured child

272
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:05,119
It's Nanase Mamoru, Nanase Eisaku's son, right?

273
00:18:05,398 --> 00:18:07,100
should be

274
00:18:07,725 --> 00:18:11,704
So Matsuda went to work as a guard at that hospital

275
00:18:11,704 --> 00:18:15,932
It is to atone for Nanase Mamoru who was accidentally injured thirty years ago.

276
00:18:15,968 --> 00:18:17,650
is that so

277
00:18:24,387 --> 00:18:27,031
I will go to Nanase's house tomorrow night

278
00:18:27,326 --> 00:18:31,875
If you find the ingredient list, everything will be solved

279
00:18:32,268 --> 00:18:34,939
Until then, have a good rest.

280
00:18:36,117 --> 00:18:40,469
Don't try to escape this time, Xiaolin

281
00:18:40,469 --> 00:18:44,282
How can I escape when there are so many people watching me?

282
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:45,938
Just know

283
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:48,184
It should be okay to go for a walk

284
00:18:48,184 --> 00:18:51,422
Please don't go out while you're here

285
00:18:52,134 --> 00:18:55,677
Really? I get it, okay?

286
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:59,041
Let's just stay at home

287
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,635
Masamune is gone

288
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,954
So obedient

289
00:19:02,954 --> 00:19:05,678
Finally sensible

290
00:19:05,924 --> 00:19:08,740
Xiaolin...

291
00:19:17,748 --> 00:19:21,194
What's next for Xiao Lin...

292
00:19:21,284 --> 00:19:23,084
what next

293
00:19:23,151 --> 00:19:26,068
You must have a plan

294
00:19:26,068 --> 00:19:29,499
You can't possibly be obedient

295
00:19:29,513 --> 00:19:31,972
As expected of you

296
00:19:31,985 --> 00:19:34,523
We have to strike early

297
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,540
If he finds the ingredient list, my existence will be useless.

298
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,921
means...

299
00:19:40,274 --> 00:19:42,944
Will definitely be killed this time

300
00:19:42,944 --> 00:19:44,755
Both of us are

301
00:19:46,692 --> 00:19:50,235
What should we do? We can't move anymore.

302
00:19:50,261 --> 00:19:54,053
It would be great if we could find a way to go out and seek help.

303
00:19:54,689 --> 00:19:58,091
have a chance

304
00:20:03,094 --> 00:20:08,235
I used to live here alone with my father

305
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:13,590
At that time, there was a typhoon and the whole area had a power outage.

306
00:20:14,101 --> 00:20:17,271
My father never carries a mobile phone

307
00:20:17,314 --> 00:20:20,136
Completely unable to contact external parties

308
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,715
That's too miserable

309
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:25,012
Were you okay at the time?

310
00:20:26,398 --> 00:20:30,732
The doctor's consortium rescue team came immediately after the power outage.

311
00:20:30,732 --> 00:20:33,771
Help us deliver necessary supplies

312
00:20:34,346 --> 00:20:36,346
Right

313
00:20:36,772 --> 00:20:38,518
Wait a moment

314
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:42,093
Obviously unable to contact the outside world

315
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,246
How is he going to notify the ambulance team?

316
00:20:44,246 --> 00:20:46,246
The key is here

317
00:20:46,608 --> 00:20:48,758
I guess

318
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:53,562
Dad should be using a wired phone that can still be used during a power outage.

319
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:59,382
If it's a wired phone, it can be used even if the power goes out.

320
00:20:59,957 --> 00:21:02,171
You really know everything

321
00:21:02,871 --> 00:21:03,889
Put it this way...

322
00:21:03,942 --> 00:21:05,706
That wired phone

323
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,515
Probably somewhere in this house

324
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:14,131
-Hello, Ruixi. -Hello.

325
00:21:23,514 --> 00:21:25,190
Mr. Matsuda

326
00:21:25,714 --> 00:21:27,194
About thirty years ago...

327
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,583
Senior, please stay here

328
00:21:29,699 --> 00:21:32,306
Please take a step to speak

329
00:21:32,603 --> 00:21:34,835
It's all in the past

330
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,711
What does it have to do with this case?

331
00:21:37,741 --> 00:21:43,395
Mr. Nanase Mamoru, the victim at the time, became the deceased this time.

332
00:21:46,754 --> 00:21:50,050
I'm really sorry for what happened at that time

333
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:52,704
Because of losing my wife and children

334
00:21:52,723 --> 00:21:54,990
I lost my mind for a moment

335
00:21:56,084 --> 00:21:59,582
Are you done asking? Sorry, I still have to go to work.

336
00:21:59,924 --> 00:22:01,924
You choose to reconcile with him

337
00:22:03,403 --> 00:22:06,922
It seems to be to make up for accidentally injuring the former dean’s child.

338
00:22:07,002 --> 00:22:10,791
But your wife and children were killed by him

339
00:22:11,405 --> 00:22:13,020
Are you really willing?

340
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:18,549
And you have been working next to Nanase Mamoru as an adult.

341
00:22:18,652 --> 00:22:20,846
Is there any problem with this?

342
00:22:23,565 --> 00:22:26,143
There is no point in resenting the past

343
00:22:26,508 --> 00:22:29,459
Hatred only breeds more hatred

344
00:22:30,573 --> 00:22:33,953
I've had enough of this

345
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:42,094
Yes...I know

346
00:22:48,699 --> 00:22:51,327
Masamune...

347
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,242
Didn't see it

348
00:23:02,488 --> 00:23:05,523
No, I can't find it anywhere

349
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:08,131
If there is no such thing in this room

350
00:23:08,203 --> 00:23:10,203
Maybe it didn't exist in the first place

351
00:23:10,275 --> 00:23:14,443
Why are you so depressed?

352
00:23:14,795 --> 00:23:16,729
It’s no wonder you’re a genius

353
00:23:16,817 --> 00:23:21,303
So what if I'm a genius? There are a lot of things I don't know.

354
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:24,469
I don’t know where the phone is installed

355
00:23:25,328 --> 00:23:28,841
I wonder where my father hid the ingredient list

356
00:23:28,885 --> 00:23:31,501
I don’t know who killed my parents

357
00:23:31,523 --> 00:23:34,558
I don’t know why things turned out like this.

358
00:23:36,122 --> 00:23:38,136
what kind of person is he

359
00:23:38,178 --> 00:23:42,833
Your father, Dean Nanase Mamoru

360
00:23:43,362 --> 00:23:45,362
I don't even know this

361
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,450
think carefully

362
00:23:47,538 --> 00:23:51,341
What I’ve been telling you these past few days

363
00:23:51,378 --> 00:23:53,867
Far more than what I said to my parents

364
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:56,783
For example, where are you going today?

365
00:23:56,816 --> 00:23:58,816
what to eat

366
00:23:58,816 --> 00:24:01,542
Although they are all boring little things

367
00:24:01,894 --> 00:24:05,407
I never had any doubt

368
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:10,993
I think such unproductive behavior as chatting is meaningless.

369
00:24:11,698 --> 00:24:16,397
Maybe I don’t know what’s really important

370
00:24:16,437 --> 00:24:19,292
more ignorant than you

371
00:24:23,942 --> 00:24:25,625
I see

372
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:28,809
In that case, let's dig through this place to find the phone number

373
00:24:28,954 --> 00:24:31,430
If you tell me you have it, you must have it.

374
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:33,360
i believe you

375
00:24:34,074 --> 00:24:36,705
By the way, where's the boiler room?

376
00:24:36,744 --> 00:24:39,969
I remember this villa had an underground boiler room

377
00:24:39,969 --> 00:24:42,100
To maintain temperature during research

378
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:44,060
Maybe it's there

379
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,024
Go quickly

380
00:24:56,768 --> 00:24:58,768
Hey, what are you going to do?

381
00:24:58,794 --> 00:25:00,528
I'm hungry

382
00:25:00,528 --> 00:25:02,608
is there anything to eat

383
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,149
follow me

384
00:25:31,384 --> 00:25:33,184
What are you doing

385
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,414
liquor...

386
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,184
Because there is nothing to do

387
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:43,730
I'm going to have a drink

388
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:47,007
Looking for an underground wine cellar

389
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:49,393
Thought it was near here

390
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:52,579
It turns out...it turns out I made a mistake

391
00:25:52,672 --> 00:25:55,836
I made a mistake, I want to go back

392
00:25:59,522 --> 00:26:02,508
By the way, I can tell you just right

393
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:04,627
Although

394
00:26:05,512 --> 00:26:07,975
I have a lot to complain about

395
00:26:08,345 --> 00:26:10,345
But there is one thing to thank you for

396
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:13,362
You asked me to see Yasheng

397
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:17,040
thank you very much

398
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:19,291
That's Dr. Mizuhara's order

399
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:22,237
Of course I'm grateful to Dr.

400
00:26:23,307 --> 00:26:24,990
thank you too

401
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,674
Why do you want to see your daughter?

402
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:39,191
You could have escaped with Nanase Rin, right?

403
00:26:39,257 --> 00:26:41,257
Why do you want to see your daughter?

404
00:26:43,846 --> 00:26:46,402
Thinking about what might happen if the plan fails

405
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:50,661
I was caught

406
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:54,127
or dead

407
00:26:58,301 --> 00:27:00,021
In that case

408
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:05,274
Not going to see Meisheng will definitely make me regret it for the rest of my life.

409
00:27:05,823 --> 00:27:07,317
That's why...

410
00:27:08,453 --> 00:27:10,453
one more thing

411
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,085
Although Xiao Lin is a genius

412
00:27:13,086 --> 00:27:15,404
But he's an ordinary kid at heart

413
00:27:15,535 --> 00:27:19,572
When I want to cry, when I want to act coquettishly

414
00:27:19,823 --> 00:27:22,127
She always endures alone

415
00:27:22,497 --> 00:27:25,026
is a very fragile child

416
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,925
As adults we must protect children

417
00:27:34,765 --> 00:27:37,417
Wait until everything is over

418
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:39,424
Let's have another drink then...

419
00:27:39,435 --> 00:27:40,591
Go away

420
00:27:42,856 --> 00:27:43,954
Too

421
00:27:44,488 --> 00:27:45,901
I'm leaving now

422
00:27:52,072 --> 00:27:53,647
Get out of here

423
00:28:05,908 --> 00:28:07,872
what to do...

424
00:28:07,872 --> 00:28:10,008
What should Xiaolin do?

425
00:28:10,035 --> 00:28:11,619
Have you found the phone number?

426
00:28:11,638 --> 00:28:13,114
Yes, yes, yes

427
00:28:13,114 --> 00:28:15,267
But there are ferocious man-eating sharks nearby

428
00:28:15,285 --> 00:28:17,285
You'll die if you get close

429
00:28:18,025 --> 00:28:19,837
Didn’t you say you wouldn’t die?

430
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:21,541
If you will die, you will definitely die

431
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:23,775
One hundred percent sure that he will die

432
00:28:23,793 --> 00:28:25,911
No, only that guy can't

433
00:28:25,911 --> 00:28:29,157
what to do...what to do

434
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,829
Please be quiet

435
00:28:32,137 --> 00:28:34,751
Hi Matsuda

436
00:28:35,076 --> 00:28:36,769
Dr. Tagawa

437
00:28:38,439 --> 00:28:41,313
Are you free? I have something to tell you.

438
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:44,558
That thing I mentioned last time?

439
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,779
Dean Nanase’s Secret

440
00:28:46,797 --> 00:28:49,095
That's not important anymore

441
00:28:49,176 --> 00:28:53,309
Rather than this, what I want to say is your business

442
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:59,941
It seems that the police are investigating you recently, right?

443
00:28:59,974 --> 00:29:04,323
Then I suddenly remembered something

444
00:29:05,622 --> 00:29:07,622
you...

445
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,370
On July 8, the day when the dean was killed,

446
00:29:11,395 --> 00:29:12,910
Dr. Tagawa

447
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:15,424
What a coincidence

448
00:29:15,725 --> 00:29:19,167
Yasheng’s mother came to learn about the surgery

449
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,899
I am Xinzhuang Yasheng. I am under the care of a doctor.

450
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:24,587
Hello, I am Tagawa

451
00:29:25,223 --> 00:29:27,106
This is Matsuda from the security company

452
00:29:27,106 --> 00:29:30,391
He often plays with Meisheng

453
00:29:30,692 --> 00:29:34,973
That's it. I usually take good care of you.

454
00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:37,186
where

455
00:29:37,219 --> 00:29:39,895
Then the doctor will see you later

456
00:29:43,792 --> 00:29:45,306
etc.

457
00:29:46,611 --> 00:29:49,423
-That person just now... -Dr. Tagawa

458
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:52,294
About what you haven’t finished talking about just now

459
00:29:52,294 --> 00:29:57,668
Do you want to go drink tonight and talk slowly?

460
00:29:57,797 --> 00:29:59,847
good idea

461
00:29:59,847 --> 00:30:02,256
See you later then

462
00:30:08,648 --> 00:30:10,028
This way please

463
00:30:11,483 --> 00:30:15,009
The chief surgeon will explain the details of the surgery later.

464
00:30:15,009 --> 00:30:16,660
OK

465
00:30:35,062 --> 00:30:37,378
Although I found something that could barely be used as a weapon

466
00:30:37,378 --> 00:30:38,921
But no matter how I look at it, I have no chance of winning.

467
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:41,415
It seems that we can't attack head-on.

468
00:30:41,428 --> 00:30:43,204
It's not possible to conduct a sneak attack either.

469
00:30:43,473 --> 00:30:46,144
Even the police were beaten into pig heads by him

470
00:30:47,927 --> 00:30:49,791
This one looks more interesting

471
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:51,601
But it's definitely useless to him

472
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:54,116
Tools depend on how people use them

473
00:30:54,351 --> 00:30:57,694
My mother was killed with a letter opener

474
00:30:58,008 --> 00:31:00,008
That's right

475
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:07,021
But it's weird

476
00:31:09,332 --> 00:31:12,930
Mom died with a letter opener, dad died with a samurai sword.

477
00:31:13,053 --> 00:31:14,715
They all want to kill people

478
00:31:14,715 --> 00:31:17,032
But a completely different murder weapon was used

479
00:31:17,032 --> 00:31:18,316
Yeah

480
00:31:19,034 --> 00:31:21,518
It feels like two things

481
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:26,554
If it's the same murderer, why do we need to change weapons?

482
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:29,361
Maybe I think too much

483
00:31:29,428 --> 00:31:31,000
No

484
00:31:31,572 --> 00:31:33,246
you have a point

485
00:31:33,576 --> 00:31:38,606
If they were two different murders...

486
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:44,833
Xiao Lin?

487
00:31:45,496 --> 00:31:47,002
What's wrong

488
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,301
are you okay

489
00:31:53,302 --> 00:31:54,821
Hello

490
00:31:56,232 --> 00:32:00,653
Hello Xiaolin

491
00:32:21,632 --> 00:32:23,905
That's not a patrol car

492
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,932
It's a security company

493
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:34,586
What was parked outside the house that day was the security company's car.

494
00:32:35,337 --> 00:32:39,846
Hey, so the murderer is not a policeman...

495
00:32:44,327 --> 00:32:45,850
are you okay

496
00:32:46,615 --> 00:32:47,899
Xiao Lin

497
00:32:57,538 --> 00:32:59,077
Xiao Lin, are you okay?

498
00:33:00,794 --> 00:33:02,146
What's wrong

499
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,569
Are you Mr. Matsuda who has a reservation?

500
00:33:09,569 --> 00:33:12,097
- Yes - I'll show you a seat, please.

501
00:33:22,127 --> 00:33:23,451
Please come in

502
00:33:25,678 --> 00:33:28,675
Matsuda, let me start eating first.

503
00:33:28,692 --> 00:33:30,845
Sit down quickly...

504
00:33:33,242 --> 00:33:36,111
Go get another glass of wine

505
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,892
Matsuda has resigned

506
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,239
-Resign? -yes

507
00:33:40,239 --> 00:33:43,143
A few days ago he suddenly said that he would resign

508
00:33:43,177 --> 00:33:45,177
Just do it today

509
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:52,562
Mr. Matsuda seems to have an appointment with Dr. Tagawa for dinner tonight.

510
00:33:52,608 --> 00:33:54,982
Do you know where they go?

511
00:33:56,145 --> 00:33:58,027
Matsuda

512
00:33:58,086 --> 00:34:00,940
You seemed to have told the police that July 8

513
00:34:00,989 --> 00:34:04,526
Just go to work until 6pm

514
00:34:05,229 --> 00:34:08,960
Actually I saw it

515
00:34:09,774 --> 00:34:13,856
You...about four o'clock

516
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:16,097
Used to be sneaky...

517
00:34:17,281 --> 00:34:19,448
Leave the hospital

518
00:34:19,577 --> 00:34:21,373
Is there any

519
00:34:21,725 --> 00:34:27,020
Later, the dean and his wife became corpses.

520
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:31,252
Don't you think it's quite suspicious?

521
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:34,947
I'm very troubled and I'm also recording now

522
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,476
this matter

523
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:41,434
Should I tell the police?

524
00:34:41,568 --> 00:34:46,326
So you may need some sealing fees.

525
00:34:46,382 --> 00:34:49,516
What do you say? Matsuda

526
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:55,367
welcome back

527
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,336
Very sensible

528
00:35:17,055 --> 00:35:18,625
I'm a policeman

529
00:35:18,647 --> 00:35:21,266
You have a guest named Matsuda Masaaki, right?

530
00:35:21,302 --> 00:35:23,042
please wait

531
00:35:23,837 --> 00:35:25,837
what are you doing

532
00:35:25,892 --> 00:35:27,450
Search a lesson?

533
00:35:27,746 --> 00:35:29,089
Why are you here?

534
00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:31,257
We just wanted to ask you

535
00:35:31,257 --> 00:35:33,478
Matsuda is the target of Lesson 1

536
00:35:33,496 --> 00:35:35,330
Found it

537
00:35:35,477 --> 00:35:37,827
-I'll take you there -Okay

538
00:35:46,148 --> 00:35:48,148
Matsuda Sanaaki We are the police

539
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:49,702
No movement allowed

540
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:57,987
-Kitamura calls an ambulance-Yes

541
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,710
No movement allowed

542
00:36:04,815 --> 00:36:07,515
I killed the person

543
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:13,404
Dr. Tagawa also...

544
00:36:15,123 --> 00:36:18,187
Dean Nanase

545
00:36:29,744 --> 00:36:31,406
Masamune

546
00:36:31,516 --> 00:36:34,713
Xiao Lin, are you okay?

547
00:36:34,713 --> 00:36:38,033
I think of the man who killed my father

548
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:41,729
That person... seems to have been caught

549
00:36:41,803 --> 00:36:46,280
Attempted to stab another male customer with a knife...

550
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,336
The police arrested the suspect who was working as a security guard in the city on the spot.

551
00:36:49,339 --> 00:36:51,049
Matsuda Masaaki

552
00:36:51,117 --> 00:36:55,540
The male customer who was stabbed died unfortunately after being taken to the hospital

553
00:37:02,727 --> 00:37:04,783
July 8th

554
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,586
Have you been to Dean Nanase Mamoru's residence?

555
00:37:09,122 --> 00:37:10,653
Yes

556
00:37:10,653 --> 00:37:14,511
Were you the one who killed the dean and his wife?

557
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:18,585
three days before that day

558
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:25,971
Dean Nanase asked me to remove the monitor in my residence.

559
00:37:32,454 --> 00:37:37,370
At that moment, I suddenly became greedy

560
00:37:38,616 --> 00:37:41,769
On the night of the 8th

561
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:45,421
I sneaked out of the hospital

562
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,032
Security in the house

563
00:37:49,069 --> 00:37:52,816
I've already figured it out through the monitor image

564
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:55,915
Contains the password for the vault

565
00:38:01,536 --> 00:38:02,983
but...

566
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:07,006
There's not even a dime in the vault.

567
00:38:07,302 --> 00:38:09,578
nothing

568
00:38:09,966 --> 00:38:11,798
then

569
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:16,491
I went to other rooms to find valuables

570
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,505
But saw...

571
00:38:24,897 --> 00:38:28,160
The lady has been killed

572
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:33,574
I have absolutely no idea what's going on

573
00:38:33,737 --> 00:38:35,881
At this time

574
00:38:39,978 --> 00:38:42,675
What a surprise

575
00:38:42,981 --> 00:38:45,768
I thought it was a thief from somewhere

576
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,235
It turns out to be Matsuda

577
00:38:55,532 --> 00:38:57,532
seen by you

578
00:38:57,736 --> 00:39:00,290
Did you kill the lady?

579
00:39:00,494 --> 00:39:02,494
There's nothing I can do

580
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:06,464
She never listened to me before

581
00:39:06,464 --> 00:39:08,641
That's why you asked me to remove the monitor...

582
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,000
Matsuda

583
00:39:14,702 --> 00:39:17,475
Just think she was killed by you.

584
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,449
and i will kill you

585
00:39:20,709 --> 00:39:22,868
This is legitimate defense

586
00:39:30,485 --> 00:39:33,032
I'm afraid I'll be killed by him

587
00:39:50,104 --> 00:39:54,259
Is the motive money?

588
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,610
That's right

589
00:39:58,202 --> 00:40:01,359
What about killing Dr. Tagawa?

590
00:40:01,738 --> 00:40:04,021
Dr. Tagawa

591
00:40:04,124 --> 00:40:10,135
He saw me sneak out of the hospital the day I committed the crime

592
00:40:10,217 --> 00:40:14,112
I'm worried he'll call the police

593
00:40:17,468 --> 00:40:19,839
The murder case is finally closed

594
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,817
It's really unexpected that the murderer is actually a guard

595
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:26,167
do you really think so

596
00:40:29,853 --> 00:40:32,415
Dean Nanase was killed

597
00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:35,362
Does it have something to do with you too?

598
00:40:36,123 --> 00:40:38,947
I'm only interested in the ingredient list

599
00:40:38,947 --> 00:40:41,579
I'm going to find out

600
00:40:57,018 --> 00:40:59,976
Sorry, outsiders are not allowed to enter here.

601
00:40:59,976 --> 00:41:03,505
I am the agent of Tomio Nanase, the uncle of Dean Nanase Mamoru.

602
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:06,927
The police also allowed us to enter the scene

603
00:41:06,927 --> 00:41:08,540
Excuse me

604
00:41:08,643 --> 00:41:11,267
I have been told by the department to please come in.

605
00:41:16,763 --> 00:41:18,388
over here

606
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:29,001
This is the rumored research laboratory

607
00:41:31,533 --> 00:41:34,481
Computers and information currently in police custody

608
00:41:34,481 --> 00:41:36,852
Please tell them to return it early

609
00:41:36,873 --> 00:41:38,646
are you looking for something

610
00:41:38,646 --> 00:41:41,243
Even if I say it, you won’t understand.

611
00:41:42,189 --> 00:41:44,531
We can only contact the outside world

612
00:41:44,561 --> 00:41:46,207
They all said no

613
00:41:46,222 --> 00:41:48,541
Who can beat that shark?

614
00:41:48,975 --> 00:41:51,972
Who told you to fight him?

615
00:41:54,823 --> 00:41:56,389
what

616
00:41:57,495 --> 00:42:00,291
Do you know Sun Tzu's Art of War?

617
00:42:01,746 --> 00:42:04,110
Really awesome person

618
00:42:04,168 --> 00:42:06,868
Know how to win without fighting

619
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:08,838
No fight...

620
00:42:12,782 --> 00:42:14,287
What's the meaning

621
00:42:30,229 --> 00:42:32,229
are you ready

622
00:42:32,277 --> 00:42:35,348
three two one

623
00:42:39,008 --> 00:42:41,153
Hey what's wrong

624
00:42:52,205 --> 00:42:54,205
Wait for me...

625
00:43:03,908 --> 00:43:07,598
That's great. I don't have time to call someone.

626
00:43:07,622 --> 00:43:09,622
Only that person

627
00:43:10,128 --> 00:43:12,610
Hey the uncle who kidnapped me

628
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:16,487
As a kidnapper, there's one thing you haven't done yet, right?

629
00:43:42,223 --> 00:43:43,485
Hello

630
00:43:43,485 --> 00:43:45,723
I am Shinjo Masamune

631
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,359
I'm a kidnapper

632
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,600
Nanase Rin is in my hand

633
00:43:58,103 --> 00:44:01,769
If you want me to release him, prepare a ransom

634
00:44:02,877 --> 00:44:05,073
I want three billion

635
00:44:12,211 --> 00:44:14,211

636
00:44:14,492 --> 00:44:16,008
Do you want to join forces?

637
00:44:16,008 --> 00:44:17,652
(Counterattack begins) If you cheat, it'll be over

638
00:44:17,652 --> 00:44:20,044
I left it to you to do something, but this is the result

639
00:44:20,044 --> 00:44:21,865
(Who is the traitor) Where do you want to start?

640
00:44:21,865 --> 00:44:24,158
In the end, it's all mine

641
00:44:24,158 --> 00:44:25,929
it's a pity

642
00:44:26,361 --> 00:44:28,715
who is helping you
