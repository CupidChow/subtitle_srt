Dean

3
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,790
The operation ended successfully

4
00:00:18,908 --> 00:00:20,908
thank you very much

5
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,956
dad

6
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,705
Can't come here

7
00:00:45,275 --> 00:00:47,993
Your medicine hasn't worn off yet

8
00:01:20,412 --> 00:01:22,127
11:04 pm

9
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,046
Pass the Baiqiu intersection

10
00:01:29,276 --> 00:01:31,276
along the road

11
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:35,115
Go forward two hundred meters

12
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:43,401
Drive under the land bridge

13
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:47,432
parking

15
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:05,522
Hello

16
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:07,174
where have you been

17
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,294
Under the promised land bridge

18
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,758
Very good very smooth

19
00:02:14,449 --> 00:02:16,810
Did you see the apartment in front?

20
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,303
right

21
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:21,091
Keep the apartment on the left hand side after the traffic lights

22
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:23,467
-Drive a hundred meters forward... -I know.

23
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,907
Do you really want to do this?

24
00:02:28,907 --> 00:02:30,615
Don't worry

25
00:02:30,677 --> 00:02:33,474
We've rehearsed the plan carefully

26
00:02:35,523 --> 00:02:38,073
are you okay sir

27
00:02:38,135 --> 00:02:40,027
Can you stand up?

28
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,881
no

29
00:02:52,513 --> 00:02:54,668
I still can't do it

32
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:51,745
are you okay

33
00:03:52,564 --> 00:03:54,101
little sister

34
00:03:57,188 --> 00:03:58,491
Hello

35
00:03:58,695 --> 00:04:01,450
What's wrong? What happened to Masamune?

36
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,389
A child suddenly rushed out

37
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,080
I didn't hit her

38
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,368
Probably

39
00:04:09,102 --> 00:04:12,084
Calm down what's going on?

40
00:04:12,362 --> 00:04:14,088
Make it clear Masamune

41
00:04:15,981 --> 00:04:19,205
Hey, wait a minute...

42
00:04:29,162 --> 00:04:30,998
it's her

43
00:04:31,717 --> 00:04:32,869
What

44
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,404
child to be kidnapped

45
00:05:22,794 --> 00:05:24,835
(date of kidnapping)

46
00:05:52,662 --> 00:05:53,735
Hello

47
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:55,721
Is that child okay?

48
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:58,431
Still sleeping

49
00:05:58,472 --> 00:06:01,590
Is it better to take him to the hospital?

50
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,590
Not injured?

51
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:05,774
That's true...

52
00:06:05,805 --> 00:06:08,198
You still love to worry so much

53
00:06:10,224 --> 00:06:12,224
But this is just right

54
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:15,392
In the end, the plan was considered a success.

55
00:06:15,968 --> 00:06:17,381
I said

56
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,225
Is it really okay to do this kind of thing?

57
00:06:20,544 --> 00:06:22,047
certainly

58
00:06:23,374 --> 00:06:25,757
We are here for buds

59
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,183
The next step is to ask for ransom

60
00:06:32,224 --> 00:06:34,872
I know, I'll just do it

61
00:06:37,903 --> 00:06:39,903
(Nanase)

62
00:06:49,847 --> 00:06:52,610
Feed your kid now....

63
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,990
The number you dialed is currently unavailable

64
00:06:55,011 --> 00:07:00,151
Please leave your name and message after the beep

65
00:07:10,261 --> 00:07:12,261
(Shout right and point your finger in the direction)

66
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,715
Are you awake?

67
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:24,391
Are you feeling well?

68
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:27,020
Are there any injuries? Is there any pain?...

69
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,891
None of that matters now

70
00:07:28,957 --> 00:07:30,302
Who is it?

71
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,969
What

72
00:07:32,194 --> 00:07:34,345
I am...that...

73
00:07:34,771 --> 00:07:36,670
-It's... -I mean me

74
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:40,167
who I am

75
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:44,612
You have no...memory?

76
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:47,398
I just said it, how many times do I have to say it?

77
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,935
who I am

78
00:07:50,475 --> 00:07:52,160
you are...

79
00:07:52,813 --> 00:07:54,597
-Um... -What about you?

80
00:07:54,622 --> 00:07:56,509
-I? -That's right

81
00:07:56,533 --> 00:07:57,928
Who are you

82
00:07:57,928 --> 00:07:59,535
I...

83
00:07:59,974 --> 00:08:01,546
I am...

84
00:08:01,571 --> 00:08:03,735
How to explain it?

85
00:08:03,748 --> 00:08:04,853
dad?

86
00:08:05,482 --> 00:08:06,446
(I love my dad the most) Dad...

87
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:08,716
I am dad dad...

88
00:08:08,973 --> 00:08:10,465
your father

89
00:08:10,527 --> 00:08:13,300
I have no impression at all...what is it called?

90
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:14,512
Masamune

91
00:08:14,543 --> 00:08:16,998
It’s the Warring States military commander Date Masamune.

92
00:08:17,008 --> 00:08:18,272
my name

93
00:08:18,735 --> 00:08:19,927
What

94
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:22,184
sprout

95
00:08:22,463 --> 00:08:24,196
(Xinzhuang Yasheng) Your name is Xinzhuang Yasheng

96
00:08:24,402 --> 00:08:25,804
Bud?

97
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:28,949
what is this place

98
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,018
Needless to say

99
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:33,110
Of course it's our home

100
00:08:33,161 --> 00:08:34,708
Home?

101
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:36,479
Isn't it a warehouse?

102
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,438
-Warehouse... -How could I become like this?

103
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:39,810
what is the reason

104
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:42,067
that...

105
00:08:43,447 --> 00:08:44,986
sometimes...

106
00:08:45,047 --> 00:08:47,882
you will lose your memory

107
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:51,191
What does it mean do I have cognitive impairment?

108
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:53,984
He actually understands such difficult words

109
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:55,648
hungry

110
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,355
There's only one thing that's clear now

111
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:01,705
I'm just very hungry

112
00:09:09,163 --> 00:09:11,117
Are you pretending to have amnesia?

113
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:21,273
Mei Shinjo

114
00:09:28,582 --> 00:09:29,658
What's this

115
00:09:30,607 --> 00:09:31,930
vegetable porridge

116
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,112
You're sick, so it's better to eat porridge.

117
00:09:34,112 --> 00:09:35,759
What about this green vegetable scraps?

118
00:09:35,787 --> 00:09:37,307
Vegetable scraps...

119
00:09:38,576 --> 00:09:40,632
That's a radish leaf

120
00:09:40,688 --> 00:09:42,462
Not only nutritious

121
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,649
Yasheng eats it with gusto every time

122
00:09:45,773 --> 00:09:47,662
I love eating this?

123
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:51,630
Yes, Yasheng likes it very much

124
00:09:52,495 --> 00:09:55,567
Said that it is full of father's love

125
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,692
love what that is

126
00:09:57,706 --> 00:09:59,607
love is...

127
00:09:59,635 --> 00:10:02,742
The person who is cooking can’t be seen but can feel it...

128
00:10:02,765 --> 00:10:04,118
Is there any other food?

129
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,255
Are these my clothes?

130
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,711
(Nanase)

131
00:10:37,488 --> 00:10:40,024
The number you dialed is currently unavailable...

132
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:43,780
Please pick it up quickly, damn it

133
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,882
Feel sorry...

134
00:10:50,896 --> 00:10:53,870
- I have a package - Yes

135
00:10:53,915 --> 00:10:55,132
It belongs to Mr. Kobayashi

136
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:56,589
not me

137
00:10:57,161 --> 00:10:59,455
-That's it. -Sorry

138
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,600
That...

139
00:11:06,471 --> 00:11:08,248
Cat

140
00:11:09,182 --> 00:11:10,663
I'm leaving first

141
00:11:10,997 --> 00:11:12,746
The cat is here again

142
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,261
what are you doing

143
00:11:23,414 --> 00:11:24,996
What's this

144
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,833
Yasheng’s toy

145
00:11:28,837 --> 00:11:31,331
You usually like to play, right?

146
00:11:32,014 --> 00:11:33,944
Can I play this?

147
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:37,000
What's wrong

148
00:11:37,475 --> 00:11:39,111
nothing

149
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:42,355
By the way, I went and bought this

150
00:11:43,087 --> 00:11:45,685
Although it is better to eat warmer food

151
00:11:45,685 --> 00:11:48,561
Wait it feels weird

152
00:11:48,561 --> 00:11:50,645
strangeness? What's strange?

153
00:11:50,756 --> 00:11:52,364
Such as this

154
00:11:54,637 --> 00:11:58,137
If I usually like to play this

155
00:11:58,137 --> 00:12:00,504
It should be kept within reach

156
00:12:00,504 --> 00:12:03,224
How did it get there?

157
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:04,264
because...

158
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:07,141
These clothes are what I'm wearing

159
00:12:07,141 --> 00:12:09,281
The material is completely different

160
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:10,973
The pattern is also very tasteless

161
00:12:10,973 --> 00:12:14,232
taste? How could...

162
00:12:15,428 --> 00:12:18,024
are you really my dad

163
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,517
Clothes turn yellow

164
00:12:21,517 --> 00:12:24,708
Dirty, vulgar, sloppy

165
00:12:24,764 --> 00:12:26,708
messy hair

166
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,506
The clothes are wrinkled and

167
00:12:30,494 --> 00:12:32,076
There's a bad smell

168
00:12:39,411 --> 00:12:42,490
What are you doing? You are so arrogant.

169
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:03,429
(Nanase)

170
00:13:08,504 --> 00:13:10,918
(Fujimi Bathhouse)

171
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:16,337
The number you dialed is currently unavailable...

172
00:13:16,372 --> 00:13:18,372
What are you doing?

173
00:13:21,347 --> 00:13:22,716
(number not shown)

174
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:27,757
Hello

175
00:13:28,394 --> 00:13:31,769
Have you talked to your parents about it?

176
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:34,117
They didn't answer the phone

177
00:13:34,598 --> 00:13:36,867
I've made several calls since morning

178
00:13:36,923 --> 00:13:38,463
That's too strange

179
00:13:38,497 --> 00:13:40,889
My daughter is missing

180
00:13:40,956 --> 00:13:42,597
Why don't you answer the phone?

181
00:13:43,112 --> 00:13:44,663
Very strange indeed

182
00:13:44,673 --> 00:13:48,739
Hey, this is different from what was planned, right?

183
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,552
Don't worry

184
00:13:51,145 --> 00:13:52,898
Where is that child?

185
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,808
actually

186
00:13:54,998 --> 00:13:57,344
She said she had no memory

187
00:13:57,993 --> 00:13:59,332
No memory?

188
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,045
Yes, I called myself dad when I was in a panic.

189
00:14:03,605 --> 00:14:05,774
I don’t know if she believes it or not.

190
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,897
This is a good opportunity

191
00:14:10,087 --> 00:14:11,690
What

192
00:14:12,346 --> 00:14:14,657
Let her think you are father and daughter

193
00:14:14,657 --> 00:14:17,022
On the contrary, other problems can be avoided

194
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,240
But...

195
00:14:18,309 --> 00:14:20,239
You can definitely do it

196
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,161
This is for buds

197
00:14:22,954 --> 00:14:25,111
To protect our daughter

198
00:14:25,111 --> 00:14:28,204
Is there anything wrong with feeding Yasheng?

199
00:14:28,346 --> 00:14:29,735
certainly

200
00:14:30,321 --> 00:14:32,321
You don't have to worry about anything

201
00:14:32,443 --> 00:14:36,011
Okay, she'll leave it to you, Xi Li

202
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,168
Yasheng has eaten

203
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:45,376
Eat

204
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:47,658
Did you do the laundry?

205
00:15:49,113 --> 00:15:50,686
Have you taken a shower too?

206
00:15:50,857 --> 00:15:52,254
washed

207
00:15:53,023 --> 00:15:56,704
How do you feel like a dad?

208
00:15:56,896 --> 00:15:58,896
Shave your beard too

209
00:16:01,425 --> 00:16:03,425
Let's eat

210
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,557
Very cute

211
00:16:06,707 --> 00:16:09,797
Good morning, I am Little Bunny.

212
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,298
Eat more

213
00:16:12,298 --> 00:16:14,106
I don't need

214
00:16:15,457 --> 00:16:18,910
I want to say this but I'm hungry

215
00:16:19,983 --> 00:16:21,612
Eat

216
00:16:24,422 --> 00:16:26,422
Eat more

217
00:16:41,912 --> 00:16:43,674
What are you laughing at?

218
00:16:43,717 --> 00:16:46,899
You look so cute when you eat

219
00:16:47,028 --> 00:16:48,359
What

220
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,156
Where is mom?

221
00:16:51,156 --> 00:16:52,294
Mother?

222
00:16:52,356 --> 00:16:55,218
Why didn't she get divorced here?

223
00:16:55,511 --> 00:16:58,029
That's almost it

224
00:16:58,372 --> 00:17:01,106
One day she suddenly left home

225
00:17:01,342 --> 00:17:03,148
Leave me and Yasheng behind

226
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:05,061
Why are you having an affair?

227
00:17:05,061 --> 00:17:06,305
Or domestic violence

228
00:17:06,305 --> 00:17:07,707
Domestic violence?

229
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,703
Here too

230
00:17:15,905 --> 00:17:17,627
Did you hit me?

231
00:17:17,627 --> 00:17:19,387
No...

232
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:21,131
no

233
00:17:21,968 --> 00:17:24,767
Did you hit it somewhere?

234
00:17:28,895 --> 00:17:31,098
You must answer the phone for me today

235
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,584
(Nanase)

236
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,335
The number you dialed is currently unavailable

237
00:17:57,335 --> 00:17:59,499
What are you doing?

238
00:18:07,382 --> 00:18:09,875
The number you dialed...

239
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:12,324
Why doesn't Xili answer the phone?

240
00:18:30,726 --> 00:18:32,961
Hello, I’m Kido from the sixth floor ward.

241
00:18:33,102 --> 00:18:35,374
Thank you for taking care of me

242
00:18:35,445 --> 00:18:37,713
I am a family member of Xinzhuang Yasheng in ward 655

243
00:18:38,861 --> 00:18:40,359
Buds?

244
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:43,304
She just finished eating...

245
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,823
Let me say

246
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:54,163
Hello, is this Mr. Xinzhuang?

247
00:18:54,222 --> 00:18:57,584
Chief Nursing Officer, may I ask if Yasheng is okay?

248
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:59,924
No problem

249
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,055
Wait a mininute

250
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,854
dad

251
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,559
Where are you

252
00:19:09,605 --> 00:19:10,898
sprout

253
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,538
The bear's nose is about to fall off

254
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:19,813
I really want to see my dad as soon as possible

255
00:19:23,232 --> 00:19:25,739
Hello Mr. Xinzhuang

256
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:28,536
Regarding unpaid hospitalization fees

257
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:31,974
I will definitely...will definitely pay

258
00:19:31,974 --> 00:19:33,669
please give me some more time

259
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:36,334
Yasheng, please give me a favor. Goodbye.

260
00:19:40,152 --> 00:19:43,501
money...

261
00:19:43,624 --> 00:19:45,051
hateful

262
00:19:45,097 --> 00:19:47,709
money...

263
00:19:48,096 --> 00:19:51,079
money...

264
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,164
Hey

265
00:20:02,814 --> 00:20:04,524
Hello

266
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:06,415
Where have you gone?

267
00:20:17,325 --> 00:20:19,495
It takes several times to say it before you understand it

268
00:20:19,517 --> 00:20:22,940
First cut the pipe into 30 cm

269
00:20:22,974 --> 00:20:25,174
in vertical direction

270
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:29,405
Temporarily fixed to the cubital tunnel at 90 degrees

271
00:20:29,617 --> 00:20:33,407
Then connect the 32A flange here

272
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:35,509
Spacing is 300

273
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:39,395
Weld this end and fix it temporarily

274
00:20:39,443 --> 00:20:40,505
Do you understand?

275
00:20:40,517 --> 00:20:43,288
I still don't understand what you are talking about

276
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,093
please speak slower

277
00:20:46,643 --> 00:20:51,067
(Chinese) "Cut this into 30cm tubes"

278
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:54,520
"Between the upper and lower 90 degree flange and the flange"

279
00:20:54,548 --> 00:20:56,548
"Screw temporary fixation"

280
00:20:56,588 --> 00:21:00,495
(Tagalog) "Between Fran and Fran here"

281
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:03,452
"Keep 30 centimeters"

282
00:21:03,501 --> 00:21:08,436
"Weld here and temporarily fix here."

283
00:21:08,471 --> 00:21:09,501
"Do you understand?"

284
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:10,822
I understand

285
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,798
I see

286
00:21:12,818 --> 00:21:14,239
Do you understand?

287
00:21:14,876 --> 00:21:17,312
Thank you little sister

288
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:20,409
my god

289
00:21:21,076 --> 00:21:24,260
Yasheng, what are you doing here?

290
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,220
-I... -Let's go

291
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,518
Excuse me...

292
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,300
Hello

293
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:35,471
Don't run around without permission

294
00:21:35,492 --> 00:21:37,417
After all, the illness is just right

295
00:21:37,438 --> 00:21:41,292
(English) Hey, I seem to be able to speak foreign languages

296
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,727
(Chinese) "Besides English, I can also speak other foreign languages"

297
00:21:47,743 --> 00:21:52,647
(French) "Do you have a natural talent for languages?"

298
00:21:52,776 --> 00:21:56,116
(Tagalog) "How can I lose my memory if I am so smart?"

299
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,788
(Arabic) "How could I be born in this family with so much education"

300
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:01,520
(English) "Do you understand what I'm saying?"

301
00:22:01,563 --> 00:22:03,563
(Korean) "Are you really my dad?"

302
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:06,899
Is this some kind of spell?

303
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,833
This is popular in school

304
00:22:09,602 --> 00:22:12,028
Forget it, it’s useless to tell you.

305
00:22:13,981 --> 00:22:15,553
etc...

306
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
Is that a spell to cast a spell?

307
00:22:40,098 --> 00:22:41,437
relapse?

308
00:22:41,437 --> 00:22:44,489
Her pulmonary artery narrowed again

309
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:47,608
To cure it, we need to operate again

310
00:22:47,608 --> 00:22:48,548
Please doctor

311
00:22:48,548 --> 00:22:50,042
but this time

312
00:22:50,052 --> 00:22:54,287
Also complicated by aortic valve insufficiency

313
00:22:54,314 --> 00:22:56,891
The risk is quite high

314
00:22:56,891 --> 00:23:00,943
There may be no hospital in Japan willing to handle it

315
00:23:00,975 --> 00:23:02,694
It's too difficult for me too

316
00:23:02,694 --> 00:23:04,301
It’s okay to go abroad

317
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:06,998
But...this

318
00:23:07,124 --> 00:23:09,667
If you want to go abroad for surgery

319
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:12,958
The prepaid surgery fee alone exceeds 100 million yuan

320
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:14,125
One hundred million?

321
00:23:14,572 --> 00:23:15,696
Yes

322
00:23:16,507 --> 00:23:18,016
One hundred million...

323
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:22,023
(Accounting Department) Can I get an advance of fifteen years’ salary?

324
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:22,963
Fifteen years?

325
00:23:22,963 --> 00:23:24,963
Please, I'll do anything

326
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:27,496
-It's no use to me, please. -Please.

327
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:29,902
This is my lifelong request to you.

328
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,859
I'm really sorry. One hundred thousand is fine.

329
00:23:31,888 --> 00:23:34,014
Fifty thousand and fifty thousand would be fine

330
00:23:34,266 --> 00:23:36,364
president...

331
00:23:36,574 --> 00:23:38,435
please

332
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:41,954
Please lend me money and sell my organs.

333
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,645
please

334
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,833
President, please...

335
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:49,282
President, please...

336
00:23:49,617 --> 00:23:51,435
Please...

337
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,193
haven't seen you for a long time

338
00:24:07,535 --> 00:24:10,279
I heard about Yasheng

339
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:16,657
I want to help too

340
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:22,163
Just think of it as making up for my past debt of abandoning my family.

341
00:24:23,882 --> 00:24:26,063
How much money is needed

342
00:24:29,095 --> 00:24:32,352
You can't even come up with that amount.

343
00:24:34,811 --> 00:24:36,264
I think so

344
00:24:37,647 --> 00:24:39,100
but

345
00:24:40,134 --> 00:24:42,035
I have a way

346
00:24:54,724 --> 00:24:59,180
This girl can solve all problems

347
00:25:21,106 --> 00:25:23,347
Where did you go at noon?

348
00:25:24,093 --> 00:25:27,266
Have you ever taken care of Meisheng?

349
00:25:27,266 --> 00:25:30,484
Of course, is there any news over there?

350
00:25:31,737 --> 00:25:33,375
The phone still can't get through

351
00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:38,301
But the other party should have called the police a long time ago, right?

352
00:25:38,335 --> 00:25:40,308
They all said no more

353
00:25:40,308 --> 00:25:42,947
- But... - That child

354
00:25:43,114 --> 00:25:45,480
abused

355
00:25:49,593 --> 00:25:52,281
She has more than one bruise on her arm

356
00:25:52,805 --> 00:25:54,455
That's right

357
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,855
Her father definitely doesn't want a scandal to break out

358
00:26:00,327 --> 00:26:04,160
After all, he is the director of a big hospital

359
00:26:04,307 --> 00:26:05,801
Dean?

360
00:26:09,676 --> 00:26:12,429
Is the child's father a doctor?

361
00:26:12,464 --> 00:26:15,158
Yes, didn't I say that?

362
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:17,175
You only said you were a rich man

363
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,327
Which hospital is it?

364
00:26:20,327 --> 00:26:22,607
Rongjin Memorial Hospital

365
00:26:23,445 --> 00:26:26,700
Isn't that the hospital where Yasheng is staying?

366
00:26:28,481 --> 00:26:30,605
Let me tell you this...

367
00:26:31,408 --> 00:26:35,473
Did he kidnap the daughter of the director who treated Mei Sheng?

368
00:26:35,543 --> 00:26:37,890
Masamune, please calm down first

369
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:40,483
Don't be afraid of anything

370
00:26:40,937 --> 00:26:45,195
Their family has plenty of money

371
00:26:45,195 --> 00:26:47,594
This is not the point

372
00:26:49,253 --> 00:26:54,298
Dean Nanase is an important figure in saving Meisheng

373
00:26:55,555 --> 00:26:58,938
How could you do this to him?

374
00:27:00,108 --> 00:27:02,090
I'll go check the situation

375
00:27:02,981 --> 00:27:04,473
Masamune...

376
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,880
The incident rocked the quiet residential neighborhood

377
00:27:41,915 --> 00:27:46,698
The police have arrived at the scene and started inspecting the scene

378
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,390
- It's nighttime in this area... - Borrowed

379
00:27:51,298 --> 00:27:55,390
Now there are alarm bells and police chatter everywhere, which is nerve-wracking

380
00:27:55,412 --> 00:27:56,653
Thanks for your hard work

381
00:27:58,731 --> 00:28:01,634
-The media came so fast. -I'm sorry.

382
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:03,642
Sorry, Sunouchi-senpai, you are obviously on vacation today.

383
00:28:03,674 --> 00:28:05,833
It doesn't matter, I'm still working anyway

384
00:28:06,234 --> 00:28:09,057
-Seniors are still working so hard - they can’t take any time off.

385
00:28:09,092 --> 00:28:10,863
According to investigators

386
00:28:10,863 --> 00:28:15,467
The person who died was Director Nanase Mamoru of Eishin Memorial Hospital.

387
00:28:15,474 --> 00:28:17,827
and his wife, Ms. Sayaka.

388
00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:20,122
- What - the remains were found...

389
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,418
Sorry, we are currently broadcasting

390
00:28:23,767 --> 00:28:25,626
sorry

391
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:30,335
It was their housekeeper who discovered the body.

392
00:28:30,373 --> 00:28:35,862
The police are investigating the murder of Nanase and his wife.

393
00:28:36,635 --> 00:28:38,775
Because the site is a quiet residential area

394
00:28:38,778 --> 00:28:41,214
Many people feel uneasy

395
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:44,849
I hope the police can solve the case as soon as possible

396
00:29:00,649 --> 00:29:03,174
The child's parents are dead

397
00:29:03,645 --> 00:29:06,228
No wonder I can't answer the phone

398
00:29:06,752 --> 00:29:08,929
Who killed the person?

399
00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:10,929
I kidnapped their daughter

400
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:13,582
The most suspicious person...

401
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,895
Is it me?

402
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:17,659
Is it me?

403
00:29:17,852 --> 00:29:19,379
This way

404
00:29:19,432 --> 00:29:20,889
This house is so boring

405
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:22,626
-Yes-Thank you for your hard work...

406
00:29:22,626 --> 00:29:26,271
The windows were all closed when the housekeeper discovered the body.

407
00:29:26,271 --> 00:29:28,534
The air conditioner is not turned on and it is quite stuffy inside.

408
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:30,816
-Explain it-yes

409
00:29:30,851 --> 00:29:35,546
Mamoru Nanase is the first person to head the neurosurgery department at the hospital.

410
00:29:35,563 --> 00:29:37,122
He fell here

411
00:29:37,227 --> 00:29:39,439
-He was slashed to death with a katana - katana?

412
00:29:39,439 --> 00:29:41,001
Katana?

413
00:29:41,141 --> 00:29:44,698
It was originally decorated here and slashed to the neck with a knife

414
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:45,995
The method is very cruel

415
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,406
Where is the other person?

416
00:29:48,406 --> 00:29:49,723
This way

417
00:29:49,723 --> 00:29:51,723
room at the other end

418
00:29:52,648 --> 00:29:56,258
Go back first and turn left at the corner

419
00:30:00,971 --> 00:30:02,813
This way

420
00:30:06,741 --> 00:30:09,209
My wife Sayaka is lying here.

421
00:30:09,209 --> 00:30:11,747
A letter opener stuck in his chest

422
00:30:11,904 --> 00:30:14,113
That's a katana over there, a letter opener over there.

423
00:30:14,566 --> 00:30:16,884
Because this room is hotter

424
00:30:16,884 --> 00:30:19,497
The remains were more severely decomposed

425
00:30:19,497 --> 00:30:21,938
The detailed cause of death will have to wait for a judicial autopsy.

426
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:28,581
-Hello-Yes?

427
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:30,859
The monitor was removed

428
00:30:32,727 --> 00:30:36,351
Not only here at the door and in the living room, but also

429
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:38,471
Sorry, I'll check it right away

430
00:30:38,474 --> 00:30:39,574
- I'm sorry - go quickly

431
00:30:39,574 --> 00:30:40,716
yes

432
00:30:42,392 --> 00:30:43,972
Sunouchi-senpai

433
00:30:43,972 --> 00:30:46,795
Don't you have to wait for someone from the prefectural police headquarters to arrive first?

434
00:30:46,817 --> 00:30:48,708
can't waste time

435
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,607
what is that

436
00:30:53,716 --> 00:30:55,453
Waterfall?

437
00:30:57,197 --> 00:30:59,197
Go and have a look

438
00:31:11,739 --> 00:31:13,473
-This is... -Call Kesouyan over.

439
00:31:13,473 --> 00:31:14,641
yes

440
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,849
(True medicine lies in a kind heart)

441
00:32:10,015 --> 00:32:12,359
What is this room for?

442
00:32:13,662 --> 00:32:17,909
"True medicine lies in a kind heart"...

443
00:32:18,251 --> 00:32:20,441
what is this place

444
00:32:26,674 --> 00:32:28,251
This girl...

445
00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:32,109
Where have you gone?

446
00:34:28,814 --> 00:34:31,428
Help...

447
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:47,152
Why is the door open?

448
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:50,902
Bud?

449
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:53,361

450
00:34:53,484 --> 00:34:55,422

451
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,279

455
00:35:24,778 --> 00:35:26,778
Xiao Lin

456
00:35:28,997 --> 00:35:30,997
Xiao Lin

457
00:35:33,543 --> 00:35:38,098
Xiaolin...

458
00:35:53,257 --> 00:35:57,621
Xiaolin...

459
00:36:00,943 --> 00:36:04,017
Sorry, did you see a little girl about this tall?

460
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,859
I didn't see it

461
00:36:05,903 --> 00:36:07,415
Yeah

462
00:36:10,279 --> 00:36:11,863
stop

463
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,274

466
00:37:04,615 --> 00:37:06,428
Dad is here

467
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,461
are you okay

468
00:37:12,023 --> 00:37:13,306
stop

469
00:37:13,306 --> 00:37:14,916
Stop chasing

470
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,098
Don't leave me alone again

471
00:37:27,517 --> 00:37:30,043
(Rongjin Memorial Hospital)

472
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,341
big bear bear

473
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:38,594
My nose is sick

474
00:37:38,594 --> 00:37:41,264
Already restored

475
00:37:41,311 --> 00:37:43,311
Very good

476
00:37:43,774 --> 00:37:45,649
big bear bear

477
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:53,225
The deceased was Director Nanase Mamoru of Eishin Memorial Hospital.

478
00:37:53,236 --> 00:37:54,866
and his wife Sayaka

479
00:37:54,963 --> 00:37:58,182
According to the police, Mr. Shou was stabbed...

480
00:37:58,203 --> 00:38:01,767
Hey you liar

481
00:38:02,228 --> 00:38:06,043
Dean Nanase and his wife...

482
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:18,062
Dr. Suwon, are you okay?

483
00:38:21,597 --> 00:38:23,035
physician

484
00:38:28,405 --> 00:38:29,923
Report

485
00:38:29,929 --> 00:38:32,552
The residents are Mr. Nanase Mamoru and his wife...

486
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,600
Excuse me, Vice Chairman

487
00:38:34,671 --> 00:38:36,037
Where's Xiao Lin?

488
00:38:36,037 --> 00:38:38,245
Haven't found anyone yet

489
00:38:38,265 --> 00:38:41,338
Maybe he was taken away by a murderer

490
00:38:41,457 --> 00:38:45,105
In the worst case scenario, the eldest lady may have...

491
00:38:46,475 --> 00:38:48,770
In that case

492
00:38:49,473 --> 00:38:51,473
This hospital...

493
00:38:51,638 --> 00:38:55,098
It belongs to me

494
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:08,220
child to be kidnapped

495
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:35,113
Hey

496
00:39:42,474 --> 00:39:44,349
Do you want to leave?

497
00:39:45,176 --> 00:39:48,378
Maybe it will be like yesterday

498
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,213
Another thief broke in

499
00:39:51,213 --> 00:39:53,585
You should inform the police first

500
00:39:53,585 --> 00:39:55,480
Did you call the police?

501
00:39:58,127 --> 00:40:02,068
But before that, get out of here. It's too dangerous.

502
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,150
Okay, let's change into this one.

503
00:40:05,741 --> 00:40:07,452
hurry up

504
00:40:10,202 --> 00:40:12,119
Do I want to wear this?

505
00:40:12,573 --> 00:40:14,573
Because your clothes are dirty

506
00:40:15,068 --> 00:40:16,552
hurry up

507
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,857
Don’t have any other clothes?

508
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:22,095
Please put it on quickly. I beg you.

509
00:40:22,123 --> 00:40:25,134
I want to eat first. I'm hungry.

510
00:40:25,134 --> 00:40:26,587
dad

511
00:40:26,931 --> 00:40:28,366
Eat

512
00:40:31,604 --> 00:40:34,352
-I'm on it. -Please use it.

513
00:40:34,373 --> 00:40:37,568
-Thank you.-The little sister looks so cute.

514
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,696
The clothes are so cute too

515
00:40:39,696 --> 00:40:41,208
Eat more

516
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:43,271
Look, people say it's cute

517
00:40:43,538 --> 00:40:47,032
Dad, what did that person want to do last night?

518
00:40:47,032 --> 00:40:48,509
Is he really a thief?

519
00:40:48,525 --> 00:40:51,955
Who would steal an empty home like that?

520
00:40:52,018 --> 00:40:53,751
How can there be nothing?

521
00:40:53,971 --> 00:40:55,641
Kidnapping?

522
00:40:56,442 --> 00:40:59,040
Is he trying to kidnap me?

523
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:02,344
How is it possible

524
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,802
(The remains of the dean and his wife were found) Thank you for the hospitality

525
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,881
Brother, thank you for your patronage. See you tomorrow.

526
00:41:15,437 --> 00:41:17,072
I'm going to the toilet

527
00:41:17,135 --> 00:41:18,865
You eat first

528
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,943
did you see the newspaper

529
00:41:38,336 --> 00:41:39,833
Saw it

530
00:41:40,252 --> 00:41:41,908
what's going on

531
00:41:41,927 --> 00:41:44,259
I just wanted to ask

532
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:47,170
How could a murder happen?

533
00:41:47,425 --> 00:41:49,333
and...

534
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:53,200
I also encountered strange things

535
00:41:53,782 --> 00:41:55,949
Strange thing?

536
00:41:56,495 --> 00:42:00,287
Yesterday there was a weirdo who wanted to take Xiao Lin away

537
00:42:00,287 --> 00:42:02,378
I thought I would be killed

538
00:42:02,414 --> 00:42:05,068
Basically, I want to kidnap...kidnap...

539
00:42:05,073 --> 00:42:08,407
Not talking about me

540
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:11,402
Have you disposed of your car and cell phone?

541
00:42:11,456 --> 00:42:14,959
I have already dealt with it as you told me and will not be traced.

542
00:42:19,455 --> 00:42:22,672
But it’s better to surrender yourself.

543
00:42:23,182 --> 00:42:24,621
What

544
00:42:25,968 --> 00:42:29,302
This is not a simple kidnapping case

545
00:42:29,975 --> 00:42:33,413
Her parents were killed

546
00:42:37,089 --> 00:42:40,031
The situation is out of control

547
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:44,058
What about Yasheng? Now I’m losing you.

548
00:42:44,058 --> 00:42:46,058
What should buds do?

549
00:42:48,952 --> 00:42:50,696
gentlemen

550
00:42:52,207 --> 00:42:54,207
-What's wrong? -Your daughter...

551
00:42:54,216 --> 00:42:56,216
- Come on - Hey, what's going on?

552
00:42:56,216 --> 00:42:57,867
Should I call an ambulance?

553
00:42:58,081 --> 00:42:59,769
There is a hospital nearby

554
00:42:59,939 --> 00:43:01,687
Go to the hospital. Go to the hospital right away.

555
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,073
Sorry please look at my child

556
00:43:06,073 --> 00:43:07,515
She lost consciousness after vomiting

557
00:43:07,515 --> 00:43:09,025
please wait

558
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:09,847
Feel sorry

559
00:43:09,847 --> 00:43:11,005
When did he fall?

560
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,531
ten minutes ago

561
00:43:15,024 --> 00:43:16,330
are you a father

562
00:43:17,393 --> 00:43:19,099
That's right

563
00:43:23,194 --> 00:43:24,937
Are you the father?

564
00:43:27,023 --> 00:43:28,499
That's right

565
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,777
what did she eat today

566
00:43:32,931 --> 00:43:36,190
Today... I had parent-child rice bowl

567
00:43:36,536 --> 00:43:38,842
And miso soup

568
00:43:38,919 --> 00:43:41,685
She may be allergic to eggs

569
00:43:43,567 --> 00:43:45,810
don't you know

570
00:43:47,512 --> 00:43:49,114
allergy?

571
00:43:50,266 --> 00:43:51,436
Is she okay?

572
00:43:51,436 --> 00:43:52,699
fell asleep

573
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,713
Look at these bruises

574
00:43:54,918 --> 00:43:56,918
It's the scar of abuse, right?

575
00:44:00,675 --> 00:44:02,893
Notify the police

576
00:44:02,893 --> 00:44:04,168
yes

577
00:44:07,326 --> 00:44:10,023
(Kawanaka Police Station)

578
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,734
This is the monitor picture near Nanase's house

579
00:44:14,164 --> 00:44:15,874
Who is this man?

580
00:44:15,874 --> 00:44:17,794
The screen was sent for analysis.

581
00:44:17,801 --> 00:44:19,360
I don’t know the vehicle or license plate clearly.

582
00:44:19,382 --> 00:44:21,239
It takes a while to lock in the target

583
00:44:21,546 --> 00:44:25,047
Sunouchi-senpai, Chief Qin from the Prefectural Police Headquarters is here.

584
00:44:39,747 --> 00:44:41,918
Within the feed

585
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:47,310
Hello, long time no see

586
00:44:49,046 --> 00:44:50,503
take it

587
00:44:50,965 --> 00:44:53,786
Sorry, I started checking first.

588
00:44:53,786 --> 00:44:55,255
I know

589
00:44:55,271 --> 00:44:57,899
The heaviest speed in this case

590
00:44:58,313 --> 00:45:01,734
It will be faster if you are familiar with the local jurisdiction.

591
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:04,827
What's more important is that I trust you

592
00:45:04,864 --> 00:45:07,583
Sunouchi-senpai and the manager seem to be the same generation

593
00:45:07,612 --> 00:45:10,219
- True or false - But you have to remember to report it

594
00:45:10,219 --> 00:45:12,167
Also you should understand...

595
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,707
Don't worry

596
00:45:14,123 --> 00:45:16,411
I'll give credit to a lesson

597
00:45:16,891 --> 00:45:18,701
Just know

598
00:45:18,781 --> 00:45:21,005
If you need help, just ask

599
00:45:21,037 --> 00:45:22,525
i need you too

600
00:45:24,123 --> 00:45:25,527
Thanks to you too

601
00:45:25,527 --> 00:45:26,775
yes

602
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,728
I want to establish a special investigation headquarters

603
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,841
Borrow a conference room

604
00:45:29,841 --> 00:45:31,180
I'll take you there

605
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:32,955
Manager, I'll take you there

606
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:36,237
Sunouchi-senpai?

607
00:45:36,237 --> 00:45:39,069
Already said hello

608
00:45:39,437 --> 00:45:42,114
Just be cautious and check nearby hospitals.

609
00:45:42,178 --> 00:45:43,448
Hospital?

610
00:45:43,448 --> 00:45:46,717
The man looked worried about the child

611
00:45:46,797 --> 00:45:49,377
Maybe take her to the hospital later

612
00:45:49,473 --> 00:45:51,908
Take meat tickets to the hospital

613
00:45:51,908 --> 00:45:54,595
Could there be such a stupid kidnapper?

614
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,384
dad

615
00:46:03,656 --> 00:46:05,240
are you okay

616
00:46:08,317 --> 00:46:09,932
I need to go to the toilet

617
00:46:09,964 --> 00:46:11,692
Can you walk?

618
00:46:13,695 --> 00:46:16,454
Sorry, can I borrow the bathroom?

619
00:46:16,486 --> 00:46:18,584
Please be over there

620
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,757
Thanks

621
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,365
Holding a backpack

622
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:25,564
Backpack?

623
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:29,679
Okay, let's go

624
00:46:30,993 --> 00:46:32,863
The toilet is over there

625
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:35,087
I said the toilet is over there

626
00:46:35,087 --> 00:46:36,861
-Hey-the police are coming

627
00:46:36,861 --> 00:46:38,086
What

628
00:46:38,525 --> 00:46:40,493
Why are the police here?

629
00:46:40,503 --> 00:46:42,695
Hey why

630
00:46:49,143 --> 00:46:51,143
I received a report of abuse

631
00:46:51,195 --> 00:46:52,831
where is the child

632
00:46:52,831 --> 00:46:54,534
She just went to the bathroom

633
00:46:54,534 --> 00:46:55,778
over there

634
00:47:05,768 --> 00:47:07,300
Run quickly

635
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,862
Sunouchi-senpai

636
00:47:13,328 --> 00:47:16,730
Tomakihara Hospital just reported a case of abuse

637
00:47:16,817 --> 00:47:18,571
This child...

638
00:47:21,982 --> 00:47:24,326
This is a video from the hospital

639
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:31,943
It's definitely Xiaolin.

640
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:42,135
Yasheng, are you in good health?

641
00:47:47,069 --> 00:47:48,600
What's wrong

642
00:47:50,954 --> 00:47:54,186
Last night you called me Xiaolin

643
00:47:57,106 --> 00:47:59,819
It's time for you to tell me the truth

644
00:48:01,109 --> 00:48:03,676
The identity of the kidnapper was found

645
00:48:03,966 --> 00:48:06,500
His name is Shinjo Masamune

646
00:48:06,726 --> 00:48:08,726
The address is...

647
00:48:09,952 --> 00:48:12,164
If I know, I will report it to the section chief

648
00:48:12,196 --> 00:48:13,807
There are matching files

649
00:48:14,453 --> 00:48:16,404
He has been arrested before

650
00:48:16,404 --> 00:48:18,096
What's the crime?

651
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:23,467
(charge of murder)

652
00:48:24,307 --> 00:48:26,307
murder?

653
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,244
Who are you

What was being studied in that basement?

657
00:48:48,456 --> 00:48:49,408
Public search?

658
00:48:49,408 --> 00:48:51,517
The only possibility is that the police leaked the secret
