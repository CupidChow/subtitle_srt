1
00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:01,853
(I am a kidnapper) My name is Masamune Shinjo

2
00:00:01,863 --> 00:00:03,712
Became a kidnapper for some reason

3
00:00:03,731 --> 00:00:04,492
Who are you

4
00:00:04,492 --> 00:00:08,160
(The genius girl who lost her memory) The Nanase Rin I kidnapped was a genius girl who lost her memory.

5
00:00:08,194 --> 00:00:10,666
- But... - The police are heading in the direction of murder...

6
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:13,080
(The girl’s parents were brutally murdered) Xiao Lin’s parents were actually murdered.

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,877
I killed the person

8
00:00:14,877 --> 00:00:17,039
Dean Nanase

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,552
(The guard was the prisoner who killed his parents?) Guard Matsuda confessed that he was the murderer

10
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:22,637
-Not only that-then encountered huge waves...

11
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:24,504
Both men fell into the sea from the boat and disappeared.

12
00:00:24,504 --> 00:00:26,315
(Masamune and Rin-chan are rumored to be dead) Are we apparently dead?

13
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:29,442
In order to break through the predicament, we decided to give it a try

14
00:00:29,482 --> 00:00:31,482
Nanase Rin is in my hand

15
00:00:31,674 --> 00:00:34,825
If you want me to release him, prepare a ransom

16
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,088
I want three billion

17
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:43,183
(The Day of Kidnapping) (Episode 6)

18
00:00:43,382 --> 00:00:44,827
I want three billion

19
00:00:44,847 --> 00:00:46,329
(Counterattack begins three billion escape plan)

20
00:00:46,342 --> 00:00:47,478
listen

21
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:50,174
I hope Xiao Lin is safe and sound

22
00:00:50,232 --> 00:00:54,152
Immediately convert Nanase Mamoru's property into cash

23
00:00:54,164 --> 00:00:55,060
This is...

24
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,149
It's a lie

25
00:00:58,247 --> 00:01:00,980
Miss Xiaolin is dead

26
00:01:01,301 --> 00:01:03,301
Don't make prank calls

27
00:01:03,394 --> 00:01:05,177
She's still alive

28
00:01:05,218 --> 00:01:08,629
This number was also told to me by Xiao Lin.

29
00:01:22,468 --> 00:01:24,323
Lawyer Yamazaki

30
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,815
It’s been a while since there was news of my death.

31
00:01:28,836 --> 00:01:31,228
Is it Uncle Tomio's idea?

32
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:34,865
This call is not for ransom.

33
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:39,540
If the public knew I was still alive

34
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,732
Great uncle Tomio is in danger.

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,774
can you help me

36
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:49,890
I can only ask you for help

37
00:01:53,205 --> 00:01:55,773
It seems you don't know anything

38
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,093
I...

39
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,911
He's Tomio's son

40
00:02:02,645 --> 00:02:05,594
In other words, if you die

41
00:02:05,615 --> 00:02:08,255
The Nanase family property will belong to my father

42
00:02:08,451 --> 00:02:11,307
In the end, I will inherit

43
00:02:12,825 --> 00:02:14,742
What a pity

44
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,159
finally fixed

45
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:35,450
Why is there a sudden power outage?

46
00:02:46,037 --> 00:02:47,684
I can't do it anymore

47
00:02:48,314 --> 00:02:50,252
Really useless

48
00:02:51,656 --> 00:02:54,379
Has the electricity been repaired?

49
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:55,996
Do you want to work out together?

50
00:02:55,996 --> 00:02:59,016
Hello...

51
00:03:01,102 --> 00:03:04,227
I didn’t expect that he was Uncle Fuxiong’s son

52
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:05,618
No problem?

53
00:03:05,835 --> 00:03:08,260
If he tells us, it'll be over

54
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,551
yes

55
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:12,201
Must find other allies

56
00:03:12,201 --> 00:03:15,093
Allies...we are surrounded by enemies.

57
00:03:15,124 --> 00:03:17,217
The enemy also has a share

58
00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:19,711
Have you heard this sentence?

59
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:23,867
The enemy of my enemy is my friend

60
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:49,810
I went through Nanase's house

61
00:03:50,223 --> 00:03:52,966
I didn’t see anything that looked like an ingredient list

62
00:03:55,103 --> 00:03:57,103
By the way, about Xiaolin

63
00:03:57,279 --> 00:04:00,022
I'm taking her to Singapore on the weekend

64
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:03,948
Investors want to see research results

65
00:04:03,948 --> 00:04:07,093
This research is what I found

66
00:04:07,226 --> 00:04:09,734
- She should be left to me... - It doesn't matter who finds it.

67
00:04:10,915 --> 00:04:14,126
Your investment amount is one billion, right?

68
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:17,568
The amount we expect to invest is dozens of times yours.

69
00:04:17,622 --> 00:04:19,351
The control is in my hands

70
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:23,463
If you are unhappy, quit this project

71
00:04:25,926 --> 00:04:27,578
in your eyes

72
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:31,029
Is this research all about money?

73
00:04:35,652 --> 00:04:38,607
Things that don't make money are worthless

74
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:41,133
Whether adults or children

75
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:44,705
If it has no value, it is useless

76
00:04:50,686 --> 00:04:52,781
- It's non-flammable - It's not flammable...

77
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:55,373
But it has a plastic logo on it...

78
00:04:56,013 --> 00:04:58,581
There are plastic signs that should be recycled...

79
00:05:06,393 --> 00:05:08,158
Jurisdiction's Quiet Spot

80
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,376
Trash is not allowed to talk

81
00:05:12,475 --> 00:05:16,670
The katana weapon used in the murder of Chief Nanase Mori

82
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:18,852
Matsuda's fingerprints have been detected

83
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:22,241
Next, Matsuda will be arrested for the second time.

84
00:05:22,297 --> 00:05:25,214
Search the work of Rin Nanase and Masamune Shinjo

85
00:05:25,214 --> 00:05:26,783
forced by status quo

86
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:29,964
Staffing will be reduced

87
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:31,697
yes

88
00:05:41,663 --> 00:05:43,621
Is this the case closed?

89
00:05:43,621 --> 00:05:46,163
As a result we did nothing

90
00:05:46,163 --> 00:05:49,464
The only thing I do is take out the trash for a class

91
00:05:49,464 --> 00:05:51,659
Shhh they will hear

92
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:52,917
So what

93
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,906
(Nanase’s household registration records show adoption in 1996) What happened to this note?

94
00:06:06,923 --> 00:06:08,273
Explain briefly

95
00:06:08,406 --> 00:06:11,219
That’s the deceased, Mr. Nanase Mamoru

96
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:13,989
In fact, he is the adopted son of former dean Nanase Eisaku.

97
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,065
This has nothing to do with the case, right?

98
00:06:18,101 --> 00:06:22,106
It stands to reason that this is the case, so I didn’t delve into the search lesson.

99
00:06:22,613 --> 00:06:24,480
so strange

100
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:31,161
Matsuda was the child who accidentally injured Nanase Eisaku thirty years ago.

101
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:36,749
The correct time is 1995

102
00:06:36,749 --> 00:06:38,661
But that note

103
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:41,341
But he said that Mamoru became an adopted son...

104
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:44,475
How could it be that in 1996...

105
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:49,461
The year of the accident

106
00:06:49,483 --> 00:06:52,395
Mamoru hasn't entered Nanase's house yet

107
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:56,254
If so...

108
00:06:59,865 --> 00:07:01,623
Notify emergency room

109
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:04,831
Which nurse, please go get a lot of gauze

110
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:08,480
Who was the child scratched by Matsuda at that time?

111
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:27,062
Wow, my stomach hurts so much

112
00:07:27,062 --> 00:07:29,011
Sorry Dr. Mizuhara

113
00:07:29,953 --> 00:07:32,918
Do you have any gastrointestinal medicine?

114
00:07:32,956 --> 00:07:35,419
It's happened before, right?

115
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,975
besides...

116
00:07:37,318 --> 00:07:39,126
We have something to talk to you about

117
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,808
it hurts...

118
00:07:42,857 --> 00:07:45,809
When I borrowed your mobile phone before

119
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:47,592
I've seen what's inside

120
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:52,565
So I know about your son

121
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:09,427
I heard he had a car accident when he was a child

122
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,954
Never regained consciousness

123
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,407
Vegetative state due to severe brain injury

124
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:19,525
But if I could use my father's medicine

125
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:23,790
There will be a chance to restore brain function and consciousness

126
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:26,417
you are for him

127
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:28,829
Will you support this research?

128
00:08:32,227 --> 00:08:36,313
This is the only way to save him

129
00:08:36,478 --> 00:08:39,537
Really? You tell me that I am the light of hope

130
00:08:39,537 --> 00:08:42,449
It turns out he was just trying to save his child

131
00:08:42,714 --> 00:08:44,876
Got me into a lot of trouble

132
00:08:44,896 --> 00:08:47,072
Hey Xiaolin, don’t be so direct

133
00:08:47,072 --> 00:08:48,409
No?

134
00:08:49,415 --> 00:08:50,772
I...

135
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,786
Want to get him back to normal

136
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,827
See him smile again

137
00:09:00,027 --> 00:09:01,339
run

138
00:09:03,021 --> 00:09:04,838
call me

139
00:09:06,565 --> 00:09:08,871
For this I am willing to do whatever it takes

140
00:09:09,658 --> 00:09:11,543
Isn't this okay?

141
00:09:11,696 --> 00:09:12,894
No

142
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,225
No

143
00:09:15,531 --> 00:09:17,554
I can feel it very much

144
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:21,564
But if the ingredient list is obtained by Z Capitals,

145
00:09:21,564 --> 00:09:23,465
You are of no use anymore

146
00:09:23,626 --> 00:09:25,668
You can't save the child that way

147
00:09:25,668 --> 00:09:27,237
- No way... - So

148
00:09:27,512 --> 00:09:28,988
Do you want to cooperate?

149
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,524
The one that's hindering us now

150
00:09:34,544 --> 00:09:37,705
It’s Z Capitals, right?

151
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:41,617
The enemy of my enemy is my friend

152
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:21,479
what happen

153
00:10:21,674 --> 00:10:24,414
An unknown person called me this morning

154
00:10:24,414 --> 00:10:28,102
Say that the eldest lady is still alive if you don’t want to be exposed

155
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,764
Prepare a ransom of three billion

156
00:10:29,816 --> 00:10:32,913
What a joke...

157
00:10:32,934 --> 00:10:35,385
How dare you ask for three billion?

158
00:10:35,425 --> 00:10:37,257
He said he would call me again

159
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:39,214
Really? Who would do such a thing?

160
00:10:39,242 --> 00:10:41,758
I just wanted to ask you

161
00:10:41,871 --> 00:10:47,192
Isn’t Xiaolin in your hands?

162
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:48,328
Vice Chairman

163
00:10:48,328 --> 00:10:51,908
As a result, what are we doing now?

164
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:54,276
Did the prisoner call you?

165
00:10:54,327 --> 00:10:55,194
Yes

166
00:10:55,194 --> 00:10:57,257
What kind of person does the voice sound like?

167
00:10:57,257 --> 00:11:00,701
I know it's the male kidnapper?

168
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,814
Call my inmate...

169
00:11:04,593 --> 00:11:06,911
It's Shinjo Masamune...

170
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:10,790
in other words

171
00:11:11,055 --> 00:11:15,379
If you die, the Nanase family property will belong to my father.

172
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:18,188
In the end, I will inherit

173
00:11:20,737 --> 00:11:22,584
What a pity

174
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,753
Then you still want to believe it?

175
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:30,219
Is this me?

176
00:11:34,788 --> 00:11:37,066
I was born by my mistress

177
00:11:37,547 --> 00:11:39,725
Always concealed identity

178
00:11:39,763 --> 00:11:42,344
follow father's instructions

179
00:11:43,543 --> 00:11:46,188
I work for the Nanase family

180
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,965
It was also because my father wanted to seize the family property.

181
00:11:47,988 --> 00:11:51,036
Ordered me to find out what happened to Dean Amomo

182
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,767
I want to get my father's approval

183
00:11:58,906 --> 00:12:00,466
However

184
00:12:01,286 --> 00:12:04,879
He only thinks about money and fame

185
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,055
Same thing when you were kidnapped

186
00:12:07,055 --> 00:12:10,003
It belongs to me

187
00:12:11,151 --> 00:12:12,973
do you know

188
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,936
The photo that broke the news on the Internet

189
00:12:16,731 --> 00:12:18,884
The person who originally sold it to the media

190
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,654
That's my father

191
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:22,687
What

192
00:12:23,255 --> 00:12:25,255
for him

193
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:29,292
I'm just a convenient tool to make money

194
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,685
That's right

195
00:12:38,213 --> 00:12:40,063
I'm done

196
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,818
lawyer

197
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,703
Your situation is a bit similar to mine

198
00:12:56,227 --> 00:12:58,509
Glad to hear you're okay

199
00:13:01,217 --> 00:13:04,751
Please feel free to order me

200
00:13:04,928 --> 00:13:06,692
Miss

201
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,284
Call me prisoner...

202
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,522
It's Shinjo Masamune...

203
00:13:13,463 --> 00:13:15,463
people other than

204
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:20,885
The other person’s voice is female

205
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:23,479
Isn't it Xinzhuang?

206
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:25,730
It’s a female voice with a very calm tone.

207
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,726
Is this true? If you dare to lie to me...

208
00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:29,309
Why should I lie to you?

209
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:32,119
I just wonder if it was you who did it

210
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:34,966
In order to extort three billion from the vice chairman

211
00:13:37,363 --> 00:13:39,495
you bastard

212
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,083
It's a joke, but I will deal with it immediately

213
00:13:43,206 --> 00:13:46,432
Ask me about the kidnapper on my hands

214
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:51,308
How could things change like this?

215
00:13:51,352 --> 00:13:53,484
I'll check it out too

216
00:13:58,818 --> 00:14:00,419
he left now

217
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:02,333
Everything goes according to plan

218
00:14:02,377 --> 00:14:03,707
knew

219
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,421
Seems to be temporarily hooked

220
00:14:07,421 --> 00:14:10,223
But asking for three billion is too much

221
00:14:10,232 --> 00:14:12,453
That's the deposit in my father's account

222
00:14:12,453 --> 00:14:15,247
I was supposed to inherit it

223
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,878
What's more important is the next development

224
00:14:17,878 --> 00:14:19,334
I know

225
00:14:30,284 --> 00:14:32,915
Why did you bring a large number of people when you came back...

226
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:37,208
Just now a woman claiming to be a kidnapper called to threaten me

227
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,663
Is he your accomplice?

228
00:14:38,892 --> 00:14:41,915
Who is that woman? Did you instigate her?

229
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:43,142
How can I...

230
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:48,096
I'm locked here by you

231
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:49,564
How to instruct her?

232
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,357
my mobile phone

233
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:59,579
He put it here when he got medicine from me in the morning.

234
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,331
Did you contact me at that time?

235
00:15:01,331 --> 00:15:02,326
Who did he call?

236
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,818
The record was deleted

237
00:15:03,818 --> 00:15:05,501
Who did you call?

238
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:10,327
I didn’t press it and it’s no use to me.

239
00:15:10,617 --> 00:15:12,309
There is no such person

240
00:15:16,606 --> 00:15:19,589
who is your accomplice

241
00:15:22,244 --> 00:15:24,610
Why haven't you said it must be that aunt?

242
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:26,168
-Aunt? -Shiori

243
00:15:26,168 --> 00:15:27,920
His wife who is separated from him

244
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,964
-Hello-his wife?

245
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,154
It was also the aunt who originally planned to kidnap me.

246
00:15:33,172 --> 00:15:35,137
To raise money for my daughter’s surgery

247
00:15:35,155 --> 00:15:37,481
That aunt planned everything and Masamune just did it

248
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:39,488
Stop talking, Xi Li is not wrong

249
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:41,107
-It's all me... -I'm trying to be strong again

250
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,703
Would you rather die yourself?

251
00:15:42,703 --> 00:15:44,864
Don't say any more...

252
00:15:44,864 --> 00:15:46,091
enough

253
00:15:47,795 --> 00:15:50,278
Shut up

254
00:15:50,788 --> 00:15:52,239
all in all

255
00:15:53,224 --> 00:15:56,195
Was that the woman who made the threatening phone call?

256
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:58,846
It has nothing to do with Xi Li

257
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:01,513
Don't go to her

258
00:16:01,601 --> 00:16:02,892
certainly

259
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,262
I won't take her seriously

260
00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:07,038
but

261
00:16:07,408 --> 00:16:11,357
I won't let go of people who dare to play tricks on me

262
00:16:22,174 --> 00:16:23,380
Drag them away and lock them up

263
00:16:23,407 --> 00:16:24,619
yes

264
00:16:26,131 --> 00:16:27,499
come over

265
00:16:31,037 --> 00:16:33,037
Be quiet

266
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:35,637
go in

267
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,649
Hello

268
00:16:42,027 --> 00:16:45,209
I asked directly thirty years ago

269
00:16:45,288 --> 00:16:47,695
Who was the child that Matsuda accidentally injured?

270
00:16:58,126 --> 00:16:59,355
actually

271
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,318
There's one thing we were given a gag order on.

272
00:17:07,146 --> 00:17:10,261
Just before Mr. Matsuda committed the crime

273
00:17:10,535 --> 00:17:12,811
Just finished an operation

274
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:18,323
The patient in that surgery

275
00:17:18,634 --> 00:17:21,967
are HIV infected

276
00:17:22,774 --> 00:17:25,972
He used the scalpel that was used at that time...

277
00:17:34,517 --> 00:17:36,480
scratch child

278
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,424
What's that child's name?

279
00:17:42,332 --> 00:17:44,109
I remember it was...

280
00:17:46,401 --> 00:17:47,922
Shi...

281
00:17:49,114 --> 00:17:51,132
-Shi... -Shiori?

282
00:17:53,314 --> 00:17:56,300
That's right, it's Shiori

283
00:17:59,895 --> 00:18:01,932
Don't move

284
00:18:02,427 --> 00:18:06,547
Xili, you don’t have to be afraid

285
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,469
Give me gauze quickly

286
00:18:15,055 --> 00:18:17,166
Miss Xinzhuang Xili

287
00:18:17,404 --> 00:18:20,061
Signature confirmed

288
00:18:20,335 --> 00:18:24,181
This is the copy of the surgery consent form

289
00:18:24,255 --> 00:18:27,185
Sorry for making you worry

290
00:18:27,332 --> 00:18:29,106
I never thought something would happen to Dr. Tagawa

291
00:18:29,129 --> 00:18:32,937
I heard...the murderer is from the security company

292
00:18:33,524 --> 00:18:37,332
Yeah I still can't believe it

293
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:40,279
Because he is really kind

294
00:18:40,793 --> 00:18:45,539
However, Budsheng's surgery will be carried out on time.

295
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,566
Sorry for bothering you

296

Sunouchi-senpai found information about Shiori

298
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:14,962
She and Xinzhuang stayed in the same kindergarten

299
00:19:15,004 --> 00:19:17,449
Well done Kitamura

300
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:20,018

The pastor seems not to be here today

307
00:19:39,944 --> 00:19:42,741
But people from Xinzhuang Xili are inside

308
00:20:17,911 --> 00:20:19,439
Are you praying?

309
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:28,311
My daughter is about to have surgery

310
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,061
Wish her all the best

311
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:35,741
when you were a child

312
00:20:35,824 --> 00:20:38,977
You and Xinzhuang both grew up here, right?

313
00:20:39,268 --> 00:20:42,137
I also checked about the incident thirty years ago

314
00:20:42,525 --> 00:20:46,205
You were once the adopted daughter of the Nanase family

315
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,944
Can you tell us the details?

316
00:20:54,984 --> 00:20:57,067
What do you want to know

317
00:20:58,232 --> 00:21:01,482
is to terminate the adoption

318
00:21:01,815 --> 00:21:03,607
still...

319
00:21:14,515 --> 00:21:16,486
Sure enough

320
00:21:16,544 --> 00:21:20,838
It was you who was accidentally injured by Matsuda thirty years ago.

322
00:21:29,806 --> 00:21:31,683
Can't come here

Notify emergency room

326
00:21:53,442 --> 00:21:56,473
I didn't shed a single tear then

327
00:21:58,247 --> 00:22:00,808
I'm afraid I'll be abandoned if I cry

328
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,966
After treating the wound, I did a lot of checks

329
00:22:10,952 --> 00:22:15,839
Found out I was HIV positive

330
00:22:16,718 --> 00:22:20,134
It took half a year to be discharged from the hospital

331
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:23,806
But

332
00:22:24,616 --> 00:22:26,854
i see a stranger

333
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:29,659

334
00:22:30,948 --> 00:22:35,055

After Mr. Nanase Eisaku canceled your adoption

338
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:51,541
Should we adopt Mr. Mamoru as our adopted son?

339
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,921
I let him down

340
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,205
Not for my father...

341
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:02,480

342

To speak plainly

346
00:23:18,477 --> 00:23:22,111
It is the study of using artificial intelligence to create geniuses.

347
00:23:25,902 --> 00:23:27,538
Artificial genius?

348
00:23:27,538 --> 00:23:29,796
She is not an ordinary eight-year-old child

349
00:23:29,811 --> 00:23:32,235
Proficient in more than 20 languages

350
00:23:32,235 --> 00:23:34,876
He is the youngest child in the country to join Mensa

351
00:23:34,876 --> 00:23:37,755
It's not an existence we can imagine

352
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:46,137
After Matsuda accidentally hurt you thirty years ago

353
00:23:46,137 --> 00:23:48,442
What is your relationship?

354
00:23:49,685 --> 00:23:53,762
Mr. Matsuda feels very guilty for me

355
00:23:55,749 --> 00:23:57,932
Until I go out into society

356
00:23:57,977 --> 00:24:00,735
Keep giving me money to support me

357
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:04,312
Have you kept in touch since then?

358
00:24:08,103 --> 00:24:10,755
Since I can support myself

359
00:24:10,755 --> 00:24:12,602
They gradually became alienated

360
00:24:14,164 --> 00:24:17,422
Later I met again in Xinzhuang

361
00:24:17,468 --> 00:24:20,873
Married and had a child

362

363
00:24:23,591 --> 00:24:28,340

Abandon everything and run away from home

00:24:59,015 --> 00:25:01,771
(True medicine lies in a kind heart)

373
00:25:16,068 --> 00:25:18,517
You must buy a high-end racket to play tennis...

374
00:25:18,563 --> 00:25:21,217
- it's important - yeah

375
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,948
It's great that the operation went smoothly and successfully.

376
00:25:27,001 --> 00:25:28,509
thank you doctor

377
00:25:29,335 --> 00:25:31,400
Very smooth...

378
00:25:37,581 --> 00:25:40,437
It was then that we met again after a long absence

379
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,588
I'm really sorry

380
00:25:56,106 --> 00:25:57,345
I...

381
00:25:59,384 --> 00:26:01,775
How can I make it up to you

382
00:26:01,775 --> 00:26:03,358
Mr. Matsuda said

383
00:26:03,423 --> 00:26:07,182
He has to pay all the medical bills for me

384
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:10,731
Matsuda testified

385
00:26:10,873 --> 00:26:14,532
He killed Dean Nanase Mamoru on July 8

386
00:26:15,732 --> 00:26:18,131
Did he contact you during that time?

387
00:26:18,673 --> 00:26:20,827
Not at all

388
00:26:21,924 --> 00:26:26,342
Although he would send money regularly

389
00:26:26,381 --> 00:26:28,381
But we never contacted

390
00:26:32,394 --> 00:26:35,011
thank you today

391
00:26:36,431 --> 00:26:40,813
The investigation may ask you again later.

392
00:26:40,852 --> 00:26:42,930
I won’t bother you again then

393
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,900
Treatment must be very hard

394
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,201
come on

395
00:26:49,214 --> 00:26:50,940
Thank you

396
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,487
Won't say goodbye

397
00:26:53,855 --> 00:26:56,671
Right

398
00:26:57,213 --> 00:26:59,303
We just said goodbye to Xinzhuang Xili

399
00:26:59,711 --> 00:27:02,527
Well, I'll leave it to you then.

400
00:27:12,684 --> 00:27:15,875
She didn't ask about Xinzhuang's life or death at all.

401
00:27:17,346 --> 00:27:19,698
Normal people should care

402
00:27:20,537 --> 00:27:23,605
Was Xinzhuang rescued after falling into the sea?

403
00:27:31,206 --> 00:27:33,025
The toilet seems broken

404
00:27:33,025 --> 00:27:34,498
can you go and fix it

405
00:27:35,582 --> 00:27:37,725
Hurry up, I can't stand it anymore

406
00:27:53,635 --> 00:27:56,260
Are you still alive, Masamune?

407
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:00,400
good

408
00:28:00,426 --> 00:28:03,951
I'm more worried about whether Xili will be in danger

409
00:28:04,428 --> 00:28:06,827
She should also suffer a little bit.

410
00:28:06,827 --> 00:28:07,675
Hello

411
00:28:07,675 --> 00:28:09,180
Just kidding

412
00:28:09,206 --> 00:28:12,737
If the police are monitoring aunt

413
00:28:12,737 --> 00:28:14,969
Fuzhu can't take action either

414
00:28:14,969 --> 00:28:16,461
I see

415
00:28:17,016 --> 00:28:18,729
Police?

416
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:23,651
But the case is apparently closed

417
00:28:23,651 --> 00:28:26,191
The police may stop following the prisoner

418
00:28:26,294 --> 00:28:29,619
Hey, what should she do?

419
00:28:29,657 --> 00:28:32,326
If the police were smart enough

420
00:28:32,326 --> 00:28:35,664
She should still be watching her now.

421
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:37,802
That's true

422
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:42,973
There is a smart policeman

423
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,465
it's her

424
00:28:49,181 --> 00:28:50,924
That woman?

425
00:29:04,499 --> 00:29:06,345
She is back at the company

426
00:29:06,358 --> 00:29:08,981
Got it, keep following

427
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:17,649
There is a note

428
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:21,083
Forget it, keep monitoring her

429
00:29:24,994 --> 00:29:25,821
Hello

430
00:29:25,821 --> 00:29:28,352
The kidnapper just sent me a message

431
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:33,722
"I'll give you instructions in thirty minutes."

432
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,772
Only this sentence?

433
00:29:35,772 --> 00:29:36,833
right

434
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:40,029
It was sent via a foreign network and the source cannot be found.

435
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:44,816
We'll be there in thirty minutes

436
00:29:52,848 --> 00:29:54,848
(number not shown)

437
00:29:55,222 --> 00:29:57,002
I'm Yamazaki

438
00:29:57,531 --> 00:30:00,321
Is everyone here?

439
00:30:01,186 --> 00:30:02,521
that...

440
00:30:02,521 --> 00:30:04,886
Yes, everything is here

441
00:30:04,963 --> 00:30:07,765
Next I will specify the place and time

442
00:30:07,817 --> 00:30:10,529
and how to pay the ransom

443
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:13,137
Prepare 30 liter garbage bags

444
00:30:13,183 --> 00:30:18,190
Filled with 10,000 banknotes totaling 150 million yen

445
00:30:18,242 --> 00:30:19,957
Twenty packs in total

446
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:23,985
The total amount is three billion

447
00:30:25,378 --> 00:30:29,968
Walking through the narrow alleys of the Nogawa area

448
00:30:30,212 --> 00:30:33,921
There are five garbage collection sites along the road

449
00:30:34,089 --> 00:30:37,561
Put four packs at each point

450
00:30:37,664 --> 00:30:41,282
The time is midnight tonight

451
00:30:41,401 --> 00:30:42,319
tonight?

452
00:30:42,336 --> 00:30:45,378
I can't prepare three billion so quickly

453
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:47,540
that's your business

454
00:30:49,219 --> 00:30:51,219
Feed the kidnappers

455
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:53,930
Stop continuing this farce

456
00:30:53,956 --> 00:30:55,802
You said before

457
00:30:55,815 --> 00:31:00,872
If Rin Nanase is still alive and doesn’t want to be exposed, he has to pay.

458
00:31:00,994 --> 00:31:04,357
Please announce it if you want to.

459
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:07,905
It's good news that the child is still alive.

460
00:31:07,905 --> 00:31:10,410
We have no reason to pay

461
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,129
In short, this bullshit deal

462
00:31:14,129 --> 00:31:16,375
It was not true from the beginning

463
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:19,652
I'll send you the link

464
00:31:21,473 --> 00:31:24,187
I received the link and this is it

465
00:31:26,478 --> 00:31:28,962
Xili and his separated wife

466
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:29,710
Hello

467
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,140
His wife?

468
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,593
It was also the aunt who originally planned to kidnap me.

469
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,871
This is...

470
00:31:36,123 --> 00:31:38,660
That aunt planned everything and Masamune just did it

471
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,914
Stop talking

472
00:31:46,586 --> 00:31:49,293
Nanase Rin's uncle

473
00:31:49,293 --> 00:31:51,692
Vice Chairman Tomio Nanase

474
00:31:51,782 --> 00:31:55,385
and the general manager of Z Capitals’ Japanese branch

475
00:31:55,591 --> 00:31:59,533
They teamed up to kidnap Xiao Lin and fabricated the news that she was dead.

476
00:32:00,024 --> 00:32:03,883
All the truth lies with this video

477
00:32:04,064 --> 00:32:08,252
From now on, it is revealed to the whole world

478
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,310
Please make a decision quickly

479
00:32:11,568 --> 00:32:14,404
(Xiao Lin is still alive) Otherwise, the number of viewers will continue to increase.

480
00:32:22,819 --> 00:32:24,185
knew

481
00:32:25,037 --> 00:32:28,864
(Video has been deleted) After confirming that the money has been received at midnight tonight

482
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,864
I'll give you more news

483
00:32:39,472 --> 00:32:41,614
what to do now

484
00:32:41,897 --> 00:32:44,544
I left it to you to do something, and it turned out like this

485
00:32:44,815 --> 00:32:46,815
How to clean up now

486
00:32:46,815 --> 00:32:49,227
Vice Chairman, please calm down first, let's...

487
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:52,275
Look, this is none of my business.

488
00:32:52,275 --> 00:32:55,854
You did everything on your own initiative

489
00:32:55,957 --> 00:32:59,408
Don't have anything to do with me

490
00:32:59,441 --> 00:33:00,561
Did you hear that?

491
00:33:01,786 --> 00:33:04,089
What a waste

492
00:33:04,089 --> 00:33:06,422
I'm very busy and have to go back

493
00:33:06,422 --> 00:33:08,677
There are piano lessons today...

494
00:33:11,964 --> 00:33:14,380
Tell you to calm down

495
00:33:14,571 --> 00:33:16,075
listen to me

496
00:33:16,107 --> 00:33:18,996
we are all in the same boat

497
00:33:19,093 --> 00:33:23,119
How can I let you escape alone now?

498
00:33:25,684 --> 00:33:27,922
Leave it to me

499
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:30,048
That arrogant kidnapper

500
00:33:30,284 --> 00:33:32,546
I'll make him die ugly

501
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:53,087
Ito-senpai, Maki-senpai, have a sip of tea.

502
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:56,448
Thank you for your hard work...

503
00:33:56,448 --> 00:33:57,509
Feel sorry

504
00:33:57,509 --> 00:33:59,240
Arrive home at 5:51 pm

505
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,601
-There are rice balls. Please give me rice balls.

506
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,929
Koga, you are so considerate.

507
00:34:03,929 --> 00:34:05,327
Thanks

508
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:07,294
-What kind of kelp is it? -Yes

509
00:34:07,294 --> 00:34:08,183
Thanks

510
00:34:08,183 --> 00:34:10,155
Pinned this morning

511
00:34:10,326 --> 00:34:12,120
what are you doing here

512
00:34:14,133 --> 00:34:16,207
The prisoner is not here for you to have a picnic.

513
00:34:17,624 --> 00:34:19,113
Go back

514
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:22,117
Xinzhuang Xili is also responsible for the first lesson

515
00:34:24,343 --> 00:34:27,043
-Please give me rice balls... -Who wants to eat?

516
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,171
- It's delicious. - What are you talking about?

517
00:34:29,191 --> 00:34:30,758
-One lesson person? -yes

518
00:34:30,758 --> 00:34:32,817
They were actually staring at Xili too

519
00:34:32,817 --> 00:34:35,103
By the way Kitamura

520
00:34:35,103 --> 00:34:37,835
I guess you also encountered a lesson when you traced Matsuda.

521
00:34:37,871 --> 00:34:40,402
-Yeah-How could this happen?

522
00:34:40,432 --> 00:34:42,748
Yes, so strange

523
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:53,892
This is in...

524
00:34:53,907 --> 00:34:57,388
Our company will prepare the ransom, don’t worry

525
00:34:57,403 --> 00:34:59,686
Thank you for your hard work.

526
00:34:59,686 --> 00:35:02,167
Please take a rest

527
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:04,573
Time is coming. Call for more people.

528
00:35:04,722 --> 00:35:06,632
Drink it while it's hot, everyone

529
00:35:09,302 --> 00:35:11,138
And buy grass cakes

530
00:35:11,155 --> 00:35:12,631
What's going on in Xinzhuang?

531
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,951
Did she call during the day?

532
00:35:43,671 --> 00:35:46,594
I have no appetite and brought it to Masamune

533
00:35:51,571 --> 00:35:53,008
Or do you want to try the poison?

534
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,287
Send lunch box

535
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:05,983
box lunch?

536
00:36:17,733 --> 00:36:19,014
Is there still food to eat?

537
00:36:19,031 --> 00:36:20,561
I just feel like it's not enough

538
00:36:20,569 --> 00:36:22,595
thank you that's great thank you

539
00:36:22,595 --> 00:36:24,847
Thank you. You're welcome.

540
00:36:25,425 --> 00:36:26,712
Thank you

541
00:36:41,662 --> 00:36:42,481
Hello

542
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:44,213
It seems that I got the phone successfully

543
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,736
Very good

544
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:48,305
Then proceed as planned

545
00:36:48,382 --> 00:36:49,516
yes

546
00:37:44,156 --> 00:37:46,424
All the cash is put away

547
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:03,430
Coming

548
00:38:04,121 --> 00:38:06,259
The ransom recovery vehicle arrives at location A

549
00:38:08,891 --> 00:38:11,299
A driver got out of the car

550
00:38:12,361 --> 00:38:14,534
Wearing a hat and mask, you can’t see clearly

551
00:38:16,786 --> 00:38:18,786
He carried the money into the car

552
00:38:26,205 --> 00:38:27,961
The target has left location B

553
00:38:28,953 --> 00:38:31,745
The ransom recovery vehicle arrives at location C

554
00:38:31,848 --> 00:38:33,167
Countdown to seconds

555
00:38:33,464 --> 00:38:37,925
Nine hundred and eighty-seven...

556
00:38:38,393 --> 00:38:42,752
six five four...

557
00:38:43,843 --> 00:38:48,851
three two one

558
00:39:01,795 --> 00:39:04,544
There is a fire alarm...

559
00:39:08,185 --> 00:39:10,257
Hey, what's going on?

560
00:39:14,774 --> 00:39:17,743
There is a fire alarm...

561
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:24,231
Who wants to see Xiaolin's room?

562
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,260
Go quickly...

563
00:39:27,304 --> 00:39:29,569
There is a fire alarm...

564
00:39:31,832 --> 00:39:34,574
What's wrong? Push it away.

565
00:39:38,315 --> 00:39:40,733
There is a fire alarm...

566
00:39:44,493 --> 00:39:47,572
There is a fire alarm...

567
00:39:50,837 --> 00:39:52,925
There is a fire alarm...

568
00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:54,959
Push carefully

569
00:40:08,121 --> 00:40:09,720
what's going on

570
00:40:11,361 --> 00:40:12,941
hateful

571
00:40:13,999 --> 00:40:17,268
This is location D. The recycling vehicle turned around the corner.

572
00:40:35,347 --> 00:40:36,745
Let's go

573
00:41:10,277 --> 00:41:11,865
Get off the bus

574
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,324
Come out soon

575
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:30,505
safe

576
00:41:30,705 --> 00:41:32,893
Great, successful

577
00:41:37,646 --> 00:41:39,544
- Come on in. - Okay.

578
00:41:59,073 --> 00:42:00,557
Sure enough

579
00:42:00,571 --> 00:42:03,913
Xinzhuang Xili is just a deception

580
00:42:04,157 --> 00:42:07,484
Calm female voice

581
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:12,081
I should first suspect you who has been beside Xinzhuang all the time.

582
00:42:12,916 --> 00:42:14,472
It doesn't matter

583
00:42:14,673 --> 00:42:17,289
You are still valuable

584
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:21,092
Let me save you before I get the ingredient list.

585
00:42:21,452 --> 00:42:25,100
Xiaolin, of course you have value too

586
00:42:29,379 --> 00:42:31,134
As for you

587
00:42:36,677 --> 00:42:39,055
who do you think you are

588
00:42:39,543 --> 00:42:43,200
What value do you have?

589
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:47,326
I...

590
00:42:47,957 --> 00:42:50,158
is a father

591
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,359
What

592
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:54,917
I am Yasheng's father

593
00:42:55,836 --> 00:42:58,002
He is also Xiaolin’s father

594
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,688
this is me

595
00:43:01,862 --> 00:43:03,231
Father?

596
00:43:03,231 --> 00:43:05,231
What's so ridiculous

597
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:08,415
Xiao Lin doesn’t even bother to ask for it.

598
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:11,521
A guy like you still wants to be her father

599
00:43:11,865 --> 00:43:15,438
you are worthless

600
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:19,878
you are right but

601
00:43:20,503 --> 00:43:22,274
Even if I am like this

602
00:43:23,678 --> 00:43:27,008
It can also divert your attention

603
00:43:33,398 --> 00:43:35,117
-Mr. Xinzhuang-here he comes

604
00:43:41,522 --> 00:43:42,660
get off

605
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:54,609
you...

606
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,877
I remember one more thing

607
00:43:57,375 --> 00:43:59,375
That's my identity

608
00:44:03,637 --> 00:44:05,434
I'm a policeman

609
00:44:05,715 --> 00:44:07,662
I'm the kidnapper you bastard

611
00:44:08,823 --> 00:44:10,505
(Final Chapter) Everything will end today

612
00:44:10,512 --> 00:44:12,403
Come redeem yourself with me

613
00:44:12,403 --> 00:44:14,851
(When all the mysteries are solved...) The case is closed

614
00:44:14,851 --> 00:44:16,851
Then I will let you disappear

615
00:44:16,953 --> 00:44:18,479
Sure enough it's you

616
00:44:18,505 --> 00:44:20,441
(But the real shady story emerged) Save Masamune

617
00:44:20,454 --> 00:44:22,454
Run away, Xiaolin
