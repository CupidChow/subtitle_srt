1
00:00:00,074 --> 00:00:01,993
(I am a kidnapper) My name is Masamune Shinjo

2
00:00:01,993 --> 00:00:04,294
Became a kidnapper for some reason

3
00:00:04,294 --> 00:00:07,824
(Little Rin was kidnapped) The genius girl Nanase Rin was once taken away by a mysterious man

4
00:00:07,824 --> 00:00:11,121
(Fortunately, he was rescued successfully) But with the help of Detective Sunouchi, he was successfully rescued.

5
00:00:11,252 --> 00:00:15,912
It’s possible that the murder didn’t happen on July 8th...

6
00:00:16,014 --> 00:00:18,543
(Did the murder occur on July 7?) It could also be the day before, July 7

7
00:00:18,543 --> 00:00:20,852
I, Rin-chan, and Detective Sunouchi

8
00:00:20,852 --> 00:00:23,531
Although the truth is gradually approaching...

9
00:00:24,044 --> 00:00:25,730
Lieutenant Uchiji Suno

10
00:00:25,756 --> 00:00:28,184
(Detective Detective Sunouchi was arrested) I am arresting you for harboring a suspect.

11
00:00:28,222 --> 00:00:31,648
Xiao Lin and I also faced a cruel fate

12
00:00:31,671 --> 00:00:33,012
-Arrest etc. -Masamune

13
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,070
-Korin -Masamune

14
00:00:35,132 --> 00:00:37,132
Don't go dad

15
00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:39,543
dad...

16
00:00:41,261 --> 00:00:43,160
(The Day of Kidnapping) (Final Episode)

17
00:00:44,142 --> 00:00:46,180
(The final truth on the day of decisive battle) Breaking news

18
00:00:46,217 --> 00:00:49,531
The kidnapping case of Rin Nanase in Kanagawa Prefecture

19
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,649
The police have just arrested the suspect Shinjo Masamune

20
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:55,323
According to the police

21
00:00:55,323 --> 00:01:01,463
Suspect Shinjo sneaked into Nanase's residence where a murder occurred on July 7

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,683
and hide in the house

23
00:01:03,735 --> 00:01:08,175
Later, the police successfully arrested him

24
00:01:08,331 --> 00:01:11,915
The hostage Xiaolin has also been rescued safely

25
00:01:13,056 --> 00:01:18,186
He actually reported the crime to arrest his husband

26
00:01:19,758 --> 00:01:21,858
why do this

27
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:26,164
Xiao Lin was taken away by the police

28
00:01:27,798 --> 00:01:30,292
Just have this, right?

29
00:01:34,248 --> 00:01:36,011
Where is the money?

30
00:01:37,074 --> 00:01:40,732
One billion yuan can be remitted at any time

31
00:01:40,732 --> 00:01:42,234
but

32
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:45,370
I need to confirm the authenticity first

33
00:01:56,095 --> 00:01:58,200
Finally got it

34
00:01:59,342 --> 00:02:01,225
Pay it now

35
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,092
Of course I'm happy

36
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:06,590
(remittance completed)

37
00:02:11,624 --> 00:02:14,300
Deal done

38
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,517
Goodbye, although I probably won’t see you again

39
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:32,009
why are you here

40
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,003
Xiao Lin?

41
00:02:35,078 --> 00:02:37,355
Xiao Lin

42
00:02:37,707 --> 00:02:42,382
I miss you so much. Fortunately you are safe.

43
00:02:42,407 --> 00:02:45,470
My uncle has been worried about you...

44
00:02:45,482 --> 00:02:48,927
Uncle, your acting skills are still as bad as ever

45
00:02:49,082 --> 00:02:51,230
Why are you talking to your uncle like this?

46
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,137
This is your email record

47
00:02:53,193 --> 00:02:55,491
You took advantage of your relationship with county police officials

48
00:02:55,491 --> 00:02:57,735
Tell them to end the search

49
00:02:57,772 --> 00:03:00,461
you misunderstood

50
00:03:00,573 --> 00:03:02,647
How is this possible?

51
00:03:05,575 --> 00:03:08,803
Can you give me a break?

52
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:14,701
After all, we are relatives whose blood is thicker than water.

53
00:03:14,751 --> 00:03:17,596
I don't care about blood uncle

54
00:03:18,868 --> 00:03:22,872
I will only protect the people who really matter

55
00:03:27,681 --> 00:03:31,625
I really can't believe it

56
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:34,879
You are actually on the same team as the kidnappers

57
00:03:34,907 --> 00:03:36,629
Not so

58
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,915
Report that Manager Qin is here

59
00:03:39,948 --> 00:03:41,099
Qin

60
00:03:41,193 --> 00:03:43,422
You came just in time

61
00:03:43,422 --> 00:03:48,552
Please send this illegal man to the disciplinary committee

62
00:03:49,123 --> 00:03:50,767
Qin listen to me...

63
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:52,771
Please come with me

64
00:03:53,095 --> 00:03:55,095
Minister of Criminal Affairs, Tatsuoka

65
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,888
Actually, I received information that Xiao Lin’s relatives

66
00:04:00,888 --> 00:04:04,430
County police officials were asked to release water during the investigation

67
00:04:04,499 --> 00:04:09,213
One of the cadres is you

68
00:04:10,402 --> 00:04:11,900
What nonsense are you talking about?

69
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,320
more than that

70
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,129
You also obstructed the Sunuchi Police Department's follow-up search.

71
00:04:17,198 --> 00:04:20,872
He is a witness to delay the solution of the case.

72
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:24,884
I was instructed by the Minister of Criminal Affairs, Tatsuoka

73
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,976
The internal police department responsible for surveillance shall

74
00:04:29,246 --> 00:04:30,680
You guy...

75
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:32,701
Go to headquarters and explain it clearly.

76
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,486
take away

77
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,197
please follow us

78
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:37,732
Let's go

79
00:04:42,672 --> 00:04:44,382
Mu, are you feeling better?

80
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:45,658
he's fine

81
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:46,955
My throat just feels uncomfortable

82
00:04:46,955 --> 00:04:48,767
Who is she, Sunouchi?

83
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,669
She, she is my consultant

84
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:53,310
consultant?

85
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,460
The eldest lady seems to have remembered what happened on the day of the crime.

86
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,087
But memory cannot be used as evidence

87
00:04:59,087 --> 00:05:01,625
Still need a trump card

88
00:05:02,061 --> 00:05:04,061
We don't have time. Let's search more quickly.

89
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:05,027
yes

90
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:06,552
Xiao Lin

91
00:05:12,738 --> 00:05:14,573
Ms. Xinzhuang?

92
00:05:14,573 --> 00:05:16,003
Mother?

93
00:05:16,003 --> 00:05:18,317
How does it look good?

94
00:05:18,877 --> 00:05:24,109
By the way, I'll pay the additional hospitalization fee first.

95
00:05:24,334 --> 00:05:26,706
Let me do the math... give it to you

96
00:05:27,405 --> 00:05:30,470
-Um... -You see, Yasheng has it too

97
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:32,841
Are they silk pajamas?

98
00:05:32,872 --> 00:05:35,239
Great, right?

99
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,300
Where is the bear?

100
00:05:37,651 --> 00:05:39,223
What

101
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:41,051
Dad said

102
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:46,146
He will help me buy bear dolls

103
00:05:52,078 --> 00:05:53,707
it is a pity

104
00:05:53,756 --> 00:05:56,104
Dad can't come

105
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:58,176
Ms. Xinzhuang

106
00:05:58,176 --> 00:06:01,638
Let me tell you where your father is now

107
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,406
(The person in charge of the murder investigation of the hospital director and his wife announced new information)

108
00:06:09,853 --> 00:06:14,454
I heard that there are new suspects in the murder case of the dean and his wife.

109
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:18,235
We can't reveal details but the suspect is confirmed to be a woman.

110
00:06:18,268 --> 00:06:21,686
We are following the memory of Xiao Lin, a witness to the murder

111
00:06:21,737 --> 00:06:25,383
The woman is under investigation

112
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,919
Mom, where are you going?

113
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,443
please wait a moment

114
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:37,914
I'll give you this money back

115
00:06:39,463 --> 00:06:42,780
Besides, I know I'm not qualified to interrupt.

116
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,804
But please stay with her more

117
00:06:47,392 --> 00:06:50,208
Now Yasheng only has you

118
00:06:50,287 --> 00:06:53,887
Don't leave mom

119
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:56,609
I will be good

120
00:06:56,687 --> 00:07:00,151
Please, please take me in too

121
00:07:00,151 --> 00:07:02,370
I can help you with chores and stuff like that

122
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:05,550
Please...

123
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:13,901
Yasheng listen to me

124
00:07:15,705 --> 00:07:18,119
don't trust anyone

125
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:22,926
Believing in others will only harm you

126
00:07:23,554 --> 00:07:25,236
no matter who

127
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:30,701
Even my mother can't believe it

128
00:07:31,132 --> 00:07:33,575
-Mom... -Answer?

129
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,002
yes

130
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:06,490
Now investors are happy, right?

131
00:08:06,524 --> 00:08:07,878
(President)

132
00:08:07,878 --> 00:08:10,195
Coming

133
00:08:10,826 --> 00:08:13,584
celebratory call

134
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:16,075
Hello

135
00:08:16,141 --> 00:08:17,484
where is the recipe

136
00:08:18,663 --> 00:08:20,564
I only saw a few experimental data

137
00:08:20,564 --> 00:08:22,945
I didn’t see any ingredients list of the key medicines.

138
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:25,763
What happened?

139
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:31,839
Don't touch the police at all

140
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,303
Why did you suddenly break in?

141
00:08:36,678 --> 00:08:39,042
Are you Kevin Fukuzumi from Z Capitals?

142
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:41,009
Please come with us to the department

143
00:08:41,557 --> 00:08:43,006
What am I guilty of?

144
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:45,141
Suspected of kidnapping, kidnapping and imprisoning Rin Nanase

145
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:47,704
and violence against Shinjo Masamune.

146

Attempted murder of lawyer Yamazaki Tadashi

147
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:55,266
There is also the crime of stealing an important pendant from a child.

148
00:08:55,297 --> 00:08:56,796
emergency arrest

149
00:08:59,142 --> 00:09:02,583
What are you doing? Help me.

150
00:09:10,254 --> 00:09:12,469
what is that

151
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:20,146
Wait until everything is over

152
00:09:20,196 --> 00:09:22,129
Let's have another drink then

153
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:37,408
alright

154
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,090
-Follow me.-Let's go.

155
00:09:43,739 --> 00:09:46,683
(Kawachu Police Station) Regarding the murder of Mr. Tagawa

156
00:09:46,703 --> 00:09:49,316
Let's check again

157
00:09:51,142 --> 00:09:55,500
We were unable to view the contents of Mr. Tagawa’s mobile phone at that time

158
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:59,238
But the file was successfully repaired later

159
00:09:59,238 --> 00:10:01,760
Found this video inside

160
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:10,524
He probably thought the dean was having an affair with this woman

161
00:10:10,546 --> 00:10:11,885
Only then can I secretly record the video

162
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,195
Have you said enough?

163
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,492
I don't have time to fool around with you

164
00:10:17,689 --> 00:10:21,094
He threatened to take the video to the police

165
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,708
And you to stop him

166
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,454
So he decided to kill people and silence them, right?

167
00:10:26,914 --> 00:10:32,021
In order to prevent Xinzhuang Shiori from becoming the focus of the investigation,

168
00:10:32,152 --> 00:10:34,137
I have no idea

169
00:10:34,312 --> 00:10:37,244
-Mr. Matsuda-I don’t know anything

170
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:44,481
can you help me xinzhuang

I need your help

173
00:10:48,702 --> 00:10:50,965
what can I do

174
00:10:51,491 --> 00:10:55,747
The key figure in this case is indeed Xinzhuang Shiori

175
00:10:56,711 --> 00:11:01,235
Do you still believe her now?

176
00:11:05,028 --> 00:11:07,332
Let’s hear our speculation first

177
00:11:10,093 --> 00:11:12,816
Then you make a decision

178

(Who is the other suspect in the murder case of the hospital director and his wife)

179

187
00:12:23,882 --> 00:12:26,242
I am Shinjo Masamune

188
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,785
Shiori's strength

189
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:31,557
How could you...

190
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:35,066
I've always wanted to talk to you

191
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:38,287
You follow me

192
00:12:39,006 --> 00:12:43,377
It's all because of Shiori that he committed the crime

193
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,240
Me and her

194
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,466
No friendship

195
00:12:49,574 --> 00:12:51,808
i have been thinking

196
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,850
Shiori so far

197
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,550
What are you thinking about?

198
00:12:58,933 --> 00:13:01,459
What kind of life are you living?

199
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:04,214
And that day

200
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,220
July 7th

201
00:13:08,729 --> 00:13:11,165
What did Xili do again?

202
00:13:12,152 --> 00:13:14,295
(Ruoye Hope Children's Home)

203
00:13:20,114 --> 00:13:23,540
He actually planned such a bold plan

204
00:13:23,648 --> 00:13:25,844
Will Xinzhuang Shiri really come?

205
00:13:25,844 --> 00:13:28,080
I can only believe Xiao Lin.

206
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,121
Be prepared

207
00:14:25,453 --> 00:14:27,359
are you ready

208
00:14:29,343 --> 00:14:30,629
yes

209
00:14:32,847 --> 00:14:34,982
Everything will end today

210
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:38,080
This is also for Xiao Lin

211
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,281
Coming...

212
00:14:45,603 --> 00:14:47,349
Xinzhuang Xili is here

213
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,434
She entered from the front door

214
00:14:50,464 --> 00:14:52,300
Approaching the church

215
00:14:57,473 --> 00:14:59,280
Xinzhuang Xili came in

216
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,316
Don't let down your guard

217
00:15:04,331 --> 00:15:06,707
Whenever something happens, attack it

218
00:15:22,998 --> 00:15:27,118
"This is the body of the Lord Jesus Christ which was given for you"

219
00:15:27,448 --> 00:15:28,923
Amen

220
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,927
"This is for you..."

221
00:15:34,954 --> 00:15:36,177
Masamune

222
00:15:36,989 --> 00:15:39,822
what did you pray for just now

223
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:43,358
I hope...

224
00:15:46,454 --> 00:15:48,197
It feels not bad

225
00:15:49,043 --> 00:15:51,245
pray to god

226
00:15:52,158 --> 00:15:54,668
Feeling calm again

227
00:15:54,837 --> 00:15:56,685
Do you want to pray too?

228
00:15:57,971 --> 00:16:01,607
I'm not here with my hands folded to pray

229
00:16:03,401 --> 00:16:07,880
But remind myself that God made me become this angry

230
00:16:10,316 --> 00:16:12,181
but

231
00:16:12,975 --> 00:16:16,408
If you ask me what I want at this moment

232
00:16:18,032 --> 00:16:20,858
Probably hoping to be able to do it as soon as possible

233
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:24,968
Unravel the police’s misunderstanding about me

234
00:16:27,556 --> 00:16:29,539
As expected of you

235
00:16:29,624 --> 00:16:31,981
You know it's a trap but you dare to come here

236
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,980
Tell me what you think of

237
00:16:37,026 --> 00:16:38,484
Want to know?

238
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,890
That's why I came here

239
00:16:41,516 --> 00:16:44,077
Before that I want to ask you

240
00:16:44,602 --> 00:16:47,894
A week before my parents were killed

241
00:16:48,062 --> 00:16:50,405
Have you ever been to my house?

242
00:16:51,014 --> 00:16:52,657
Why

243
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:56,872
That thing

244
00:16:59,055 --> 00:17:03,416
I came here to explain this matter.

245
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:09,152
I just miss my childhood home

246
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:11,208
Want to go and see

247
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:14,086
By the way

248
00:17:14,321 --> 00:17:16,737
Exploring kidnapping routes

249
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:20,275
she admitted

250
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,428
Just kidnapping

251
00:17:23,621 --> 00:17:25,774
Do you want to follow this script?

252
00:17:25,774 --> 00:17:29,009
I wanted to surrender

253
00:17:30,757 --> 00:17:32,577
my crime

254
00:17:33,312 --> 00:17:36,464
He was just leaking information to Masamune, right?

255
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:40,097
I'm willing to atone for this

256
00:17:40,749 --> 00:17:43,587
Do you think you can get away with it by saying this?

257
00:17:44,586 --> 00:17:47,476
It's time to get to the point

258
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:50,478
about what i recall

259
00:17:51,087 --> 00:17:54,294
What did you actually do?

260
00:17:55,749 --> 00:17:58,333
I'll tell you everything now

261
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,299
-The first was three years ago... -Three years ago

262
00:18:03,854 --> 00:18:06,867
Shiri suffers from AIDS

263
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,866
She fell into self-destruction

264
00:18:10,532 --> 00:18:12,643
Abandon our family

265
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:17,884
In her heart at that time

266
00:18:18,675 --> 00:18:21,304
It's full of things that made her look like that

267
00:18:22,497 --> 00:18:25,117
Anger towards the Nanase family

268
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:29,667
So she went to see Dean Nanase Mamoru

269
00:18:30,731 --> 00:18:32,047
and threaten him

270
00:18:32,138 --> 00:18:33,405
let go

271
00:18:34,892 --> 00:18:36,892
she said

272
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,328
Research matters need to be disclosed to the public

273
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:41,401
Didn’t I give you enough money?

274
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:42,965
Enough?

275
00:18:45,232 --> 00:18:47,782
My life has been ruined by you

276
00:18:47,782 --> 00:18:50,399
It’s all because of your father and son’s research

277
00:18:52,176 --> 00:18:54,031
Have you said enough?

278
00:18:54,502 --> 00:18:56,938
I don't have time to fool around with you

279
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:00,109
Can you be so cruel to me?

280
00:19:02,013 --> 00:19:06,029
Dad is starting to think you are a hindrance

281
00:19:06,174 --> 00:19:10,153
At that time, he gradually became impatient with his mother.

282
00:19:10,153 --> 00:19:13,035
Decided to deal with both of you in one go

283
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,158
What an interesting reasoning and then what?

284
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,189
So my father

285
00:19:19,262 --> 00:19:21,262
A few days before the incident, he

286
00:19:21,697 --> 00:19:23,697
call you over

287
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,688
Remove the monitor from your residence

288
00:19:30,065 --> 00:19:32,664
Then on July 7th...

289
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:35,046
Why go to Singapore

290
00:19:35,135 --> 00:19:38,106
Are you going to take Xiao Lin out without telling me again?

291
00:19:38,106 --> 00:19:40,070
This is for research

292
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,426
Research...

293
00:19:44,462 --> 00:19:48,822
You will only accompany Xiaolin and be indifferent to me

294
00:19:50,508 --> 00:19:52,416
What do you think I am?

295
00:19:53,141 --> 00:19:55,068
Why

296
00:20:01,995 --> 00:20:05,577
I will never forgive you. I've had enough.

297
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,263
i want to kill you

298
00:20:09,263 --> 00:20:10,991
Nanase Mamoru

299
00:20:10,991 --> 00:20:14,392
I originally planned to kill my wife

300
00:20:36,203 --> 00:20:38,189
that night

301
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:40,935
He called Xi Li to his home again

302
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:43,120
At that time, the dean...

303
00:20:43,563 --> 00:20:45,878
Avoid police raids

304
00:20:45,907 --> 00:20:49,261
Hiding the key content of the research

305
00:20:49,304 --> 00:20:51,590
Keep it in the most inconspicuous place

306
00:20:53,937 --> 00:20:55,649
during this period

307
00:20:55,649 --> 00:20:59,293
Xiao Lin is still comatose due to the experimental anesthetic.

308
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,903
Shiori also came to Nanase’s house at this time

309
00:21:08,023 --> 00:21:11,224
The settlement money you want is all ready.

310
00:21:15,403 --> 00:21:16,945
Wait me a moment

311
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,270
in hospital

312
00:21:49,544 --> 00:21:52,802
There are rumors going around that we are having an extramarital affair.

313
00:21:54,305 --> 00:21:56,675
You broke into my house

314
00:21:57,063 --> 00:21:59,864
He killed my wife because of a relationship dispute

315
00:22:01,165 --> 00:22:03,051
And I will kill you

316
00:22:03,895 --> 00:22:07,537
This is legitimate defense

317
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,773
The person who killed Nanase Mamoru

318
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,283
It's Shiori

319
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,977
That's right

320
00:22:58,771 --> 00:23:00,637
That's right

321
00:23:02,463 --> 00:23:04,230
later

322
00:23:04,496 --> 00:23:07,112
In order to ask for help, Xi Li

323
00:23:07,162 --> 00:23:09,212
Contacted you

324
00:23:21,618 --> 00:23:22,857
And you...

325
00:23:22,891 --> 00:23:24,288
Miss Shiori

326
00:23:24,412 --> 00:23:28,126
What should Mr. Matsuda do?

327
00:23:28,591 --> 00:23:29,626
I...

328
00:23:29,626 --> 00:23:32,277
You decided to take the blame for her, right?

329
00:23:37,424 --> 00:23:42,476
I...I don't know anything

330
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:45,639
Don't worry

331
00:23:45,988 --> 00:23:49,580
Leave all these matters to me

332
00:23:54,426 --> 00:23:56,426
I...

333
00:23:57,908 --> 00:23:59,492
Don't know anything

334
00:24:07,496 --> 00:24:10,813
Are you planning to bear all the charges alone?

335
00:24:12,945 --> 00:24:16,501
Why are you willing to do so much for Xi Li?

336
00:24:19,908 --> 00:24:22,564
I seem to be able to understand it too

337
00:24:26,815 --> 00:24:28,471
I understand

338
00:24:34,204 --> 00:24:35,816
I understand...

339
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:44,297
So Mr. Matsuda

340
00:24:44,311 --> 00:24:47,385
Decided to take the blame for you

341
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,418
Let’s talk about me next

342
00:24:52,821 --> 00:24:54,542
Just at that time

343
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,650
I quit due to anesthesia

344
00:24:57,802 --> 00:25:00,121
wake up groggily

345
00:25:02,018 --> 00:25:04,281
I saw it then

346
00:25:08,476 --> 00:25:11,371
I thought he killed the person

347
00:25:11,883 --> 00:25:13,869
Actually...

348
00:25:14,284 --> 00:25:16,647
He's wiping your fingerprints

349
00:25:17,243 --> 00:25:19,992
After that I was anxious to escape

350
00:25:31,512 --> 00:25:33,290
Miss Shiori

351
00:25:37,417 --> 00:25:38,914
What happened to her

352
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:40,843
may have been seen

353
00:25:48,085 --> 00:25:49,489
follow me

354
00:26:05,621 --> 00:26:07,139
what are you doing

355
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,193
It would be troublesome if I woke up again

356
00:26:10,248 --> 00:26:12,136
Gotta put her to sleep

357
00:26:21,027 --> 00:26:23,142
sleep well

358
00:26:23,972 --> 00:26:26,416
then forget all this

359
00:26:28,937 --> 00:26:30,826
If you remember

360
00:26:32,016 --> 00:26:34,128
I will kill you

361
00:26:34,751 --> 00:26:38,566
Then I slept the whole day

362
00:26:39,688 --> 00:26:41,688
lost memory

363
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,648
That's awesome. Thank you for your hard work, Xiao Lin.

364
00:26:54,381 --> 00:26:56,534
You are more than smart

365
00:26:56,561 --> 00:26:58,812
He also has a talent for handling cases.

366
00:26:59,491 --> 00:27:01,449
But I've heard enough

367
00:27:02,017 --> 00:27:04,017
This is all your fantasy

368
00:27:04,072 --> 00:27:06,265
fantasy? How to say?

369
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:08,099
Did I remember it wrong?

370
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:09,959
There's no use setting a trap

371
00:27:09,987 --> 00:27:11,724
Fantasy is fantasy

372
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:15,966
What a waste of time

373
00:27:15,994 --> 00:27:17,457
goodbye

374
00:27:17,997 --> 00:27:19,415
By the way, auntie

375
00:27:19,442 --> 00:27:21,456
I've always wanted to ask you

376
00:27:21,484 --> 00:27:23,358
Why challenge Masamune?

377
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,854
You used Matsuda to get revenge on the past

378
00:27:28,868 --> 00:27:32,055
But why bring Masamune into this?

379
00:27:32,082 --> 00:27:33,527
did he do something

380
00:27:35,812 --> 00:27:37,618
Want to know?

381
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,940
Your grandfather thirty years ago

382
00:27:44,452 --> 00:27:47,306
Originally I wanted to adopt Masamune

383
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,238
But it was me who was chosen in the end

384
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:56,313
I was happy not long ago

385
00:27:57,746 --> 00:28:00,191
Then the hellish days began

386
00:28:02,627 --> 00:28:06,071
Do terrible experiments every day

387
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:08,246
Finally encountered this kind of thing

388
00:28:08,503 --> 00:28:10,014
These

389
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:13,219
Originally, it was all Masamune's fault.

390
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,210
But I took the responsibility

391
00:28:16,281 --> 00:28:18,641
So he should pay the price

392
00:28:18,677 --> 00:28:21,356
Do you want to blame him for all your misfortunes?

393
00:28:21,426 --> 00:28:23,391
He is completely different from you

394
00:28:23,391 --> 00:28:25,250
always optimistic

395
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,716
Happy for Yasheng to finish the surgery successfully

396
00:28:27,716 --> 00:28:29,505
I'm glad you're safe and sound

397
00:28:29,505 --> 00:28:31,936
happy that i can come home

398
00:28:32,123 --> 00:28:34,194
But you want him to pay the price?

399
00:28:34,217 --> 00:28:36,555
He obviously did nothing wrong

400
00:28:37,545 --> 00:28:39,545
Is he not wrong?

401
00:28:42,261 --> 00:28:44,062
What about me?

402
00:28:46,172 --> 00:28:48,125
What did I do wrong again?

403
00:28:50,247 --> 00:28:52,330
what did i do wrong

404
00:28:52,376 --> 00:28:54,877
I deserve to be sick and live in such pain

405
00:28:55,212 --> 00:28:56,467
Sunouchi-senpai

406
00:28:56,946 --> 00:28:57,910
not yet

407
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,092
Have blood drawn every day

408
00:29:00,475 --> 00:29:02,651
Open the skull for surgery

409
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,083
Be patient, be patient, be patient

410
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:07,201
I know because I am too

411
00:29:07,857 --> 00:29:10,818
It hurts longer than you

412
00:29:10,941 --> 00:29:13,117
How can it be the same

413
00:29:15,269 --> 00:29:18,005
Your pain has been rewarded accordingly

414
00:29:18,098 --> 00:29:21,765
Live in a mansion and have decent parents

415
00:29:22,667 --> 00:29:25,969
Being praised by everyone and held in the palm of your hand

416
00:29:26,113 --> 00:29:27,704
but me

417
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,588
i have nothing

418
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,888
Everything was taken away by your father and you

419
00:29:33,888 --> 00:29:35,847
snatched from my hand

420
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:40,371
Damn it, enough is enough. I don't want to endure it anymore.

421
00:29:41,836 --> 00:29:44,480
What else can I do

422
00:29:46,068 --> 00:29:47,716
I'm only one person

423
00:29:47,726 --> 00:29:49,822
You can only protect yourself

424
00:29:49,987 --> 00:29:51,332
What's the result?

425
00:29:51,363 --> 00:29:53,426
But you said we are the same?

426
00:29:53,426 --> 00:29:54,545
is the same

427
00:29:54,775 --> 00:29:57,573
Because it was Masamune who changed me

428
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,838
By the way, auntie

429
00:30:08,838 --> 00:30:11,730
I will take care of Yasheng after she is discharged from the hospital

430
00:30:11,946 --> 00:30:13,864
Masamune too

431
00:30:13,864 --> 00:30:16,919
Thank you for abandoning Masamune and Meio

432
00:30:16,987 --> 00:30:20,150
It's thanks to you that I can have a new family

433
00:30:20,584 --> 00:30:22,230
you...

434
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:26,299
Do you still want to take away my things?

435
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:30,099
listen

436
00:30:30,694 --> 00:30:33,019
Masamune and Mei are mine

437
00:30:33,046 --> 00:30:35,795
It's up to me whether I want to throw it away or pick it up.

438
00:30:35,943 --> 00:30:38,066
If I'm going to be snatched away by you, it's better to kill me

439
00:30:38,066 --> 00:30:41,580
But wouldn’t it be better if Meisheng didn’t have a murderer mother?

440
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,547
The murderer is your father

441
00:30:44,601 --> 00:30:47,780
He killed his wife and also wanted to kill me.

442
00:30:47,821 --> 00:30:50,733
You should thank me

443
00:30:50,774 --> 00:30:55,228
Because I killed that bastard father for you

444
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:58,351
Really

445
00:31:01,503 --> 00:31:02,741
arrest people

446
00:31:09,546 --> 00:31:13,020
You're done, auntie

447
00:31:20,015 --> 00:31:23,074
You think we are the same, right?

448
00:31:26,592 --> 00:31:28,197
That being the case

449
00:31:32,296 --> 00:31:36,746
Let you taste the same pain as me

450
00:31:46,424 --> 00:31:48,722
Shinjo Shiori Fudando

451
00:31:48,794 --> 00:31:50,437
don't come near me

452
00:31:50,473 --> 00:31:52,161
Put down the gun and don't come over

453
00:31:52,174 --> 00:31:53,599
calm down

454
00:31:54,055 --> 00:31:56,444
Put down the knife and ask Xiao Lin to come over

455
00:31:56,444 --> 00:31:58,359
put the gun down

456
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:00,746
lay down

457
00:32:01,516 --> 00:32:02,788
lay down

458
00:32:09,207 --> 00:32:10,449
Shiori

459
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:20,955
Stop it, Shiori

460
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:24,932
Retreat from danger

461
00:32:24,949 --> 00:32:26,495
Whatever you do, don't come over

462
00:32:26,495 --> 00:32:28,224
I really know how to do it

463
00:32:35,118 --> 00:32:36,511
Stop it

464
00:32:39,965 --> 00:32:41,362
come with me

465
00:32:45,889 --> 00:32:47,754
You must hate me very much

466
00:32:47,762 --> 00:32:50,684
Because I'm using you

467
00:32:51,681 --> 00:32:53,001
No

468
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,264
I never hated you

469
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,862
I remembered it too

470
00:33:05,531 --> 00:33:07,116
childhood

471
00:33:08,505 --> 00:33:11,148
The time I lived here with you

472
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:16,781
And you take my place

473
00:33:18,093 --> 00:33:20,299
The matter of becoming an adopted son

474
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:26,358
Are you in pain?

475
00:33:28,714 --> 00:33:31,022
Sorry for not being with you

476
00:33:33,396 --> 00:33:35,260
really sorry

477
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,431
but

478
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,838
After adulthood

479
00:33:55,736 --> 00:33:57,462
meet you again

480
00:33:58,971 --> 00:34:00,851
become family with you

481
00:34:00,885 --> 00:34:02,661
I'm very happy

482
00:34:03,898 --> 00:34:06,377
She also gave birth to a cute bud

483
00:34:09,377 --> 00:34:13,868
Because of you I am really happy

484
00:34:15,665 --> 00:34:18,349
So I hope you are too

485
00:34:20,146 --> 00:34:22,242
I was here just now

486
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,853
pray to god

487
00:34:31,346 --> 00:34:33,312
I hope you and Yasheng

488
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:38,390
May you always be healthy in the future

489
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:43,332
happiness

490
00:34:45,484 --> 00:34:47,125
Masamune

491
00:34:49,549 --> 00:34:53,173
what did you pray for just now

492
00:34:54,076 --> 00:34:55,754
I hope

493
00:34:55,771 --> 00:34:58,941
Shiri can be happy forever

494
00:35:02,552 --> 00:35:04,111
Thank you

495
00:35:09,671 --> 00:35:12,722
You are my important family

496
00:35:13,756 --> 00:35:16,782
This will never change

497
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:19,290
forever

498
00:35:21,969 --> 00:35:23,728
i love you

499
00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:28,066
I love you Xili

500
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:30,509
Shiori

501
00:35:54,834 --> 00:35:57,974
The suspect Xinzhuang Shiri has admitted that on July 7

502
00:35:58,002 --> 00:36:00,680
The crime of killing Dean Nanase Mamoru

503
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,278
His husband also admitted that on July 8, the next day

504
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:08,143
He followed the instructions of his wife Shiori's kidnapping...

505
00:36:08,177 --> 00:36:09,886
What is the prisoner's motive?

506
00:36:09,886 --> 00:36:13,541
I heard it has something to do with the research conducted by the dean.

507
00:36:13,575 --> 00:36:15,575
motivation

508
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:18,168
The motivation is...

509
00:36:23,661 --> 00:36:25,969
Dean Nanase's property

510
00:36:26,037 --> 00:36:29,422
You just said that Xiao Lin is the key to solving the case

511
00:36:29,433 --> 00:36:31,479
Has her memory been restored?

512
00:36:31,488 --> 00:36:33,451
Is there a ransom demand?

513
00:36:59,698 --> 00:37:01,232
Natsuki

514
00:37:03,843 --> 00:37:06,335
Later on the evening of July 8

515
00:37:06,335 --> 00:37:08,335
I fainted in front of my house

516
00:37:08,335 --> 00:37:11,156
Loss of memory due to drug effects

517
00:37:11,427 --> 00:37:15,105
At that time Mr. Masamune Shinjo took me away

518
00:37:15,105 --> 00:37:17,515
Since then, he has been taking care of me...

519
00:37:18,549 --> 00:37:22,825
Are you okay? Are you scared when you see someone being yelled at?

520
00:37:23,707 --> 00:37:25,385
Won't

521
00:37:27,029 --> 00:37:29,132
Not once did I

522
00:37:29,505 --> 00:37:32,183
scared of him

523
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:37,094
What can you do to free him?

524
00:37:37,126 --> 00:37:39,643
The victim in court was still very young

525
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,179
Because he spent a lot of time with the defendant

526
00:37:42,264 --> 00:37:43,940
Possibly brainwashed

527
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,194
brainwashing?

528
00:37:45,194 --> 00:37:47,550
He's not that powerful

529
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:50,912
He always listens to me

530
00:37:51,098 --> 00:37:53,529
good to me

531
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,696
Please eat

532
00:38:00,527 --> 00:38:03,997
The time spent with Masamune was a very special time

533
00:38:04,506 --> 00:38:07,075
I know you can't release him

534
00:38:07,126 --> 00:38:10,562
Because it is a fact that he kidnapped me

535
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:13,563
But what counts as kidnapping?

536
00:38:13,631 --> 00:38:16,207
If you lie to me, threaten me

537
00:38:16,207 --> 00:38:18,732
Restricting my freedom is called kidnapping

538
00:38:18,783 --> 00:38:21,258
Then when I was kidnapped

539
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:24,784
It should be from birth to July 8 of this year

540
00:38:27,378 --> 00:38:29,378
since that day

541
00:38:32,802 --> 00:38:35,246
After I met Masamune

542
00:38:36,585 --> 00:38:39,816
This is the first time in my life that I am free

543
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:48,410
Very suitable for you

544
00:38:49,783 --> 00:38:52,176
why should i go to school

545
00:38:52,193 --> 00:38:54,449
Isn’t that what Mr. Xinzhuang said?

546
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:56,500
hope you can go to school

547
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,500
learning socialization

548
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:01,013
Do I want socialization?

549
00:39:01,013 --> 00:39:02,671
this is necessary

550
00:39:04,434 --> 00:39:06,095
I still won't go

551
00:39:06,095 --> 00:39:08,129
Long wait, Xiaolin

552
00:39:08,129 --> 00:39:09,756
Let's go to school together

553
00:39:11,858 --> 00:39:13,379
What's wrong with you

554
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:17,108
It's okay. I never went to school.

555
00:39:17,108 --> 00:39:18,544
You want to teach me

556
00:39:18,561 --> 00:39:21,070
Yeah, wrap it up on me

557
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,223
Thank you budsheng

558
00:39:23,257 --> 00:39:24,843
let's go

559
00:39:24,877 --> 00:39:26,929
Let's go out

560
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,488
Be careful on the road

561
00:39:32,946 --> 00:39:35,116
Someone in Xinzhuang wants to see you

562
00:39:37,337 --> 00:39:40,439
No. 513 leaves the dormitory

563
00:39:44,627 --> 00:39:46,935
Are you talking about Xia Shu?

564
00:39:47,003 --> 00:39:48,884
His very subtle...

565
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,003
Moved a bit

566
00:39:54,342 --> 00:39:56,579
As if to me...

567
00:39:57,342 --> 00:39:59,205
say something

568
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,661
He is sure

569
00:40:02,271 --> 00:40:04,938
is calling you

570
00:40:09,769 --> 00:40:11,598
human potential

571
00:40:13,246 --> 00:40:15,073
It's really amazing

572
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:23,227
By the way, the file inside the pendant

573
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:26,626
It seems to be mainly experimental records

574
00:40:26,677 --> 00:40:29,412
and notes on the research process

575
00:40:29,768 --> 00:40:33,699
The most important pharmaceutical ingredients list

576
00:40:33,886 --> 00:40:35,664
not inside

577
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:39,424
May I take a look at it

578
00:40:40,746 --> 00:40:42,575
certainly

579
00:40:44,084 --> 00:40:45,793
Please see

580
00:40:55,931 --> 00:40:58,700
Sunouchi-senpai, have you read this report?

581
00:40:58,731 --> 00:41:01,355
(Testimony of interceding for the defendant in the Nanase Rin kidnapping case) Yeah, until the end

582
00:41:01,394 --> 00:41:05,341
Nanase Mamoru doesn’t seem to know the ingredients of the medicine either.

583
00:41:05,937 --> 00:41:09,547
Later, he inherited his father's research results

584
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,814
Although the samples left by my father were analyzed

585
00:41:12,871 --> 00:41:15,157
But it didn’t work out in the end

586
00:41:15,314 --> 00:41:19,229
Does that mean the ingredient list no longer exists?

587
00:41:19,272 --> 00:41:21,128
Don't know

588
00:41:22,073 --> 00:41:25,788
If Nanase Eisaku didn't tell anyone

589
00:42:18,064 --> 00:42:22,578
It turns out that Dean Eisaku didn’t leave any ingredient list.

590
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,960
That's fine too

591
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:31,712
I'll get rid of the files in the basement.

592
00:42:31,742 --> 00:42:33,092
good

593
00:42:34,249 --> 00:42:37,328
That's what I mean...

594
00:42:37,405 --> 00:42:40,406
"True medicine lies in a kind heart"

595
00:42:40,622 --> 00:42:43,833
I heard that this is something Dean Eisaku often talks about.

596
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:46,252
Kind heart?

597
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,668
Are you basically talking about Masamune?

598
00:42:48,668 --> 00:42:50,175
really

599
00:43:00,056 --> 00:43:01,640
What are you doing

600
00:43:01,917 --> 00:43:03,964
Xinzhuang please leave the fence

601
00:43:03,964 --> 00:43:05,933
Xinzhuang can't be like this

602
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:07,972
Gone

603
00:43:08,034 --> 00:43:09,444
Let's go

604
00:43:10,847 --> 00:43:12,863
Get up and walk

605
00:43:13,834 --> 00:43:16,815
Xinzhuang, please use a notebook to write next time, do you hear me?

606
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,704
Do you need to write a report on this?

607
00:43:18,704 --> 00:43:21,356
Xinzhuang will also come to help clean it up.

608
00:43:37,943 --> 00:43:39,943
