1
00:00:00,528 --> 00:00:02,567
(I am a kidnapper) My name is Masamune Shinjo

2
00:00:02,567 --> 00:00:04,620
Became a kidnapper for some reason

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,798
Who are you

4
00:00:05,798 --> 00:00:09,854
The Nanase Rin I kidnapped is a genius girl who has lost her memory.

5
00:00:09,947 --> 00:00:11,971
(Genius girl with amnesia) "I can also speak other foreign languages"

6
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:13,290
"Do you understand what I'm saying?"

7
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,454
Is this some kind of spell?

8
00:00:14,454 --> 00:00:17,389
(The girl’s parents were brutally murdered) But Xiaolin’s parents were actually murdered.

9
00:00:17,415 --> 00:00:20,495
(Who is the real murderer) The police are investigating the murder...

10
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:23,356
(Xili’s hidden secret) And my missing wife Xili has another secret

11
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,370
I am infected with HIV

12
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,825
I will protect Xiaolin for sure

13
00:00:28,841 --> 00:00:30,761
The mysterious man appears again

14
00:00:30,761 --> 00:00:32,761
(Masamune and Xiao Rin were taken away) Take me and Xiao Rin away

15
00:00:32,813 --> 00:00:34,588
When I opened my eyes, what I saw was...

16
00:00:34,588 --> 00:00:36,695
Xiao Lin, what is that?

17
00:00:36,695 --> 00:00:39,336
What will happen to Xiaolin and I?

18
00:00:41,855 --> 00:00:43,786
(The Day of Kidnapping) (Episode 4)

19
00:00:44,183 --> 00:00:46,381
(Seventh day after kidnapping) She is ours...

20
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:50,188
light of hope

21
00:00:50,438 --> 00:00:52,069
What a joke

22
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:53,645
Give me back Xiao Lin

23
00:00:56,731 --> 00:00:59,328
Samezu lets him go

24
00:01:04,724 --> 00:01:06,724
Please rest assured Mr. Xinzhuang

25
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:12,085
This is the safest place for Xiaolin

26
00:01:14,249 --> 00:01:18,478
This villa is my research base

27
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,345
It's an isolated land island

28
00:01:21,345 --> 00:01:24,871
It is impossible for outsiders to visit

29
00:01:24,949 --> 00:01:28,062
I sometimes use this place

30
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:30,929
Lend to Dean Nanase Mamoru

31
00:01:31,023 --> 00:01:33,946
He started from his father's generation

32
00:01:34,087 --> 00:01:37,538
Dedicated to neurophysiological research for many years

33
00:01:38,086 --> 00:01:40,086
Neurophysiology?

34
00:01:40,086 --> 00:01:42,953
For example, a genius mathematician

35
00:01:42,953 --> 00:01:47,003
You can intuitively give the answer just by looking at the formula.

36
00:01:47,003 --> 00:01:51,021
Or only listened to the music once

37
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:53,647
A talented pianist who can perfectly reproduce

38
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:57,886
Don't you think this is a very unique ability?

39
00:01:57,964 --> 00:02:00,926
Isn't it what people call talent?

40
00:02:02,398 --> 00:02:04,398
Please sit down

41
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,330
In simple terms

42
00:02:10,487 --> 00:02:13,942
The research done by two generations of their father and son

43
00:02:14,036 --> 00:02:16,140
Just manually

44
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,296
Create such a genius

45
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,478
And this research

46
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:29,069
For young children whose brains are still in the soft growth stage

47
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:31,820
have more significant results

48
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,014
You mean Xiao Lin...

49
00:02:35,014 --> 00:02:38,078
She is number one on this project...

50
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:41,096
Finished product

51
00:02:41,926 --> 00:02:44,588
Now with the development of AI

52
00:02:44,588 --> 00:02:47,124
Humanity must also enter the stage of evolution

53
00:02:47,124 --> 00:02:50,559
And the one who holds the key to creating that future

54
00:02:50,575 --> 00:02:54,151
-This is it... -Next generation intelligence development plan

55
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,587
Xiaolin...

56
00:02:58,495 --> 00:03:00,174
human capabilities

57
00:03:00,184 --> 00:03:05,031
There will be a huge gap due to the trace amounts of hormones secreted in the brain.

58
00:03:05,048 --> 00:03:08,625
If special drugs are injected into specific parts of the brain

59
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,193
Regulate hormone secretion

60
00:03:11,193 --> 00:03:15,226
Perhaps it can maximize the brain’s perceptual function

61
00:03:16,466 --> 00:03:19,931
Xiaolin, is your memory...

62
00:03:19,947 --> 00:03:22,526
Long time no see Xiao Lin

63
00:03:25,157 --> 00:03:29,032
Suwon...Dr.

64
00:03:35,157 --> 00:03:36,857
Sunouchi-senpai

65
00:03:37,202 --> 00:03:39,265
Xinzhuang’s fingerprints were detected

66
00:03:39,265 --> 00:03:41,265
He was indeed present

67
00:03:41,265 --> 00:03:43,265
The ingredients are soda sugar

68
00:03:46,178 --> 00:03:47,908
It's a shame we had to stay up all night looking for someone.

69
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:49,857
He even said he would disappear and then he disappeared.

70
00:03:49,857 --> 00:03:52,503
Where did he go?

71
00:03:52,911 --> 00:03:55,197
What about the whereabouts of the others?

72
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,527
Homicide and kidnapping

73
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,971
It's possible that it's a different case

74
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:07,558
Does this mean that Xinzhuang might not be a murderer?

75
00:04:07,558 --> 00:04:09,842
I'm just speculating

76
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:14,733
Check the relevant parties again

77
00:04:14,764 --> 00:04:16,240
yes

78
00:04:18,996 --> 00:04:20,855
- Kitamura is gone - Yes

79
00:04:20,871 --> 00:04:23,781
You don't have that kind of free time anymore

80
00:04:23,794 --> 00:04:25,494
- Minister of Criminal Affairs - Borrowed

81
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:26,690
Excuse me

82
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:31,469
Starting today, this case will be transferred to the command of the Criminal Affairs Minister Tatsuoka

83
00:04:31,498 --> 00:04:35,199
And a special team from the first class is responsible for investigating.

84
00:04:35,528 --> 00:04:37,909
The Minister of Criminal Affairs went to the scene in person?

85
00:04:38,018 --> 00:04:41,705
Long time no see Mr. Sunouchi

86
00:04:48,282 --> 00:04:50,908
The investigation has yet to make any progress

87
00:04:50,936 --> 00:04:52,324
It seems that it is because

88
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:56,385
The jurisdictional agency has been acting without authorization

89
00:04:57,152 --> 00:05:00,420
From now on, the front line will be under our full command

90
00:05:00,984 --> 00:05:05,214
Please ask the jurisdictional agency to provide logistical support

91
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,651
yes

92
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:12,926
Don't hinder me like before

93
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:16,085
Sunouchi...

94
00:05:17,497 --> 00:05:19,078
Inspector

95
00:05:25,347 --> 00:05:26,243
Where is the search headquarters?

96
00:05:26,268 --> 00:05:27,847
Please follow me here

97
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,032
- Stay out of the way - Yes

98
00:05:29,049 --> 00:05:31,487
The floor is cracked here, please be careful.

99
00:05:33,445 --> 00:05:35,272
(Reorganize the following words to answer the question)

100
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,191
(Devonian)

101
00:06:03,495 --> 00:06:05,281
Really awesome

102
00:06:06,082 --> 00:06:08,972
I know she's not an ordinary person

103
00:06:09,311 --> 00:06:11,821
Didn't expect it to be so amazing

104
00:06:27,293 --> 00:06:29,710
Do you have any soda candy?

105
00:06:30,522 --> 00:06:32,128
Are you thirsty? (Soda sugar sounds the same as soda)

106
00:06:32,128 --> 00:06:34,891
No I mean candy

107
00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:37,462
candy?

108
00:06:39,922 --> 00:06:42,788
Mr. Xinzhuang, please come over.

109
00:06:45,102 --> 00:06:47,589
This is your thing

110
00:06:47,634 --> 00:06:48,819
right

111
00:06:49,621 --> 00:06:51,249
-Is this too? -Yes

112
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,462
terribly sorry

113
00:06:53,462 --> 00:06:55,856
Keep this for me

114
00:06:56,173 --> 00:07:00,143
This place cannot be known to outsiders

115
00:07:01,091 --> 00:07:03,351
Of course the same goes for the police

116
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:04,689
To the police too?

117
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:05,936
That's right

118
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,558
If that child is taken away

119
00:07:08,671 --> 00:07:11,549
Cause this project to become known to the public

120
00:07:12,068 --> 00:07:15,476
People may criticize us for using young children as guinea pigs

121
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:18,077
cause plans to be hindered

122
00:07:18,088 --> 00:07:19,324
The worst thing is

123
00:07:19,414 --> 00:07:23,126
The child will be exposed to the curious gaze of the public

124
00:07:23,837 --> 00:07:25,837
Hide Xiaolin here

125
00:07:25,837 --> 00:07:28,028
Actually it's for her own good

126
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,339
I see

127
00:07:33,043 --> 00:07:35,707
if you can understand

128
00:07:37,062 --> 00:07:39,062
I have one more request

129
00:07:39,614 --> 00:07:41,411
Mr. Shinjo

130
00:07:41,456 --> 00:07:44,356
I want to ask you to leave Xiaolin

131
00:07:45,112 --> 00:07:46,568
What

132
00:07:47,109 --> 00:07:50,785
Your presence is unexpected

133
00:07:50,785 --> 00:07:52,291
therefore

134
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:57,691
I hope you can get out of here and find a place to hide

135
00:07:57,736 --> 00:07:59,736
Hiding...

136
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:02,403
Do you want me to pretend to be missing?

137
00:08:02,437 --> 00:08:04,148
My daughter...

138
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,680
It's called Yasheng, right?

139
00:08:09,309 --> 00:08:10,979
Do you know my daughter?

140
00:08:11,397 --> 00:08:13,622
her heart treatment

141
00:08:14,987 --> 00:08:19,857
I am willing to provide comprehensive assistance

142
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,160
Targeting the kidnapper’s past relationships, former workplace colleagues, and debt relationships

143
00:08:26,176 --> 00:08:28,446
Check them all again

144
00:08:28,446 --> 00:08:31,640
In short, we must completely find out the details of Qingzhuang Zhengzong.

145
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:33,168
yes...

146
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,115
No instructions were given to us

147
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,126
A special group worthy of a lesson

148
00:08:40,126 --> 00:08:41,569
It's an elite force

149
00:08:41,569 --> 00:08:42,584
yes

150
00:08:42,584 --> 00:08:44,369
-Everyone in the jurisdiction - Yes

151
00:08:44,369 --> 00:08:48,579
Please order food for our investigators

152
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:49,422
yes

153
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:50,980
Order...order food?

154
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,980
Inspector Sunouchi

155
00:08:53,104 --> 00:08:55,104
Please

156
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:01,129
Let's go

157
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:12,516
Sunouchi-senpai

158
00:09:13,013 --> 00:09:15,396
-Bukchon-Yes

159
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,126
What would happen if it were you?

160
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:20,107
this...

161
00:09:20,141 --> 00:09:23,749
We also hope to go back to handle the case as soon as possible

162
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:26,447
Do you want seaweed bento and salmon bento?

163
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:28,322
I still want the Makunouchi bento

164
00:09:29,338 --> 00:09:31,961
This salmon bento is delicious

165
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,847
But I want one more

166
00:09:37,165 --> 00:09:38,456
senior...

167
00:09:40,736 --> 00:09:42,679
Even Sunouchi-senpai

168
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:45,355
There is no way to disobey the criminal director of the national examination team?

169
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:48,046
Do you mean they have some holiday?

170
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:50,737
In the past, senior was still in the first class

171
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,214
A suspect was caught in a certain case

172
00:09:53,403 --> 00:09:56,574
But the suspect is a big shot

173
00:09:56,574 --> 00:09:58,867
Send another person to take the blame

174
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,275
The decision to close the case was...

175
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:05,373
Who told you to do it?

176
00:10:05,576 --> 00:10:07,100
what is the reward

177
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,492
This person came to confess his crime on his own

178
00:10:13,219 --> 00:10:15,985
Hey, how much did you collect?

179
00:10:16,188 --> 00:10:18,188
You know everything, right?

180
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,121
-Hey - stop it quickly

181
00:10:21,944 --> 00:10:23,724
What a joke

182
00:10:25,008 --> 00:10:27,184
What kind of police officer are you?

183
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:29,593
Don’t you have justice in your heart?

184
00:10:34,928 --> 00:10:36,441
Sunouchi-senpai

185
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,928
I ordered a special makuuchi for one class

186
00:10:38,928 --> 00:10:40,527
we are this

187
00:10:41,206 --> 00:10:43,902
The first lesson is focusing on investigating Xinzhuang

188
00:10:43,985 --> 00:10:47,050
Someone has to check other lines

189
00:10:47,202 --> 00:10:49,076
Matsuda from the security company

190
00:10:49,146 --> 00:10:53,771
I patrol the hospital as usual from morning to six o'clock in the evening

191
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:57,272
Go see your high school classmates after get off work

192
00:10:57,272 --> 00:11:00,020
The two drank until morning

193
00:11:00,048 --> 00:11:02,090
Have you checked your alibi?

194
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,992
not yet

195
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:09,977
Do you want to continue checking?

196
00:11:09,977 --> 00:11:12,414
Is it bad to disobey orders?

197
00:11:12,561 --> 00:11:14,789
This can be regarded as supporting a lesson, right?

198
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:18,929
i have a friend

199
00:11:19,031 --> 00:11:23,090
He is a well-known top Japanese cardiac surgeon in the United States

200
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:29,473
I have also undergone many difficult surgeries like yours.

201
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:34,610
He promised to help with this

202
00:11:35,448 --> 00:11:38,337
I will bear all the expenses

203
00:11:38,855 --> 00:11:40,855
Cost too?

204
00:11:42,013 --> 00:11:47,891
Could it be that you also paid for the previous medical expenses?

205
00:11:50,735 --> 00:11:53,467
Why do you need to help me so much?

206
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:58,391
This is thank you for protecting Xiaolin until now

207
00:11:59,057 --> 00:12:01,057
as well as

208
00:12:02,962 --> 00:12:05,863
for this plan

209
00:12:08,706 --> 00:12:12,874
The whole world is looking forward to the results of this plan

210
00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:17,812
Among them is a Singaporean company called Z Capitals

211
00:12:17,858 --> 00:12:20,986
Already promised to invest tens of billions of yuan

212
00:12:21,077 --> 00:12:23,352
Tens of billions...

213
00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:26,767
As long as it can succeed

214
00:12:27,565 --> 00:12:29,837
I'm not afraid of any difficulties

215
00:12:35,446 --> 00:12:38,087
It's time for Yasheng to take medicine

216
00:12:38,702 --> 00:12:42,030
Although there is no need for me to worry all the time

217
00:12:42,645 --> 00:12:44,645
But hearing this voice

218
00:12:44,827 --> 00:12:47,383
Then you will feel that Yasheng and I are still together

219
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:53,441
As long as the surgery is done

220
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:56,014
Bud will recover

221
00:12:57,428 --> 00:13:01,397
I will also take full responsibility for post-operative care.

222
00:13:02,035 --> 00:13:05,523
-But in exchange... -In exchange

223
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,761
I have to hide my whereabouts

224
00:13:10,947 --> 00:13:12,530
That's right

225
00:13:13,853 --> 00:13:15,779
從小rin

226
00:13:16,687 --> 00:13:18,803
disappear in front of budsheng

227
00:13:46,946 --> 00:13:49,049
marvelous

228
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:20,356
Don't be afraid of Xiaolin

229
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,150
You will be...

230
00:14:28,813 --> 00:14:31,432
hope of mankind

231
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,549
I heard that you met Mr. Matsuda on the evening of the 8th.

232
00:14:46,608 --> 00:14:50,393
Yes, he suddenly asked me if I wanted a drink

233
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:53,823
Have you drank with him before?

234
00:14:53,823 --> 00:14:56,654
No, this is the first date after graduation

235
00:14:56,654 --> 00:14:59,149
I don’t know how I found my phone number

236
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:03,621
Sounds like a hastily prepared alibi.

237
00:15:04,077 --> 00:15:05,626
yes

238
00:15:05,626 --> 00:15:11,525
Moreover, Dean Nanase’s home security was also recommended by him.

239
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:13,751
Feels suspicious

240
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,709
This is delicious too

241
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:22,200
I've never eaten anything like this

242
00:15:23,732 --> 00:15:25,732
delicious

243
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,678
Why don’t you eat?

244
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:33,287
Not poisoned

245
00:15:35,116 --> 00:15:37,252
what

246
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:40,634
I usually say I'm hungry every now and then.

247
00:15:40,634 --> 00:15:43,235
I want to eat and make a fuss all the time.

248
00:15:43,806 --> 00:15:45,806
Who said that?

249
00:15:45,942 --> 00:15:48,433
Don't think of me as you

250
00:15:54,363 --> 00:15:56,225
Have you recovered your memory?

251
00:15:56,307 --> 00:15:58,307
Do you remember what happened on the day of the crime?

252
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,258
Not yet but it doesn’t matter

253
00:16:03,634 --> 00:16:07,061
I originally wanted to find out who killed my parents.

254
00:16:07,061 --> 00:16:09,225
No motivation now

255
00:16:15,372 --> 00:16:17,991
Hello...

256
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:21,545
There is a private beach here

257
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,683
So comfortable

258
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,641
Awesome

259
00:16:50,213 --> 00:16:51,992
So cold

260
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,396
There is also a salty taste

261
00:16:54,695 --> 00:16:58,552
Although I have learned that this is the sea.

262
00:17:00,782 --> 00:17:02,782
good

263
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:06,446
I'll teach you a little more

264
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:09,832
Look at the moves

265
00:17:23,161 --> 00:17:24,834
stop...

266
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:26,958
Too much, too much water

267
00:17:27,961 --> 00:17:30,398
sorry...

268
00:17:30,398 --> 00:17:33,179
My hair is wet

269
00:17:33,424 --> 00:17:35,888
Let me cut it for you

270
00:17:36,324 --> 00:17:37,723
come over

271
00:17:47,053 --> 00:17:50,265
Think of it as my farewell gift to you.

272
00:17:50,265 --> 00:17:52,756
Farewell?

273
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,765
Are you leaving here?

274
00:17:58,403 --> 00:18:01,113
Yasheng is about to undergo surgery

275
00:18:01,222 --> 00:18:04,723
That Dr. Mizuhara promised me

276
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,383
Is that great?

277
00:18:07,437 --> 00:18:08,995
yes

278
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,430
But it’s also a good thing for you

279
00:18:14,231 --> 00:18:16,422
people here

280
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:19,026
Although I hate that man

281
00:18:19,026 --> 00:18:21,517
But the doctor seems to be a good guy

282
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,855
There are also companies willing to invest tens of billions

283
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:28,710
It can be seen that everyone is very protective of you.

284
00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:31,743
you are really naive

285
00:18:32,858 --> 00:18:35,841
There is no such thing as unwarranted kindness in the world

286
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:38,795
How old are you?

287
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:43,813
To them I am just an individual with research value.

288
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:46,352
On the other hand, once it loses value

289
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:48,379
I'm meaningless

290
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:52,344
whether it's you or me

291
00:18:54,548 --> 00:18:56,603
I remembered

292
00:18:57,908 --> 00:19:01,255
This bruise is the mark of the injection

293
00:19:01,336 --> 00:19:03,336
inject?

294
00:19:04,152 --> 00:19:06,014
Not just here

295
00:19:06,123 --> 00:19:08,123
Also on the head

296
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:13,097
Drilling holes in the skull and injecting them directly into the brain

297
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:20,622
I always wanted to know who I was

298
00:19:20,677 --> 00:19:26,089
Turns out I was the kid my dad used for experiments.

299
00:19:27,449 --> 00:19:29,283
Xiao Lin

300
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:34,253
What's the matter?

301
00:19:36,388 --> 00:19:39,944
Ah, how did it become flat like this?

302
00:19:40,026 --> 00:19:41,971
-What kind of hair style is it? -It's the same as mine.

303
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:45,299
What? How do I fix it now?

304
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:48,705
How are you going to make up for it?

305
00:19:48,768 --> 00:19:50,168
Masamune

306
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:53,603
If I lose my memory again

307
00:19:53,603 --> 00:19:56,477
Don't tell me the truth this time

308
00:19:56,994 --> 00:20:01,016
If you continue to lie to me, you will be my father.

309
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,638
Right

310
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:11,116
You said there is a company investing in this research?

311
00:20:11,116 --> 00:20:12,637
what's the name

312
00:20:12,637 --> 00:20:13,923
name...

313
00:20:13,923 --> 00:20:18,407
It seems to be called Z...

314
00:20:18,407 --> 00:20:21,051
Cabbage? Z cabbage... (sounds like Capital)

315
00:20:22,363 --> 00:20:25,044
Z Capitals

316
00:20:30,218 --> 00:20:31,791
Sorry for the unexpected visit

317
00:20:31,827 --> 00:20:35,087
Actually, I'm here to ask your hospital for help.

318
00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:39,414
Immediately perform surgery on a hospitalized patient

319
00:20:43,195 --> 00:20:44,666
terribly sorry

320
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,107
Our surgeries are fully booked

321
00:20:47,142 --> 00:20:49,142
There is no way to arrange other surgeries

322
00:20:49,142 --> 00:20:51,142
I think so too

323
00:20:51,142 --> 00:20:55,009
But there's someone who really wants me to help with this

324
00:20:55,073 --> 00:20:57,776
He even said no

325
00:21:01,008 --> 00:21:02,507
(Request for Surgery) What’s more?

326
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:05,623
We don't have the surgeons to handle this difficult surgery

327
00:21:05,691 --> 00:21:08,187
We will arrange for the surgeon to

328
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,679
in addition

329
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:14,160
If you don't mind, please accept this.

330
00:21:15,855 --> 00:21:17,855
Just a little thought

331
00:21:20,115 --> 00:21:23,346
Please give your hospital serious consideration.

332
00:21:24,747 --> 00:21:26,544
welcome back

333
00:21:26,996 --> 00:21:28,590
what are you doing

334
00:21:28,635 --> 00:21:30,977
One lesson tells us to organize files

335
00:21:30,977 --> 00:21:33,518
To put it bluntly, it’s just a chore.

336
00:21:38,694 --> 00:21:42,290
By the way, what are seniors investigating without telling us?

337
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,438
If we can be of any help please let us know

338
00:21:44,438 --> 00:21:46,233
OK I know

339
00:21:46,233 --> 00:21:48,975
Sunouchi-senpai, I found something amazing

340
00:21:49,014 --> 00:21:50,070
What

341
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:54,805
It's a sushi restaurant in front of the station, right?

342
00:21:54,905 --> 00:21:55,542
What

343
00:21:55,562 --> 00:21:57,562
I heard that they use very powerful ingredients, right?

344
00:21:58,334 --> 00:21:59,897
Yes...right

345
00:21:59,912 --> 00:22:02,357
There are many fresh ingredients in the flower-shaped octopus and small squid.

346
00:22:06,545 --> 00:22:07,375
Right

347
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:10,319
Do you want to eat sushi tonight?

348
00:22:10,351 --> 00:22:12,617
-My treat-Kitamura continued

349
00:22:12,617 --> 00:22:13,572
yes

350
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:17,410
Mr. Matsuda from the security company

351
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,908
There was an intersection with the murdered Nanase Mamoru.

352
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:23,542
And it was thirty years ago

353
00:22:23,836 --> 00:22:25,774
-Thirty years ago? -That's right

354
00:22:25,774 --> 00:22:29,775
When Nanase Mamoru's father, Mr. Nanase Eisaku, was still the dean,

355
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:32,723
Errors occurred during surgery

356
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,217
(Eongjin Memorial Hospital) Because of this incident

357
00:22:35,255 --> 00:22:37,824
The wife who harmed Mr. Matsuda at the time

358
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:39,858
and fetal death in the abdomen.

359
00:22:43,521 --> 00:22:45,521
Medical negligence?

360
00:22:45,521 --> 00:22:48,100
Yes, there is one more thing

361
00:22:51,086 --> 00:22:52,669
you see

362
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,932
(Settlement letter) Is it a settlement letter with the hospital?

363
00:22:55,932 --> 00:22:56,756
That's right

364
00:22:56,756 --> 00:22:59,094
Mr. Matsuda once filed a complaint with the hospital

365
00:22:59,094 --> 00:23:00,981
But soon withdrawn

366
00:23:00,981 --> 00:23:03,056
After receiving the settlement money

367
00:23:03,094 --> 00:23:06,858
He also requested that he be assigned to the security company that cooperated with the hospital.

368
00:23:06,858 --> 00:23:09,067
Is it okay to collect money?

369
00:23:09,124 --> 00:23:12,345
How can I forgive so easily after losing my wife and children?

370
00:23:12,383 --> 00:23:15,321
It's outrageous that you still go to work in that hospital.

371
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:25,977
The doctor kept you waiting

372
00:23:25,977 --> 00:23:27,977
Thank you

373
00:23:27,977 --> 00:23:30,849
It turns out to be a sandwich

374
00:23:30,849 --> 00:23:33,825
I originally wanted to eat pork cutlet rice bowl today.

375
00:23:33,825 --> 00:23:35,066
sorry

376
00:23:35,066 --> 00:23:37,332
It's okay. Please sit down.

377
00:23:37,464 --> 00:23:40,976
Having said that, I'm really sorry

378
00:23:41,005 --> 00:23:43,918
I may have said too much to the police.

379
00:23:44,983 --> 00:23:46,983
It's you who entrusted me

380
00:23:46,983 --> 00:23:51,111
Ask me to help you connect the dots and say a lot of good things to the dean.

381
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,715
It doesn't matter

382
00:23:53,715 --> 00:23:57,001
Thank you very much for this

383
00:23:57,001 --> 00:23:58,832
That's good

384
00:24:02,456 --> 00:24:03,874
Right

385
00:24:04,517 --> 00:24:08,367
In this case, why don't we find the murderer together?

386
00:24:08,385 --> 00:24:09,739
What

387
00:24:09,864 --> 00:24:12,887
Isn't the murderer the man named Xinzhuang?

388
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,333
God knows

389
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,315
Actually me

390
00:24:17,315 --> 00:24:20,709
There's something I haven't told the police yet

391
00:24:21,674 --> 00:24:24,652
It's the secret about the dean

392
00:24:33,177 --> 00:24:34,764
Hello

393
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:39,164
You will sleep in this room for now

394
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:44,720
-Mr. Xinzhuang-Yes

395
00:24:44,756 --> 00:24:49,231
The cardiac surgeon will arrive in Japan over the weekend

396
00:24:49,249 --> 00:24:51,985
Waiting for all necessary inspections to be completed

397
00:24:51,985 --> 00:24:54,218
You can have surgery as soon as you are born

398
00:24:54,218 --> 00:24:56,343
thank you very much

399
00:24:56,486 --> 00:24:59,224
Please keep your promise tomorrow morning

400
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,463
OK

401
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:03,267
i will leave here

402
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:07,703
Xiao Lin, you heard it too, right?

403
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:10,128
whatever you want

404
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:12,977
Then I'll make arrangements

405
00:25:13,191 --> 00:25:15,720
Sorry, wait.

406
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,144
Finally I have one more request

407
00:25:19,198 --> 00:25:22,241
before leaving here tomorrow

408
00:25:22,402 --> 00:25:24,077
I want to see Yasheng

409
00:25:24,077 --> 00:25:26,398
-The police are watching... -I know

410
00:25:26,398 --> 00:25:28,886
But please think of a way

411
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:32,278
Once he says it, he won't back down.

412
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:34,412
please you

413
00:25:35,647 --> 00:25:37,812
I will arrange this

414
00:25:37,812 --> 00:25:39,924
thank you

415
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:46,683
Masamune, I advise you to run away now

416
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:52,084
The investment company you are talking about is Z Capitals, right?

417
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,382
Yes, you know that one

418
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:58,395
Although it appears to be a good investment company

419
00:25:58,395 --> 00:26:02,429
In fact, he is a person who does whatever it takes for the sake of profit.

420
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:07,024
Like letting opponents suddenly disappear.

421
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:13,420
Thank you for brokering the surgery for me.

422
00:26:13,474 --> 00:26:15,227
It's really hard to handle

423
00:26:15,293 --> 00:26:19,222
But it was Dr. Mizuhara’s request after all.

424
00:26:19,222 --> 00:26:23,476
Post-operative care also prepared the best environment for her

425
00:26:23,476 --> 00:26:27,604
Is it necessary to do this to a child you don’t know?

426
00:26:27,655 --> 00:26:30,590
I am a person who does what I say

427
00:26:31,908 --> 00:26:34,139
OK

428
00:26:35,988 --> 00:26:40,245
Can the father on the other side handle it?

429
00:26:40,346 --> 00:26:43,090
That person is no longer useful

430
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,686
Besides, he already knows so much

431
00:26:46,718 --> 00:26:48,976
We can't let him fly away

432
00:26:51,561 --> 00:26:53,402
they are dangerous

433
00:26:53,435 --> 00:26:55,903
- you better run away - i know

434
00:26:56,126 --> 00:26:59,737
I also know everything is going too well

435
00:27:00,497 --> 00:27:03,626
There is no such thing as unwarranted kindness in the world

436
00:27:05,425 --> 00:27:07,528
There must be some plan

437
00:27:07,579 --> 00:27:09,810
-Then you do it now... -But

438
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:12,038
Finally I want to see Yasheng

439
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:14,645
If you run away now, you won't be able to see her.

440
00:27:15,506 --> 00:27:18,763
Yasheng is the most important person to me

441
00:27:20,232 --> 00:27:22,232
and

442
00:27:23,144 --> 00:27:25,144
And you

443
00:27:26,715 --> 00:27:29,183
You are just as dangerous, right?

444
00:27:29,817 --> 00:27:32,638
They pretend to be good people

445
00:27:32,689 --> 00:27:35,111
In fact, it is basically kidnapping and imprisonment.

446
00:27:35,163 --> 00:27:37,594
You don't know what will happen if you stay here

447
00:27:37,677 --> 00:27:39,677
I can't rest assured

448
00:27:39,806 --> 00:27:41,510
Masamune

449
00:27:41,687 --> 00:27:44,433
What you said is completely opposite to what you said before.

450
00:27:47,241 --> 00:27:49,114
Anyway, if I run away now

451
00:27:49,114 --> 00:27:51,114
It's like leaving you alone

452
00:27:51,512 --> 00:27:53,386
so...

453
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:56,646
So let's run away together

454
00:27:57,861 --> 00:28:00,965
I will run away after seeing Meisheng tomorrow

455
00:28:00,965 --> 00:28:03,443
Let's run away and then meet again

456
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:04,932
How about this

457
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,719
Masamune

458
00:28:07,683 --> 00:28:09,599
I promised

459
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:12,146
I will definitely protect you

460
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:19,462
But how to escape and meet again later?

461
00:28:21,914 --> 00:28:23,809
I have no idea

462
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,094
I didn't think about it at all

463
00:28:28,157 --> 00:28:31,249
Can't think of a way at all

464
00:28:31,249 --> 00:28:32,850
what to do

465
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:41,619
That Miss Suwon

466
00:28:43,086 --> 00:28:45,590
dinner is ready

467
00:28:45,632 --> 00:28:48,007
After cleaning up, come and eat with Xiao Lin.

468
00:28:48,447 --> 00:28:51,392
Do you have any stomach medicine?

469
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:54,482
Maybe you’ve been playing at the beach for too long

470
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,108
My stomach hurts a little

471
00:28:56,841 --> 00:28:58,463
Wait me a moment

472
00:28:58,505 --> 00:29:00,526
sorry very sorry

473
00:29:02,266 --> 00:29:05,056
My gastrointestinal condition has never been good before

474
00:29:05,056 --> 00:29:07,728
Frequent diarrhea and the like

475
00:29:22,753 --> 00:29:25,921
Then I'll make arrangements

476
00:29:34,995 --> 00:29:36,475
So awesome

477
00:29:36,496 --> 00:29:38,769
- Let's go look out. - Okay.

478
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,574
The location of this villa...

479
00:29:54,406 --> 00:29:55,928
what are you doing

480
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,151
We can't escape just the two of us

481
00:29:58,207 --> 00:30:00,016
Need help

482
00:30:00,056 --> 00:30:01,483
I see

483
00:30:10,723 --> 00:30:12,667
-Ms. Mizuhara, I cut my hair... -This is stomach medicine

484
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:14,427
It wasn't me who cut it, it was cut by others...

485
00:30:14,427 --> 00:30:17,284
Not only my stomach, but my back also hurts...

486
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,047
There's painkillers in there too

487
00:30:24,421 --> 00:30:26,160
Anything else?

488
00:30:26,238 --> 00:30:27,769
No

489
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:29,927
thank you

490
00:30:30,005 --> 00:30:31,666
it hurts

491
00:30:32,921 --> 00:30:34,686
How about it

492
00:30:34,686 --> 00:30:36,373
Who is the helper?

493
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,181
There is only one choice left

494
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:46,474
(Don’t reply. Prepare a car to pick us up at 8 o’clock tomorrow morning)

495
00:30:46,474 --> 00:30:47,645
(The location is...)

496
00:30:48,361 --> 00:30:49,890
What

497
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,264
Pass it to Xi Li?

498
00:30:52,297 --> 00:30:54,785
I clearly said I couldn't cause her any more trouble.

499
00:30:54,785 --> 00:30:57,322
I didn't agree

500
00:30:57,371 --> 00:31:01,000
Although we can only take a gamble whether she will come or not.

501
00:31:18,186 --> 00:31:20,431
(The location is at Hoshimi-saki Lighthouse and you must be on time)

502
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:22,832
(Besides, your daughter is definitely ready for surgery, congratulations)

503
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:27,576
There are no problems. The situation is very stable.

504
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:29,313
I'll have surgery in a week

505
00:31:29,313 --> 00:31:31,154
Monitor her condition carefully

506
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:32,392
yes

507
00:31:42,146 --> 00:31:45,070
before leaving here tomorrow

508
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,835
I want to see Yasheng

509
00:32:09,277 --> 00:32:10,838
are you ready

510
00:32:10,884 --> 00:32:12,218
yes

511
00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:15,070
Have you said goodbye to Xiaolin?

512
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:16,278
No

513
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:18,857
We're actually not that good

514
00:32:21,946 --> 00:32:23,489
Let's go then

515
00:32:27,948 --> 00:32:29,536
Mr. Shinjo

516
00:32:31,468 --> 00:32:33,392
This is for you

517
00:32:36,042 --> 00:32:38,557
-thank you-please take care

518
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,328
I hope we can happily meet again someday

519
00:32:52,016 --> 00:32:53,895
He already knows so much

520
00:32:53,996 --> 00:32:55,996
We can't let him fly away

521
00:32:56,373 --> 00:32:58,588
(Rongjin Memorial Hospital)

522
00:33:13,187 --> 00:33:15,685
Go ahead. It's already arranged.

523
00:33:18,915 --> 00:33:20,832
Get off the car quickly

524
00:33:29,898 --> 00:33:31,483
Mr. Shinjo

525
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:35,172
Head nurse, I'm sorry for bringing you into this.

526
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:38,681
-This-No, if I do this, if I get discovered...

527
00:33:38,895 --> 00:33:41,850
Do you know your situation?

528
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,755
- now the police are looking for you - i know

529
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:48,262
But I really want to see Yasheng

530
00:33:49,951 --> 00:33:51,737
I want to go see her

531
00:33:52,081 --> 00:33:55,003
I don't want her to think that she was abandoned by her father

532
00:33:55,069 --> 00:33:58,567
not loved by father

533
00:33:58,698 --> 00:34:00,928
I want to see her one last time

534
00:34:01,321 --> 00:34:04,350
Tell her daddy will always be there for her

535
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:08,109
Please...

536
00:34:09,372 --> 00:34:11,092
only five minutes

537
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:13,125
Thank you very much

538
00:34:13,682 --> 00:34:14,571
this

539
00:34:14,604 --> 00:34:16,307
I don't want this kind of thing

540
00:34:16,317 --> 00:34:18,134
Put this on quickly

541
00:34:18,196 --> 00:34:18,969
good

542
00:34:24,927 --> 00:34:26,680
This way

543
00:34:56,922 --> 00:34:58,675
sprout

544
00:35:05,524 --> 00:35:07,524
dad?

545
00:35:08,629 --> 00:35:11,352
Sorry for waking you up

546
00:35:13,124 --> 00:35:15,505
are you crying

547
00:35:17,296 --> 00:35:19,086
No

548
00:35:22,669 --> 00:35:24,397
have you heard

549
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:27,678
You can have surgery

550
00:35:28,917 --> 00:35:32,630
Wait until the surgery is done to restore health

551
00:35:33,376 --> 00:35:36,838
You can go to school like before

552
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,969
Played with friends

553
00:35:41,441 --> 00:35:43,180
dad

554
00:35:43,335 --> 00:35:46,745
Are you going somewhere else?

555
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:52,753
I want you to stay with me

556
00:35:59,306 --> 00:36:01,306
you will recover

557
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:07,180
You will definitely recover

558
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:09,986
So during this time

559
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:13,340
Dad will work hard for you

560
00:36:13,898 --> 00:36:15,542
Make money well

561
00:36:16,626 --> 00:36:18,549
make a lot of money

562
00:36:20,703 --> 00:36:22,442
Come back to pick you up

563
00:36:24,534 --> 00:36:26,209
dad

564
00:36:26,534 --> 00:36:30,332
You can buy me more dolls

565
00:36:34,174 --> 00:36:36,856
Xiong Xiong said he was only one person

566
00:36:36,887 --> 00:36:39,153
very lonely

567
00:36:44,188 --> 00:36:45,889
That's right

568
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,960
I see

569
00:36:50,136 --> 00:36:51,767
I see

570
00:36:52,123 --> 00:36:53,938
I promise you

571
00:36:54,806 --> 00:36:56,729
next time

572
00:36:57,443 --> 00:37:00,295
I will bring my bear friends with me

573
00:37:00,883 --> 00:37:02,790
Will definitely...

574
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:05,751
Will definitely come back to you

575
00:37:20,325 --> 00:37:22,325
thank you

576
00:37:32,976 --> 00:37:34,649
Gone

577
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:39,037
Yasheng will leave it to you.

578
00:37:55,426 --> 00:37:57,222
Go take that container truck

579
00:37:57,721 --> 00:37:59,533
The hiding place is prepared for you

580
00:37:59,533 --> 00:38:01,654
Just hide there

581
00:38:05,537 --> 00:38:07,483
so much money

582
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:14,777
Use the money to buy me a stuffed bear and put it next to Meisheng's bed

583
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:17,391
-I'll prepare.-No.

584
00:38:17,509 --> 00:38:20,013
My father has to buy this kind of thing himself

585
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:22,702
Even though it’s not my money

586
00:38:24,684 --> 00:38:27,141
Please pick something cute

587
00:38:27,527 --> 00:38:29,154
goodbye

588
00:39:07,133 --> 00:39:10,302
It's time for Xiao Lin to have breakfast

589
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:55,315
that

590
00:39:56,188 --> 00:39:58,507
do you want to eat

591
00:39:58,726 --> 00:40:00,390
this...

592
00:40:01,012 --> 00:40:03,300
Where is Xinzhuang?

593
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:05,552
No clues yet?

594
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:08,441
Sunouchi-senpai

595
00:40:10,154 --> 00:40:13,228
Drop me off here and give you all the money

596
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,070
Instead, just treat me as dead and buried on the mountain.

597
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,112
please

598
00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:20,214
I will take the money

599
00:40:20,449 --> 00:40:22,886
you will die too

00:40:30,038 --> 00:40:31,547
Masamune

601
00:40:31,614 --> 00:40:33,782
I will definitely escape

602
00:40:33,782 --> 00:40:35,477
Let's run away together

603
00:40:35,645 --> 00:40:37,129
Definitely want to meet again

604
00:40:37,129 --> 00:40:39,196
What if something happens?

605
00:40:39,196 --> 00:40:42,557
We'll figure it out by ourselves when the time comes.

606
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:52,654
There will be police ahead

607
00:40:53,745 --> 00:40:55,577
head nurse

608
00:40:55,594 --> 00:40:58,986
Please go directly to the police

609
00:40:59,103 --> 00:41:01,741
i might be killed

610
00:41:03,688 --> 00:41:05,520
Xinzhuang said?

611
00:41:07,081 --> 00:41:09,584
He just came to the hospital

612
00:41:10,103 --> 00:41:13,814
Emergency personnel were dispatched to Rongjin Memorial Hospital

613
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:19,239

614
00:41:19,507 --> 00:41:21,826
Excuse me

615
00:41:25,553 --> 00:41:28,336
-Please open the container. -Okay

616
00:41:36,771 --> 00:41:38,665
What's wrong?

617
00:41:45,778 --> 00:41:47,778
No exception

618
00:41:49,335 --> 00:41:51,335
Sorry, you can close it

619
00:41:51,461 --> 00:41:53,819
- wait a minute - yes

620
00:42:01,817 --> 00:42:04,196
Someone has been here before?

621
00:42:10,216 --> 00:42:12,922
It's near Xinzhuang Soso

622
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:13,864

Masamune

625
00:42:40,608 --> 00:42:42,376
Did you see it over there?

626
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,192
He must be nearby

627
00:43:05,626 --> 00:43:06,880
where are you

628
00:43:07,241 --> 00:43:09,220
Driving past

629
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:11,282
Almost to the lighthouse

630
00:43:11,347 --> 00:43:12,658
knew

631
00:43:40,448 --> 00:43:42,448
Shinjo

632
00:43:55,244 --> 00:43:56,775
The suspect was caught

633
00:44:00,302 --> 00:44:03,048

00:44:14,422 --> 00:44:16,673
(Enter a new chapter) He will definitely be killed this time

636
00:44:18,182 --> 00:44:20,182
Are we dead?

637
00:44:20,182 --> 00:44:22,649
(Revealing the real murderer of my parents) I remembered who killed my father

638
00:44:22,673 --> 00:44:25,020
Just think it was you who killed him

639
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:28,397
(Counterattack) Get the ransom ready. I want three billion.
