1
00:00:00,566 --> 00:00:02,870
It's the child she wants to kidnap

2
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:04,811
(I am a kidnapper) My name is Masamune Shinjo

3
00:00:04,811 --> 00:00:06,869
Became a kidnapper for some reason

4
00:00:06,869 --> 00:00:07,792
Who are you

5
00:00:07,792 --> 00:00:10,967
The Nanase Rin I kidnapped is a genius girl who has lost her memory.

6
00:00:10,979 --> 00:00:13,260
(Amnesiac genius girl) "Besides English, I can also speak other foreign languages"

7
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,586
"Do you understand what I'm saying?"

8
00:00:14,586 --> 00:00:15,944
Is this some kind of spell?

9
00:00:15,944 --> 00:00:18,589
Later I was involved in a shocking case

10
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:21,167
(The girl's parents were brutally murdered) The police are investigating the murder...

11
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:24,050
Xiao Lin's parents were actually killed

12
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,125
(Who is the real murderer) Is the murderer from the police?

13
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,237
suspect found

14
00:00:27,248 --> 00:00:30,301
(Mysterious man targeting girls) Xiaolin and I are investigating the truth of the murder case

15
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:31,949
But was attacked by a mysterious man

16
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,719
Then my missing wife suddenly appeared

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,469
(The missing wife appears) She is the one who suggested the kidnapping, Shiori

18
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:40,310
Meeting Nanase Rin’s sister for the first time

19
00:00:41,571 --> 00:00:43,507
(date of kidnapping)

20
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:49,296
It turns out you live nearby

21
00:00:49,328 --> 00:00:51,876
It’s more convenient to take care of buds here

22
00:00:51,876 --> 00:00:54,078
I recently rented this weekly apartment

23
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,525
Yeah

24
00:00:56,092 --> 00:00:58,145
Fortunately you are okay

25
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,875
What happened

26
00:00:59,907 --> 00:01:02,120
suddenly a man appeared

27
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:04,355
I want to take Xiao Lin away

28
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:06,634
Who is he?

29
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,602
Have you seen Xiao Lin?

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,402
There is no such auntie

31
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,754
Don't you have any clues?

32
00:01:13,818 --> 00:01:16,581
You were the one who planned this kidnapping, right?

33
00:01:16,581 --> 00:01:17,875
Did you tell her?

34
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,045
I've always wanted to ask

35
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:22,045
Why did you choose my house?

36
00:01:22,088 --> 00:01:25,564
Did you kill my parents?

37
00:01:27,415 --> 00:01:30,575
Order to carry pistols

38
00:01:30,586 --> 00:01:33,091
On the premise of giving priority to the safety of the hostages

39
00:01:33,112 --> 00:01:34,759
Just in case of emergencies

40
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,940
yes

41
00:01:36,892 --> 00:01:38,892
Pistol?

42
00:01:38,956 --> 00:01:43,170
This means that the headquarters thinks Xinzhuang is cruel, right?

43
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,052
A suspect in kidnapping and murder

44
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,105
In short, if you catch Xinzhuang, you will know all the truth.

45
00:01:50,105 --> 00:01:51,424
yes

46
00:01:51,681 --> 00:01:54,511
OK, I'll tell you

47
00:01:54,693 --> 00:01:57,512
I picked your parents

48
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,897
It's because they dare not call the police

49
00:02:00,474 --> 00:02:04,699
I heard that Director Nanase of Eishin Memorial Hospital

50
00:02:04,699 --> 00:02:06,562
Abuse daughter in private

51
00:02:06,576 --> 00:02:07,731
Hello

52
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,506
Right

53
00:02:09,656 --> 00:02:13,699
Don’t you remember? But your body should know

54
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:18,361
Yes indeed there is

55
00:02:18,376 --> 00:02:20,690
You pull me up to show her. Hurry up.

56
00:02:20,692 --> 00:02:22,686
If this kind of thing is exposed

57
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,923
The hospital's reputation will plummet.

58
00:02:25,385 --> 00:02:27,825
So I judged that he did not dare to call the police

59
00:02:27,876 --> 00:02:30,569
Do you think I would believe this?

60
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,762
That's your freedom

61
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:37,455
But I want to declare one thing

62
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:42,794
I didn't kill your parents

63
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:47,610
Not to mention the parents who killed Meupiao

64
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,610
I can't get the ransom.

65
00:02:49,623 --> 00:02:52,742
This is...wait a minute

66
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:58,779
So you didn’t get the ransom either?

67
00:02:58,841 --> 00:03:00,127
Of course

68
00:03:00,127 --> 00:03:02,277
What about Yasheng’s medical expenses?

69
00:03:02,327 --> 00:03:04,428
Didn't you pay for it?

70
00:03:04,428 --> 00:03:05,616
Medical expenses?

71
00:03:05,616 --> 00:03:08,328
Otherwise, who paid... strange...

72
00:03:10,163 --> 00:03:12,163
Right

73
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:14,968
Did you go take care of Meisheng?

74
00:03:15,157 --> 00:03:17,157
I didn't see you yesterday

75
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:19,233
Didn’t I ask you to accompany her?

76
00:03:19,245 --> 00:03:21,339
-I have a lot to do. -What are you busy with?

77
00:03:21,346 --> 00:03:23,360
There's nothing more important than children

78
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,224
don't yell

79
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:27,561
Neighbors will call the police

80
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:42,871
Use this money to stay in a hotel temporarily

81
00:03:43,418 --> 00:03:45,560
Okay Masamune

82
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,032
we want to live here

83
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,997
Have you seen the news?

84
00:03:52,997 --> 00:03:55,474
This guy is wanted now

85
00:03:55,474 --> 00:03:57,176
It's dangerous wherever you go

86
00:03:57,176 --> 00:03:58,925
Right Masamune?

87
00:04:00,744 --> 00:04:01,928
yes

88
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,267
I have accepted this. Please take care of me during this period.

89
00:04:08,303 --> 00:04:10,509
accomplice aunt

90
00:04:13,684 --> 00:04:17,044
I will leave temporarily starting tomorrow

91
00:04:17,044 --> 00:04:18,581
Research continues

92
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:20,474
Yes I understand

93
00:04:23,007 --> 00:04:27,071
Long time no see, Dr. Mizuhara

94
00:04:27,523 --> 00:04:30,009
This is a souvenir from Singapore for you

95
00:04:36,453 --> 00:04:39,245
You still have time to hang out here

96
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,912
The child hasn't been found yet

97
00:04:42,043 --> 00:04:45,846
Don't worry, you will definitely find her

98
00:04:46,178 --> 00:04:48,822
You don't seem to understand the seriousness of the matter

99
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:50,692
You are the one

100
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:55,612
Do you understand how many interests and people are involved behind this matter?

101
00:04:57,328 --> 00:04:58,848
In case of failure

102
00:04:58,896 --> 00:05:02,161
You've lost more than just your Ph.D. status

103
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:08,262
What is status?

104
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:13,435
I bet my life

105
00:05:14,636 --> 00:05:17,762
Stop talking nonsense and go find that kid

106
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,339
Don't be preempted by the police

107
00:05:24,226 --> 00:05:26,784
I didn't mean to argue

108
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:32,005
Let's live in peace with each other

109
00:06:00,153 --> 00:06:02,861
get up...

110
00:06:02,897 --> 00:06:05,128
Get up, get up, get up quickly

111
00:06:05,128 --> 00:06:08,378
-Get up, get up... -It hurts

112
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:11,039
what are you doing

113
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,363
What's your attitude? I woke you up out of kindness.

114
00:06:13,363 --> 00:06:16,075
-Won't you be gentler? -It's time to eat

115
00:06:17,714 --> 00:06:20,099
Please eat first

116
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:22,214
Well, little Rin, let’s eat it too

117
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:25,129
You eat first

118
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:28,711
I started

119
00:06:32,427 --> 00:06:35,288
-How's it going? - It's so hot and delicious.

120
00:06:35,304 --> 00:06:36,647
No

121
00:06:36,665 --> 00:06:39,483
Will your tongue be numb or make you feel dizzy?

122
00:06:39,514 --> 00:06:41,611
ah? what are you talking about

123
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:43,941
It's okay, eat quickly

124
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:54,232
What are you doing again?

125
00:07:01,017 --> 00:07:03,017
I started

126
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:07,353
Wow, this seasoning is too salty.

127
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:09,201
Auntie, do you still have a sense of taste?

128
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,764
How about it

129
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,900
I really miss the miso soup you cooked

130
00:07:13,922 --> 00:07:16,675
Do you like this taste?

131
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,495
Relaxed physically and mentally

132
00:07:18,641 --> 00:07:20,191
delicious

133
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:24,718
I'm going out to work later

134
00:07:24,998 --> 00:07:27,450
During this time, please stay at home.

135
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,753
Yeah I will

136
00:07:28,753 --> 00:07:29,892
Did you hear Xiaolin?

137
00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:33,217
Auntie, I want to ask you a favor

138
00:07:33,217 --> 00:07:35,295
give me a mobile phone

139
00:07:35,306 --> 00:07:36,769
cell phone?

140
00:07:39,647 --> 00:07:42,355
Hello...

141
00:07:42,971 --> 00:07:44,859
Didn’t you say you should stay at home?

142
00:07:44,938 --> 00:07:47,855
I didn't agree

143
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:49,867
It's dangerous to go outside

144
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:53,104
of course i know

145
00:07:53,137 --> 00:07:56,893
But something more dangerous may happen if this continues

146
00:08:01,985 --> 00:08:05,275
Judging from your current income and expenditure...

147
00:08:05,324 --> 00:08:09,611
Efficient application and risk management are very important

148
00:08:09,634 --> 00:08:13,613
What is more dangerous to feed?

149
00:08:14,296 --> 00:08:16,870
You shouldn't be doubting Xi Li, right?

150
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,678
Reasons to doubt her

151
00:08:18,678 --> 00:08:21,396
More than not doubting her

152
00:08:26,295 --> 00:08:28,295
What do you want a cell phone for?

153
00:08:29,763 --> 00:08:33,418
The day of the kidnapping was July 8th

154
00:08:33,566 --> 00:08:36,828
Contemporaneous with the kidnapping

155
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:40,716
Nanase and his wife were also killed

156
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:48,028
The murder weapon that killed the dean was the samurai sword decorated in the house

157
00:08:48,258 --> 00:08:51,433
The wife is a letter opener

158
00:08:52,102 --> 00:08:55,634
Katana and letter opener...

159
00:08:55,772 --> 00:08:58,405
Do you see what they have in common?

160
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:01,839
Completely different murder weapon

161
00:09:01,885 --> 00:09:06,443
Neither of these murder weapons were brought in from outside.

162
00:09:06,804 --> 00:09:08,804
I see

163
00:09:09,272 --> 00:09:10,984
so what

164
00:09:35,952 --> 00:09:38,499
Xiaolin, does your head hurt?

165
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,468
Did you remember something?

166
00:09:47,326 --> 00:09:49,326
Xiao Lin, this is...

167
00:09:49,985 --> 00:09:51,985
Monitor?

168
00:09:52,412 --> 00:09:54,342
Don't you think it's strange?

169
00:09:54,342 --> 00:09:56,290
Just call this monitor

170
00:09:56,309 --> 00:09:59,413
You should know what happened on the day of the murder, right?

171
00:10:00,276 --> 00:10:02,026
I see

172
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,797
You are right

173
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:06,678
Do you really understand?

174
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,672
please wait

175
00:10:14,802 --> 00:10:18,618
Sunouchi-senpai, this is Mr. Matsuda from the security company.

176
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,163
-Ito-senpai-What's going on?

177
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,732
There seemed to be some public quarrel yesterday

178
00:10:23,732 --> 00:10:26,941
This is the guard's body video, can you see it?

179
00:10:27,286 --> 00:10:29,154
Why don't you watch it yourself?

180
00:10:30,395 --> 00:10:32,635
Because you sit in my seat

181
00:10:32,635 --> 00:10:35,116
- Can you take a look? - What's going on?

182
00:10:35,276 --> 00:10:40,399
I have been a guard at Rongjin Memorial Hospital for a long time

183
00:10:40,547 --> 00:10:42,253
about a year ago

184
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:46,684
Dean Nanase Mamoru asked me to serve as his residential security guard as well.

185
00:10:46,703 --> 00:10:49,214
How long is it?

186
00:10:49,214 --> 00:10:52,214
Plus one makes it thirty years faster

187
00:10:52,214 --> 00:10:55,342
Thirty years is really very senior.

188
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:58,048
The dean must trust you very much

189
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,222
Even ask you to be the security guard at the residence

190
00:11:00,222 --> 00:11:01,547
Don't dare to take it

191
00:11:01,563 --> 00:11:05,025
I personally rarely talk to the dean

192
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,394
It should be based on my performance in the company.

193
00:11:08,187 --> 00:11:10,423
That's it, that's it

194
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,811
I want to ask

195
00:11:12,811 --> 00:11:17,170
Why were the monitors in the dean’s house removed?

196
00:11:17,182 --> 00:11:20,283
Yes, that was not long ago

197
00:11:20,324 --> 00:11:23,935
The dean asked me to dismantle it

198
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:24,798
tear down?

199
00:11:24,795 --> 00:11:26,702
When was that?

200
00:11:26,702 --> 00:11:28,382
July 5th

201
00:11:28,975 --> 00:11:30,975
He said he wanted to switch to a monitor from another company.

202
00:11:30,975 --> 00:11:32,962
Ask me to dismantle the one I'm using now

203
00:11:34,187 --> 00:11:37,182
What about the previous images?

204
00:11:37,182 --> 00:11:42,586
The dean asked me to delete them all

205
00:11:42,632 --> 00:11:44,357
all?

206
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:47,089
So nothing is left?

207
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:49,730
Sorry I can't help

208
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,337
It doesn't matter

209
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,372
Can I go then?

210
00:11:55,577 --> 00:11:58,662
Okay, thank you for your cooperation

211
00:11:59,323 --> 00:12:01,323
I'll take you out

212
00:12:03,737 --> 00:12:05,440
Right

213
00:12:05,486 --> 00:12:08,172
Where were you on July 8th?

214
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,485
No. 8?

215
00:12:09,485 --> 00:12:11,142
This is a routine inquiry

216
00:12:11,142 --> 00:12:15,480
I patrol the hospital as usual from morning to six o'clock in the evening

217
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,922
Go see your high school classmates after get off work

218
00:12:18,922 --> 00:12:21,563
The two drank until morning

219
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:26,167
Can you give us the name and contact information of that friend?

220
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:27,635
OK

221
00:12:29,434 --> 00:12:31,297
so unlucky

222
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:34,317
Maybe we can know the truth if we have surveillance video.

223
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:37,832
Do you think it's a coincidence?

224
00:12:39,517 --> 00:12:42,852
Murders and kidnappings occurred immediately after the monitors were removed

225
00:12:42,852 --> 00:12:45,676
And none of the previous files have been left behind.

226
00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:48,967
It is indeed too beneficial for the murderer

227
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:51,196
Sunouchi-senpai, please take a look.

228
00:12:51,196 --> 00:12:55,256
There seemed to be a fight in the West District yesterday

229
00:12:56,098 --> 00:12:58,784
I don’t know if this is a body-worn video.

230
00:12:59,422 --> 00:13:02,161
Could this person be...

231
00:13:02,161 --> 00:13:04,093
It's him

232
00:13:09,514 --> 00:13:12,200
Hello, is that okay?

233
00:13:12,474 --> 00:13:14,634
It's time for us to go back

234
00:13:14,702 --> 00:13:17,343
By the way, what is your relationship?

235
00:13:18,596 --> 00:13:20,551
You and aunt

236
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,446
Your personalities are completely different

237
00:13:23,446 --> 00:13:25,407
How do we know each other?

238
00:13:25,407 --> 00:13:27,270
So what if we know each other?

239
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:31,492
Where did you first meet? Who spoke to you first?

240
00:13:31,525 --> 00:13:34,076
Is it you or her?

241
00:13:34,576 --> 00:13:37,972
-Who confesses first? -You are the gossip reporter.

242
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,476
haven't seen you for a long time

243
00:13:40,476 --> 00:13:42,476
i have been waiting for you

244
00:13:42,476 --> 00:13:44,295
- Come over there - OK

245
00:13:48,691 --> 00:13:52,842
Who is he smiling so happily?

246
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:57,258
So when and where did you meet?

247
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:02,023
When I was a child, I was in a kindergarten

248
00:14:02,388 --> 00:14:05,175
Neither Xili nor I have parents

249
00:14:06,106 --> 00:14:10,706
I used to be a crybaby and a clumsy person

250
00:14:10,814 --> 00:14:15,257
Xiori is very reliable and smart.

251
00:14:15,873 --> 00:14:19,276
She often teaches me how to read

252
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:22,603
Will also play with me

253
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,250
- It seems - It seems?

254
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,891
I don't remember much about that time.

255
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:30,977
I get a headache every time I think about it

256
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:35,401
Definitely not a good memory

257
00:14:40,068 --> 00:14:43,510
Our fate has been with us since then

258
00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:45,426
Do you want to eat?

259
00:14:46,766 --> 00:14:48,213
If you don’t want it, don’t want it.

260
00:14:56,384 --> 00:14:57,123
How about it

261
00:14:57,123 --> 00:14:58,621
I got the eyewitness testimony

262
00:14:58,621 --> 00:15:01,350
It seems to be Xinzhuang and a child who looks like Xiaolin

263
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:04,485
And there was a woman in her thirties or forties next to her.

264
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:05,904
woman?

265
00:15:06,045 --> 00:15:07,903
An accomplice of Xinzhuang?

266
00:15:19,147 --> 00:15:20,307
she's gone

267
00:15:20,322 --> 00:15:21,725
Follow up quickly

268
00:15:22,565 --> 00:15:24,109
It's a university hospital

269
00:15:24,235 --> 00:15:25,692
hurry up

270
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,927
It doesn't look like a date

271
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:33,367
Needless to say

272
00:15:33,414 --> 00:15:35,705
Shiori wouldn't do that...

273
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:37,179
who knows

274
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:40,894
We are nominally husband and wife, but you have been living apart.

275
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:44,701
Xiao Lin, please stop making trouble.

276
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,177
Hello

277
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,692
You still doubt me

278
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:06,936
No, you misunderstood

279
00:16:06,936 --> 00:16:08,629
Of course I still doubt it

280
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,407
Your whole person is suspicious

281
00:16:14,566 --> 00:16:17,101
They might betray us to the police.

282
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,204
Hello

283
00:16:19,297 --> 00:16:21,297
Who was that person just now?

284
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:24,540
why go to hospital

285
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,113
besides

286
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:36,995
The medicine you took in the morning

287
00:16:39,948 --> 00:16:44,957
Is this a traditional Chinese medicine that improves the body’s self-healing ability?

288
00:16:44,988 --> 00:16:45,846
What

289
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,120
Why take this medicine

290
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,485
Can't answer?

291
00:16:54,277 --> 00:16:56,334
Then let me change the question

292
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:05,756
Where were you and what were you doing on July 8th?

293
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,425
8 days?

294
00:17:08,448 --> 00:17:09,815
It was the day of the kidnapping

295
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:14,090
This person has something he didn't say

296
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,850
yes

297
00:17:20,965 --> 00:17:23,112
do you really want to know

298
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,864
I...

299
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,048
The police at that time

300
00:17:38,285 --> 00:17:40,285
Was it you who called me here?

301
00:17:43,837 --> 00:17:47,132
Sorry for the unexpected visit because you are not in the office and had to come here.

302
00:17:47,156 --> 00:17:48,578
What's the matter

303
00:17:48,873 --> 00:17:52,049
Can we come inside to talk?

304
00:17:52,219 --> 00:17:53,741
Just say it here

305
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:55,286
Ms. Xinzhuang

306
00:17:55,327 --> 00:17:59,064
You should know that your husband is involved in the kidnapping case, right?

307
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:01,633
To prevent neighbors from gossiping

308
00:18:01,684 --> 00:18:03,037
Let's go inside

309
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:04,619
Sunouchi-senpai

310
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,121
Sunouchi-senpai

311
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,414
what do you want to ask

312
00:18:18,577 --> 00:18:22,363
There was a fight in the street yesterday

313
00:18:22,444 --> 00:18:25,445
A man who witnessed the scene said

314
00:18:25,556 --> 00:18:28,297
That person is suspected to be Mr. Xinzhuang who is on the run

315
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:32,979
And that person also brought a girl with him

316
00:18:33,008 --> 00:18:36,898
We suspect she is Nanase Rin

317
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:38,567
Then what

318
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:39,470
Then...

319
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:42,990
In fact, besides them, I also saw

320
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,951
another woman

321
00:18:46,086 --> 00:18:48,258
I would like to ask out of necessity

322
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:50,824
Where were you last night?

323
00:18:50,841 --> 00:18:55,420
Yesterday...I was at home

324
00:18:55,725 --> 00:18:58,275
Is there anything to prove?

325
00:18:58,835 --> 00:19:00,595
I live alone

326
00:19:00,595 --> 00:19:04,128
There are no monitors in this apartment either.

327
00:19:04,128 --> 00:19:08,614
There seems to be nothing to prove

328
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,252
Yeah

329
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,996
By the way, let me ask you where person No. 8 is.

330
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,996
No. 8?

331
00:19:15,996 --> 00:19:17,809
I can't remember it for a moment

332
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,759
It doesn't matter if you think about it slowly

333
00:19:20,912 --> 00:19:24,533
We're willing to wait until you remember

334
00:19:36,766 --> 00:19:38,902
This room is so beautiful

335
00:19:39,343 --> 00:19:41,395
The environment is very quiet

336
00:19:41,463 --> 00:19:43,944
It seems very comfortable to live in

337
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:52,375
What's wrong, senior?

338
00:19:55,242 --> 00:19:57,736
Have any guests been here?

339
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,376
Feel sorry

340
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,731
I went to the hospital

341
00:20:12,648 --> 00:20:14,562
I remembered

342
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:16,600
July 8th

343
00:20:16,637 --> 00:20:20,123
I was in the hospital all day because I felt unwell

344
00:20:20,683 --> 00:20:22,683
Hospital?

345
00:20:24,142 --> 00:20:28,753
I am infected with HIV

346
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:30,787
HIV？

347
00:20:43,122 --> 00:20:45,871
human immunodeficiency virus

348
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:50,952
After infection, the body’s immunity will be reduced

349
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,094
However, with proper treatment

350
00:20:55,094 --> 00:20:57,297
It’s not contagious everywhere

351
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:00,421
Can live like ordinary people

352
00:21:00,421 --> 00:21:03,248
You don't have to be afraid

353
00:21:05,691 --> 00:21:09,019
Just because of this disease

354
00:21:09,036 --> 00:21:13,778
I feel uncomfortable when exposed to the sun

355
00:21:14,085 --> 00:21:18,539
Doing housework is also very tiring, so you accumulate dishes

356
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,340
Have you finished asking?

357
00:21:28,172 --> 00:21:32,152
If you want to continue the investigation, please bring out a writ.

358
00:21:32,186 --> 00:21:35,114
Okay, I'm very sorry.

359
00:21:36,403 --> 00:21:37,939
err on the side of caution

360
00:21:37,939 --> 00:21:40,586
We will check your hospital records

361
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,327
please

362
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:56,566
Oh, I never thought she had such a hidden secret

363
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,361
senior?

364
00:22:01,227 --> 00:22:02,763
Let's go

365
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,435
yes

366
00:22:05,385 --> 00:22:07,196
Xi Li is talking

367
00:22:08,112 --> 00:22:09,791
It's okay

368
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:13,033
I take medicine and there's nothing wrong with it

369
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:16,840
Why don't you say when it happened?

370
00:22:17,213 --> 00:22:19,213
Have had it since childhood

371
00:22:19,365 --> 00:22:21,365
It seems to be a vertical infection from mother to child

372
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:22,969
mother and son...

373
00:22:24,191 --> 00:22:26,765
I discovered it three years ago

374
00:22:26,765 --> 00:22:29,157
Because the cold has never been cured

375
00:22:29,157 --> 00:22:32,690
I only found out after doing a blood test.

376
00:22:33,674 --> 00:22:37,290
If you say that, wouldn't it be okay for Yasheng to...

377
00:22:37,307 --> 00:22:39,222
Yasheng is fine

378
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:41,966
She has had a test and it was negative

379
00:22:41,989 --> 00:22:43,507
Yeah

380
00:22:45,408 --> 00:22:47,851
But why

381
00:22:47,885 --> 00:22:50,873
Why didn't you tell me

382
00:22:51,043 --> 00:22:52,699
If I said

383
00:22:55,023 --> 00:22:57,158
Can you still abandon me?

384
00:23:02,503 --> 00:23:05,320
you won't abandon me

385
00:23:05,948 --> 00:23:07,948
Definitely not

386
00:23:14,118 --> 00:23:16,995
Even if I say I'm fine

387
00:23:17,157 --> 00:23:22,131
You will also worry about staying with me all the time, right?

388
00:23:23,175 --> 00:23:25,248
Would rather stay awake

389
00:23:25,661 --> 00:23:29,733
Sacrifice yourself to accompany me

390
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,682
You are too gentle Masamune

391
00:23:42,676 --> 00:23:46,834
I don't want to see you become like that

392
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,632
and

393
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:52,803
I don’t want Yasheng to be with you either

394
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:56,551
See how sick I am

395
00:24:10,776 --> 00:24:12,672
This is...

396
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:17,995
I never forget my family

397
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:20,874
Sorry for hiding this from you

398
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:26,409
Sorry for ruining our happiness

399
00:24:26,594 --> 00:24:30,590
But at the time I thought

400
00:24:31,247 --> 00:24:34,978
This is the best approach

401
00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:40,484
I didn’t expect that I would end up involving you in the end.

402
00:24:40,505 --> 00:24:43,362
I'm really sorry

403
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:51,309
It's not too late now

404
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:53,687
I will surrender

405
00:24:55,084 --> 00:24:57,575
It all started because of me

406
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
I have to end it

407
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,459
no...

408
00:25:02,592 --> 00:25:05,039
you did nothing

409
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,465
This kidnapping was planned by me alone

410
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,465
I did it myself

411
00:25:11,486 --> 00:25:13,044
Masamune

412
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:17,685
Xi Li... you go and accompany Mei Sheng.

413
00:25:17,755 --> 00:25:21,011
You must accompany her this time, okay?

414
00:25:24,636 --> 00:25:26,026
Do you want to leave here?

415
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:27,213
That's right

416
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,574
Gone, gone

417
00:25:29,774 --> 00:25:31,929
Go faster. Go faster.

418
00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:33,797
Xiaolin, we should go

419
00:25:33,886 --> 00:25:37,277
Don't cause any more trouble to Xi Li

420
00:25:37,277 --> 00:25:38,874
hurry up...

421
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:40,785
Get up and walk well

422
00:25:40,785 --> 00:25:42,432
Masamune

423
00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:46,029
hope one day

424
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,665
We can still live together as three of us

425
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:57,185
And you

426
00:25:57,873 --> 00:26:00,119
Actually, I also want to have a good chat with you.

427
00:26:00,133 --> 00:26:01,890
last question

428
00:26:02,231 --> 00:26:05,571
Was I really being abused?

429
00:26:06,697 --> 00:26:09,195
I don’t know the details either.

430
00:26:09,871 --> 00:26:11,334
only

431
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:15,140
Dean Nanase seems to be doing some kind of research

432
00:26:15,901 --> 00:26:17,705
Research...

433
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:22,726
Maybe you are also related to that research

434
00:26:26,951 --> 00:26:28,951
Let's go, let's go

435
00:26:29,007 --> 00:26:31,165
hurry up...

436
00:26:31,184 --> 00:26:32,973
Gone...

437
00:26:32,973 --> 00:26:37,346
No one knows what kind of research Dean Nanase is doing.

438
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:41,523
He is simply a research maniac

439
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,255
mad Men?

440
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,404
Sometimes research is more important than internal affairs

441
00:26:48,438 --> 00:26:50,224
- right - yes

442
00:26:50,435 --> 00:26:55,043
By the way, the dean suddenly took a long leave recently.

443
00:26:55,043 --> 00:26:58,138
I was scheduled to go to Singapore next month

444
00:26:58,138 --> 00:26:59,954
Singapore?

445
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:07,867
Are you going to attend a society or a family trip?

446
00:27:07,896 --> 00:27:11,283
I didn’t know that the dean hated attending the society.

447
00:27:11,295 --> 00:27:14,733
It doesn’t feel like a family trip either.

448
00:27:16,045 --> 00:27:18,402
Tell you secretly

449
00:27:18,581 --> 00:27:23,398
I heard that the relationship between the dean and his wife is not good.

450
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:25,198
physician

451
00:27:33,975 --> 00:27:36,193
Oh, it’s Matsuda

452
00:27:37,027 --> 00:27:41,011
Would you like a cup of coffee after the examination?

453
00:27:45,244 --> 00:27:48,375
Is he Mr. Matsuda who also serves as the security guard at the dean's residence?

454
00:27:50,067 --> 00:27:52,087
The performance must be excellent

455
00:27:52,127 --> 00:27:54,408
Only the dean would entrust him to be the security guard of the residence.

456
00:27:54,408 --> 00:27:58,511
That's because Matsuda worked hard to recommend himself

457
00:28:00,797 --> 00:28:03,138
You even came here to ask me a favor

458
00:28:03,178 --> 00:28:05,704
Help him connect with the dean?

459
00:28:11,249 --> 00:28:14,261
I also suddenly wanted to drink coffee. Would you like another cup, doctor?

460
00:28:14,261 --> 00:28:17,471
- Matsuda? - It’s different from what he said

461
00:28:18,147 --> 00:28:20,428
I confirmed with the travel agency

462
00:28:20,428 --> 00:28:23,697
He did have three tickets booked to fly to Singapore

463
00:28:23,697 --> 00:28:25,296
Singapore?

464
00:28:25,674 --> 00:28:27,694
So are we going as a family of three?

465
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:30,765
Not by name, it’s Dean Nanase and Xiao Rin

466
00:28:30,765 --> 00:28:33,727
The other person is Dr. Mizuhara

467
00:28:34,323 --> 00:28:36,814
Going abroad not with your wife but with Dr. Mizuhara?

468
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:38,789
Going to Singapore?

469
00:28:38,828 --> 00:28:40,768
Go and ask about it

470
00:28:40,768 --> 00:28:43,661
Dr. Mizuhara seems to have lost contact.

471
00:28:43,661 --> 00:28:46,523
Even the employees of the consortium don’t know where she is.

472
00:28:46,523 --> 00:28:48,783
Hiding your whereabouts?

473
00:28:48,803 --> 00:28:51,063
There is another strange thing

474
00:28:51,102 --> 00:28:54,164
The person who ordered the air tickets was not the dean himself.

475
00:28:54,164 --> 00:28:57,057
But Mr. Yamazaki, the legal adviser

476
00:28:57,256 --> 00:28:59,177
Yamazaki?

477
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:10,806
ok thank you

478
00:29:10,852 --> 00:29:13,145
-thank you-walk slowly

479
00:29:14,124 --> 00:29:18,038
Boss, I want a Suwa special sandwich.

480
00:29:18,072 --> 00:29:20,292
-One of Suwa's special sandwiches is good-Next news

481
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:24,754
It has been five days since the kidnapping case of Nanase Rin occurred

482
00:29:24,754 --> 00:29:29,820
-The police have disclosed the appearance of the male suspect... -This matter has not been resolved yet.

483
00:29:29,855 --> 00:29:32,336
The world is so chaotic now

484
00:29:32,853 --> 00:29:37,629
-Seriously, this murderer is really hateful... -Yeah

485
00:29:37,927 --> 00:29:40,324
Your Suwa Special Sandwich is ready

486
00:29:40,324 --> 00:29:42,182
-Add 50 yuan and you will get a cup of coffee - no need

487
00:29:42,202 --> 00:29:44,263
- I charge you one thousand yuan - no need to look for it

488
00:29:44,288 --> 00:29:46,205
Thank you for visiting

489
00:29:53,352 --> 00:29:54,909
long wait

490
00:29:54,929 --> 00:29:57,187
If you're hungry, take it.

491
00:29:57,605 --> 00:29:59,573
Eat quickly

492
00:30:01,389 --> 00:30:05,353
Am I a bad boy?

493
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:09,312
Being beaten like this

494
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:12,549
Is it because I'm not good?

495
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,463
How is it possible

496
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,845
Children are irreplaceable treasures of their parents

497
00:30:20,302 --> 00:30:22,747
How could it hurt you?

498
00:30:23,403 --> 00:30:25,502
I never believe it

499
00:30:27,907 --> 00:30:30,170
those bruises

500
00:30:30,468 --> 00:30:36,436
Maybe you were injured because you had too much fun with your father

501
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:41,557
Don't be afraid, it will be fine

502
00:30:47,202 --> 00:30:48,821
Xiao Lin

503
00:30:49,298 --> 00:30:53,619
You still want to go home

504
00:30:53,778 --> 00:30:56,550
Go back quickly

505
00:30:56,909 --> 00:30:58,443
go to school

506
00:30:58,443 --> 00:31:02,129
Playing with good friends like that

507
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:05,879
Why are you talking about this?

508
00:31:08,762 --> 00:31:14,229
Although you are doubting the police

509
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:18,511
But they're not all bad guys, right?

510
00:31:18,729 --> 00:31:22,672
There will also be people in the police who are trustworthy.

511
00:31:22,712 --> 00:31:24,549
You can ask him for help

512
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,734
Masamune, do you want to surrender?

513
00:31:28,827 --> 00:31:29,876
Did I hit the mark?

514
00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:32,507
Acting cool in front of aunt and running out

515
00:31:32,612 --> 00:31:34,612
Are you going to turn yourself in as a result?

516
00:31:34,904 --> 00:31:37,211
We can't escape anymore

517
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:39,577
Now there are eyes and ears everywhere

518
00:31:39,621 --> 00:31:42,850
Do you want to sleep outdoors and eat instant noodles every day?

519
00:31:42,881 --> 00:31:44,421
So you have to surrender?

520
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:46,899
Are you in pain too?

521
00:31:46,957 --> 00:31:48,633
Why not ask the police for help

522
00:31:48,633 --> 00:31:50,522
Go to the doctor to get your memory back...

523
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:52,235
Stop pretending to care about me

524
00:31:52,338 --> 00:31:54,967
If it's for my own good, help me

525
00:31:55,033 --> 00:31:56,285
I?

526
00:31:57,362 --> 00:31:59,066
what can i do

527
00:31:59,066 --> 00:32:00,498
Then surrender yourself

528
00:32:00,564 --> 00:32:03,029
Even if it's just me, I have to find the murderer

529
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:05,029
Revenge for parents

530
00:32:10,492 --> 00:32:12,939
Wait wait a minute

531
00:32:13,126 --> 00:32:15,053
Want to find the murderer?

532
00:32:15,084 --> 00:32:16,916
Even the police are having trouble

533
00:32:16,926 --> 00:32:19,051
How can we do it with just the two of us?

534
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,083
- I can - impossible

535
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:23,083
Can't escape anymore

536
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:24,699
I really want to be good for you

537
00:32:25,283 --> 00:32:28,868
If I really want to be good to you, I should stop here.

538
00:32:29,542 --> 00:32:30,923
See this for yourself

539
00:32:31,379 --> 00:32:35,030
Look, everyone is looking for this face everywhere now

540
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,141
Find this face

541
00:32:37,621 --> 00:32:40,442
I have a history of murder

542
00:32:40,484 --> 00:32:44,222
He is a major criminal who is regarded as a thorn in the side of the country.

543
00:32:44,233 --> 00:32:47,386
So what, I have nothing

544
00:32:47,386 --> 00:32:50,417
Mom and Dad were killed and terrible things happened all the time.

545
00:32:50,431 --> 00:32:52,893
Can't rely on the police to remember anything

546
00:32:52,893 --> 00:32:54,893
i have nothing

547
00:32:55,365 --> 00:32:57,916
nothing but you

548
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:01,378
I can only believe you

549
00:33:01,378 --> 00:33:04,620
But you said it was for my own good?

550
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,488
That's why it's for your daughter's sake

551
00:33:06,488 --> 00:33:08,488
you don't care about me at all

552
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:11,427
You never worried about me after you took me away

553
00:33:18,727 --> 00:33:21,387
I see...

554
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:23,859
it's all my fault

555
00:33:24,552 --> 00:33:26,303
sorry

556
00:33:27,615 --> 00:33:30,044
but i swear to you

557
00:33:30,103 --> 00:33:31,674
I'll take you with me from now on

558
00:33:32,869 --> 00:33:36,815
There's never a time when I don't worry about you

559
00:33:37,304 --> 00:33:39,304
Even now

560
00:33:40,971 --> 00:33:43,311
But I'm scared

561
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:48,056
Because I can't do anything

562
00:33:49,163 --> 00:33:52,567
Just say you'll protect me

563
00:33:54,854 --> 00:33:56,854
I will protect you

564
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:00,697
I will protect Xiaolin for sure

565
00:34:00,903 --> 00:34:02,542
Really

566
00:34:02,831 --> 00:34:04,688
I promise

567
00:34:06,325 --> 00:34:08,325
OK, then I'll leave it to you

568
00:34:08,351 --> 00:34:09,666
Let's go

569
00:34:16,029 --> 00:34:17,405
That's right

570
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:21,033
The dean asked me to book those air tickets.

571
00:34:21,047 --> 00:34:23,333
Why did Dean Nanase go to Singapore?

572
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:24,907
have no idea

573
00:34:24,907 --> 00:34:27,635
I just do what he says

574
00:34:27,635 --> 00:34:30,246
That's really strange

575
00:34:30,298 --> 00:34:33,306
Dean Nanase Mamoru is a research madman and a secretist

576
00:34:33,306 --> 00:34:35,982
Keep a distance from people around you and hate coming into contact with people

577
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:40,434
Such a dean actually trusts you so much

578
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:46,138
Indeed compared to others

579
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:49,068
We are relatively close

580
00:34:51,474 --> 00:34:55,289
Have you known the dean for a long time?

581
00:34:57,497 --> 00:35:01,707
I used to be the eldest lady's tutor

582
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:04,082
Have you ever taught Xiaolin how to read?

583
00:35:04,108 --> 00:35:06,017
She doesn't need anyone else's guidance

584
00:35:07,168 --> 00:35:09,633
I'm just helping

585
00:35:11,457 --> 00:35:14,878
She was taught by experts in various fields

586
00:35:15,098 --> 00:35:18,106
-Various fields? -She's no ordinary eight-year-old

587
00:35:18,145 --> 00:35:20,597
Proficient in more than 20 languages

588
00:35:20,597 --> 00:35:23,140
Others like mathematical physics

589
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,972
Medical quantum mechanics and more

590
00:35:24,972 --> 00:35:28,071
Comparable to top research scholars in various subjects

591
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:32,224
He is the youngest child in the country to join Mensa

592
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:37,330
Who is Xiao Lin?

593
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:40,440
At least

594
00:35:40,531 --> 00:35:43,870
It's not an existence we can imagine

595
00:35:57,774 --> 00:36:02,256
Mamoru has always regarded you as an errand boy.

596
00:36:02,596 --> 00:36:07,206
Bossing you around

597
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:13,046
I can only sigh from the side

598
00:36:13,127 --> 00:36:14,784
I don't care

599
00:36:14,784 --> 00:36:17,953
Thanks to this, I learned a lot

600
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,827
yes

601
00:36:21,232 --> 00:36:25,332
you are indeed strong

602
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:29,286
is a smart man

603
00:36:32,506 --> 00:36:34,506
Then again

604
00:36:35,081 --> 00:36:38,837
Who killed Mamoru?

605
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:42,035
do you have any clues

606
00:36:47,345 --> 00:36:49,045
It doesn't matter

607
00:36:49,066 --> 00:36:52,062
I don't care about this kind of thing at all

608
00:36:56,071 --> 00:36:57,487
Xiao Lin?

609
00:36:58,041 --> 00:37:00,189
He seems to be a very special child

610
00:37:00,189 --> 00:37:03,312
Maybe it has something to do with Dean Nanase’s research

611
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:07,020
Once we find out, Lesson 1 will take over the investigation.

612
00:37:07,084 --> 00:37:08,694
another injury

613
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:11,058
The investigators were very dissatisfied

614
00:37:11,058 --> 00:37:13,421
Said you were handling the case without permission

615
00:37:14,018 --> 00:37:16,146
I obviously shared information

616
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:20,368
The information is very useful and I thank you very much.

617
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:23,884
But you also need to think about organizational norms

618
00:37:23,968 --> 00:37:26,246
Just upholding justice does not mean you can act arbitrarily

619
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:27,496
Qin

620
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:29,710
Have you forgotten why you were transferred?

621
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,661
Senior has obtained the witness information of the suspect.

622
00:37:34,661 --> 00:37:36,280
In Nagisa Water Park

623
00:37:36,642 --> 00:37:38,252
Hello...

624
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:41,148
This costs 50,000

625
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,901
Xiaolin...

626
00:37:44,068 --> 00:37:46,934
Do you think it is meat?

627
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:49,662
It’s only half price. Half price.

628
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:52,201
I’ll use this to cook the ingredients today.

629
00:37:54,014 --> 00:37:55,357
How much is this

630
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:57,018
300,000

631
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,530
Give him 300,000

632
00:37:59,658 --> 00:38:01,251
300,000?

633
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,019
300,000 here

634
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:09,202
Why does it hurt so much?

635
00:38:09,437 --> 00:38:11,827
Maybe you can use it for self-defense

636
00:38:11,827 --> 00:38:13,827
I've confirmed it with witnesses.

637
00:38:13,827 --> 00:38:15,954
It seems that it is indeed Xinzhuang and Xiaolin

638
00:38:15,954 --> 00:38:16,958
They went that way

639
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:18,744
I'd better go look for any clues.

640
00:38:18,744 --> 00:38:19,952
yes

641
00:38:25,234 --> 00:38:28,177
(1,500 yen per night if available today)

642
00:38:28,313 --> 00:38:29,885
I'll go in first

643
00:38:29,899 --> 00:38:32,098
See if it is suitable for two people to live in

644
00:38:32,225 --> 00:38:35,070
Do you hear me if you stay here?

645
00:38:37,297 --> 00:38:38,987
I want to accommodate two people

646
00:38:38,987 --> 00:38:40,874
-Three thousand yuan -Three thousand?

647
00:38:42,292 --> 00:38:43,925
Tomio Nanase

648
00:38:43,971 --> 00:38:47,187
Vice Chairman of Rongjin Memorial Hospital

649
00:38:47,203 --> 00:38:48,885
Three thousand yuan

650
00:38:54,897 --> 00:38:56,742
This person...

651
00:39:05,816 --> 00:39:08,070
Lawyer Yamazaki...

652
00:39:08,089 --> 00:39:10,317
Isn’t it just a child that can’t be counted as two thousand?

653
00:39:10,362 --> 00:39:12,044
Do you want to live in Sanqian?

654
00:39:12,053 --> 00:39:13,171
Three thousand?

655
00:39:18,761 --> 00:39:21,169
The room was surprisingly good

656
00:39:26,272 --> 00:39:29,159
Hey Xiaolin?

657
00:39:29,685 --> 00:39:31,373
Xiao Lin

658
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,416
Xiao Lin

659
00:39:41,026 --> 00:39:43,697
Xiaolin...

660
00:39:47,482 --> 00:39:49,182
Hello

661
00:39:49,452 --> 00:39:51,849
It's you again, you want to treat Xiao Lin...

662
00:40:02,354 --> 00:40:04,154
Xiaolin...

663
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:11,288
Professor Masamune Shinjo

664
00:40:11,472 --> 00:40:13,288
please leave

665
00:40:13,897 --> 00:40:16,179
how do you know my name

666
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:19,639
please leave

667
00:40:22,446 --> 00:40:24,939
I just promised Xiaolin today

668
00:40:26,682 --> 00:40:29,090
Will definitely protect her

669
00:40:31,855 --> 00:40:34,740
It’s not even a day yet

670
00:41:24,627 --> 00:41:26,060
I said it

671
00:41:28,224 --> 00:41:31,618
I will protect...this child

672
00:41:32,414 --> 00:41:34,272
protective rind

673
00:42:02,341 --> 00:42:03,890
Sunouchi-senpai

674
00:42:03,904 --> 00:42:05,904
I almost lost him

675
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:08,316
Hey what is this

676
00:42:08,316 --> 00:42:09,678
Don't touch

677
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:26,263
Masamune

678
00:42:26,688 --> 00:42:28,135
Xiao Lin

679
00:42:28,815 --> 00:42:30,602
sorry

680
00:42:31,564 --> 00:42:34,086
And I frightened you again

681
00:42:34,587 --> 00:42:38,080
I will definitely protect you

682
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:16,056
Hello

683
00:43:16,257 --> 00:43:18,727
where is xiaolin

684
00:43:19,798 --> 00:43:21,565
Hello

685
00:43:22,436 --> 00:43:24,872
Mr. Xinzhuang, don't worry

686
00:43:25,625 --> 00:43:28,775
Xiaolin is here

687
00:43:31,135 --> 00:43:32,831
what is that

688
00:43:34,471 --> 00:43:36,471
If you dare to hurt Xiao Lin...

689
00:43:36,471 --> 00:43:38,222
How could I hurt her?

690
00:43:38,573 --> 00:43:40,979
She is our...

691
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:46,729
light of hope

692
00:43:50,696 --> 00:43:52,478
©ASTORY & KT Studiogenie/tv asahi

693
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,389
(The genius girl who recovered her memory) I knew she was not an ordinary person, but I didn’t expect her to be so powerful.

694
00:43:56,394 --> 00:43:59,180
I wanted to find the murderer before but now I have no motivation.

695
00:43:59,206 --> 00:44:01,592
(Partner is in danger of breaking up?) Please don’t have anything to do with Xiao Lin anymore

696
00:44:01,592 --> 00:44:03,475
(Amazing progress) Found it

697
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:05,309
i might be killed
