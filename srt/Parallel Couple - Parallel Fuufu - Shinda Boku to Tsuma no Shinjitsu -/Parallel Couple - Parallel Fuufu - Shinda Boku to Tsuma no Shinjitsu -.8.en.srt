(Natsume) How to keep it in your own heart ➡

10
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,242
Honestly it's getting a little painful.

12
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,579

Thank you for today for Natsume.

No, I think you're listening ➡

42
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,131
He was a terrible old man.

Leave your family behind...

I want to meet you.

00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,877
Father-in-law. (Goro) Huh?

55
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,214
Would you like to tell me properly?

56
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:41,321
Hey, you can still try hard, right?

57
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,725
There are so many things I've had to deal with with Mikita.

58
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,396
Hey!

Tough! Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang...

Ah, what should I do if I can't meet you well...

61
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:02,743
Is there someone I want to meet? Huh?

62
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,444
Huh?

63
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,613
Huh? (Goro) Aaaah...｡(snoring)

Huh? What does that mean?

67
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,189
Ah, no, this is today... We're not that far, right?

68
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,024
That's why I'm.... I'm kidding.

69
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:21,762
Ah, my father-in-law came to raise the incense sticks.

70
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,697
Father side now?

71
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:27,200
I traced my relatives, found a place to go and informed me of marriage.

72
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,369
He's the one who told me I don't have a daughter?

73
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,304
Work stress relief with alcohol ➡

74
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:34,608
When I drink it, I get bigger and I'm sure I can't make any promises.

75
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,643
There are no happy memories.

76
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:41,148
It disappeared without my permission, and suddenly this appeared, who is what you are thinking?

77
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:45,886
This one won't exist forever!

78
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,554
What is it? This time.

79
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:51,224

Ah, sorry.

84
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,181
It seems Natsume wasn't ready yet.

85
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,249
Ah... I'm going home.

86
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,686
Something seems to be stuck on the fox all the time ➡

87
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:23,790
I knew he was still doing well somewhere.

88
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,259
Ah...｡ (Goro) Then ➡

89
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:30,697
I also realized how much I hate him.

90
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:34,368
I'm saying it that way, but I'm serious...

91
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:36,203
Ah no me ➡

92
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:39,873
I know more about Natsume than before.

93
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:43,944
He's doing it too much.

94
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:47,047
He's a good guy.

95
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,716
Ahhh.

96
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:53,120
Ah... I know but ➡

97
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,123
It's too honest.

98
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:58,558
Where did you go?

99
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,496
It's yuzei!

100
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:04,164
Ah...

101
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,101
(Goro) No, so... I don't have to walk around the edges ➡

102
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,836
I guess they bumped into it! So...

103
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,505
What are you doing? Ah.

104
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,173
Come over here! Ah, sorry!

105
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,075
Sorry, sorry... What is it?!

106
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,511
Hey, come on! Wow!

107
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,583
You can drink this, right?

108
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:29,956
Ahhh, what do you think?

109
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:33,527
Is there time tomorrow night?

110
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:38,799
It's fine now.

111
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,867
I might not be able to meet Natsume.

112
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,036
Forever.

113
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:46,373
That's tough.

114
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:53,213
It's fine if things don't go well, isn't it?

115
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,882
Please share your feelings.

116
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:05,158
Actually, I hadn't noticed it until recently.

117
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:09,563
Natsume: When I parted ways, I said "Hoppepuku."

118
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:12,999
Oh, I'm cheating something ➡

119
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:16,169
I used to do it when I lie.

120
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,510
(Goro) Tell me about Natsume.

121
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,246
I want to know everything you know.

122
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,016
It's fine but ➡

123
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,519
I can't speak by tomorrow night.

124
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,788
Ahhh.

125
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,524
What is Natsume's favorite?

126
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:43,363

If it's Natsume's voice, I'd like to hear it every day.

137
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:44,491
It's not that long for children to face their parents.

138
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:48,428
But that time was a treasure.

139
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:51,832
Show me your face once in a while.

140
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:54,534
Yes I understand.

No way what? that.

147
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:20,694
Could it be? Listen to your father-in-law's story.

148
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,362
No, it's impossible.

149
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:25,031
Because we won't be able to meet forever.

150
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:31,071
He's the guy who left you, who was still small.

151
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,241
I don't have the right to call myself a father.

152
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,977

153
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:40,514
Ah... I know it's not cool.

154
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:44,618
But if I missed this opportunity I would regret it forever.

155
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:49,022
No matter how much you hate me, I want you to apologise properly.

I bought this at a festival I went to with Natsume.

It's dangerous. There was in India ➡

184
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:21,108
A real couple parallel.

185
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,677
Is parallelism like me and Mikita?

186
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:25,445
What, I mean, that story?

187
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:28,048
I also got a proper translation. What? To who?

188
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,183
A general at a curry restaurant in Takadanobaba.

189
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:34,688
Sahaji, a miraculous couple living in West India, is ➡

190
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:36,456
With his wife Aisha, who was supposed to have died ➡

191
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,825
One night we met again at home.

192
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,194
Reunion at home.

193
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,730
From that day onwards, the time we can meet will be longer each day. ➡

194
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,799
Aisha has returned. Wow.

195
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:48,769
In other words, Natsumecchi can return to his normal life...

196
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,939
That's a good story. What a movie?

197
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,475
No, what the title is um...

198
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:57,644
Sorry, that's dangerous, a moment ➡

199
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:59,646
Uhh... sorry.

200
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:06,219
safe?

201
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:07,888
Uuh...

202
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:13,026
Ahhh.

203
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:19,499
Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang...

204
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,435
By the time the mix is ​​finished ➡

205
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:24,838
What can I do for you?

206
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:27,174
What? Suddenly.

207
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:30,110
It's not decided that the mix is ​​over yet.

208
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,778
Even Tamura-kun did some research ➡

209
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:34,214
He runs around to make it work.

210
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,683
You have to assume something.

211
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:39,319
What's more, this room is limited to this short time?

212
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,987
I have to think about the end too.

213
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:45,492
Take it easy! I don't need such a negative thing at all.

214
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:50,130
Ah... sorry, sorry.

215
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,165
My bad habit has appeared again.

216
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,268
this! When I think about it, that's all I can see.

217
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:58,572
Ah wait.

218
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:00,741
I'm sorry.

219
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:03,844
Yes certainly ➡

220
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,879
There's also the rent of this house.

221
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,547
You have to save money.

222
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,383
If you can no longer live in this house ➡

223
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:11,418
That's how we won't be able to meet.

224
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,487
That's right. Yes.

225
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:16,423
Ah, can you drink that already?

226
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:19,426
Ahhh, I can drink it. Hmm.

227
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:22,062
But it's better to let him sleep for about another year ➡

228
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:24,297
The corners are peeling off and become mellow.

229
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:28,902
So it's about next summer. Yes.

230
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:31,538
I hope we can drink it together.

231
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:35,542
I'm sure you can drink it.

232
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,378
Yeah.

233
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,782
Ah, that's right. Huh?

234
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:43,917
Yes. This is three years old.

235
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:46,119
Ahhh.

236
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:49,856
Bring it. What?

237
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:54,027
It seems like I've not drunk it in 20 years.

238
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:57,264
Even when I recommended it, I didn't take a drop.

239
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:59,800
We know too ➡

240
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,003
It's not natural that we can meet.

241
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:09,976

242
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:13,046
<My father in the world>

243
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,784
Haa...

244
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:19,453
Ahhh.

245

246
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:34,868
that.

247
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:41,775
I'm Natsume.

248
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:47,481
It's your daughter.

249
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:50,183
I don't have a daughter. Ahhh.

250
00:15:53,854 --> 00:15:58,258
I'm Natsume, your daughter.

251
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:01,094
I don't have a daughter.

252
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:02,963
Ahhh.

253
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,966
I thought I would say that.

254
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:11,304
But unfortunately I've updated it.

255
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,619
I know.

256
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:30,123
It's just a strong one.

257
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:48,341
Haha.

258
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,978
Hahaha.

259
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:55,115
It's well here.

260
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:56,783
father.

261
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:01,354
Don't disappear all of a sudden.

262
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,356
ah.

00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:12,299
♬～

264
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,768
I'm now able to drink alcohol.

265
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:18,238
Haha, how old do you think?

266
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:21,375
Ahhh.

267
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,511
Thank you. Yes.

268
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:26,179
thank you.

269
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:33,286

270
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:35,822
Do you remember?

271
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:38,091
yeah?

272
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:42,329
When I was a child, I was given a shoulder car at a festival.

273
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,664
Ahhh.

274
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:48,301
Just go through the shrine's torii gate ➡

275
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:51,138
And I think I'll be able to reach the torii gate.

276
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:55,442
I felt so proud.

277
00:17:55,442 --> 00:18:00,514
I suddenly felt like the way the world was viewed was changing.

278
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:09,022
Good memories that were right.

279
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:13,794
Sorry I can't stay with you forever.

280
00:18:13,794 --> 00:18:15,896
Yeah.

281
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:18,498
I didn't really know before, but ➡

282
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:20,967
Now ➡

283
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:25,572
A couple that you might understand a little.

284
00:18:29,076 --> 00:18:33,213
(Goro) At first, it was a bit of a mistake in the buttons.

285
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:37,250
That's gradually shifting.

286
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,254
But I think it's just right if it's off.

287
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:44,391
A couple is originally a stranger.

288
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:48,495
A little patience and effort for each other.➡

289
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:53,366
When you overcome this, you will experience another relationship that transcends youth ➡

290
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:56,837
I think there is

291
00:18:56,837 --> 00:19:00,507
I couldn't go that far.

292
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:05,212
That's not convincing for me to say it.

293
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:09,049
Yes, that's right haha.

294
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:11,718
Haha.

295
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:15,021
Natsume. Huh?

296
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:17,691
(Goro) Are you doing well with your husband?

297
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:25,499
Yes, it's fun.

298
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:28,902
(Goro) I see. Yes.

299
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:31,071
Takenoko. What a... Isn't it all black?

300
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:32,773
Can you do that? Are you okay?

301
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:37,210
(Goro) Yes, I put it in. Oh, the inside is delicious.

302
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,879
What? With bare hands?

303
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:58,899
♬～

304
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:00,634
We met there too.

305
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:02,703
Yes. Ah...

306
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:05,172
Mikita Thank you. Ugh.

307
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:07,774
It's thanks to Mikita.

308
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:09,910
With that stubborn dad and me ➡

309
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,747
I couldn't make a reconciliation for the rest of my life.

310
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:15,415
Me. Yes.

311
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:19,486
I want my dad to pat him ➡

312
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:21,655
My cheeks were intentionally bulging out.

313
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:23,323
I want to pacify too.

314
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:25,892
Huh? Haha.

315
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,561
That's fine. Really?

316
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:29,796
Yes. Hehe.

317
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:31,665
I'll go. Yes.

318
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:34,601
Hmm! Haha.

319
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,937
Hahahahaha. Hahahaha.

321
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:42,142
Someday... ｡ Yes.

322
00:20:42,142 --> 00:20:46,279
I wonder if this will become impossible either? Ah...

323
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:50,751
I can't explain the mix in the first place though ➡

324
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:53,754
Something's trigger?

325
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:57,524
That's something like a world bug, for example. ➡

326
00:20:57,524 --> 00:21:01,428
If this situation was born...

327
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:05,599
It's not surprising it would end at any time.

328
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,868
Ahhh.

329
00:21:07,868 --> 00:21:09,936
Tamura said that ➡

330
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,205
Just like us in West India ➡

331
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:15,008
There was a couple who met their deceased spouse.

332
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:16,676
Really? Yeah.

333
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:19,146
At first it was a few minutes a day.

334
00:21:19,146 --> 00:21:22,282
Gradually, we're spending more time together.

335
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:25,652
He said he could go back to his normal life in five years.

336
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:29,423
So maybe we can go back too?

337
00:21:29,423 --> 00:21:31,858
Yes... it's impossible.

338
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:33,527
No, it's not impossible.

339
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:37,264
Because this situation itself is impossible.

340
00:21:37,264 --> 00:21:39,366
Stop thinking badly.

341
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:42,769
There is no basis but there is hope.

342
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:45,872
There's no proof that the mix will continue ➡

343
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:48,208
There's no guarantee that it's going to end. Yes.

344
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:51,044
It could last for more than 100 years.

345
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:53,714
Haha.

346
00:21:53,714 --> 00:21:55,549
Gee...

347
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:57,317

Congratulations ➡

352
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,977
I'm in my 12th week of pregnancy.

353
00:22:23,977 --> 00:22:25,645
Huh?

354
00:22:28,482 --> 00:22:30,283
I might be a baby Ayasu pro.

355
00:22:30,283 --> 00:22:32,719
Mikita has always wanted children.

356
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,388
I can't say it.

357
00:22:34,388 --> 00:22:36,957
Weren't we two eating? (Riko) Why not have a new love?

358
00:22:36,957 --> 00:22:40,160
Let's get through it at all costs. The mix may be extended.

359
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,462
It's definitely in any situation.
