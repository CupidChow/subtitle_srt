00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,280
Good job.

00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,684
(Maruyama) Natchan.

4
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,331
Here are Mikita and my baby.

5
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,266
(Kinta) It's a child.

6
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:36,203
Yes. Tight!

8
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:42,542
Shu... Mikita See you next time.

9
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:46,913
Make sure your stomach doesn't cool down.

10
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:54,287
Natsume. Stump!

11
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:55,956

I'm coming again so early.

15
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:15,142
Well, if you're not working, you won't be able to hold your heart.

16
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,280
Tamura: It's the CG of the New Year's sale.

17

00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:29,389
Just Tamura-san. Ah...it's fine.

20
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:34,327
(Riko) Please have some tea.

21
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:36,763
They're still big, two people.

22
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:40,734
I asked Manager Moriya... (Imai) What?

23
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,969
(Recall) What does that mean, Mikita?

24
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:47,407
No... Just think of it as a dream.

25
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:50,010
That wasn't there from the beginning.

26
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,179
Are you really saying that?

27
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:53,847
It's not like it's a dream.

28
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,515
Meet Natsumecchi again, who was supposed to be dead.

29
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,751
How happy were we too?

30
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:00,887
Hey.

31
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,556
Say something, Mikita!

32
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:04,491
Hey, um... Tamura Tamura, what's wrong? You ➡

33
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,394
Calm down. Huh? what up? No, it's okay.

34
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:09,396
(Moriya) Yes. It's okay.

35

Replacement.

39
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:34,654
Ahhh, maybe I'll do something else.

40
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,723
I'm going to drink a lot today.

41
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:40,293
Sorry. Can I talk about Natsume now? ➡

42
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,329
Because Maruyama is the only one.

43
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:46,099

When I look at the child's face...

48
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:06,353
I thought I would no longer be able to slurp.

49
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:10,424
To ensure that Natsume looks forward and lives

50
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,893
I had no choice but to do this.

51
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:22,302
Which one is boy or girl?

52
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:25,305
I think I should have decided on the name alone.

53
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:27,374
(Maruyama) Sorry for keeping you waiting.

54
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,746
It's a Natsume special.

55
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:36,183
This is Natsume's favorite taste.

56
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:40,220
I want to meet you, Natchan.

(Voice in my heart) The mix hasn't happened for months now.

59
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:06,380
What happened in Mikita's world?

60
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:11,818
So what is it talking about?

61
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:19,393
It's this though.

62
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,666
(Riko) Can't you repair it?

63
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,568
Did Mikita say that?

64
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,237
Ah no ➡

65
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:32,672
I can't get rid of it myself so I'll ask for it instead.

66
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,508
What is that? Ah, no ➡

67
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,410
I think he's always trying to force himself.

68
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,245
Yes, I'm just trying to be strong.

69
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:41,214
That's why I can't forgive it!

We all ➡

71
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:47,988
I'm desperately trying to believe that I wish that the world could be restored.

72
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:53,560
But you can't believe it was a dream.

73
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,228
Don't be kidding.

74
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,897
I understand Tamura-san's feelings too.

75
00:04:56,897 --> 00:05:01,268
Sorry, but that's because I can't ride.

76
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:03,704
hey hey.

77
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,476
(Imai) It's a mystery if it's something that can be fixed in the first place.

78
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,678
That's right.

79
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,981
No matter how you look at it, it feels like a Showa era home appliance.

80
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,752
But I have to try as much as I can.

81
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:21,688
Wow, this is the manufacturer itself has already gone out of business.

82
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,356
What? Is that so?

83
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,026
Now, this perspective triple heater is used ➡

Fluffy... No, it's not like you're baking bread.

85

Ah, no, I know it's quite old.

86
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:37,437

Maybe I can do something if I find that toaster?

187
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:42,923
I wonder if he's going up and down the apartment with his big stomach.

188
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:44,791
Definitely rice...

189
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,629
I wonder if he can eat it.

190
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:52,833
It's the due date next week ➡

191
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,737
I couldn't even be present.

192
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:01,408
I'll give birth alone ➡

193
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:04,411
How hard it is ➡

194
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:07,147

It's pathetic but ➡

198
00:14:18,492 --> 00:14:20,394
I have nothing but regrets.

199
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:24,531
It's a mass of regret.

200
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,934
I'm really stupid.

201
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:30,070
He's a huge idiot.

202
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:33,407
Maybe I can! (Imai/Moriya) What?

203
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:35,075
(Riko) Tamura-san.

204
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,810
Mikita. (Imai) So... when?

205
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,678
No you, that ➡

206
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:40,747
Maybe they fixed it?

207
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:45,118
There is an old God Hand repairman at a local factory nearby.

208
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,554
I think I could bake about one bread at the end.

209
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:51,691
So, once more with Natsume?

210
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:54,594
Tamura Sorry, me...

211
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,797
Anyway, it's better to get quicker.

212

it was good.

230
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:23,650
