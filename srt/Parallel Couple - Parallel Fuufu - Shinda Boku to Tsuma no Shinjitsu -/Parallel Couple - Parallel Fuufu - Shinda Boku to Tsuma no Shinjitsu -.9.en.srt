(Narration) <The world of a husband who lost his wife before his wife ➡

2
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:12,145
The world of a wife who was lost before her husband.

3
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:16,183
<The Namikawa couple, divided into two worlds, are

4
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:20,687
Every night, 11:22 for 3 minutes ➡

5
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:24,558
You will only be able to meet in this room.

6
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:28,729
<The two called this miraculous time a mix>

7
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:33,133
<It was a mix that seemed to last forever ➡

8
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,569
Something strange was slowly beginning to happen.

9
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:37,237
(Natsume) Me.... Bad!

10
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:38,905
Huh? (Kinta) What?

11
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:40,574
what?

12
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:42,576
It's not surprising it would end at any time.

13
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:45,512
Shatter Kata... Kachan!

14
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:50,851
Congratulations, I'm in my 12th week of pregnancy.

15
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:52,519
Huh?

16
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:58,759
Ah... thank you.

17
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,727
Oh, but I didn't notice it at all.

18
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,896
It's okay if you notice it at this point ➡

19
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,765
There are quite a few people there.

20
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:08,769
Ah... Is that so?

21
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:12,105
(Voice in my heart) I'm pregnant.

22
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:17,377
Harutan How many months has it been? It will soon be nine months.

23
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,213
Nine months or so full of energy.

24
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:22,215
It's going in the blink of an eye, isn't it? It's going in the blink of an eye➡

25
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,884
Ah! It ends with that. Hahaha ➡

26
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,219
It's just a moment, isn't it? A moment, for a moment.

27
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:30,557
I have a baby in my stomach.

28
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:33,226
Mikita and me.

29
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:46,239
♬～

30
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,910
Mikita has always wanted children.

31
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,745
(Reminiscence) It's better for kids to get up early.

32
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:54,915
You can also record your basal body temperature to help you get pregnant...

33
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:02,622
That day, since then, already ➡

34
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,525
There's a baby in my stomach ➡

35
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,661
If Mikita finds out.

36
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:10,397
Uhh... Natsume.

37
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:12,566
Why? Ugh...

38
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:15,469
Once more now➡

39
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,105
It hurts Mikita.

40
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:25,345
♬～

41
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:31,418
The mix will be over someday ➡

42
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:34,755
If you're going to live in separate worlds ➡

43
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:38,358
You shouldn't tell me...

44
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:50,971
♬～

45
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,939
what happened?

46
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,442
(Tamura) I came up with something interesting.

47
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,411
yeah?

48
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,780
West Indian Ruins?

49
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,283
Yes. It's a translation of the Curry Shop General ➡

50
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:06,086
Her husband, Sahaji, visited Ajanta, India.

51
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:09,756
Apparently, five years later, he returned to his former married life with his wife Aisha.

52
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:13,493
You Ajanta, do you know the current situation?

53
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,463
The other day... hey, Natsume.

54
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:22,069
I mean, is it okay? Something's not good?

55
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:26,673
Ah... I feel like I'm feeling a bit cold. Ah, but it's not a big deal.

56
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:30,077
You have to eat something good for your health, warm it up, and sleep.

57
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:33,580
Ah, cold medicine is in the medicine box. Yes, thank you.

58
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,116
Oh well, it's hot. Shut up.

59
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:39,953
I've been thinking of a way for these two.

60
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,790
yeah?

61
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,264
Nan? Specially made by the general.

62
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:55,102
If you bake this, the mix might be extended.

63
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:58,205
What do you mean, don't do anything you like!

64
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:01,041
Okay, Mikita: The hint is India.

65
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,910
What is that? Hey hey, stop it, you!

66
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,579
It's fine, it's fine, it's a bit.

67
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,247
Shatter Kata... Kachan! Hey….

68
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,915
Shoe...

69
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,686
Ah.

70
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,354
Beep

71
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:18,725
Ah... 2 minutes and 32 seconds.

72
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,461
It's shorter than before.

73
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,530
Maybe really ➡

74
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,867
Is the end of the mix coming near?

75
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,736
What, it was just one more step.

76
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:38,612
♬～

77
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,480
(Riko) Yes it's tasty. It's delicious.

78
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,149
(Riko) What? Is it true? Yeah.

79
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,751
(Riko) What? Can I get it? That's fine.

80
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,887
It's tasty.

81
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,555
This one is good, after all.

82
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,957
Is this Tamura also curry? (Riko) Yes, it's delicious.

83
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,126
Isn't it good? Can I get it? (Riko) Just a little.

84
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,063
Naan curry.

85
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:57,731
The hint is India.

86
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:01,234
India. Is India the hint after all?

87
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,070
I like this one better... Tamura.

88
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,305
Let's exchange it once... huh? Why are you eating naan curry?

89
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,575
Oh why naan curry, why naan?

90
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:10,310
Oh no, I'm hungry.

91
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,847
I heard the Indian landscape or the voice of Indian gods ➡

92
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:15,515
Isn't there more? In my head. What? ➡

93
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:18,251
I was feeling like curry.

94
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:21,188
I see, that's right.

95
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,856
What's wrong, Mikita, are you okay?

96
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:25,192
Ah yes, sorry.

97
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,194
Mikita is weird. Yes.

98
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,362
eat? I don't need it.

99
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,031
Don't you need it? (Moriya) Ah, that's right.

100
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:33,066
I don't need it. It's really tasty.

101
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,868
Are you going to eat it? (Moriya) Is it okay?

102
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:36,536
It's good. It's good. Which is better?

103
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,572
(Riko) This one is delicious too... (Moriya) What? What?

104
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:44,644
So what time will the shot be...

105
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:47,547
Oh, that's so cute.

106
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:52,085
Wow!

107
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,554
Ah. Ah...

108
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,723
Wow! (Riko) Ah, it's dangerous, it's dangerous.

109
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,726
Wow! Are you okay?

110
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:03,296
Wow!

111
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:06,099
Okay, okay. I mean, what about your mother?

112
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,901
(Imai) Sorry, it looks like the bathroom is currently being put in.

113
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:11,171
Ah, what should I do? Natsume-san Help!

114
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,340
Yes. Come on.

115
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,008
Wow! Good job.

116
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:18,045
I didn't like it, oh! Ahhh.

117
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,080
Yes yes.

118
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,749
Ahhh. Yes Yes Yes Good.

119
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,718
Okay, okay...

120
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,520
As expected from Natsume.

121
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,022
I always understand the feelings of models.

122
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,690
(Imai) Yes.

123
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,695
Natsume? ➡

124
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,597
Natsume?

125
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,266
Yeah.

126
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,438
Mikita-san, morning, wasn't it?

127
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:46,606
I just say something I don't understand.

128
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,942
I wonder if the curry was disliked. Haha.

129
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:52,145
Well, it's been a little better since I took a picture of my baby.

130
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,981
The loneliness of Natsume-san after a long time has passed ➡

131
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:58,151
Is it starting to expand? Well, I guess there is.

132
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:01,922
Of course, my life partner is gone.

133
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,592
A life partner?

134
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:09,963
Well, Tsuji Riko isn't interested in marriage.

135
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:12,299
Well, that's right.

136
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:16,503
Maruyama-cchi Are you interested in getting married?

137
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,171
There's no.

138
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,240
Wow, then it's the same as me.

139
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,576
Or rather, who I want to marry?

140
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:26,346
Because I'm not in this world anymore.

141
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,116
Ah, I see.

142
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:36,423
Well, why not just drag us to a new love, and not drag us on forever?

143
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:41,361
Oh... Hey, are you okay? Are you okay?

144
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,697
It's okay... What? (Riko) Ahhh, I'm going home.

145
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,365
Huh? Thank you for the meal.

146
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,200
Wait a minute, Tsuji Riko, a minute.

147
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,036
Tamura-san ➡

148
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:52,039
Accounting. What?

149
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:53,707
I!?

150
00:07:57,444 --> 00:08:00,547
Tight... Tight!

151
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,916
A slutty bang...

152
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,718
Ah.

153
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,554
Ah... Natsume.

154
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:09,890
Ah.

155
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:13,126
Yeah.

156
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,795
Oh well.

157
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:19,099
Oh no. Huh? Oh?

158
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,637
Hey, are you okay?

159
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,639
What?

160
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,742
Oh, I guess he's still not feeling well.

161
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:34,014
Ah, yes hey haha.

162
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:44,157
Was that a photo of you taking a diaper today too?

163
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:47,994
Yes. The baby was so cute.

164
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,330
If one person crys, another person crys.

165
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,998
Wow!

166
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,667
Wow...

167
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,304
But when I hold him I won't cry.

168
00:08:57,304 --> 00:09:00,640
I might be a baby Ayasu pro. Haha.

169
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,079
♬～

170
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,648
Hey, what's wrong?

171
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,890
Maybe the end of the mix is ​​nearing.

172
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,059
Huh? Natsume is also feeling unwell ➡

173
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,727
Maybe that's because of that.

174
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,963
Ah, no...

175
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,966
Does it hurt somewhere? Tinnitus or headaches.

176
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:29,803
Yes, it's okay. Ah...

177
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:32,439
Oh... That's... Are you okay?

178
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:36,410
Are you about to vomit? Are you okay?

179
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,245
Natsume. Shattering Shattering... Kachan!

180
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,913
Shoe...

181
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,615
Ah...

182
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:43,283
Ah.

183
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,951
Beep!

184
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,554
Ah... 2 minutes 29 seconds.

185
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:49,756
It's shorter than yesterday.

186
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,328
Ahhh.

187
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,402
I can't say it.

188
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:19,920
♬～

189
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,255
Natsume-san. Ah...

190
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:25,092
(Riko) Is there a space tonight? Can't you go out to eat?

191
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:29,029
Tonight? Hmm.

192
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,898
There are shops I really want to go to.

193
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:36,870
But it's a shop that's hard to get in by yourself.

194
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,605
please!

195
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:41,575
Haha, it's fine, let's go.

196
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:43,577
Yeah, thank you very much.➡

197
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:46,012
Well then, later. Yes.

198
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:53,520
Riko-chan.

199
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,423
What? What? What does that mean?

200
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:58,592
Hehe. Not hehe.

201
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:00,360
What? Weren't we two eating?

202
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,829
Hmm, because when I invited Natsume straight up,

203
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:06,466
I don't think he'll come. Yes, he won't come.

204
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,570
I'm going home. (Riko) What a...➡

205
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:15,375
Once in a while, let's change our mood in a different environment than usual.

206
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,211
Huh? (Riko) Please.

207
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,750
(Riko) Yes.

208
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,419
Thank you. Yes.

209
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:29,723
That means they both don't have any partners now, right?

210
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:34,361
Well, I guess there's one. Hey, Natsume-san.

211
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,563
I've been married once.

212
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,899
What? Is that so? So you mean divorced?

213
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,967
Well, don't listen too deeply.

214
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:44,805
I can ask as much as I want.

215
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,709
Do you want to drink something?

216
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,812
Oh, then, the same one, orange juice.

217
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:54,915
I drank red.

218
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,583
Um.... Sorry.

219
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,251
You can answer appropriately.

220
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,856
Two reds and two reds Yes.

221
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,624
(Riko) This wine is delicious.

222
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:07,761
Hey, why did you break up with your husband?

223
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:10,097
Cheating? Is it an affair?

224
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,765
It's not.

225
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:14,167
So what did you hate? Hehe.

226
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,136
No comment?

227
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:19,039
Well, I thought he was his soulmate.

228
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,776
I guess it would have been different if I got married... right?

229
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:26,713
Even if you're a couple, you end up being someone else.

230
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:29,082
others?

231
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,618
Yes, stop it. Let's have a more fun story...

232
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,787
We haven't broken up. What?

233
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:37,924
I still love you, and I'm talking about my husband.

234
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:41,862
Of course, there are some things that are annoying, as it's not just someone else.

235
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:44,464
I'll push it right away and manage it ➡

236
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:47,734
I live in my own world alone and have a strong belief.

237
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:52,239
Also, there are things that I don't know because I'm someone else.

238
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:56,643
When he was a student, he was supporting his dreams of being such a beautiful friend.

239
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:59,613
The other day, with my dad over there ➡

240
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,715
We've become friends without permission.

241
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:05,185
But thanks to this, I also have a dad.

242
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:07,921
We'll be able to meet again.

243
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:11,291
What's the story? It's stupid but ➡

244
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,127
That guy is good.

245
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:18,932
So you're someone else, but you're not someone else anymore. Do you understand?

246
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:21,935
Don't you know? I bumped into you and fell over and woke up ➡

247
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:25,372
And if we bump into each other, we'll no longer be someone else.

248
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,040
I don't know about the other couples though.

249
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,176
That's how I and Mikita came to be a couple ➡

250
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:33,580
So you're just invincible?

251
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:39,920
♬～

252
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,891
Ah! That's all.

253
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:46,693
Haa...

254
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:50,063
Well, I've just started to get drunk.

255
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:53,200
No... No, with juice?

256
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,135
Let's go. Yes.

257
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,638
Thank you for the meal.

258
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:04,010
That Riko-chan was really...

259
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,781
You didn't need it. Huh?

260
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:11,251
Change of mood.

261
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:14,955
I love Natsume and Mikita.

262
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:20,293
(Riko) Before that, I often hear about Mikita's complaints ➡

263
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:22,729
Natsume-san, I wonder if you can say what you're thinking properly ➡

264
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:25,465
I was worried. Ah...

265
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:28,468
You could have said it properly.

266
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:32,072
Well... recently?

267
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,442
Two invincible people.

268
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:38,578
Stop it, (Riko) Hahaha.

269
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:41,081
So, do you think they're two invincible? Wait a minute ➡

270
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,116
You're teasing me a little. (Riko) I'm not bullying me.

271
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:45,285
That's right.

272
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:49,890
A lot of things happened since the mix took place.

273
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,858
Did Natsume really love me?

274
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,660
It bumped from the front.

275
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,296
The couple remained unfinished.

276
00:14:56,296 --> 00:15:00,333
I've been hurt or hurt.

277
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:07,708
Then look at the side you didn't know and look at the other person again.

278
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,243
It must have been off anyway!

279
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:14,881
In the time of mixing ➡

280
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:19,753
We learned how strong each other is.

281
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:27,294
It's okay.

282
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:29,296
Ahhh.

283
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:42,175
Let's drink something.

284
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,481
no.

285
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:49,816
Come to think of it...

286
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:54,988
I'm drinking coffee again at night.

287
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:57,524
That's fine, well.

288
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:59,192
You should avoid caffeine at night.

289
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:00,961
Because I can't sleep. Ahhh.

290
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,662
I'll buy some caffeine-free.

291
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:07,334
It's okay, there's no need to worry about that.

292
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,536
already.

293
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:12,039
No good.

294
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:15,442
There was no caffeine.

295
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,212
yeah?

296
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:23,417
what? This is Rooibos tea?

297
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:26,186
I also bought this one.

298
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,492
Haha.

299
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,161
Tough!

300
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,229
Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang...

301
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:40,000
Ah, Natsume. Ah, how are you feeling? Was it okay yesterday?

302
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,737
Yes, it's okay. Ah, really?

303
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,877
That's the one I bought before.

304
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:56,950
Wow. Hahaha.

305
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,986
I didn't know that I was writing something like this.

306
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:03,390
what? This. Ah... no, it's a surprise ➡

307
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,058
Ah, did you just realize it?

308
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:07,694
Yes. What is it?

309
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,563
So was this in the box forever?

310
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:13,166
Hahaha. Shame.

311
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:22,909
You can still believe it, right?

312
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:28,682
of course.

313
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:32,386
My feelings for Natsume have always been the same.

314
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,988
I'm always there at Natsume.

315
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:37,257
So feel safe.

316
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:44,731
Ah... your stomach hurts?

317
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:49,703
The mix is ​​after all. Haaaa.

318
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,810
Here ➡

319
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:03,183
Mikita and my baby are there.

320
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:05,752
baby? Yeah.

321
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:12,125
Are you with me?

322
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:19,466
♬～

323
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:21,468
sorry.

324
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:29,743
I couldn't protect the baby there.

325
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:35,215
Natsume! Natsume!

326
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:37,217
sorry.

327
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:44,591
Sorry, Mikita.

328
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:46,893
sorry.

329
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:51,631
Because of me, I can't protect the baby there.

330
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:55,435
You can't say it because you think you'll be sad if Mikita finds out...

331
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:03,076
Natsume protected me there.

332
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:05,412
He protected the baby.

333
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:11,084
Is the end of the mix near?

334
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:13,320
What is the mix in the first place?

335
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,789
I don't understand it at all and I can't understand it.

336
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:18,325
Uhh... Life here now is ➡

337
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:22,295
I know that I have to protect it.

338
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:25,832
No matter what the situation, it's absolutely. Ugh...

339
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:31,938
♬～

340
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:34,941
Let's get through it at all costs.

341
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:38,145
If we have to overcome it, we all together.

342
00:19:38,145 --> 00:19:40,047
With us family.

343
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:47,254
Uhh... for this child too.

344
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:53,026
Mikita. Haha.

345
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,694
Mikita.

346
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,499
I'm a child ➡

347
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,501
Natsume...

348
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:08,408
I'm a child. Hehe.

349
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:12,713
It's okay, it's okay.

350
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:14,381
Yeah.

351
00:20:17,084 --> 00:20:20,287
Jiji...

352
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:24,791
Huh? What is this?

353
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,794
Natsume?

354
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:31,298
Shu... Mikita: There's one, right?

355
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:32,966
Eh, there's one, right?

356
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:36,837
S... There's one. Natsume.

357
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:38,505
what? this.

358
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:40,874
♬｢encore｣

359
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:43,076
Go...

360
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:44,945
Huh?

361
00:20:44,945 --> 00:20:46,613
Why?

362
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:49,082
Why is this...? Shoe...

363
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,852
What is this? Go...

364
00:20:51,852 --> 00:20:53,587
Mikita! Natsume.

365
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:55,589
Kachan! Shoe...

366
00:20:55,589 --> 00:21:10,704
♬～

367
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:13,240
<I and Natsume have a child.>

368
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:21,481
<An important life that we must protect as a married couple>

369
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:23,817
Yes, I understand.

370
00:21:23,817 --> 00:21:28,021
<If I were to be with Natsume, I could overcome anything>

371
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:31,324
(Riko) Natsume-san It was like that yesterday...

372
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:35,462
<If it's the same as Mikita, I'm sure.>

373
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:42,035
♬～

374
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:44,037
Tick...

375
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:50,811
Natsume?

376
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:58,185
Eh, the lever hasn't come down.

377
00:22:03,957 --> 00:22:06,393
Tough!

378
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:08,361
Kachan! Ah...

379
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:16,403
The mix is ​​over.

380
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:19,406
Ahhh.

381
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:21,074
Are you okay.

382
00:22:23,777 --> 00:22:26,246
Are you okay.

383
00:22:26,246 --> 00:22:28,715
Because it's not just one.

384
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:30,384
Ahhh.

385
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:34,121
it's okay.

386
00:22:38,392 --> 00:22:41,528
Please do something. I saved you.

387
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:43,196
Natsume. I was hospitalized.

388
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:45,399
(Moriya) Let's raise Mikita's child together.

389
00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:47,467
Does the manager like Natsume?

390
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:50,303
(Moriya) Are you me? There's an important story about Mikita.

391
00:22:50,303 --> 00:22:52,706
Please take care of Natsume.
