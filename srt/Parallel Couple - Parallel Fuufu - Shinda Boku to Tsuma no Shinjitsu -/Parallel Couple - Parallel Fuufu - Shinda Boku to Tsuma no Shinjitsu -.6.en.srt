We were able to meet in this room for a few minutes.

<We struggle to find the culprit ➡

12
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:46,012
I feel uncomfortable with the actions of the landlord Hattori.

Hattori-san's share someday.

00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:52,085
I'll have that uncle find out about Hattori.

15
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,254
But there's no evidence.

00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,523
I don't know the motivation.

00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:59,159
Did you know our schedule for that day?

00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,328
But what we do

I've looked it up once after I found it to be a grudge.

00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,711
But there were no interesting discoveries.

24
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:21,581
I've heard that before but I'm really curious.

Could you please check it out again?

26
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:27,154
There's a reason to move the police.

27
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,423
There may be some oversights.

28
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,392
Mikita-kun, do you think something?

Thank you, uncle.

Sorry to say it too much, uncle. No, that's not true.

Either would have been fine to get injured. Is that so?

182
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:09,102
That day, I happened to see a natsume appear on my toes?

183
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,077
You were also aiming for your husband, right?

184
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,745
No, that's it.

185
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,414
Bang! (Speech of a desk)

186
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:23,850
You've visited the Namikawa family many times!

187
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,519
Apparently it was a grudge.

188
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,255
Actually, my wife's uncle is a detective.

189
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:32,192
I think the person who hated Natsume committed the crime.

190
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,461
Huh? For Natsume?

191
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:37,397
(Hattori) Knowing that the investigation is underway ➡

192
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,666
That's why I was scared.

193
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:44,237
(Hattori) Please come on this. Ah...

194
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:45,906
Hayori's share farm.

195
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:48,642
Pesticide-free and just butter and salt are the best.

196
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:50,644
It was also well received by his teammates.

197
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:53,880
(Hattori) I'll check to see if there's a detective.

198
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:01,421
Let's catch Hattori from that world soon too.

199
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:04,958
First of all, to me in that world➡

200
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:09,096
They'll have the apartment's security cameras re-searched.

201
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:11,398
Hibou slander IP address also ➡

202
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,967
It's certain you'll need to request disclosure.

203
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:21,475
Pullur Pullur... (ring tone)

204
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:24,978
uncle? I have a request.

205
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,551
(footsteps)

206
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:35,822
(Actually) Isn't it Hattori Taiyo? It's the police. ➡

207
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:41,461
A search and seizure permit has been issued on suspicion of murder of Mikita Namikawa.➡

208
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:44,698
Please provide your home promptly.

209
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:47,934
Tough! Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang...

210
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,704
Ah...

211
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:56,443
It looks like the search for the house begins. Ah, everything will be over today.

212
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:58,812
Yeah.

213
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,480

Ahhhh, the investigation proceeded smoothly.

216
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:16,063
I feel like I want to drink something. I'll drink a bit.

217
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:18,565
Yes. Right.

218
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:20,667
It's good. Ahhh.

219
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:23,704
(Door opening and closing sound) Ha!

220
00:13:23,704 --> 00:13:26,740
Ah! Ah...

221
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,209
Huh? Ha ha ha ha...

222
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,281
Ah! Ah...

223
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:35,949
Gacha... What?

224
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:40,554
Ha ha ha ha.... Gacha gacha...

225
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:42,622
It's the home of the victim's family, right?

226
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:45,158
Hey, ask a contractor. Yes.

227
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,628
This is a hostage. It stimulates the perpetrator.

228
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,267
Huh? No, um...｡➡

229
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,169
No, um ➡

230
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,105
sorry!

231
00:13:58,105 --> 00:14:02,008
Oh, um... I had no intention of killing him.

232
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,778
sorry!

233
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:07,547
But ha ha ha ha...

234
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:10,016
That's good, that's good.

235
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:15,389
Ah, what is it? Are you alive? What?

236
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:18,125
Are they all pranks? ➡

237
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,861
That TV and the newspaper ➡

238
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,797
Are they all pranks that fool me? ➡

239
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:26,166
Haha.

240
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,068
He's not dead.

241
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,237
That husband's brother ➡

242
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:33,106
He is a world class surgeon.

243
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:37,911
He survived after an emergency surgery.

244
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:43,517
That's why I didn't die for sure.

245
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:46,953
Ah... ah ahhh.

246
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:50,223
Hattori-san, let's turn ourselves in.

247
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,593
The family is sad too.

248
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,730
family? ➡

249
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,832
family.

250
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:03,637
I don't have a family.

251
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:08,709
But I often talk about my wife and Nozomi...

252
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:14,047
My wife took Nozomi out. Two years ago.

253
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:18,151
Ha... I don't know why. ➡

254
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:24,057
Well, I guess I'm an actor who won't sell forever.

255
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:26,793
I'm getting old.

256
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,930
So pathetic, my wife.

257
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,234
Uuh...

258
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:38,105
Ah!

259
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:42,209
It didn't work ➡

260
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:44,845
Unlike you.

261
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:55,155
What are you?

262
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:58,225
You don't know anything about us!

263
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:02,562
Is it because his wife was on the show that he couldn't sell as an actor?

264
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:05,098
That's not true!

265
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:09,770
Hattori-san, did you hear about your wife?

266
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,373
Didn't you live in your own world?

267
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:18,011
Assert, push and manage it.

268
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:20,247
It must have been off anyway!

269
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:22,149
Was it off?

270
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:25,419
Ha... well, I guess so.

271
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:30,957
Ah! wait a minute….

272
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:33,093
There's nothing anymore... there's nothing anymore.

273
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:36,296
Ha ha... you have a future.

274
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:37,998
Hattori-san ➡

275
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:41,368
You're still alive! Don't die!

276
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:43,503
I'm going to die and run away ➡

277

Ugh. Ah!

Uh... Uh!

Don't die!

286
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:13,800
I broke up with my wife ➡

287
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,937
If we're alive, we'll be able to meet one day!

288
00:17:16,937 --> 00:17:19,139
Can you meet?

289
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:22,142
Uhh... that's already happening.

For children, father is father.

That's supposed to be!

292
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:32,486
I'll make a proper compensation and talk again someday and bump into each other. ➡

293
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:34,721
Your wife will understand.

294

No, my person too ➡

296
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:47,367
They're assertive and forceful, and they'll manage it➡

297
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:50,937
Honestly it was tough.

298
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:55,976

The Metropolitan Police Department lives in the victim, Minakawa Mikita.

Hattori Taiyo, the landlord of the apartment building, has been arrested.

Hattori's suspect was investigated ➡

Minakawa Mikita is still alive ➡

331

But it might have been an illusion ➡

332
00:20:18,752 --> 00:20:22,022
It means that he is making an inexplicable statement.

333
00:20:22,022 --> 00:20:25,792

00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:16,336
Hahaha. Hahaha.

365
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:18,205
Ahhh.

366
00:22:24,878 --> 00:22:36,423

367
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:39,860
(Hanako) You are Kan-chan's ➡

368
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,095
partner?

369
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:43,764
That person is also in Mikita's world ➡

370
00:22:43,764 --> 00:22:45,432
There's one there.

371
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:48,735
(Hanako) I'll do anything if I can.

372
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:51,738
The end of the mix may be approaching.
