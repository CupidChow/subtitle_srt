1
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:06,206
(Natsume) Uuh...

2
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,017
(Kinta) Natsume!

3
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:29,296
Parallel world?

4
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:42,943
(Narration)<But you end up living in separate worlds➡

5
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:44,911
It's clear.>

6
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:49,182
<We've been off for a long time now>

7
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,818
I was running away from facing it properly.

8
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,487
Junk sweets etc.

9
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:56,056
I also want to eat chicken with oil twig ➡

10
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,892
I want to drink alcohol at my own pace.

11
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,395
It's about Natsume's health.

12
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:04,231
We only have 3 minutes a day.

13
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:07,534
It's difficult to become a couple.

14
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,202
What are you talking about?

15
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:12,472
Mikita.

16
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:15,542
Thank you so much.

17
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,210
Tick...

18
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,879
Tough!

19
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,315
<Since then, Natsume ➡

20
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:24,985
No longer appears in the mix.

21
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,725
(Recollection) At this time?

22
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,393
Ah...

23
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:40,934
<I didn't know anything about Natsume.

24
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,403
You can also record your basal body temperature to help you get pregnant...

25
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:47,340
Take it easy now!

26
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,143
Ahhh... that's oily.

27
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:53,880
<I've always thought it was>

28
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,851
<A couple lives in one world together.>

29
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,389
Tough! Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang...

30
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,892
Natsume?

31
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,728
It's finished.

32
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,037
(Actually) The car that took place in the hit-and-run incident ➡

33
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:19,773
Found in a forest 10km away.

34
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:21,441
It was a stolen car.

35
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:24,745
I consider it a murder due to grudge.

36
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:27,948
Does that mean someone was hated?

37
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:31,218
(Voice in the heart) It's really weird.

38
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:34,521
At the same time in two worlds, at the same place➡

39
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,057
Different people were killed.

40
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:39,226
Over there, me ➡

41
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,261
This is Mikita.

42
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:45,866
Hmm, why is it off?

43
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:49,002
already! I don't really understand.

44
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,142
Did the two perpetrators both grudge?

45
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:59,012
So next time, me?

46
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:03,517
That means the trunk thighs are also dangerous.

47
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,120
(Kaede) Natsume ➡

48
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,656
Are you really not coming back here?

49
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:13,226
Yes I thought about it ➡

50
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,462
There are times when I have to do it here.

51
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:17,531
yes?

52
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,499
Well, it's about Natsume ➡

53
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:23,103
I think it's because of a lot of thoughts.

54
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,405
Yeah.

55
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,074
Tight... Tight!

56
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:28,909
Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang...

57
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,677
Natsume!

58
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,947
Thank you for coming.

59
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,416
I'm really sorry for 3 years of marriage.

60
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,118
I won't live in my own world anymore.

61
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:40,921
Don't force or manage it in a variety of ways!

62
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:43,557
Raise your head. It's not the time for that now.

63
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:46,126
No, do you remember what you said?

64
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,994
I'm so sorry.

65
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,896
My real uncle, haven't you come over there?

66
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,733
My real uncle's story right now, don't you care?

67
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,803
Sorry, uncle ➡

68
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,773
I think I came to take out the incense sticks once after the funeral.

69
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,875
Huh?

70
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,577
Ahh ➡

71
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:06,947
I decided to throw this away. It was annoying, wasn't it?

72
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:09,783
Mikita: I don't know anything yet.

73
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:13,520
Does that mean my real uncle hasn't come at the same time?

74
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,024
Resentment? It's not just a hit-and-run.

75
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,527
His uncle is almost retired and apparently he investigated it on his own.

76
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,829
That means they both had a grudge.

77
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,332
If that's the case, then Natsume is in danger!

78
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,234
Oh.

79
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:30,203
Is it power harassment? What did you hate about Natsume?

80
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,039
(Moriya) Hey, Mikita, what are you doing?

81
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:35,308
You did it! What did you hate Natsume?

82
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:38,345
Please give me back...

83
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:42,015
You killed it! What did Natsume do?

84
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:45,819
What? Hey!

85
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:51,291
Hey, what happened to your uncle?

86
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,327
Have you heard it? Natsume.

87
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,996
Yes.

88
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:58,632
Chicken with the Giant Bright on the Moon...

89
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,901
I'll tell Mikita now ➡

90
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:04,371
Maybe they'll go out of control and stimulate the perpetrator.

91
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,139
Don!

92
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,975
Let's explore it for ourselves a little more.

93
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,747
<This means they lose each other ➡

94
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:17,150
A couple who ends up living in separate worlds ➡

95
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,421
A story that you can meet for a little while every night.

96
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:29,563
A person who hates us and our husband and wife...

97
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,737
I think so.

98
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,509
A person who grudges... Work-related?

99
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,611
No way.

100
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:55,355
Hey... what are you doing?

101
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,357
(Notification sound)

102
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,063
I forgot my SNS account.

103
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:05,399
Ahhh.

104
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:26,820
♬～

105
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,488
Whew.

106
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:32,259
There seems to be more words that are more specific to us.

107
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,428
Hmm, if it's an obituary ➡

108
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:37,097
Isn't it really hard? ➡

109
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:38,899
No, I understand how I feel though.

110
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,068
(Manner mode)

111
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,736
Sorry.

112
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:47,974
Ah... I can't believe it though ➡

113
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,910
Is that the truth?

114
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:54,347
Yes, so please cooperate.

115
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,583
Yes... (Tamura) Seriously?

116
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:00,020
(Actually) Thank you to everyone, Natsume always helps you.

117
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,688
No. Oh no.

118
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:04,658
This is Detective Hirata, my uncle. Ah.

119
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:07,561
This is Hirata. Thank you very much. (Moriya/Imai) Please.

120
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:12,132
It's cool. Japanese made Nicolas Cage.

121
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:15,902
(Riko) Detective This is the first time I've seen it live.

122
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:21,141
Something around Mikita-kun ➡

123
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,744
Was there anything that looked like a problem?

124
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:25,545
As a director, everyone is strictly important.

125
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,315
I feel like he was pulling me.

126
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,384
Mikita is just straightforward about what he wants to do.

127
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:33,954
I love Natsume so much that I love her.

128
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:37,157
I don't think it was a problem.

129
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:41,061
Actually, I've been having some concerns about commuting.

130
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,729
Yeah.

131
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,832
When Mikita goes outside of work ➡

132
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,201
Have you ever used a different station?

133
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:52,272
It's also the case when filming or something like that.

134
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:56,843
If you go left at that Y-joint, you'll see the scene of the accident, right?

135
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,212
Yes. That?

136
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,281
The culprit's car is every morning ➡

137
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:05,552
Is it because they were ambushed at that scene?

138
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,554
Or...

139
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,825
That's a bit of a question.

140
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,064
But Natsume is happy.

141
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:19,800
yeah? Mikita-kun ➡

142
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,903
He was a really good husband.

143
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:28,241
No one swears or hates them.

144
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:31,178
Because he's the director, it's too detailed ➡

145
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:34,081
It seems there were some areas that were strong

146
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:37,851
He was a capable person at work.

147
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,120
Yes, that's right.

148
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,857
Oh, and about the security of Natsume ➡

149
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:48,195
I think I'll be able to do it for my personal use from tomorrow, so don't worry.

150
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:51,398
Understood, thank you. (Actually) Yes.

151
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:54,668
Even if you suddenly say grudge.

152
00:08:54,668 --> 00:09:00,140
Yes, of course you need to know ➡

153
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,410
There are only a few things I can do now.

154
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,913
That's right. Natsume has to be careful too.

155
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:10,584
Yes. Oh my uncle will come from tomorrow.

156
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:13,687
I see, if that detective is there, is it okay?

157
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,655
Yes, thank you very much.

158
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,324
No no.

160
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,501
Ahhh actually ➡

161
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:30,971
During my lifetime, I had a fight with Natsume, which left me feeling sorry for him.

162
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:35,208
I see, I brought work home.

163
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:40,747
Yes, I wonder if he brought too much of his self as a director into the house.

164
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,917
I manage Natsume at my own pace.

165
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:48,088
Hmm. Well, that's the case too.

166
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,258
Sadly, we live at work.

167
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:55,595
My wife said this all the time while I was alive.

168
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,864
Don't manage it! Not a staff member!

169
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:01,168
Ah... Ahhh. (Moriya) Hahaha.

170
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:03,804
Well, there's nothing I can do about it.➡

171
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:05,672
To live in this industry ➡

172
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:08,608
You need to have something like yourself.

173
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,245
It's only a couple who say the details.

174
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:15,482
Don't blame yourself too much.

175
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:18,218
Thank you. Yes.

176
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:24,424

183
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,212
(Moriya) Natsume!

184
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:21,381
Ah!

185
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:23,717
(Moriya) Hey! A bit...➡

186
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:25,552
Huh? Hey, what's wrong? I don't want it!

187
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:29,222
Hey, it's me, it's me. What?

188
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:32,893
Moriya-san? Yes, it's okay. What is it? Hey.

189
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:39,232
(Moriya) Yes, please.

190
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,303
(Moriya) Hmm.

191
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:46,073
I told them the situation. The police also said tonight.

192
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:47,974
They'll strengthen the patrols around here.

193
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:51,511
Ah, thank you. No.

194
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:54,581
I couldn't connect to my uncle. (Moriya) Ah...

195
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,750
I'll try again tomorrow. I see.

196
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,087
Yes. Maybe they're under investigation.

197
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:04,624
So did you calm down a little?

198
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:10,130
Is that the culprit who killed Mikita?

199
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,965
No... next time I'll be it?

200
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:16,103
Eh, no, it's okay, it's okay, I'm here. What?

201
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,572
Sorry. (Moriya) Ah, no no.

202
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:21,708
Ah... Is there a business hotel around here?

203
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,377
How about staying there tonight?

204
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:27,447
I'll do some research. Ah, yes.

205
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,616
Please wait a minute. What?

206
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:32,052
That's right ➡

207
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:34,287
I have to tell Mikita as soon as possible.

208
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:38,458
No, I managed to do something here today.

209
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:42,362
No no no no. Isn't it scary? Here it is.

210
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,831
So Moriya-san, um... ｡ Yes.

211
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:48,969
Is it possible to stay here tonight?

212
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:52,639
Oh... I see. That's right.

213
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,307
Yes. (Moriya) Yes.

214
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,309
Please. (Moriya) No no.

215
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,078
Moriya-san. (Moriya) What... What?

216
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,082
Yes for more than three minutes... you'll get in, right?

217
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:03,750
(Moriya) So... 3 minutes? yes.

218
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,586
(Moriya) Hmm, well, for more than 3 minutes. Ah, isn't it?

219
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:09,189
(Moriya) What? That confirmation. Ah, no ➡

220
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:12,426
Take your time. I left my change of clothes away.

221
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:14,861
(Moriya) Ahhh thank you. Yes.

222
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:19,433
Ah, Natsume!

223
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:22,436
Thank you for coming. I'm sorry I was in the wrong after all.

224
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:25,105
I mean, I've brought too much of my self as a director into the house...

225
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:27,040
Listen, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

226
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,543
I was attacked by a man in black just now.

227
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:31,878
Huh? Moriya-san helped me.

228
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:34,548
Ah... what's the situation? Mikita.

229
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:38,552
We must have been killed by him.

230
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:41,488
My uncle told me about it.

231
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,324
It wasn't just a hit-and-run.

232
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:50,263
Someone was hated and killed. It's a grudge.

233
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:53,166
Resentment? Oh, so it wasn't here ➡

234
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,570
What about your uncle? It's the other day ➡

235
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,574
He came to us and explained it to me. What? Hey, he wasn't here?

236
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:03,076
Right, right? Ahhh.

237
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:05,846
Anyway, we have to find the culprit.

238
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:08,248
Oh... each other? I hope I can find it ➡

239
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:12,018
Well, this world is this world.

240
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,855
Ah... what do you mean? Yes, that's why...

241
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:17,524
How did you say you're going to find the culprit?

242
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,194
(Door opening and closing sound)

243
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:27,701
(Moriya) Ah, did your uncle turn around?

244
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,936
yes.

245
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,605
It looks like it's tough today.

246
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:34,541
I see. Yes.

247
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,210
Haha, Mikita, you're long.

248
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:44,651
Hmm. I was so confused yesterday.

249
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:47,220
I tried to summarize it myself.

250
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,889
Yes. That is ➡

251
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,725
If it's a grudge, then one person is usually targeted. ➡

252
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:55,062
The victims are shifting in two worlds.

253
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:57,731
That means they both had a grudge.

254
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,433
Next time, me or ➡

255
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:01,334
Natsume might be killed.

256
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:04,137
In fact, I was attacked yesterday.

257
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:06,339
Yes, so even in this world ➡

258
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,008
Go see my uncle ➡

259
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:09,676
We'll look for the culprit together.

260
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:11,411
It's better to find each other first ➡

261
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,080
I'll teach you quickly.

262
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,416
That will save each other's lives.

263
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,421
That's what I wanted to say yesterday.

264
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,524
I finally understand. As expected of Mikita.

265
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,526
Thank you for organizing it. Haha.

266
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:29,730
Whiteboards are useful in such situations.

267
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:35,535
Trunk is too thick.

268
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:39,106
Can I give you my uncle's phone number? 08...

269
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:42,376
Natsume. Huh?

270
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,378
Sorry. What?

271
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:46,546
Ah... I used a whiteboard.

272
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:50,550
Just a moment... No no, it's fine if this is what it is. Easy to understand.

273
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,386
Ah... Is that so?

274
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:54,755
what? It's not like Mikita.

275
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:59,359
Because it's just like Mikita...

276
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:02,062
That's fine now.

277
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:04,898
I'll tell you the number. Yes.

278
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,970
Hmm. But ➡

279
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,174
Why didn't my real uncle from this world tell me?

280
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:16,410
I've met even me.

281
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,645
surely.

282
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:24,017
♬～

283
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:26,653
I was surprised.

284
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,855
Mikita-kun, why did that?

285
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:33,293
Uncle: What about the investigation?

286
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:37,197
(Actually) It was good until I found the culprit's car.

287
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:40,434
It's a grudge.

288
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:42,669
It's shocking to know. ➡

289
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,439
My legs stopped moving.

290
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:51,645
(Actually) I'm retired now, so I can't. ➡

291
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:53,680
I'm sorry.

292
00:16:56,817 --> 00:16:58,485
(Actually) Ahhh.

293
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:07,894
Ah, ah... ah, ah, ah.

294
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:10,163
uncle!

295
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:12,499
Please motivate.

296
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:15,168
When the perpetrator was arrested ➡

297
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:17,204
Natsume won't be back anymore.

298
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:19,840
That's not true, uncle, let's do our best➡

299
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,310
I'll do anything. Me ➡

300
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,246
I've experienced this many times.

301
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:31,051
Once you know the truth, time won't go back.

302
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:36,156
I'm disqualified from the detective.

303
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,794
Okay, is it okay? Okay.

304
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:43,463
(Maruyama) Umm. Yes.

305
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:45,132
Ah. Oh!

306
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:47,167
Huh, uncle? Kosuke-kun.

307
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:52,372
Pin pon Pin pon! (Interhon sound)

308
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,041
Ah.

309
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:01,348
What? Kou-chan?

310
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:03,917
Sorry, but I'm serious.

311
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,786
So the reply is ➡

312
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:08,321
It's fine when my blueberry fruit grows.

313
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:10,924
Noooo thank you very much, that was helpful. No.

314
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:13,560
Oh, I heard you live near Kosuke.

315
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,228
Ah... Uncle ➡

316
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:17,764
It seemed difficult to put on. It's bad for machines and it's bad.

317
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,667
No no. Ah, thank you for helping me.

318
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,503
Natchan lives alone so I feel safe.

319
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:25,505
Ah. Then, uncle again.

320
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:27,574
Ah, thank you. What?

321
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:38,218
♬～

322
00:18:42,022 --> 00:18:44,024
Thank you for the meal. Thank you for the meal.

323
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:48,962
Ping Ping Ping Ping Ping!

324
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:52,532
It's okay, it's a landlord. Ah...

325
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:54,568
Ah, Natsume. Huh?

326
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:59,106
I'll just say it's my father. I don't want to be found out that there's a detective.

327
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:01,208
Yes. (Actually) Yes.

328
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,777
Oh, thank you for your continued support, Hattori-san.

329
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:05,979
(Hattori) What if that's fine? Huh?

330
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,914
This is a famous shishito dish from Wakayama. What?

331
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:10,717
I received a lot from my dad friend from my nursery school.

332
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:14,588
Wow, I love it, thank you very much.

333
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:16,256
It's Natsume's father.

334
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:17,924
Oh, thank you for your continued support.

335
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:20,193
This is it. (Hattori) Ah...

336
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,862
Tough! Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang...

337
00:19:21,862 --> 00:19:23,530
sorry.

338
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,866
I met Uncle Natsume.

339
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:29,870
Also? what happened?

340
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,406
When the perpetrator was arrested ➡

341
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:35,375
Natsume won't be back anymore.

342
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,444
I'm disqualified from the detective.

343
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:41,114
Don't be fooled!

344
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:44,985
Ugh...

345
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:49,322
Ah, Mikita-kun, sorry. It's a habit.

346
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:57,164
Uncle: There's no Natsume.

347
00:19:57,164 --> 00:20:00,534
But, but ➡

348
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:03,637
There's still Natsume.

349
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:10,277
What are you going out of control? Stop it.

350
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:15,048
Because he has to find the culprit quickly to help Natsume.

351
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:18,452
The perpetrator may be aiming for Mikita.

352
00:20:18,452 --> 00:20:20,120
Don't overdo it.

353
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,223
I'll do anything to help Natsume.

354
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:31,698
♬～

355
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:33,700
thank you.

356
00:20:35,936 --> 00:20:38,472
That's it ➡

357
00:20:38,472 --> 00:20:43,944
I wonder if we can continue to meet together like this in the future?

358
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:52,753
The feeling I talked about the other day➡

359
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:54,888
That's really.

360
00:20:57,057 --> 00:21:04,197
I live in my own world alone, my management, my assumptions ➡

361
00:21:04,197 --> 00:21:07,000
I didn't like it.

362
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,405
But let's put together our hands.

363
00:21:11,405 --> 00:21:13,273
Until you find the culprit.

366
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:29,890
Everyone who supports us and our husband and wife.

367
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:33,293
Sorry for the sudden report.

368
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:36,863
My husband, commercial director, Minakawa Mikita, was

369
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:42,235
It passed away on April 1st, 2025.

370
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:44,871
Funerals are held at relatives and acquaintances➡

371
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:48,975
I was able to finish with a friend attending.

372
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,977
Clap... (sound of hitting the keyboard)

377
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:40,861
You have to find the culprit as soon as possible.

378
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:42,529
(Maruyama) I really want to protect Natchan. ➡

379
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,197
I'll also get my husband to accept it.

380
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:46,233
Anything is fine, so if you have any information.

381
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:48,301
(Really) What was the person wearing black doing?

382
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:50,837
I'm also protecting Mikita.

383
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:52,906
I want to save Natsume.
