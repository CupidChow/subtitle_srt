00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,078
Uuh...

184
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:22,349
I want to meet you.

185
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:26,086
Tight Tight Tight...

186
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,088
Tight!

187
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:31,358
Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang...

188
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,663
Uuh...

189
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,331
Ha!

190
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:46,139
Mikita?

191
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,608
Natsume?

192
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,377
what? this.

193
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,981
dream?

194
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:58,552
Huh? What...

195
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:10,030
Ahhhh...

196
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,099
sorry.

197
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:16,203
Sorry to say I don't need a lunch box.

198
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:20,040
Why? Uhh... sorry.

199
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,008
Why is it?

200
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:24,711
That's Mikita.

201
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:28,215
Uuh...

202
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,160
What... is it a ghost?

203
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,563
ghost?

204
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:46,800
Because Mikita was hit by a car.

205
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:52,072
Uuh...

206
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,811
I also checked the body.

207
00:12:57,811 --> 00:13:03,917
Me? He's dead, isn't he?

208
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,585
Huh?

209
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:11,558
What, that's my smartphone.

210
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:13,393
Why is it broken like this?

211
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:16,930
Huh? Ah, no...

212
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,534
Huh?

213
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:27,541
There are two.

214
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,443
Shattering Shattering...

215
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:31,111
Kachan!

216
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:34,514
Shoe...

217
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,183
Natsume?

218
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:46,426
Haa...

219
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,564
Illusion?

220
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:13,653

221
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:15,322
Tight!

222
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:17,324
Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang...

224
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:30,570
This is ➡

225
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,040
What is called ➡

226
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,576
Is it the one who stands on a dream pillow?

227
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:40,514
Is the dead person me?

228
00:14:40,514 --> 00:14:45,419
Because it's Natsume's funeral now...

229
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:49,056
Huh? I don't know but.

230
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:52,592
Can I touch it?

231
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:57,998
♬～

232
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,666
Yeah.

233
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:04,871
♬～

234
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,707
warm.

235
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:12,713
It's Natsume. Uuh...

236
00:15:12,713 --> 00:15:15,482
Mikita.

237
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:17,217
Shatter Kata... Kachan!

238
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,920
Shoe...

239
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:32,566
♬～

240
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:35,669
Huh? It was definitely the real thing.

241
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:38,038
Really this... No...

242
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:40,374
(2 people) What's the situation?

243
00:15:40,374 --> 00:15:43,310
So it's not gone yet? Dream pillow.

244
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:47,547
Yes. That guy would be a shame.

245
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:51,818
No, I know it's impossible.

246
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:54,054
That's it, Natsumecchi. In this world➡

247
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:56,656
There are so many things that have not been clarified yet.

248
00:15:56,656 --> 00:16:00,660
For example, "Endgame," the fourth installment in the "Avengers" series...

249
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:05,098
This is the only thing Yumemakura's true identity, Mikita.

250
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:06,967
Parallel world?

251
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,169
A certain incident led to the world being divided into two parts.

252
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:12,172
A phenomenon in which each person lives in a different world on the same time axis.

253
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:13,840
Common sense of science fiction.

254
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,176
Another world...

255
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,512
Is that a sticky thing?

256
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:21,615
Will it stick? A new case?

257
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:23,283
here we go.

258
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:25,018
Here it is ➡

259
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:27,287
The world and the world ➡

260
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,723
It's like they mix together. No no no no ➡

261
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:31,825
I've never heard of it mixing together.

262
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,493
People come from another dimension ➡

263
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:37,064
The classic sci-fi movie of moving back and forth between two worlds is the classic.

264
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:38,732
I see.

265
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:41,168
Parallel world.

266
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:44,137
(Moriya) Mikita Are you okay? Take a little rest.

267
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:45,806
No, Manager ➡

268
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:47,474
Parallel worlds exist. (Moriya) Yes...

269
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:49,576
Like "Spiderbers," "Doctor Strench," and "Avengers."

270
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:52,412
Even the family movies that children can watch are nowadays, multidimensional concepts are being held ➡

271
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:54,081
It's adopted. (Moriya) That's exactly what it is.

272
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:55,982
The concept of a parallel world... I'd rather be at work ➡

273
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:58,752
It's distracting. I see.

274
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:01,088
But, well, don't overdo it.

275
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:03,156
Eat even a sweet bit and take a break.

276
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:05,058
That was also a wonderful work...

277
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:07,694
This is the first thing. Expressed in a parallel world...

278
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,362
thank you.

279
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,698
That's because I always liked this. It's a concept that can be said to be true.

280
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,701
Oh, that's right, and later, there is a multiverse in "The One" too...

281
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,938
Thank you for the wake. 6~

282
00:17:17,938 --> 00:17:19,806
I wanted to know what kind of person my husband is.

283
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:23,777
１ ２ ３ ４ ５ ６➡

284
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:26,346
marriage! Oh oh

285
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:29,416
Wife I'll put it in the passenger seat.

286
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,551
So, turn it and if an odd number appears, a bonus is born➡

287
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,820
It's 7. Wow!

288
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,889
It's noisy, I'll be careful a little.

289
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,458
You don't have to ride in the same car...

290
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:45,699
I wanted to hold my own handle.

291
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:51,471
You can aim for the same goal even with separate cars.

292
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:56,610
But the important thing is...

293
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:02,315
But it was still in the same world.

294
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:13,827

295
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:17,330
Is Natsume a really regular here?

296
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,733
(Maruyama) Sorry for keeping you waiting. (Riko) Yes.➡

297
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:22,335
This is our standard menu.

298
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,505
Huh? (Maruyama) I'm sad.

299
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:29,943
I loved Natchan too.

300
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,712
thank you.

301
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:34,448
When you're cheating or lying something ➡

302
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:36,883
It's also cute that her cheeks look plump.

303
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:40,654
Ah... when Natsume does that ➡

304
00:18:40,654 --> 00:18:42,956
If you're happy... It's not. ➡

305
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,425
That was definitely a sign when I wanted to say something.

306
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:47,094
No, that's not it...

307
00:18:47,094 --> 00:18:50,197
Maruyama-chi's replacement. (Maruyama) I'm insane.

00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:45,986
Manager Moriya can only take a space.

322

Huh?

333
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:20,687
This is truly a parallel world.

334
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:22,956
Tamura-kun said that too.

335
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:25,859
That's right, right. Tamura Tamura.

336
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:27,761
There are two worlds.

337
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:30,931
The world I live in and the world I live in.

338
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:34,067
Ah, it probably started back then.

No, isn't that the other way around?

342
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,642
Just the toast of Mikita was cooked ➡

343
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:44,544
So I took a bite and left first.

344
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:46,880
Reverse ➡

345
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,049
It's parallel! Oh wait a minute ➡

346
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:52,419
Parallel means parallelism, right?

347
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:55,055
Only here! Only here:

348
00:20:55,055 --> 00:20:59,025
The world is mixed together.

349
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:00,694
Are you mixing it?

350
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:03,864
Yes, mix.

Ah... Good.

368
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:08,862
What is it?

369
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:14,067

00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:18,939
Ah!

(Actually) It's not just a hit-and-run after all.

377
00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:47,234
Who is Yamacchi?

378
00:22:47,234 --> 00:22:49,169
We're definitely off.

379
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:52,906
