00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:31,351
Yes, let's make it winter at least.

189
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,019
(Moriya) What? Aiming for summer...

190
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,688
(Tamura/Riko) Ah! Natsume...

191
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,998
Is this the future?

192
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:48,969
I don't know if it was the car the detective said.

193
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,038
Ah, that's what it is.

194
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:55,075
Ah.

195
00:12:55,075 --> 00:13:01,248

196
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:03,517
You've stuck, it's a reward.

197
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:05,252
ah.

198
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:07,587
I can't get away with this anymore.

199
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:14,995
Ah, did you feel a little refreshed at your parents' house?

200
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,531
Yes, thank you. Haha.

201
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:19,199
Natsumecchi. Huh?

202
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:22,069
When hanging out the laundry, do you also dry men's pants?

203
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:24,204
It's gross. What is it? that.

204
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:27,107
It's safe to not be thought of as a woman living alone.

205
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:29,843
The entrance lock must be double locked and the door scope...

206
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:32,212
(Moriya) What? Are you starting now?

207
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:34,247
♬ Nibun (Aoki) back dancer's movements ➡

208
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,883
The client doesn't seem to like it.

209
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:40,187
Clients would like to make adjustments by the end of the weekend.

210
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:42,889
What, does that mean re-shooting?

211
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:46,493
(Aoki) What, it's not a problem that can be solved by editing...

212
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,361
I understand. I'll take a retake.

213
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,030
Are you planning on gathering dancers again?

214
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,799
Natsume P Are you really saying it? (Aoki) As expected from Natsume-san.➡

215
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,868
You will accept any order ➡

216
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:57,537
That's helpful! (Moriya) But ➡

217
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,973
There is also a general schedule adjustment.

218
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:02,109
Please consult us regarding delivery dates.

219
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:04,177
Thank you. (Imai) Please.

220
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,347
(Aoki/Natsume) Please. (Moriya) Yes please. ➡

221
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:11,284
I think it would be fine to fight more.

222
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:14,321
Not just the agency, but the staff too.

223
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:17,858
Huh? Well, sometimes I'm overexplaining my emotions ➡

224
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:20,794
I sometimes get a big quarrel though ➡

225
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:22,462
What is the relationship of trust with friends?

226
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:25,799
I think that's how I make it.

227
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,467
yes.

228
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,436
Hmm.

229
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:34,207
I also often got into a fight with my wife, haha.

230
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,611
But I can't do anything about it anymore.

231
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,148
He passed away 10 years ago.

232
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:44,718
Huh? Ah, I didn't know.

233
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,386
Uh uh uh uh.

234
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:51,291
Every time, we fight over something unimportant.

235
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:54,928
But let's say what we want to say ➡

236
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:58,131
Because I bumped into a lot ➡

237
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:02,669
I think the bond between the couple has become stronger.

238
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:08,775
Being close and building relationships ➡

239
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,844
Sometimes it's different.

240
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:17,050
That's right. Thank you very much.

241
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,719
(Moriya) You're welcome. Haha.

242
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:20,387
Haha.

243
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,060
welcome….

244
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,996
Right. Natchan.

245
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,765
I thought he might come again.

246
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:34,768
Haha, that's not the case.

247
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:38,205
Campari Soda. Natsume special.

248
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,643
Um, Ko-chan, I'm sure...

249
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:46,813
Don't say it. What?

250
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:49,916
I don't want a reply right now.

251
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,785
If you just want an answer ➡

252
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:55,322
It's certain that it will be 100% off.

253
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:57,224
So the reply is ➡

254
00:15:57,224 --> 00:16:01,528
It's fine when my blueberry fruit grows.

255
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,897
That blueberry ➡

256
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:06,333
It'll take another five years.

257
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,402
That's fine.

260
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:23,650
I wonder if Natsume will come to the mix tonight.

261
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,318
Tick...

262
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,987
Tough!

263
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,790
Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang...

264
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,793
Ah... Natsume.

265
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:40,267
Ah... Natsume.

266
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:43,770
sorry.

267
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:50,644
I wanted to meet you very much.

268
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:54,715
Sorry I ran away the other day.

269
00:16:54,715 --> 00:16:59,419
Today I came to talk properly.

270
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,588
Thank you, Natsume.

271
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:08,795
We are

272
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:12,566
He was a good partner at work, right?

273
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:15,102
Ah...

274
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:17,237
At work?

275
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:20,707
Me ➡

276
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:26,580
He was running away from facing Mikita properly.

277
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,915
I couldn't say I don't like smoothies either.

278
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:31,852
Huh? Junk sweets etc.

279
00:17:31,852 --> 00:17:34,721
I also want to eat chicken with oil twig ➡

280
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,591
I want to drink alcohol at my own pace.

281
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:40,861
It's about Natsume's health.

282
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:45,198
Did you notice?

283
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:53,440
Everything that he said was for me was for Mikita.

284
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,108
What does that mean?

285
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:57,911
Mikita always says ➡

286
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,914
I wish I could be the person who liked Mikita.

287
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:05,452
So I also suppress my feelings ➡

288
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:08,288
I started to swallow everything.

289
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:13,560
Since then.?

290
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:19,900
♬～

291
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:29,042
We're at the same workplace so you can pretty much understand it.

292
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:32,479
It would be more convenient to be able to grasp each other's actions, they are a couple.

293
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,815
Why do you decide that way?

294
00:18:34,815 --> 00:18:38,085
Oh, so that we can live together for a long time later➡

295
00:18:38,085 --> 00:18:40,754
Take two days a week to rest on your liver.

296
00:18:40,754 --> 00:18:44,124
On a day off of liver. Umm...

297
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,126
a little bit! Already ➡

298
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:48,595
Stop moving forward at your own pace.

299
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:52,165
This one is definitely more convenient.

300
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:56,903
At that time, I thought that no matter what I said to Mikita was useless.

301
00:18:56,903 --> 00:19:00,974
It's better for children to get up early. You can also record your basal body temperature to get pregnant...

302
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:04,745
Take it easy now!

303
00:19:04,745 --> 00:19:07,614
Ahhh... that's oily.

304
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:14,888
I didn't want to be managed that way.

305
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:18,225
No, I'm planning on managing it...

306
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,163
Us ➡

307
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:26,733
The couple remained unfinished.

308
00:19:28,402 --> 00:19:30,837
By bumping into one another,

309
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:33,907
If the bond between husband and wife becomes stronger ➡

310
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:39,946
Honestly, we only have 3 minutes a day.

311
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:43,450
It's difficult to become a couple.

312
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,553
Natsume What are you talking about?

313
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:48,221
Today is….

314
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:53,060
I came to say that.

315
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,728
Mikita.

316
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:01,635
Thank you so much.

317
00:20:05,739 --> 00:20:07,407
Natsume!

318
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,076

It's Mikita after all.

324
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:38,739
I live in my own world alone and have a strong sense of self-conception.

325
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:41,441
Trunk is just too thick.

329
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:59,059

335
00:21:21,515 --> 00:21:23,517
I was wrong.

<Living separately in two worlds ➡

337
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:31,558
I finally realized that mistake.

<From that day onwards, Natsume ➡

339
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:39,533
No longer appears in the mix.

(Manner mode)

341
00:21:44,071 --> 00:21:45,906
uncle?

342
00:21:45,906 --> 00:21:47,574
What does that mean?

343
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:49,376
The car that took place in the hit-and-run incident ➡

344
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:51,611
Found in a forest 10km away.

345
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:53,714
It was a stolen car.

346
00:21:53,714 --> 00:21:56,383
A stolen car? In other words: ➡

347
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:59,186
Crime Purpose ➡

348
00:21:59,186 --> 00:22:02,422
I consider it a murder due to grudge.

349
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:05,826
Does that mean someone was hated?

350
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:09,362
Do you have any thoughts?

351
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:12,065
No, it's not Mikita.

352
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:16,870
Because in Mikita's world, I was the one who died.

353
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:20,741
At the same time in two worlds, at the same place➡

354
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:24,878
Different people were killed.

355
00:22:24,878 --> 00:22:28,849
If the target of the perpetrator is ➡

356
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:32,152
If it's the lives of both of us.

357
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:37,057
The trunk thighs are also dangerous!

358
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:40,761
The culprit who killed Mikita?

359
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:43,497
Is it me next? You did it!

360
00:22:43,497 --> 00:22:45,832
We must have been killed by him.

361
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:48,502
(Moriya) Is that the truth? Natsume is in danger.

362
00:22:48,502 --> 00:22:50,170
Ugh...

363
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,839
I'll do anything to help Natsume.
