17

Yes. It's stressful to not be able to leave the house.

00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:12,139
It's no use. Are your hands okay?

19
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:14,474
It wasn't a big deal. What about Mikita?

20
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,843
Ah...it still hurts.

21
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:20,213
Uncle, he's a detective, even though he's not motivated.

Ah, that's right. The other day, my uncle...➡

Ah, this uncle said that.

24
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,154
(Recall) The perpetrator's car is every morning ➡

25
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:30,323
Is it because they were ambushed at that scene?

26
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:32,225
Or...

27
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:36,797
The perpetrator knew we were going through that scene.

28
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:39,066
Because when we go outside of our company,

29
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:41,268
You might use another station.

30
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:45,972
Certainly. You can also go to the right at that Y-crossing path.

00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:49,843
In other words, our schedule for that day➡

No, it's not that.

Yeah.

36
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:09,629
(Voice of the Heart) That morning, Natsume passed by here too.

37
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,765
Just as my uncle said ➡

38
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:15,135

I want to protect Natchan.

(Maruyama) I thought there was no chance that Natchan would get married anymore.

Yes. Apparently, construction has been cancelled ahead of this road.

67
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:38,245
So there are no witnesses? Yes, there are few cars and people walking.

It seems it wasn't just a hit-and-run incident.

78
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,606
Huh? Apparently it was a grudge.

79
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,643
Actually, my wife's uncle is a detective.

80
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,546
I think the person who hated Natsume committed the crime.

81
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:15,816
Huh? For Natsume?

00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,318

Normally, it's not a sauce, I want to eat tartare.

108

Tsuji Riko: It's a junkie, it's probably soy sauce, it's fish, right?

109
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,595
The fried horse mackerel is sauce.

00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,773
Yes. Yes.

183
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,909
Natsume might get mad though.

184
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:45,412
what? Ah...

185
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:48,782
Well, say it, I don't have time.

186
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:52,252
At this time ➡

187
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,921
Normally go out to eat?

188
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,590
Huh?

189
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:00,026
No, that's what I wrote.

190
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,929
They will be daily guardians and cook meals.

191
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,198
They'll do some shopping, so it's a thank you.

192
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,300
Ah... you might be in danger outside.

193
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,070
It's okay because it's the same with Moriya-san and Tamura-san.

194
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,540
Ah no, and ➡

195
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,277
That...Huh?

196
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,179
Guardianship? Huh?

197
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,549
Ah, I see.

198
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:28,188
Guardian. Ahh, that's right. Ahh...

199
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,856
Ahhh. Guardian.

200
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,059
Maybe ➡

201
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:35,695
Are you still suspecting of an affair?

202
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:40,300
Stop it, it's already over, that story.

203
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,838
I can't believe the manager of that game bar is also there.

204
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,506
It's not here.

205
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,442
Ping Ping Ping Ping Ping!

206
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:50,444
(Door opening and closing sound)

207
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:52,345
Natsume! uncle?

208
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:55,348
Ah... Mikita-kun was bad at doubting him.

209
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,250
Is this a mix?

210
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,886
It must have been true Wow.

211
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,789
Natsume. Ah...

212
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:05,325
Sorry, to motivate my uncle➡

213
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,294
I want you to believe that Natsume is alive ➡

214
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:08,962
I had no choice but to do this.

215
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:12,032
Well, certainly.

216
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:14,101
It's Natsume!

217
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:16,837
Hehe. I wanted to meet you.

218
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:18,605
me too.

219
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,574
I heard everything from Mikita.

220
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,677
We are rushing to investigate this world too.

221
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:26,179
Uncle, it's quick to understand and it helps.

222
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,648
Let's do our best for Natsume. Ah.

223
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:32,486
For Mikita's sake. (Morning Natsume) Yes.

224
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:35,689
We ask for your cooperation from everyone who passes by.

225
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:38,091
Please. (Imai) Please.

226
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,462
(Imai) Please.

227
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:49,302
(Actually) Have you seen this woman before?

228
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:53,840
(Hattori) These onions are delicious.

229
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,776
Ah... It's also popular with the theatre company members.

230
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,444
thank you.

231
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:04,918
Tough! Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang...

232
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:08,522
(Whisper) Mikita...

233
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:21,802
♬～

234
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,837
Thank you for your hard work.

235
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:34,381
Tough! Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang...

236
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:36,450
There's nothing particularly changed here.

237
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,186
Ah, I bought a door camera.

238
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,854
Ahhh. Thank you.

239
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:43,690
Haha. But there's no one who seems to be the culprit lately.

240
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,759
You ran away the other day, right? Yeah.

241
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,028
Why isn't he just attacking Mikita?

242
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:50,564
Isn't it because this is a man and that is a woman?

243
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:53,567
Eh, it was so scary.

244
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:55,469
Don't say you'd be attacked.

245
00:13:55,469 --> 00:13:57,137
Ah... I haven't said that.

246
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:59,973
Because the same thing happens in parallel worlds, right?

247
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:02,042
Ah, the basics. But I guess so ➡

248
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:05,512
Isn't the response between men and women different?

249
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,981
In other words? Ahh ➡

250
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:11,885
The same thing happens in two worlds.

251
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:14,688
Yes. There's something related to us ➡

252
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,456
It seems like it's starting to shift.

253
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:18,458
The attacking pattern...

254
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,160
It's a pattern that doesn't attack.

255
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,529
My uncle's actions were completely different too.

256
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,932
No, but when I start thinking about something off➡

257
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:28,468
It's getting a little headache.

258
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,470
yes?

259
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,673
There are two worlds like this, right? Yeah.

260
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:36,777
If the people who exist are different ➡

261
00:14:36,777 --> 00:14:43,083
The black suit and his uncle both act differently.

262
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,751
You know, don't you?

263
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:48,922
No, I think I know that though.

264
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,924
Ahhh.

265
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:56,797
Ah... sorry I said something strange again.

266
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:03,570
I'm sorry about this one. Ah...

267
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,407
Ah, this is an offering to me, right?

268
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:11,445
I want it a little. No, Hattori-san's share of it.

269
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:13,714
Huh? The people from Yamacchi's Association ➡

270
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:15,382
Didn't you come to our house?

271
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,484
Hattori's share farm run.

272
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:20,320
It's getting too much. Wow.

273
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,988
Well, then it's pesticide-free. Yes.

274
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:25,192
That's good. Have you not received it? From Hattori-san.

275
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:27,094
I've come many times.

276
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,396
Huh?

277
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:32,399
I've only got this one.

278
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,070
Hattori-san's share someday.

279
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:42,109
But it's not relevant to us, right?

280
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,777
But ➡

281
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:47,514
We were just as close as we could, right? Yeah.

282
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,182
Shatter Kata... Kachan!

283
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:50,851
Shoe...

284
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:56,189
♬～

285
00:15:56,189 --> 00:16:01,762
Me and Natsume were just as close as Hattori-san.

286
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:04,164
There are differences between men and women, though.

287
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:08,702
I wonder if Hattori's movements are so off.

288
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:13,106
And he's come to me many times.

289
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:19,346
♬～

290
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:22,616
Ping Ping Ping Ping Ping!

291
00:16:22,616 --> 00:16:24,484
At this time.

292
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:28,855
Hattori-san?

293
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:30,524
Konkon Konkon! (The sound of knock)

294
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:32,192
Huh?

295
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:37,764
Huh?

296
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:44,137
This time.

297
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:50,577

298
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:54,414
Kou-chan. Sorry it's late.

299
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:57,417
The bar is a bit busy.

300
00:16:57,417 --> 00:17:00,587
I'll come in. Please.

301
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:16,770
Thank you. Finally, I've gotten to sort my feelings out.

302
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,506
Why did you wander around all the time?

303
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:24,444
I can't accept Natchan.

304
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:27,447
My hair was also darkened for the funeral.

305
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:32,519
In the end I couldn't go.

306
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:37,858
That's what I've been hooked for so long and I hate myself as such a weaker person.

307
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:41,461
Ah...

308
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:46,299
I don't have the courage to come, so I only look at this place.

309
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:50,404
Tell me sooner.

310
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:53,073
Why did you run away the other day?

311
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:57,144
My husband hates me.

312
00:17:57,144 --> 00:18:00,247
Ah...

313
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:03,750
It's about Yamacchi.

314
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,920
Sorry at that time.

315
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,493
It's almost 49 days.

317
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:23,170

It's been 5 days.

320
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:33,447
Natchan ➡

321
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:36,850
Please let me know the other day's reply.

322
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,855
What are you talking about?

323
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:44,458
I'm sure I like it better.

324
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,793
I've been over 10 years ➡

325
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:50,130
Seriously, I've always had an unrequited love for Natchan.

326
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,965
Is it a long time? (Maruyama) Ugh...

327
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:55,068
About Mikita-san, the real Natchan ➡

328
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:59,473
Did you know everything? Uuh...

329
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:02,909
Stop it, that's the kind of thing that tends to happen.

330
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:07,914
(Maruyama) Uuh... Natchan uhhh.

331
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:11,084
Me ➡

332
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:14,921
He wasn't dealing with Kou-chan's feelings properly.

333
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:20,160
I could have answered it ➡

334
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,895
I was running away.

335
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,832
sorry.

336
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,669
I….

337
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:34,074
I can't date Kou-chan.

338
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:40,447
For me ➡

339
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:43,984
My precious childhood friend.

340
00:19:47,888 --> 00:19:53,560
Thank you for letting me know your feelings.

341
00:19:53,560 --> 00:20:01,635
♬～

342
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:03,837
But ➡

343
00:20:03,837 --> 00:20:06,940
Your husband can't protect Natchan anymore, right?

344
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:14,047
Yes.

345
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:19,519
He's protecting me so much now.

346
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,521
It's not just Mikita.

347
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:24,758
Me too.

348
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:31,064
I'm also protecting Mikita ➡

349
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,766
With your heart.

350
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:37,537
Tough! Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang...

351
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:39,206
Natsume Sorry I'm late...

352
00:20:39,206 --> 00:20:41,541
Mikita, here, here, here... Oh, oh.

353
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:44,644
My uncle is coming to protect me now.

354
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:47,381
So I'll wrap it up. I'll just go there and over there ➡

355
00:20:47,381 --> 00:20:49,049
It's strange that the shares are off.

356
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:51,918
Right, right? Yes. I'm Hattori-san ➡

357
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,587
We were talking about investigative information.

358
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:55,255
Apparently it was a grudge.

359
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,958
Actually, my wife's uncle is a detective.

360
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:01,628
I think the person who hated Natsume committed the crime.

361
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:04,164
Huh? For Natsume?

362
00:21:04,164 --> 00:21:06,299
To check if the police have staked it out➡

363
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:09,336
I brought vegetables every day. That's it.

364
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:12,639
I don't think Hattori knows anything about this one.

365
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:16,143
My uncle is supposed to be my father.

366
00:21:16,143 --> 00:21:18,378
Hattori is the culprit.

367
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,550
I'll have that uncle find out about Hattori.

368
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,720
No, I can't say it's off ➡

369
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,789
There's no evidence. Ahhhh.

370
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:31,158
Hmm, that's...

371
00:21:31,158 --> 00:21:33,160
Kachan! Shoe...

375
00:22:01,221 --> 00:22:06,960
Why did you aim for us?

376
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,229
I don't know the motivation.

377
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:15,268
So you knew what we were doing that day?

378
00:22:15,268 --> 00:22:17,704
But what we do

379
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,873
There's a way to grasp it...

380
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:23,510
be.

383
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:44,865
Let's find the real culprit as soon as possible.

384
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:47,167
To save Natsume! This is a hostage.

385
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:49,603
You don't know anything about us!

386
00:22:49,603 --> 00:22:51,338
The couple is a couple.

387
00:22:51,338 --> 00:22:53,003
Everything will be over today.
