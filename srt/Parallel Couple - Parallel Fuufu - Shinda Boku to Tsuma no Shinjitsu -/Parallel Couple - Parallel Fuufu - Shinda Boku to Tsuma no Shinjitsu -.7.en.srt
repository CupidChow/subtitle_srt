00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:07,241
Don!

2
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:10,777
(Narration) <My husband is no longer in this world>

3
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:17,084
<I'm not in this world in my husband's world>

4
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:22,422
<However, we each night at 11:22 for three minutes.

5
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:25,692
We were only able to meet in this room.

6
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:30,897
<We called this miraculous time a mix.>

7
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:34,501
(Kimita) Hattori-san, didn't you live in your own world?

8
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,169
<Use the mix ➡

9
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:40,173
We are approaching the truth behind the accident in our world.

10
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:42,476
It's a miracle to meet you!

11
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:45,212
<Finally, we've come to the truth>

12
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:49,349
The perpetrator was arrested thanks to Mikita. Thanks to the two.

13
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:53,053
<Yasaki thought that peaceful times would return.>

14
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,522
Gee...

15
00:00:55,522 --> 00:01:02,796
♬～

16
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:07,667
<Mikita has not noticed anything strange about the toaster.>

17
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:11,438
<Just a little more happy time>

18
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,174
Kachan! Shoe...

19
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:37,697
To keep it in your own heart ➡

20
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:41,835
Honestly it's getting a little painful.

21
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:43,837
(Reminiscence) Gee...

22
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:52,345
I wonder what will happen next.

23
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:54,014
(Tamura) Today we also have some recommended parallel items ➡

24
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:56,850
I'll take it with me. Yes, that movie is good too➡

25
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,919
Rather than just fiction...

26
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:01,354
Natsume-san! Ah, good morning. What's wrong?

27
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:04,357
Something like that seems dangerous. What?

28
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,059
Is it a dangerous person? (Riko) Quick!

29
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,131
Ah haha...➡

30
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,600
This is... a friend from my school days.

31
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,405
My name is Mizusawa. Thank you for your sadness this time.

32
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:21,541
Ah. It's dazzling.

33
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:31,418

34
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,958
Is that so from overseas?

35
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,329
I've seen SNS.

36
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:45,432
I just couldn't leave on the tour ➡

37
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:47,968
Sorry it's today.

38
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:52,039
Ah... Thank you very much.

39
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:56,076
Are you Kan's partner?

40
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:57,978
Yes, it's my wife.

41
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,646
It was.

42
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,184
What is that master?

43
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,853
Ah, see, that's it, um ➡

44
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:10,557
Like a friend from the Film Research Group.

45
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:15,328
(Hanako) Kan-chan is my compass.

46
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,731
That was when I was 20 years old.

47
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,133
I saw it seriously. What's your name?

48
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,669
(Hanako) When I was being hanged out by a man.

49
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,038
Seriously yes.

50
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,341
(Hanako) A child from the film research circle helped me.

51
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,010
I'm a boxer though.

52
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,447
That girlfriend doesn't like it?

53
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:36,650
Are you slutting it? Oh, that's amazing right now.

54
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,318
It's KO now. Please show me ➡

55
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,120
Please show me. Ah, see? This is how it is...

56
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,788
Oh ｡ One two three...

57
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,124
Amazing. Wow, amazing.

58
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:47,728
It's pho this time! Straight now...

59
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:55,335
(Hanako) That was how Kan-chan met.

60
00:03:55,335 --> 00:04:00,640
What? Mikita is so cool. It's the first episode of a romance drama.

61
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,443
(Hanako) Kan-chan said I was in trouble ➡

62
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,947
He reached out and pointed in the direction I was heading.

63
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:11,385
Ha... my master wants to decide on a lot soon.

64
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:13,820
They filmed videos for the audition.

65
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,691
Yes, he's the type who can't leave someone in trouble alone.

66
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,359
(Hanako) Someday with two people ➡

67
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,729
I had promised to aim for the world.

68
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,731

69
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:31,004

70
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:35,409
During my lifetime, I was very grateful for Namikawa.

71
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,880
(Hanako) That's this.

72
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,316
Wow, this is a super-high-class Japanese sweet.

73
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:48,755
Kan-chan, I had no eyes.

74
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,490
thank you.

75
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,029
I don't think he's an ex-girlfriend.

76
00:04:56,029 --> 00:05:01,501
Well, it's not really relevant, but it was a long time ago.

77
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,704
That's right. Yes.

78
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:07,307
Even though he tried to mess with him, Mikita was no longer there.

79
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,913
No, there is.

80
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,919
I learned about the news of his death through online news.

81
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:24,091
(Hanako) I'll offer this to my wife.

82
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:25,759
thank you.

83
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,698
It's become a hot topic of conversation with Hana-chan's musical.

84
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:35,001
Off-Broadway is a huge competitive rate.

85
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:41,975
(Hanako) I'll do anything if I can.➡

86
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:44,945
Me... (Riko) Please

87
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:49,015
Ahh haha. Thank you.

00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,772
This is really rare. What? Really?

92
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,511
It's definitely suspicious, isn't it? Is it suspicious?

93
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:20,213
What? Do you normally say it? ➡

94
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,417
I'll do anything if I can ➡

95
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:26,553
For a man who just lost his wife.

96
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:30,457
Oh... Mikita is such a popular character.

97
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,626
How about falling in love with someone?

98
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:37,464
It can be a surprising simple thing that can be triggered.

99
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:39,766
yeah? Wasn't he not interested in romance?

100
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,035
I'm just not interested in marriage.

101
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:45,338
But I couldn't help Natsume's husband.

102
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,708
I will never forgive you.

103
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:51,044
Tsuji Riko You haven't put any poison in your coffee, right?

104
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:54,081
What do you think of Maruyama-cchi?

105
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,416
It's about Natsume's rival appearing.

106
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,218
It's not just a rival...

107
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:01,121
Because even if Natsume is gone ➡

108
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:03,490
The two are married.

109
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,430
Maybe Tsuji Riko...

110
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,599
what?

111
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,569
No, anything.

112
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,579
Something's getting nervous.

113
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,417
Tough! Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang...

114
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,085
Ah, Natsume. Mikita?

115
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:35,489
Ah! Why Tamura?

116
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:38,024
I consulted.

117
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,927
I want to understand this phenomenon a little more.

118
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:44,831
Mikita You don't die leaving Natsumecchi behind.

119
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,900
How much did we cry? Ah...

120
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,003
Oh, that's right, let's take a photo. Photo yes.

121
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,572
I'll go.

122
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:55,208
Yes cheese.

123
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,311
Yeeeee I was able to take a picture.

124
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,114
I've tried that many times.

125
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:03,550
Ah, but I can only see my own world.

126
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,353
I see, parallel worlds are not proven easily ➡

127
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:08,188
Was that how it was?

128
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,861
Huh, Mikita? Jiji...

129
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:19,566
Oh no, how far is the world connected in the first place?

130
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:24,671
It's probably only inside of these, mainly that toaster.

131
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,374
The relationship between electrical appliances and the time paradox.

132
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:31,078
No, in this case the timeline is the same.

133
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:32,746
This too...

134
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,648
My university friends came to see me today.

135
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:37,350
Ah, she's such a beautiful woman who came over here too.

136
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,154
Yes. Is it Mizusawa-san? We were good friends.

137
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:43,223
She's amazing.

138
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:46,626
I auditioned every single one and failed many times ➡

139
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:50,197
Still, I made my dream come true by dancing.

140
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:53,066
I was inspired too.

141
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:55,302
Oh, is it about time?

142
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:59,573
As expected of Tamura, it's about 3 minutes. Oh.

143
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:04,444
Mixed time is about 3 minutes. Yes.

144
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:07,347
OK. See you tomorrow. shatter...

145
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,015
See you next time. Kachan!

146
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,684
Yes. Shoe...

147
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:13,153
That's Tamura: Will you come again tomorrow?

148
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:14,821
Ahhh.

149
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,892
What's wrong?

150
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,830
no….

151
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:29,036
I think that person is also in Mikita's world.

152
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:31,471
Mizusawa-san.

153
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:38,245
Something deep bond between the two? I felt it.

154
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,946
No, I guess so.

155
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,915
She's so beautiful, isn't she?

156
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,583
Those beauty standards vary from person to person...

157
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,154
It's a compass. A compass?

158
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:51,425
Mikita seems to have no eye on this too.

159
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:54,528
Anyway, what is the bond between Mikita and Natsumecchi?

160
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:56,897
I know the best.

161
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:59,866
I will definitely regain the happiness of both of you.

162
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:05,372
Hehe.

163
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,407
Thank you, Tamura-kun.

164
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:10,711
So I'm about to have the last train. Yes.

165
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,379
Well then. Yes.

166
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:25,826
♬～

167
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:27,494
good.

168
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:32,866
(Aoki) That's a great idea. You're so enthusiastic, Natsume P.

169
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:34,534
(Riko) I don't know.

170
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:38,572
You're trying your best to suppress the hard feelings.

171
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:41,141
I'd invite you to eat as a way to relax.

172
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,477
I don't know, Tsuji Riko.

173
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:47,047
Natsume P is really fulfilling every day...

174
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,715
Oops, more than this.

175
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:51,451
Something's annoying. That's right Tsuji Riko ➡

176
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,153
It's fine to invite me to eat, but ➡

177
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,223
After that, don't drag Natsume P around late.

178
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:58,058
Huh? Who are you?

179
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,726
thank you.

00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:05,465
(Voice of the heart) What should I do?➡

181
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:08,135
About that woman.

182
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:13,673
Also, it seems that Mikita hasn't noticed it yet➡

183
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:18,345
I feel like something's going on in the mix.

184
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:26,019
Before we knew it, it was becoming common for us to meet.

185
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,687
Thinking about it ➡

186
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,090
It's better to be able to meet like that ➡

187
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,125
It's strange though.

188
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,498
(Notification sound)

189
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:55,649
More than me, who can only meet for three minutes a day.

190
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:59,586
If there's someone you can always meet.

191
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:07,427
I'm already with Mikita.

192
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:09,596
I can't even walk in the sun.

193
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,598
Tough! Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang...

194
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,502
What about Tamura?

195
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:18,839
Ah, something suddenly started working overtime.

196
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,441
Well, can't you do it?

197
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,877
Huh? Someone has come.

198
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:27,214
Hana-chan. He came to raise the incense sticks.

199
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,551
Ahhh.

200
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:34,221
Hey, what happened?

201
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:35,889
Hmm.

202
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:42,729
I've become able to talk about anything to Mikita ➡

203
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:46,233
It's after Mikita dies.

204
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:50,737
The relationship like Mikita and Mizusawa-san ➡

205
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:53,073
I feel like I couldn't make it.

206
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:56,410
Is it the relationship between me and Hana? Yeah.

207
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:59,913
It's not blurred, Mizusawa-san.

208
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:03,750
I believe in Mikita.

209
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,920
Ahhh.

210
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:13,093
Um, what should I say?

211
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:18,765
Feel like a comrade? Like-minded and fellow-minded.

212
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:22,436
Is that like Tamura-kun or Riko-chan?

213
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:24,671
Yes I think it's close.

214
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:30,544
But Hana-chan has been working hard on her own.

215
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:35,949
But you like it, right?

216
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:41,221
Haha, she has no romantic feelings.

217
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:43,457
absolute?

218
00:13:43,457 --> 00:13:46,226
Absolutely. Hmm.

219
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:49,796
I think I respected her for having her.

220
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:54,134
He was someone who could make efforts that he couldn't imitate.

221
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:56,570
More for Natsume ➡

222
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,741
I'm getting something like normal comfort.

223
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:02,476
what? It's normal.

224
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:07,080
Hmm, that's the most important thing.

225
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,649
What should I say? Ahhh ➡

226
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:12,753
This... Umm... ➡

227
00:14:12,753 --> 00:14:16,356
Mountain-shaped toast and square toast ➡

228
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,024
Even if your preferences are different ➡

229
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:21,161
Pon! Just come out with it ➡

230
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:24,664
It makes me feel like I'm happy.

231
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,536
Hmm, Mikita.

232
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:33,273
Hmm.

233
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:38,612
♬～

234
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:43,216
Ahhh, sorry, boring and silly.

235
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:46,119
However, it may not be bad for your nerves to be fed up.

236
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:48,889
Hahaha, what are you talking about? Hahahaha.

237
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,391
But there's no need to worry about that anymore. Hana-chan ➡

238
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,628
I'll return to my hometown tomorrow afternoon on a flight. What?

239
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:56,963
I came to say that.

240
00:14:56,963 --> 00:15:12,913
♬～

241
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,749
Can you return to your hometown?

242
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:21,254
Ah... that luggage.

243
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:27,861
I'll leave Tokyo and work in my hometown.

244
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:29,529
So what about dance?

245
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:34,534
I came into contact with the world and learned my limits.

246
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:38,538
I have no regrets because I've done it.

247
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,377
It's all thanks to Kan-chan.

248
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:51,284
(Hanako) I thought I'd stop dancing and try to find a job after all.

249
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:55,889
Is that a dream that makes me want to give up?

250
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:59,926
Uhh... hmmm.

251
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,164
(Hanako) What do you think?

252
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:09,569
If it's a dream that makes me want to give up, I'd give up ➡

253
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:12,472
If you can't give up ➡

254
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:19,413
I think if I try hard, I won't be able to give up.

255
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:24,751
Why not ask Hana-chan's true self?

256
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,354
Uuh...

257
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,264
Haha, it looks like a mitsuta.

258
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:42,269
He showed me the direction I should go.

259
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:46,707
What will you do now?

260
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:52,479
I work at Ayamedo.

261
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,015
Monaka's?

262
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:59,486
It's my parents' house. Is that so?

263
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:05,792
By the way, why today?

264
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:11,732
I wanted to meet again.

265
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:20,574
I misunderstood it on my own, and it was about Mikita and Mizusawa-san.

266
00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:23,377
My ex-girlfriend too.

267
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:28,148
Hahaha ha ha.

268
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:33,053
I can't stand with your wife. What?

269
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:36,056
I've been checking it all the time.

270
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:38,225
A couple support each other ➡

271
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:43,296
The two of them making high quality works.

272
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:47,334
Kan-chan, both at work and at life➡

273
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:50,904
I think I've been blessed with the best partner.

274
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:56,877
♬～

275
00:17:56,877 --> 00:18:01,882
Ah me ➡

276
00:18:01,882 --> 00:18:04,551
I liked Kang.

277
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,756
(Hanako) No, I couldn't confess my feelings ➡

278
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:13,560
But I want to express my feelings somehow. ➡

279
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,563
Kan-chan's favorite waist bag ➡

280
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:19,099
Secretly embroidery.

281
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,435
Embroidery?

282
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:25,472
Yes, I'm almost a stalker.

283
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:30,043
It's like your spell-like wish comes true.

284
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:33,680
Hahahaha, that's insane.

285
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,551
No, but I understand.

286
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:44,124
This has been sealed as a dark history of my own.

287
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:49,463
This is the 9th year confession for only my wife.

288
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:55,335
Why did you talk about that?

289
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:59,639
Because they have a married couple's history.

290
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:06,413
I felt Kan-chan inside my wife.

291
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:09,883
(Hanako) The past ➡

292
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:14,354
It's an important time that made me who I am today.

293
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:21,495
But I'll switch. Do I switch?

294
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:26,900
I am the one who will create the future ahead.

295
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:32,572
♬～

296
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34,474
I wish you the best.

297
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:37,077
yes.

298
00:19:37,077 --> 00:19:42,249
I will also support your wife's future.

299
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:46,253
My future...

300
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:55,328
Ah... there was, there was. Good luck.

301
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:59,099
Is this about this? Yes this is this.

302
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:01,101
I used it on site a lot when I was a budding player.

303
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:02,969
Yes. Something like this design ➡

304
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:05,072
I thought I wanted it.

305
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,843
Hana-chan is her younger name, Hanako.

306
00:20:09,843 --> 00:20:11,611
Hanako-san. Yes.

307
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:13,480
It's something different from what I imagined it ➡

308
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,550
It feels right when I learn about Mizusawa-san.

309
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,585
Cute. Hahaha.

310
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:21,988
Her image is stoic and powerful.

311
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:24,558
That's why I'm a little reluctant to know the name Hanako.

312
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:26,226
Hmm.

313
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,495
He always looks scary, but he's very sensitive.

314
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:30,931
That's getting more positive.

315
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:33,066
(The two) Hahaha.

316
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:45,512
Haha. What's wrong?

317
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:48,615
yeah? Yes, it's not good.

318
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:50,283
yeah?

319
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:54,187
Take care of it. Yes.

320
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:57,391
Come to think of it, I heard about meeting Mizusawa-san.

321
00:20:57,391 --> 00:21:00,627
yeah? It's cool and drama-like.

322
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:02,696
♬｢encore｣

323
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:06,433
Haha, is that so? Yeah.

324
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:10,237
I think he was when he was twenty.

325
00:21:10,237 --> 00:21:13,807
I was scouting locations with a fellow Gekiken friend.

326
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:17,477
Children from the same department ➡

327
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:20,013
You were having trouble recruiting a club.

328
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:24,084
Ah, why not try a movie?

329
00:21:24,084 --> 00:21:26,353
No, what's that? You come later.

330
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:28,588
Ah... I want her to be the heroine ➡

331
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:30,991
A zombie movie...

332
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:33,493
That's how I met Hana-chan.

333
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,962
Mizusawa-san is a little glorified.

334
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:38,198
Hmm, I see.

336
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,842
Hey, Mikita. Huh?

337
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:52,012
Hmm. Haha, wait.

338
00:21:55,082 --> 00:21:58,452
What will our future be like?

339
00:21:58,452 --> 00:22:02,322
I can't even imagine it.

340
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:05,692
If this situation is ➡

341
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:08,628
If it lasts forever, I...

342
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:10,297
Batchin!

343
00:22:10,297 --> 00:22:11,965
Huh? Oh?

344
00:22:11,965 --> 00:22:13,633
what? Haa...

345
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:16,203
Huh, what? this.

346
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:20,407
Smoke came out of the toaster a while ago.

347
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:22,075
Is that so? Yeah.

348
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:25,779
Maybe ➡

349
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:28,515
The end of the mix may be approaching.

350
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:30,517
Tick...

351
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:40,060
What happens when the mix is ​​over?

352
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,229
I have to think about the end too. Just take it easy!

353
00:22:42,229 --> 00:22:44,931
(Goro) I want you to apologize properly. Is it too late for your father?

354
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:46,900
Because we won't be able to meet forever.

355
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,936
Who is it that you're going to disappear without your consent?

356
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:52,539
We might be able to get back to normal too.
