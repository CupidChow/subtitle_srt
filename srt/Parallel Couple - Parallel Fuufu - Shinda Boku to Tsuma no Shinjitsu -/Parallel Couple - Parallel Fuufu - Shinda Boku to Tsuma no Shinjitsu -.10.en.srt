(Kinta) There's one. Natsume. (Natsume) What? this.

Hey, Mikita, are you okay? Have you chanted something?

20
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,575
(Tamura) Yes I'm chanting. How to come.

21
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,611
incantation? I'm scared. What? Would you like to call out to me?

22
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:19,846
(Moriya) No, but it's because they're chanting it.

23
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:22,049
How to come. Wow.

I'm sure you don't overdo their bodies.

I'm not going to be surprised anymore.

mother.

64
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:58,205
I've always been surprised by Natsume for a long time.

65
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:01,041
Ever since ancient times? Yes, yes. Ah.

66
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,578
Ahhh, ah.... Huh?

67
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,614

I'm crying so much. It's so cute.

(Kaede) Usually when I'm back ➡

71
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,324
I'm worried because he's not coming back at all.

72
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:20,427
Wasn't he kidnapped? I was thinking that.

73
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,363
So? What? Contact the police ➡

74
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,566
When I said that, I came home with a frivolous look on my face.

75
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,468
But aren't you crying so much?

76
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:32,139
Because mom, I'm so angry. ➡

77
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,175
What were you doing until this time? If you ask me that.

78
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:38,545
Uhh... a present for mom.

79
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:41,948

I? Yeah.

82
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:51,091
A friend told me that if you find it you'll be happy.

83
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,060
I don't remember.

84
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,730
Come on, after mom and dad leave ➡

85
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,500
I was desperate to raise Natsume.➡

86
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,036
From a perspective of Natsume, I was

87
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,973
I guess he didn't look happy ➡

88
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,177
I regret it.

89
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:16,149
My life is happy thanks to Natsume.

90
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,851
Hehe.

91
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,889
Thank you for being born to me.

00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:31,264
Haha, thank you to me.

00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,066
I'm sure Natsume's child will be too ➡

94
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:36,803
One day, there will be a time when I will be grateful to you like this.

No returns. Ah...➡

102

Toaster savior?

106
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:26,920
It's not sold for a long time ➡

107
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,258
I was thinking about getting rid of it soon.

108
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,226
Ah, hey, I'll buy this.

109
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,363
yeah? Pop-up toaster? Yeah.

110
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:38,432
With this shape, only bread can be baked.

111
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:40,233
Isn't this better?

112
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,603
No, this one is more interesting.

113
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:46,707
Two slices of bread for breakfast! I'd like to see it coming out.

114
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:49,409
Do you need fun for breakfast?

115
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,013
Is it necessary? Why?

116
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,148
Hmm, ah.

117
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:58,185
Anyway, while we're all allying together ➡

118
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:01,088
It's not necessary. There's one!

119
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:06,259
Two of you guys bought it that day.

120
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:11,598
So the toaster savior.

121
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,835
Come to think of it, that's right.

122
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,503
What happened to that?

123
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:20,540
Ah, this toaster has a mysterious power ➡

124
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,209
Have you ever heard of it?

125
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:24,678
It's like meeting people you can no longer see.

126
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,346
Oh!

127
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,182
Ah... what is it? Ah➡

128
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:32,018
It's fine to talk about the owner before.

129
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:36,990
No, it came from another store.

130
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,226
Ha... Ah and ➡

131
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:42,162
Did you marry that girl properly?

132
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,101
Ah, yes, we've become a couple.

133
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,637
Of course it was good.

134
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:54,908
Let's live together and live in good health.

135
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:59,579
Yes, I'll do my best. Yes.

136
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:04,684
(Voice of the heart) I wonder if this story will laugh?

137
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:08,722
No, if it were Mikita, he would be moved and crying.

138
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,526
Tick...

139
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:23,036
There's no mixing happening again.

140
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:27,007

No... (Moriya) Huh?

159
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:29,036
I'm pregnant.

160
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:33,840
I mean, I was doing it. Ah...

161
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,678
It's been three months now.

Congratulations. Thank you very much.

Umm, here it is.

166

(Moriya) There's no need to worry.

167

What abruptly?

170

What about Natsume?

178
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:46,780
I was hospitalized. Is it hospitalized?

179
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:51,685
Natsumecchi asked Mikita to tell him about his hospitalization.

180
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:58,525
For now, both mother and child are not life-threatening.

181

Ah, that's good.

182
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:06,266
So why do you know about children?

183
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,135
I asked Natsumecchi at the hospital.

184
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:09,803
But why are you hospitalized?

185
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,806
I collapsed at work because I had pregnancy anemia.

186
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:15,409
Moriya-san accompanied me to the hospital.

187
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:19,479
Just to be safe, I'll be at the hospital one night tonight.

188
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:26,053
Ah... I see, the manager.

189
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:30,624
I can only meet in this room.

190
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:32,659
Let me start with the conclusion.

191
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:35,162
With the manager Natsumecchi ➡

192
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:37,964
I'm planning to raise Mikita's child. Huh?

193
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:40,300
I also thought about a lot of things but ➡

194
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,736
Thinking about children in this situation➡

195
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:45,505
I think that choice isn't bad either... No, wait a minute ➡

196
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:48,809
That's really strange. I guess the manager would be safe.

197
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,477
Natsumechi doesn't worry either ➡

198
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:53,180
I wonder if I can raise a child.

199
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,348
You didn't help us?

200
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,017
That's.... I'm shit...

201
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:59,086
Hey, Tamura.

202
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:00,754
Jiji...

203
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:04,057
Can you hear it? Hey!

204
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,726
Shatter Kata... Kachan!

205
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,394
Shoe...

206
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,063
What is that?

207
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:15,302
♬～

208
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:19,806
What is it... That's too bad.

209
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:25,178
Please do something.

210
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,647
Did you save you?

211
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,783
We every morning...

212
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:31,451
Kachan!

213
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:36,823
♬～

214
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:42,129
That's right... That's right.

215
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,797
Excuse me.

216
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:46,466
what up?

217
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:48,635
Manager. (Moriya) Yes.

218
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:51,605
Is there free tonight?

219
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:58,311
Please. Yes, even so ➡

220
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:01,681
Why the room? yeah? ➡

221
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,617
Pop-up toaster?

222
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,620
I really want Natsume.

223
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,456
I thought I wouldn't need it until I used it either.

224
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,492
What? Isn't that a little more?

225
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,895
Will it really come out? It'll come out.

226
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:16,563
Kachan! Oh!

227
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:19,232
Haha. Oh haha, it's interesting.

228
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,868
Well, it's going to make the morning more enjoyable.

229
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:26,006
Yes. Actually, from Moriya-san.

230
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:30,043
They told me to cherish the morning time we spend together.

231
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:32,045
We're still peep➡

232
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:35,515
I'm really busy and can't be together during the day.

233
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,617
Well, that's right.

234
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:41,188
So if you're wondering what to do ➡

235
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:43,457
My senior in life taught me.

236
00:13:43,457 --> 00:13:47,060
So I wanted to enjoy the morning time as much as possible.

237
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:54,267
Wow, it's hot!

238
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,169
I'm glad I bought it.

239
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:59,606
Let's continue to cherish the mornings we spend together for the rest of our lives.

240
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:01,675
Haha.

241
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,977
Huh?

242
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:06,713
I can't believe it's not a proposal, is it?

243
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,682
No, no, no, no. What?

244
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:12,886
Ah, no, it's not different, but ah, how's that?

245
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:15,889
Everyone gathers to propose, wow! Or something like that.

246
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:18,191
Hahaha!

247
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,961
There's no choice. Hahaha.

248
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,332
If there was no manager ➡

249
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:28,702
Maybe they didn't become a married couple with Natsume.

250
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:32,472
I believe in the club manager. Mikita?

251
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:36,143
Does the manager like Natsume?

252
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:37,944
Huh?

253
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:47,354
Ah... hmm.

254
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:52,025
Of course I like Natsume.

255
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,763
It's about the same as Mikita.

256
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,432
As much as me?

257
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:04,971
They are important subordinates and important friends for me.

258
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:06,973
Tell me what happened.➡

259
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:09,609
In other words, in another world ➡

260
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:12,412
Natsume is alive. Yes.

261
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:15,615
I'm in Natsume's world. Yes.

262
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:18,985
Did you say you're raising two children?

263
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:23,824
Ah yes, but I can't believe this story.

264
00:15:23,824 --> 00:15:25,959
No, I believe it. Oh...

265
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,961
Ahhh, but as expected... hmm? ➡

266
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:30,831
Um. Yes yes yes yes yes.

267
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:36,169
(Moriya) Huh?

268
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:39,239
I'm coming. What?

269
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,808
Tough! Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang...

270
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,810
Ha...

271
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,545
B... Manager!

272
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:48,949
Moriya-san.

273
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:51,118
Are you me?

274
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:54,054
I'm me... And ➡

275
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:56,323
Are you me too?

276
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:59,059
This is what happens... This is what happens...

277
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:01,595
(2 people) are there.

278
00:16:01,595 --> 00:16:04,498
Why is that manager here?

279
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:07,634
Ah, actually ➡

280
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:11,338
There's an important story about Mikita.

281
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:13,006
ah.

282
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:22,249
In fact, there's an important story about Mikita.

283
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:23,917
(Moriya) Ah.

284
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:26,053
Moriya-san ➡

285
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:31,191
They all said they would help raise their children.

286
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,560
Together? Yeah.

287
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,864
Let's raise Mikita's child together.

288
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,469
Moriya-san What's suddenly...

289
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:46,206
(Moriya) That would be better for the sake of the children too.

290
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:49,710
I'm not saying it with a reasonable mindset.

291
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,245
And as much as I say in my mouth ➡

292
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:56,316
I don't think I can easily cooperate with raising my children.

293
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:59,319
But it's not like that.

294
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:02,089
At any time ➡

295
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:06,827
I want you to know that you're not alone.

296
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:10,263
Yes, thank you very much.

297
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:13,266
Yes. But...

298
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:17,371
I'm not alone.

299
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:20,073
Haha... What?

300
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:24,311
So we also talked about mixing.

301
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:28,081
I was thinking of having Mikita tell him directly from Moriya-san.

302
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:31,685
Ah... That's right.

303
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:34,488
Everyone will be there here. ➡

304
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:37,357
You can rest assured even when you can't meet.

305
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:41,027
(Moriya) But I guess this kind of thing happened ➡

306
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,696
Honestly, I was surprised.

307
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:45,632
I'm a bit of a good person in that world.

308
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:47,601
Right? Haha.

309
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:49,770
I'm happy to meet Moriya-san over there as well.

310
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,506
Ah, I'm happy to meet you too.

311
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:55,475
I'm happy to meet Mikita too. Then...

312
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:02,082
It's okay if I'm not here.

313
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,151
Huh?

314
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:09,756
Only people from that world can protect Natsume.

315
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:13,493
The mix is ​​unstable.

316
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:16,163
Honestly ➡

317
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:20,000
I can only meet in this room ➡

318
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,505
I can't help Natsume and my children.

319
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:32,746
Manager: Please about Natsume ➡

320
00:18:32,746 --> 00:18:34,681
thank you.

321
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:39,352
Mikita.

322
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:44,024
(Moriya) Me and everyone in the world of the same person ➡

323
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:46,960
I think he will definitely protect Natsume.

324
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:53,166
But Mikita.

325
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:56,937
You are Natsume's husband and the father of a child.

326
00:18:56,937 --> 00:18:59,106
For Natsume, Mikita is ➡

327
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:02,943
I'm here, you're the only one here right now!

328
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,148
(Moriya) I'm in this world ➡

329
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:12,786
I will work together with everyone to think about how I can help raise my children.

330
00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:16,156
So you're in that world ➡

331
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,825
Think about what you can do.

332
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:23,930
Is it something I can do?

333
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:35,709
♬～

334
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:38,011
Shatter Kata... Kachan!

335
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:40,013
Shoe...

336
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,419
Ah...

337
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:52,092
I'm the only one.

338
00:19:52,092 --> 00:19:54,194
That's right.

339
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,163
You're the only one ➡

340
00:19:56,163 --> 00:20:00,767
And there are your friends over there too.

341
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:06,373
(Moriya) I'll help you no matter what ➡

342
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:09,142
The best friends.

343
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:13,080
yes.

344
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,781
(Everyone) Mix!?

345
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:17,818
Yes. And now ➡

346
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:22,689
There are days when problems occur in the mix and sometimes there are days when problems don't come.

347
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,825
So that's...

348
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,830
I want everyone to help.

349
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,933
I know that you won't believe this story.

350
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:34,935
But... you.

351
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:36,903
Ah...

352
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,406
Why don't you say it right away?

353
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,375
This kind of story should be discussed first.

354
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,478
It's true. Work instructions are annoyingly quick.

355
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:46,847
Imai Tamura.

356
00:20:46,847 --> 00:20:48,849
There's no way you can do something on your own.

357
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:51,385
Let's all quickly find out about the mix.

358
00:20:51,385 --> 00:20:53,587
(Imai) Yes. I can't.

359
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:55,255
Riko-chan.

360
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:59,092
Can Natsume live in another world and meet only at night?

361
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:02,429
what? That doesn't make sense.

362
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:07,234
Natsume died.

363
00:21:07,234 --> 00:21:10,704

Thank you very much for your help from Tamura-kun over here...

387
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,922
<It can be overcome.>

388
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:40,394
Think of your name. Is it a name?

389
00:22:40,394 --> 00:22:42,996
If the mixing time continues to decrease.

390
00:22:42,996 --> 00:22:44,765
My grand project.

Can you leave that room? (Moriya) For children ➡

00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:49,236
Isn't it okay to pound so embarrassing?

393
