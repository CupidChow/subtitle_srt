(Narration) <The Namikawa couple who have split into two worlds and lost each other ➡

00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,679
A few minutes each night ➡

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,782
We were only able to meet in this room.

00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:19,853
<The two called this miracle a mix.

(Kinta) <However, the mix is every day ➡

6
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,028
My heart was almost crushed.

7
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,097
<I asked for help.>

8
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:33,533
I want everyone to help you. (Tamura) Why don't you say it right away?

9
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,370
<They were trustworthy friends>

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,872
Tough! Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang...

11
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,741
(Natsume) Everyone. It's a lie. Hey.

12
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:43,677
Ahh... is it really real?

13
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:46,847
It's real, Tamura-kun.

14
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:49,282
Don't cry. (Moriya) You're probably crying the most.

15
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:50,951
Parallel world is real!

16
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:54,654
(Moriya) Let's be stupid now... Hahaha.

17
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:01,261
Tick... Tick Bat...

18
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:04,831
Everyone in Mikita's world is warm too.

19
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,500
Yeah.

20
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,036
I wish I had told everyone sooner.

21
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:11,905
Ahhh ➡

22
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,841
I wish I could go there now.

23
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,511
Really? Do you think so?

24
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:20,514
Yeah.

25
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:23,984
As your stomach gradually gets bigger.

26
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:27,287
Yes. With Mikita ➡

27
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:30,223
I feel like I want to raise a child.

28
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:39,666
Raising a child together is like a dream.

29
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,002
Ah, that's right, Mikita. Huh?

30
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,970
Think about the name.

31
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,175
It's okay to have a boy or a girl.

32
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:50,544
Is it your name? Yes.

33
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:55,115
Hmm. Hehehe.

34
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,017
I wonder what?

35
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:58,685
Shatter shatter... What...

36
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:01,922
Kachan! Shoe...

37
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:04,091
Ahhh.

38

♬～

39
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:13,567
(Voice of the heart) I want to put my name into it.

40
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:24,344
No, Natsume is hiragana and is probably related to nature.

41
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,113
(Recollection Moriya) You're in that world ➡

42
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:28,949
Think about what you can do.

43
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:31,618
Is it something I can do?

44
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:50,837
♬～

45
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,540
Oh, Mikita has also started making homemade bento boxes.

46
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,209
Oh, I'll be my father ➡

47
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,579
You have to be healthy anyway.

48
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:03,083
So can I ask you today?

49
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,085
My grand project.

50
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:10,090
♬～

51
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,992
I found something really good.

52
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:13,660
(Moriya) Yes. (Imai) Yes.

53
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,929
This is in Maharashtra, West India.

54
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,498
With Sahaji's wife Aisha, who died.

55
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,901
We met at home every night. Are you serious?

56
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:23,437
Is that the same as Mikita and Natsume?

57
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:25,505
Yes. Ahhh.

58
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,274
This is what Tamura over there said.

59
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:30,310
yeah? What am I? Ah... no. Ah, continue.

60
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,246
Yes, this is the important thing.

61
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:36,016
This couple, with their wife who should have died five years later.➡

62
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:38,018
Apparently he's returned to his normal life.

63
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:39,686
In your original life? Ahhh.

64
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,555
If that's true.

65
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,523
Again, with Natsume-san like before?

66
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:47,260
No, can we live together as a parent and child as before?

67
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,629
As expected from the head of the department. Our purpose is ➡

68
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,466
Bringing Natsumecchi into this world.

69
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,267
So, my grand plan ➡

70
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,436
I'm trying to put it into practice.

71
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,872
(Imai) Yes. 11:22 ➡

72
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:01,041
15 minutes before mix time ➡

73
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,076
Everyone moved to their posts. (Riko) Yes.

74
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,978
First up is the Chief Moriya. (Moriya) Yes.

75
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,780
Wait under the apartment in your car.

76
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,448
Leave it to me.

77
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,117
Tsuji Riko Time it off.

78
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:11,785
Leave it to me.

79
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,453
(Imai) What should I do?

80
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:16,089
Imai checks to see if there are no pedestrians around.

81
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,758
Understood.

82
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,926
Wait a minute and what are you going to do with a car?

83
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,595
No, it's decided.

84
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:25,265
In three minutes, take Natsumecchi as far as possible.

85
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,234
No no, ah... that's not possible.

86
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:30,070
The mix only happens in that room in that apartment.

87
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,540
Is that so? I've tried it a number of times before.

88
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:39,813
As soon as you leave the room, you will be returned to your own world.

89
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,715
Ahhh.

90
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43,917
Ahhh.

91
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:46,253
(Imai) That is, that room only.

92
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:50,290
I also put naan in the toaster to see if it would last longer.

93
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,459
Hehehe, don't do anything ugly.

94
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,095
It's you. Hey, Mikita.

95
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,264
Have you tried going outside with a toaster?

96
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:59,166
Ah, no, that's...

97
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:02,169
If there's a mix going on in that room ➡

98
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,771
With a radius m centered around the toaster ➡

99
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,807
What if the mix is happening?

100
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,643
Ha, can you leave that room?

101
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,279
Jesus.

102
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:16,450
Actually, I have two toasters. Oh.

103
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,186
A toaster from the world of Mikita and Natsumecchi.

104
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:20,921
Ah... I see, that's true.

105
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,589
(Moriya) Ah, it's a mix. Yes.

106
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:25,726
First, we'll experiment with how it works.

107
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,394
How does it work?

108
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:30,597
1. Try carrying the toaster of Mikita.

109
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:34,167
Furthermore, the mix continued from that room ➡

110
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,270
If I could get away as far as possible ➡

111
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,439
Maybe we can bring Natsumecchi back to this world.

112
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,009
But I wonder if that's really possible.

113
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,278
Mikita.

114
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:46,947
If you're going to be a father ➡

115
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:51,385
Isn't it okay to slap so embarrassing for the sake of a child?

116
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:53,453
I agree.

117
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,823
I might not be able to do anything alone though.

118
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,459
Ah, if everyone has the cooperation. Oh.

119
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,628
Let's try everything we can try.

120
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:05,298
We'll do anything.

121
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,601
Thank you guys.

122
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,773
Battery OK.

123
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:15,675
OK. Okay.

124
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,344
Ahhh.

125
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:19,980
Natsume's shoes are also available.

126
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,416
Okay, it's starting.

127
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:29,289
5 seconds before 4 3 2 1 0.

130
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:37,697
Ah, both of them came.

Explanation is later. What?

I was so surprised I went outside.

00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:51,004
This is the path I walked with Mikita every morning.

155
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,707
Ha... are you okay? Natsume.

156
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:59,012
Yes, the best! Haha.

157
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:01,448
Who thought of such a stupid thing?

158
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:06,319
There's no one else in Tamura. Haha.

159
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,090
Wow hahaha. Hahaha.

160
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,858
Ahhh.

Whew.

Hahahaha.

169
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,636
Tamura was right. The mix was just like that ➡

170
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,705
It was happening mainly in the toaster.

171
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:02,309
My thoughts weren't wrong. (Riko) Yes.

172
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,511
(Imai) Natsume-san, when I was running ➡

173
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,179
Something looked really happy.

174
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,448
Right, right? It's been a while since I saw that smile.

175
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:12,786
But I was able to go outside, but Natsume went home barefoot.

176
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:15,822
Now let's have Natsume prepare some shoes.

177
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,258
It's just not good to let pregnant women run.

178
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:22,028
That's right. I understand. I think about some countermeasures.

179
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,097
With that in mind, the next strategy.

180
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:27,868
2. Try carrying two toasters at the same time.

181
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:29,569
That means hmm?

182
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,272
It's an experiment to experiment with resonance between toasters.

183
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,708
Sorry I have no idea.

184
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,978
I'll try anything I can think of.

185
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,646
Thank you. Oh.

186
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:42,382
<With the passionate support of our friends➡

187
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:45,285
We didn't give up and tried our strategy.

188
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,821
Yes. Riko-chan please. Yes.

189
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,723
I'll go, yes.

190
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,591
It's for Natsumecchi's body.

191
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,262
Leave it to me. Okay, go!

192
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,364
(Imai) Ah! Are you okay?

193
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:59,032
yes! take care.

194
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,701
It's okay. ➡

195
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,869
Hahaha... Hahahaha.

196
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,538
Shatter Kata... Kachan!

197
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:06,206
Shuh... (Imai) Wow! Ah ➡

198
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,508
Huh?

199
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:12,546
(Imai) Tamura-san: It was no good.

200
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:14,214
Seriously?

201
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:18,618
I'm coming. Be careful.

202
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,454
(Moriya) I asked.

203
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:26,860
Wow!!

204
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,963
Swoo... Ahhh.

205
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,633
Natsume. Tamura: It was no good.

206
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,169
Tamura? Tamura...

207
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,839
Shall we go?

208
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:40,974
<But ➡

209
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:45,011
As if to mock us like that ➡

210
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:49,449
The strategy was one after another.

211
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,118
Huh?

212
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:59,393
Mikita-san, uh...

213
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:04,264
You know, because I was measuring the time.

214
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:08,869
Yes, little by little each time ➡

215
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:12,906
It's getting shorter by 3 seconds.

216
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:17,577
If the mixing time continues to decrease...

217
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:20,047
(Riko) I think Mikita had noticed it too.

218
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:24,785
I don't want Natsume to say this.

219
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,121
got it.

220
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:48,141
♬～

221
00:11:48,141 --> 00:12:08,161

222
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:24,111
♬～

223
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:27,214
<What should I do?>

224
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,760
Excuse me.

225
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:58,011
♬～

226
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:01,381
Oh, that toaster, the same as ours.

227
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,517
Hmm. Ah, sorry ➡

228
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:06,953
It looks like a peek at me haha. No, no, nothing at all.

229
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:09,322
I liked the retro design and bought it.

230
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:12,359
Ah, retro, hahaha. Yes.

231
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:15,462
At that time, it was a spontaneous design.

232
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,765
Hahaha. Hahaha.

233
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:21,935
Maybe congratulations?

234
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:24,504
Yes, it's been four months now.

235
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:28,241
Yes, I'm looking forward to it.

236
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:31,411
Yes haha.

237
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:34,014
Tough! Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang...

238
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:37,050
I've already been thinking about the next plan for Natsumecchi.

239
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,686
Yes, it's getting more and more fun.

240
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,354
Haha. (Riko) But like this one last time ➡

241
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,590
It's no good if you force yourself to run.

242
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,226
I know. (Moriya) That's strange.

243
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,395
He'll be born by the end of the year.

244
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:50,063
yes.

245
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:53,734
what happened? Mikita.

246
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:56,770
Ah no... I'll do that ➡

247
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:01,942
I hope I can get back Natsume's things even with force.

248
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,610
Ah. (Moriya) Huh?

249
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,278
So before you go back to the other world.

250
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,280
(Riko) Yes. Everyone, about Natsume-san➡

251
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,249
How about pushing it down with force?

252
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:10,917
Hey. Hey Imai➡

253
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,586
You're such a primitive way. Hahaha.

254
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:14,421
No, is it worth trying? (Moriya/Riko) What?

255
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:17,457
Can you do that? Shall we gather summons and rugby guys?

256
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,426
No, you shouldn't bring an outsider.

257
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:21,194
No, we'll do what we can do alone.

258
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,330
Ah, maybe it's over. (Moriya) What?

259
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,998
(Riko) 8 seconds left. (Moriya) 8 seconds left?

260
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:26,666
That's dangerous. (Imai) Just a moment... what should I do?

261
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,335
Yes Yes Yes Yes. Are you going to do it?

262
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,003
3 2. Make sure there is no strain on Natsume's body.

263
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,906
(Riko) 1 0｡ (Imai, Tamura, Moriya) Ahhh!

264
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,574
Kachan! Shoe...

265
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:37,411
Ugh...｡ Ha ha...

266
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:39,846
Natsume-san. Natsume-cchi.

267
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:44,184
Of course it's impossible. Damn it.

268
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:48,555
Ha ha ha...

269
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:53,126
It's always quiet and good to come.

270
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:58,131
Haha, the vegetables, fruits and air are delicious. ➡

271
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:04,771
Hahaha Natsume has always loved working in the fields.

272
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:08,942
Mikita, are you eating well?

273
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:12,512
Ah... Yes. My stepmother too?

274
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:15,749
Yes, I have to cheer up.

275
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:19,953
Hahaha. I've gained 2kg. Hahaha.

276
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:28,328
Overcoming a family's death is not easy, but ➡

277
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:31,631
I'm alive.

278
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:35,569
No matter how sad a human is,

279
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:39,039
It's also normal to make you hungry.

280
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:43,677
Don't you think so? Ah... That's right.

281
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:45,345
Yeah.

282
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:51,118
Ah...

283
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,821
That stepmother.

284
00:15:56,757 --> 00:16:00,026
If I could meet Natsume ➡

285
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:02,396
Do you want to meet?

286
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:04,064
yeah?

287
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:05,966
Ah... no, that...

288
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,834
(Kaede) It's okay.

289
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:13,306
I can meet Natsume anytime.

290
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,975
Huh?

291
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,713
Because I'm here.

292
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:25,786
Natsume is gone though ➡

293
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:28,855
But the fact that Natsume was certainly there ➡

294
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:31,958
We know the best.➡

295
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:35,395
And Nenatsume has been born since she was born➡

296
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:38,532
He's been here forever.

297
00:16:38,532 --> 00:16:43,670
So with the natsume in my heart ➡

298
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:50,410
I'll look forward and live. That's what I decided.

299
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,646
If you can't meet Natsume?

300
00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:56,783
yeah? That's right.

301
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:01,955
Is Natsume thinking that too?

302
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:04,191
Does that mean it's in heaven?

303
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:07,394
Ah... Haha.

304
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:10,330
But that kid is fine.

305
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:16,002
He's pretty strong, just like me. Hehe.➡

306
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:18,638
Hey ｡haha｡➡

307
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,307
Haha.

308
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:31,084
♬～

309
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:48,668
Tough! Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang...

310
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:50,504
Hehe.

311
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:52,372
There's no one today.

312
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,708
Of course, everyone has come too much lately.

313
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:58,578
Hehehe, look at this.

314
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,714
Oh, isn't it cute?

315
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:02,949
Is this the choice Tamura?

316
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:07,654
Correct answer. Hahaha. Yeeee.

317
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:09,856
cute.

318
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:11,525
yeah?

319
00:18:13,994 --> 00:18:16,897
Hehe.

320
00:18:16,897 --> 00:18:18,932
Hahaha.

321
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,705
Jajahhh. Hehe.

322
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:26,373
happy birthday.

323
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:29,743
Wow. Amazing.

324
00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:32,279
Hehehe.

325
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,581
Congratulations Natsume.

326
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:37,517
thank you.

327
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,486
Can I delete it? Yeah.

328
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,193
Whew.

329
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:50,697
Please. Thank you.

330
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:53,400
(2 people) will be served.

331
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:01,241
Hmm! delicious!

332
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:03,510
Yeah? Hahaha.

333
00:19:06,113 --> 00:19:08,782
yeah? What about Mikita? Don't you eat it?

334
00:19:08,782 --> 00:19:11,051
Sweets at this time are definitely dangerous.

335
00:19:11,051 --> 00:19:13,754
Wow, it's unfair.

336
00:19:13,754 --> 00:19:16,556
Oh, be careful about weight gain too.

337
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:19,326
Hey, do you say that by feeding her cake?

338
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:24,664
Ah... sorry. Hahaha.

339
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,701
Oh, I'm born in winter ➡

340
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:29,569
Maybe it can be done together with Mikita Birthday.

341
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,405
Ah, that's not possible. What?

342
00:19:31,405 --> 00:19:33,774
I've been together with Christmas and birthdays for a long time.

343
00:19:33,774 --> 00:19:36,510
Hahaha. I can't make you feel that way.

344
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:40,213
I understand. Then my birthday is already there➡

345
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:43,617
Let's celebrate in a luxurious and luxurious way.

346
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:47,721
Hey. Hey. Hey.

347
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:52,592
Right... Ah➡

348
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:55,595
Hospitalization items can be brought out at any time➡

349
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:57,664
It's better to put it all together.

350
00:19:57,664 --> 00:20:00,300
Yes, I'll start preparing it soon.

351
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,437
Sometimes, be sure to be very pampered by your mother-in-law.

352
00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:05,105
I'll do that.

353
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:07,741
Also consume plenty of iron and dietary fiber.

354
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:11,278
Ah, but it's easier to get swelling in the late stages of pregnancy.

355
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:13,113
Be careful not to consume too much salt.

356
00:20:13,113 --> 00:20:16,683
It's really anxious.

357
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:20,287
Natsume's health is number one. Yes.

358
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:22,222
Then in hot water ➡

359
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:24,391
It's not good to go in for a long time. Shattering kata... Kachan!

360
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:27,327
Shu... Mikita See you next time.

361
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:34,801
Make sure your stomach doesn't cool down.

362
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:36,603
after that….

363
00:20:38,372 --> 00:20:40,240
The door is closed...

364
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:45,545
Be sure to be solid.

365
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:49,616
Uhh... it's the expiration date ➡

366
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:51,885
Don't eat it.

367
00:20:55,155 --> 00:20:56,923
Uuh...

368
00:20:58,892 --> 00:21:04,698
When it's tough, someone rely on you.

369
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,337
Don't take it too hard by yourself.

370
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:19,246
After doing my best ➡

371
00:21:19,246 --> 00:21:23,283
Eat some gorgeous sweets.

372
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,685
Natsume.

373
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,657
good bye.

374
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,266
Ah...

375
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:54,147
♬～

376
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,750
Slurp!

377
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:12,332
♬～

378
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:14,334
Jeew...

379
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:23,110
♬～

380
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,246
Just think of it as a dream. Say something, Mikita!

381
00:22:26,246 --> 00:22:28,148
Mikita's liar.

382
00:22:28,148 --> 00:22:29,816
(Riko) It's the expected birth date.

383
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:31,485
Okay, go quickly!

384
00:22:31,485 --> 00:22:33,787
He's really stupid and a huge idiot.

385
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:35,522
Let me meet Natsume one more time.

386
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:37,724
I love Mikita.
