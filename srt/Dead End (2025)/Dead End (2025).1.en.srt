758
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,020
He's not in this batch.

759
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,110
The notice just came in.

760
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,070
He's assigned to our station?

761
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,360
Did you pull some strings

762
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,630
to keep him here?

763
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,080
Nonsense. Am I that kind of person?

764
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:19,760
Let me tell you.

765
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,590
If you're going to be like this,

766
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,510
don't complain to me later

767
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,040
about having too much work.

768
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,370
I still can't mentor a CPPSC grad.

769
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,400
He's so arrogant.

770
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,480
You're the kind of person

771
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,280
who takes kindness for granted.

772
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,400
I know exactly

773
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,400
what you're like.

774
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,030
You can't become the chief.

775
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:34,840
Why not get yourself

776
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,040
a student who might become one someday?

777
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,510
Chief?

778
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,550
I'd be happy

779
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,630
just patrolling my fourteen hutongs.

780
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,070
Hey.

781
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,210
Gan'e.

782
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,000
This...

783
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,400
Zhao Gan'e.

784
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:43,800
You...

785
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,600
Come here.

786
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,490
Hurry up.

787
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,440
Chief.

788
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,310
Let me introduce you.

789
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,230
He's Ran Xi.

790
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,290
From now on,

791
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,770
he will be your mentor.

792
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,560
The new CPPSC grad here,

793
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,370
Zhao Gan'e.

794
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,760
He's eager to catch criminals
and solve cases.

795
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,400
In the future,

796
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,670
when there's a burglary case

797
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,920
and the Criminal Police Team
wants to handle the scene,

798
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,670
we won't need them.

799
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,760
We can solve the case ourselves,

800
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,320
right?

801
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,190
Chief,

802
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:10,390
could you assign me a different mentor?

803
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,630
Kid, you just

804
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,920
said exactly what I was thinking.

805
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,590
Perfect.

806
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,960
I don't want to be his mentor, either.

807
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,190
What's wrong with you two?

808
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:17,840
Let me tell you both.

809
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,670
This is how it's going to be.

810
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,150
Stop arguing.

811
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,320
If you don't like it,

812
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,280
you can quit being patrol cops.

813
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:24,970
Well...

814
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:25,840
You...

815
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,440
Mr. Qin.

816
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,920
You're late today.

817
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,670
Perfect timing.

818
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,470
Freshly made.

819
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,960
Here, Beiping brought it for you.

820
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:47,920
Here we go again.

821
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,180
You're being too kind.

822
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,370
Well, thank you.

823
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,320
The new colleague?

824
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:52,630
Come.

825
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,760
Join us for the meal.

826
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,670
There's enough. I'll cook more.

827
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,590
Thank you. But I'll pass.

828
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,390
Don't bother if he's not eating.

829
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,880
How are these dumplings?

830
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,890
Very delicious.

831
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,820
By the way, Ran.

832
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,750
Yesterday I passed by that small hostel.

833
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,760
It's a mess again
with all those people staying there.

834
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,220
It's really troublesome.

835
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,590
The surrounding area is being demolished.

836
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,760
It was already chaotic.

837
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,440
Don't worry.

838
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,760
I'll check it out tonight.

839
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,590
Why not go now?

840
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,910
What place he mentioned?

841
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:46,890
The hostel.

842
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:47,550
Yes.

843
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,590
Would anyone be at the hostel
during the day?

844
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:51,630
Who would hang around there
in broad daylight?

845
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,160
Exactly.

846
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,300
Use your brain.

847
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,480
Officer Ran?

848
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,920
Open for business again?

849
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,720
Thanks to you.

850
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,030
But now I'm

851
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,160
operating legally.

852
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,060
I have a license there.

853
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,510
Business licenses aren't my concern.

854
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,710
I just want to ask you—

855
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,260
How many people are staying here?

856
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,030
Not many.

857
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,710
Do they have temporary residence permits?

858
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,280
Do the man and woman living together

859
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,670
have a marriage certificate?

860
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,930
Yes, yes. They got them from the station.

861
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:53,880
What?

862
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,510
They really do have them.

863
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:57,690
Fine.

864
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:58,840
I got it.

865
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,490
Let's go.

866
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:02,840
[Hostel]

867
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,590
Take care.

868
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,220
I could rush in.

869
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,060
[Hostel]

870
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,620
Are we making arrests?

871
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,110
If you think you can handle
all those people,

872
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,080
then go ahead.

873
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:34,960
Stop!

874
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:35,840
Police!

875
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,520
Don't run!

876
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:37,920
[Hostel]

877
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,380
Stop running! Don't move!

878
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,370
Don't move!

879
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,360
Stop!

880
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:43,960
[Hostel]

881
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,490
Get down!

882
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,580
Don't move!

883
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:46,600
Get down!

884
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:47,730
Ran,

885
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,840
that was sneaky.

886
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,550
You said everyone had permits.

887
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,270
Why run?

888
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,600
I'm begging you.

889
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,810
Please let me go.

890
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:54,850
Ran.

891
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:55,920
That girl from the bun shop

892
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,070
really is not here.

893
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,230
If I ever see her,

894
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,960
I'll call you right away, okay?

895
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,920
You'd better remember that.

896
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:02,880
Yes.

897
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:13,550
[Hostel]

898
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,550
[Come to Zilaishui Hutong, Zhang.]

899
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,910
Over here! Over here!

900
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,140
Ran, over here!

901
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:28,840
What's going on?

902
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,670
She must have been scared by the dog.

903
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,280
She was like this when I arrived.

904
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,000
You don't know that.

905
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,320
She's terrified of dogs.

906
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,520
Ma'am, what's wrong?

907
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,070
That's enough.

908
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,110
She needs to rest for a while.

909
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:44,440
You should go check on that dog first.

910
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,760
Don't let it run away again.

911
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,110
Okay.

912
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,030
Please keep an eye on her for me.

913
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,320
Be careful with that dog.

914
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:49,920
Don't worry.

915
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,670
Don't get bitten.
