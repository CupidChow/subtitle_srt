[DEAD END]

00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,310
[Episode 2]

3
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,400
Go back

4
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,930
to whatever you were doing.

5
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,729
We're handling a case here.

6
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,830
Don't stand around watching,

7
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,560
okay?

8
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,430
Move along!

9
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,400
Stop watching.

10
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,729
You'd know by now
if we could talk about it.

11
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,630
Excuse me.

12
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,729
What took you so long, CPPSC grad?

13
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,680
I was out checking for people
without temporary residence permits.

14
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
Step back!

15
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,000
Is this a murder case?

16
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,229
None of your business.

17
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,350
Hurry up. Help keep order!

18
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,920
Move along!

19
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,380
Come on.

20
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,560
Everyone, step back!

21
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,350
Step back!

22
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,680
Step back! Stop pushing.

23
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,120
Step back, okay?

24
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,790
Step back!

25
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,250
Auntie.

26
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,560
Don't push.

27
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,710
-Back off!
-Back off!

28
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,960
Don't gather here.

29
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,780
Are you hot?

30
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,380
Get up!

31
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,150
Step aside!

32
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:11,960
Excuse me.

33
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,870
Come on.

34
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,840
Stop watching!

35
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,910
Go back!

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,630
Go home.

37
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,240
Go home.

38
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,040
Put it inside.

39
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,240
Hurry up. We're waiting for you.

40
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,630
Hurry up.

41
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,400
Go home.

42
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,190
Don't join the crowd here.

43
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,450
Block off the outside!

44
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,120
Go!

45
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,520
Ran,

46
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,960
did that old lady say anything?

47
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,680
I asked her all night—

48
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,540
still the same.

49
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,910
She said she didn't see the suspect,

50
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,840
only the body.

51
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,840
It even gave her a heart attack.

52
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,470
Yes.

53
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:44,610
Make way!

54
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,750
Make way!

55
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,840
Make way! Make way!

56
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,360
Stop pushing.

57
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,280
We're working a case—no entry.

58
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,910
We're from the Criminal Police Team.

59
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,280
We're one of you.

60
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:52,870
Song!

61
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,150
He's inside.

62
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,190
Stop asking, okay?

63
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,610
Chief.

64
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,150
We'd tell you if we could.

65
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,680
Have you identified her?

66
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,680
She's in the water;

67
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,680
we can't tell her.

68
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,630
I think

69
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,030
we should get the body out first.

70
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,030
There are more and more people here.

71
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,030
Is there any trace at the scene?

72
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,830
It's pouring;

73
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,520
the rain's washed any traces away.

74
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,580
Pump the water out.

75
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:16,870
Do it.

76
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,870
Stop pushing.

77
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,079
What are you pushing for?

78
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,810
Go home and wash the water tank.

79
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,680
The body has been stewing in the well

80
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,340
long enough to turn into soup.

81
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,079
Go home.

82
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:44,810
My goodness.

83
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,290
Why did you go in again?

84
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,470
I want to go in and take a look.

85
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,560
There are so many people inside.

86
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,690
Don't make it worse.

87
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,960
Stay outside.

88
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,120
Hello,

89
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:15,720
show me your ID.

90
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,920
Did you see

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,120
anyone suspicious

92
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:18,750
on the night of May 18th?

93
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,310
Think about it.

94
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,310
Aunt, if there's nothing else,

95
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,040
-Don't look here.
-That night,

96
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,040
I slept better than any other night.

97
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,480
I didn't hear anything.

98
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,310
Did you see anyone suspicious?

99
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,160
I was home sleeping.

100
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,190
Just tell me.

101
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,330
I went to bed early.

102
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,190
Excuse me.

103
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,480
Captain Song!

104
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,800
How's it going?

105
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,159
The victim's father, Liu Aijun,

106
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,040
fired a few people

107
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,310
when the factory restructured.

108
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,680
Those guys are suspects.

109
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,010
We're looking for them.

110
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:43,920
Did he see the victim

111
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,680
last night?

112
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,600
No.

113
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,360
I heard he's the stepfather, right?

114
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,120
Yes.

115
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,750
How's their relationship?

116
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,240
They've always been close.

117
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,560
I checked and he's basically cleared.

118
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,240
And last night

119
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,159
he was working late at the factory

120
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,000
with his secretary.

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,480
Have the meeting first.

122
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,140
Secretary?

123
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,040
His female secretary.

124
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,170
They've been together for half a year.

125
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,680
She provided an alibi too.

126
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,540
Is this female secretary single?

127
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,480
Yes.

128
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,560
Liu,

129
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,310
Zhang,

130
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,360
you two go over this thoroughly.

131
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,090
-Okay.
-Yes.

132
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,690
Here's what I think:

133
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,430
let's use

134
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,270
our local know-how;

135
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,750
check whether anyone unfamiliar

136
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,240
has shown up in the precinct recently.

137
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,900
Generally,

138
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,950
when a newcomer shows up around here,

139
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,920
we patrol officers

140
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,380
figure it out pretty fast.

141
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,330
Who's the cop in this precinct?

142
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,560
Ran.

143
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,920
Ran Xi?

144
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,560
Ran Xi!

145
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,560
I didn't recognize you.

146
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,070
Well...

147
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,400
Look how many years it's been
since we last met.

148
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,120
Back then,

149
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,040
I was Little Song, he was Little Ran.

150
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,360
We've known for many years,
and we're now getting old.

151
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,620
You're in this office.

152
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,270
Hello, Captain Song.

153
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:55,750
Ran,

154
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,310
you are a veteran detective,

155
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:57,870
right?

156
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,310
Share your thoughts with everyone.

157
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,800
I fully support
the Criminal Police Team's work.

158
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,930
I'm asking you to share your thoughts.

159
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,390
Guess I'm just unlucky—

160
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,050
—had to happen in my precinct.

161
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,840
What are you talking about?

162
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,430
I mean, the girl is unlucky.

163
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,040
Ran is testing us.

164
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,270
In my opinion,

165
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,510
the suspect probably meant to rape her,

166
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,240
but got angry

167
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,630
when she resisted.

168
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,390
In the end,

169
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,850
he threw her into the well.

170
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,590
She must've fought back,

171
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,740
otherwise she wouldn't have been killed.

172
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,400
Yeah, yeah.

173
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,040
No.

174
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,640
I don't think it was rape.

175
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,630
If it were,
he wouldn't have been so violent.

176
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,480
And her wallet

177
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,280
wasn't taken,

178
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,240
so we can rule out robbery.

179
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,950
Either it's a crime of passion

180
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,000
or a revenge killing.

181
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,190
Start investigating along those two lines.

182
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:45,680
Okay.

183
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,050
What did her mother say?

184
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,480
Her mother is Huang Hui,

185
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,270
the union chair

186
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,909
at the electronics factory.

187
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,000
She's a bit difficult to deal with.

188
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,720
What do you mean?

189
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,070
She refuses to acknowledge the body,

190
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,560
and won't let anyone else either.

191
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,270
Then how was the identity confirmed?

192
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,930
Name was on her school papers.

193
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,560
It's a bit troublesome

194
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,510
if the family doesn't identify the body.

195
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,000
Yes.

196
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,390

197
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,280
Think of a way.

198
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,240
Chief Zhu,

199
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,480
Tian Hao and Mei showed up,

200
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,410
insisting their daughter is dead.

201
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,160
It happened in my precinct.

202
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,160
I'll go handle it.

203
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,130
Will you keep your promise?

204
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,040
No.

205
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,510
You really expect me to believe that?

206
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,720
Don't touch me!

207
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,480
What are you doing?

208
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,360
If you can stop me here,

209
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,820
can you stop me over there?

210
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,510
Look,

211
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,800
if you don't give me a real lead today,

212
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,960
a real lead today,

213
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,030
[Speak openly. We'll listen.
Be honest. We'll understand.]

214
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,789
I'll smash my head
against this wall and die.

215
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:37,030
You have to
close her household record today.

216
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,630
Ran,

217
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,120
is the body our Chang?

218
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,750
I saw the body.

219
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,500
She had that long hair.

220
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,280
You really think it's your Tian Chang?

221
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,360
Wait, Ran,

222
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,480
is it true?

223
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,270
Why would I lie to you?

224
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,080
Ran said so.

225
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,670
You...

226
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,670
Thank you, Ran.

227
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,910
Then you

228
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,310
go back first.

229
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,600
Please

230
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,200
help us keep looking for her.

231
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,320
Thank you.

232
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,820
She died a pretty horrible death.

233
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,410
Judging from the wound,

234
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,360
it looks like one clean slash
across the neck,

235
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,550
cut through the windpipe

236
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,350
and in the end,

237
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,390
she choked to death on her own blood.

238
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,850
Didn't anyone around hear anything?

239
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,390
She couldn't even scream by then.

240
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,600
The strangest part is, there was no semen.

241
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,530
The genital area

242
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,400
clearly shows signs of assault,

243
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,870
but after a thorough check,

244
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,080
we couldn't find any.

245
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,360
What could have caused this?

246
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,890
A relatively large object,

247
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,840
smooth

248
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,960

249
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,360
A bottle?

250
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,550

where are the controlled knives?

00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,270
She's always like this;

387
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,000
she never stayed home for long.

388
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,520
You were the same way back in school,
weren't you?

389
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,560
Check the arcade too,

390
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,150
she loves hanging around there.
She's such a tomboy—

391
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,010
picks things up

392
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,390
so fast,

393
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,790
Actually...

394
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,600
Would you please come back

395
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,860
to the station with us?

396
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,690
We'll need your cooperation.

397
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,330
This got burned...

398
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
Oh my god. This...

399
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,250
This...

400
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,510
This...

401
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,670
How's she supposed to wear this?

402
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,670
Seriously…

403
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,440
My God…

404
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,000
What a joke.

405
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,250
Just cut it off.

406
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,750
It's gonna have to be done
sooner or later anyway—

407
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,330
might as well get it over with.

408
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,070
How about this?

409
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:30,910
Come with me

410
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,370
back to the station and sign the papers.

411
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,570
Where are you going?

412
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,760
Where are you going so late?

413
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,510
He will come with us
to the police station.

414
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,600
Why are you going?

415
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,650
What for?

416
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,290
-Who do you think you are?
-Stop beating him.

417
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,290
Stop beating him.

418
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,040
Get lost!

419
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,160
Get lost!

420
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,250
Who allows you to go?

421
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:56,910
Aijun,

422
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,240
let's talk about this later.

423
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,910
How could your wife

424
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,240
hit a cop?

425
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:00,670
Well,

426
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,120
the station still needs...

427
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,030
What?

428
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,270
Calm down!

429
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,150
Who gave you the right to go?

430
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,480
Are you her real father?

431
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,790
Who are you?

432
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,240
Who gave you the right to go?

433
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,560
Who told you to go?

434
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,480
I'll kill you if you dare!

435
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,240
I'll kill you and
that slut of a secretary of yours!

436
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,750
He's been beaten up like that.

437
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,150
We have to go check on him.

438
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,200
Are you out of your mind?

439
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,150
You just rush in when  something happens.

440
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,360
A couple's arguing

441
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,630
and you go sticking your nose in.

442
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,440
That iron's just as likely

443
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,080
to smash your face

444
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,280
as it is to smash mine.

445
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,580
Actually, I...

446
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,270
[I've been waiting for you for ages.
Where are you?- Beiping]

447
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,000
Oh no.

448
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,220
Actually what?

449
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,110
About this matter...

450
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,970
What are you trying to say?

451
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,030
You're really dawdling.

452
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,630
You're not making any sense.

453
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:22,450
What happened?

454
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,310
What is it?

455
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,680
What do you mean by "What?"

456
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,030
Didn't we agree to
look at the place together?

457
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,230
I've been waiting for you for two hours.

458
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,440
Today?

459
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,710
Didn't we agree on tomorrow?

460
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,320
Are you playing dumb with me?

461
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,550
Are you moving or not?

462
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
Just tell me.

463
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,070
Give me some time.

464
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,950
There's a case in the hutong.

465
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,510
What does it have to do

466
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,440
with our moving?

467
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,240
A girl

468
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,240
was killed

469
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,440
and thrown in a well.

470
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,010
Then...

471
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,350
That's more reason to move.

472
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,410
Move immediately!

473
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,640
When something serious happens,

474
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,590
if I, a patrol officer,

475
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,270
move out first,

476
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,510
what will others think?

477
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,510
So if you don't solve the case,

478
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,840
I'm not allowed to move?

479
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,030
Anyway, I can't stop

480
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,090
what you want to do.

481
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,200
But Dong's got his college entrance exams
coming up;

482
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,800
let's not stir things up now.

483
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,970
Why are you hanging on to it?

484
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:49,380
The one who can't let go of you is me.

485
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,630
[Hongqi store]

486
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,230
The one who can't live without you is me.

487
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,950
Do you want to listen with me?

488
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:02,920
No, no.

489
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,770
You go ahead and listen.

490
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,210
I won't either.

491
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,460
Do you ever write letters?

492
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,640
If you need to reach me,

493
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,550
you can call

494
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,200
the Nanhuaishu Police Station.

495
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,000
I don't really like phone calls;

496
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,680
they're

497
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,540
too short, and nothing lasts.

498
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,920
I like writing letters.

499
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,270
How about this: let's make a deal.

500
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:27,850
When the day comes that

501
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:28,980
I leave this hutong,

502
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,640
I'll write you a letter.

503
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,660
By then, I'll probably be far,

504
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,920
far away.

505
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:05,880
Wang Lei,

506
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,510
give me an update on your side.

507
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,040
Alright.

508
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,640
Liu Ke's stepfather, Liu Aijun,

509
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,350
has a few people at his factory

510
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,200
he's had conflicts with,

511
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,160
but two of them were on business trips
at that time,

512
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,160
and another is bedridden

513
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,000
with a stroke.

00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,920

He's currently
in the local detention center,

520
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,780

524
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,350

525
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,030
the blood was washed away.

526
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,870
That won't do.

527
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,000

but he doesn't know who it was from.

539
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,830

540
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,510

00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,570
When will they find out?

00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,510

00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,310
Song,

575
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,240
but

576
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,610
this is on me too.

577
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,680
He mentioned it

578
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,880
but I

579
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,010
didn't take it seriously.

580
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:04,640
Now that

581
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,790
there's been a homicide,

582
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,030
let's keep digging.

583
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,790
Our station

584
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,000
won't cover anyone.

585
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,480
In a while, your Criminal Police Team

586
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,810
will pick one of our guys

587
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,200
to take his statement.

588
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,400
Is it an interview or an interrogation?

589
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,680
Don't waste the others' time
with useless talk.

590
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,010
Stop talking nonsense.

591
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,770
Take his statement later.

592
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,200
Ran,

593
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,010
please put in more effort.

594
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,460
After all, this is…

595
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,360
you know.

596
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,920
I think we still have to

597
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,830
follow the procedure.

598
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,400
Yes.

599
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,530
Don't interrogate him;

600
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,460
just take a statement.

601
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,080
Chief Zhu,

602
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,180
assign someone else to me.

603
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,460
I can't handle him.

604
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,920
He's just a fool.

605
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,420
He's a CPPSC graduate.

606
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,680
You call him a fool,

607
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,790
I'd say you're the fool.

608
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,480
Fine.

609
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,740
I'm the fool, okay?

610
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,590
He's stubborn and thick-headed.

611
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,920
What am I supposed to do?

612
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,550
Ran,

613
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,110
I'll tell you just two things.

614
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,650
First,

615
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,270
in all your ten years at the station,

616
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,680
you've always played the fool.

617
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,750
You've dodged every major case,

618
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,960
and have I ever said a word about it?

619
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,450
Second,

620
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,200
think back to

621
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,720
when you were his age.

622
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,750
What were you like?

623
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,610
And how did your mentor treat you?

624
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,170
Is being a mentor

625
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,550
that easy?

626
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,440
[advanced unit]

627
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:36,690
We're just here to get the facts.

628
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,440
[Speak openly. We'll listen.
Be honest. We'll understand.]

629
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,270
How did you

630
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,640
get to know Liu Ke?

631
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,840
I interrogated her father—

632
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,230
her biological father, Zhou Weiping.

633
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,580
[Speak openly. We'll listen.
Be honest. We'll understand.]

634
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,210
Then I got in touch with her.

635
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,960
Zhou Weiping...

636
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:54,880
Did you inform her

637
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,920
that the suspect was detained?

638
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,920
Did you serve the detention notice?

639
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,160
I didn't tell her.

640
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,240
Then why did you call her?

641
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,200
I want the suspect

642
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,770
to cooperate with our work.

643
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,270
I promised him

644
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,640
I'd deliver a postcard to his daughter.

645
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,510
What postcard?

646
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,880
A postcard of The Little Tigers.

647
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,080
What did she give you?

648
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,960
What are you implying?

649
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,750
You ask the suspect's daughter

650
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,680
to meet you late at night.

651
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,610
What do you mean?

652
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,420
You were asking for
something, weren't you?

653
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,110
Yes.

654
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,190
I was asking for her life.

655
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,640
We are classmates,

656
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,510
same year.

657
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,350
I'm not out to get you, okay?

658
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,880
You're still young.

659
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,510
Just lay all your cards on the table.

660
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,720
You think I didn't tell you the truth,

661
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,200
right?

662
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,200
You need to understand,

663
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,440
I'm here to help you.

664
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,750
This is my first case.

665
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,270
This is also my first case.

666
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,530
I don't need your help.

667
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,270
Come on, let's go through this.

668
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:50,570
You said you went out to meet her

669
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,240
[Speak openly. We'll listen.
Be honest. We'll understand.]

670
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,720
just to give her a postcard.

671
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,720
But now you're telling me

672
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,790
you two didn't even know
each other before?

673
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,680
Buddy, if our roles were reversed,

674
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,720
would you even believe that?

675
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,750
Believe it or not.

676
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,590
With an attitude like yours,

677
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:07,350
you'll never make it into
the Criminal Police Team.

678
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,210
Say that again.

679
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,590
I said you'll never make it into

680
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,790
the Criminal Police Team.

681
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,720
And you'll never solve a real case!

682
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,400
Whoa, what's going on with you two?

683
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,000
Did you both wake up
on the wrong side of the bed?

684
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,590
Do you still think

685
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,650
you're in college?

686
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,680
You're still on this?

687
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,680
Someone saw
the two of them together yesterday.

688
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,070
We have a timeline.

689
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,590
Who?

690
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,070
Zhao was seen with Liu Ke

691
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,200
around 8-something PM.

692
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,070
Someone saw it.

693
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,550
The witness is giving his statement
right now.

694
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,610
But the victim was killed after 10 PM.

695
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,400
And at 10 o'clock,

696
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,720
everyone in the station
saw  Zhao right here with us!

697
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,270
What the hell are you two

698
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,470
still arguing about?

699
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:49,900
Drop it.

700
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,350
Well,

701
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,720
sign the statement, then.

702
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,790
If the witness can give a clear account,

703
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,720
why do you even need his statement?

704
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,640
Let's see which one of us

705
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,750
puts the cuffs on the suspect first.

706
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,110
See who puts the cuffs
on the suspect first.

707
00:25:59,110 --> 00:25:59,680
Fine.

708
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:10,750
[2012]

709
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,920
[Criminal Investigation Division,
Yanchuan City Police Department]

710
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,240
Hello,

711
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,480
who's the Captain?

712
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,960
Captain Wang.

713
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:27,920
Wang Lei?

714
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:28,910
Isn't this...

715
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:30,720
Zhao!

716
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,800
Captain Wang.

717
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:32,470
Zhao,

718
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,960
why didn't you say

719
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,530
before coming here?

720
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,270
Captain Wang.

721
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:36,960
Not bad.

722
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,350
You haven't lost much hair.

723
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,960
Clearly, you're not losing any sleep
over your work.

724
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,310
You still remember me, Captain Wang?

725
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,570
How could I forget you?

726
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,200
I think you don't remember me.

727
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,270
Come, have a seat.

728
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,680
Li, get us some water.

729
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:51,790
Zhao,

730
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,960
what brings you here? Just tell me.

731
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,680
I want to

732
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,580
take a look at
the recent citywide case reports.

733
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,680
Oh, come off it.

734
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,550
You're living the easy life now;

735
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,070
you don't have to
deal with people anymore.

736
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,240
I'm almost jealous.

737
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,160
I'm here about a case.

738
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,680
It's a sequel to that old hutong one.

739
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,210
Another one just popped up.

740
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,750
Do you remember?

741
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,440
It was the first case for both of us.

742
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,920
Which one was that again?

743
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,120
Over on Limin Street.

744
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,440
The perpetrator
didn't have time to finish.

745
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,100
He got away.

746
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:23,980
Fine.

747
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,630
We'll check it for you later.

748
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,510
Can I check the system?

749
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,880
Well, this...

750
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,720
I'd need authorization from higher up.

751
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,050
Here.

752
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,000
Have some water.

753
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,640
Thank you.

754
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,000
Wang,

755
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,960
we're classmates. Please help me.

756
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:42,880
Look,

757

Zhao.

758
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,410
It's not that I won't...
Just look at all this.

759
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,880
These are four cases

760
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:49,940
from today's call-outs.
