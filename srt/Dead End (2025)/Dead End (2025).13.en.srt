[Episode 13]

3
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,280
[1994]

4
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,350
Didn't you already note down
the license plate number?

5
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,410
Why are you still going to see You Jia?

6
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,680
Have you ever heard

7
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:57,479
a Hugo's poem...

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,560
Come in.

9
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,750
Mr. Wang.

10
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:16,960
Mr. Wang.

11
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,050
We just want to ask a few questions.

12
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,190
What is it?

13
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,870
How many times

14
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,610
has Zhang Dan been here?

15
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,030
Who?

16
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,030
Zhang Dan.

17
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,430
I have many students here.

18
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,250
I'm not quite sure about that.

19
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,490
You have quite a lot of girls here.

20
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,470
We also have boys.

21
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,040
[Name: Huang Xinyan,
Huang Jialin, Huang Qing.]

22
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,970
There are fewer boys in your class.

23
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
Young girls

24
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,930
are easy to deceive,

25
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,810
aren't they?

26
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,120
Well, girls

27
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,840
have stronger language learning abilities

28
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,190
than boys from an early age.

29
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,560
So, it's normal to have more girls
in my class.

30
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,590
I noticed other classes

31
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,120
have a normal gender ratio,

32
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,470
but in your class,

33
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,890
girls are the majority.

34
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,330
Mr. Wang has great personal charm.

35
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,490
You flatter me.

36
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,970
Has Liu Ke taken classes here?

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,430
Who is Liu Ke, then?

38
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,310
Excuse me.

39
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,910
I need to...

40
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,030
Go ahead.

41
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,640
Please go with your work.

42
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,470
Thank you.

43
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,980
Your register.

44
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,880
I don't know if Zhang Dan has been here.

45
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,120
Strangely, there are fewer people
with the surname Liu on the register.

46
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,000
Do you know

47
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,750
what the strangest thing is?

48
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,280
From beginning to end, he never asked

49
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,880
why we were questioning him.

50
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,960
We must pay attention to

51
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,820
tenses—

52
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,590
The shift of verbs

53
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,590
from present continuous

54
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,960
to past tense.

55
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,960
Silent, please.

56
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,820
Okay, let's continue.

57
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:19,560
For example,

58
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,860
simple past tense—

59
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,430
I watched a movie yesterday.

60
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,390
That's enough.

61
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,430
Where did you find this girl?

62
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,740
You saved her life.

63
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,900
What happened?

64
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,430
This child

65
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,920
didn't even know

66
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,360
she was bleeding internally.

67
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,240
We've been working on her

68
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,310
from last night until this morning.

69
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,000
And,

70
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:48,830
I guess

71
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,330
she won't be able
to give birth in the future.

72
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,880
How did this happen?

73
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,070
She won't tell us anything,

74
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,310
not a single word.

75
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:56,950
Until now,

76
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,360
we don't even know her name,

77
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,420
let alone what caused her condition.

78
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,580
Young lady,

79
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,970
don't be afraid.

80
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,520
We're police officers.

81
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,920
Tell me who hurt you.

82
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,890
We'll help you get justice.

83
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,560
Do you know Wang Kun?

84
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,510
What are you doing?

85
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,240
We're having a class right now.

86
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,600
We're having a class right now.

87
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,360
Policing.

88
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,120
Where's Wang Kun?

89
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,720
He's on leave.

90
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,950
On leave?

91
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,000
Yes.

92
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,560
Do you know where he went?

93
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,310
I don't know.

94
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,120
You Jia.

95
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,490
I need to talk to you.

96
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,510
What is it?

97
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,630
That guy's name,

98
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,840
the one who was with you last time,

99
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,900
is Wang Kun, right?

100
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,320
Yes.

101
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,730
Have you seen him recently?

102
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,400
Are you still in contact?

103
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,169
What's going on?

104
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,430
You'd better stay away from him.

105
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,840
He's dangerous.

106
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,150
Do police officers

107
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,510
see everyone as a suspect?

108
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,600
I'm not joking with you.

109
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,860
He's really a suspect.

110
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,730
That's impossible.

111
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,170
He's my teacher.

112
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,240
Can I go in and see her?

113
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,440
Hello.

114
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,320
I'm You Jia.

115
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,120
Do you remember the thing

116
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,320
that happened to you?

117
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,090
You smashed his car.

118
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,390
Because you wanted revenge on him,

119
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,050
didn't you?

120
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,010
Don't be afraid.

121
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,080
I'm also Wang Kun's student.

122
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,870
I take his class, too.

123
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,480
So if there's anything—

124
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,240
Run.

125
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,390
Run...

126
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,260
Don't move!

127
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,080
Take care.

128
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,670
It's okay.

129
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,470
It's okay now.

130
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,720
Miss,

131
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,560
are you alright?

132
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,770
You're safe now.

133
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,440
Don't be afraid.

134
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,480
You're safe.

135
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,120
It's okay now.

136
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,650
You'll never be hurt again.

137
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,840
Never again.

138
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,320
You'll never be hurt again.

139
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,630
Tell me that

140
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,780
when you're ready to talk.

141
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,080
Mr. Wang.

142
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,290
These are the test papers
we just finished.

143
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,600
Where should I put them?

144
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,790
In this cabinet.

145
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,550
Mr. Wang.

146
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,880
I'll put them here then.

147
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,680
Li Jing.

148
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,080
You know...

149
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,080
You are the most talented

150
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,270
and gifted student

151
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,320
I've ever met.

152
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,790
Really?

153
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,410
Thank you.

154
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:58,440
I...

155
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,240
I'll definitely study hard
with you in the future.

156
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,930
Do you have a boyfriend?

157
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,200
No.

158
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,030
You're very smart.

159
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,270
At your age,

160
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,550
you should focus

161
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,480
on your studies.

162
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,550
Don't let yourself get distracted.

163
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:33,960
Sir.

164
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,390
Linda, she...

165
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,750
Linda suddenly

166
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,840
has to attend a party

167
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,840
and won't be here.

168
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,270
It's yummy.

169
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,270
Is the locksmith here?

170
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:12,840
Yes.

171
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,370
Let's go.

172
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,320
Mentor!

173
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:57,390
The one who can't let go of you is me.

174
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:04,630
The one who can't live without you is me.

175
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,440
The tape Liu Ke was listening to

176
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,570
was sung by Wang Kun.

177
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,600
She was also Wang Kun's student.

178
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,930
We also have witnesses.

179
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,000
It must be him.

180
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,360
We've contacted immigration.

181
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,270
There's no record of anyone named Wang Kun

182
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,000
leaving the country recently.

183
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,870
Is it possible that

184
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,600
the girl smashed his car,

185
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,320
and he left town for a few days

186
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,360
to avoid the trouble?

187
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,600
That would only mean

188
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,230
he has more than one hideout.

189
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,390
Have you contacted the school principal?

190
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:28,910
Yes, we have.

191
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,440
But he can't reach Wang Kun.

192
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,540
[Quiet]

193
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,630
Li Jing.

194
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,390
Where is she?

195
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,420
She harmed herself

196
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,630
and was taken to the emergency room.

197
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,000
Page 1334821.

198
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,600
Let's meet up.

199
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:40,840
Mr. Wang.

200
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,050
What did you say to Wang Kun?

201
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,250
I asked him to meet me.

202
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,600
Are you crazy?

203
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,360
Do you know how dangerous that is?

204
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,690
Li Jing harmed herself.

205
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,340
She's been taken to the emergency room.

206
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,210
I know.

207
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,990
But that's not your concern.

208
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,450
We, the police, will catch him.

209
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,360
But right now I'm the only one

210
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,030
who can contact him,

211
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,600
right?

212
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,680
And don't worry.

213
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,720
I'm a nurse.

214
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,770
I've prepared everything.

215
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,670
You think with these things

216
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,730
you can handle him?

217
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,910
He's a suspect.

218
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,840
He's a criminal.

219
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,600
But I...

220
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,280
I have to do something, don't I?

221
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,960
Has he responded to you?

222
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:20,870
No.

223
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,240
I paged him.

224
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,480
But there's no message from him now.

225
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,910
He knows where you live.

226
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,550
I bring you some fruit.

227
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,040
What's wrong?

228
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,380
Shine the laser on my nail.

229
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,640
Are you wearing the fluorescent polish?

230
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,070
My mom doesn't let me wear nail polish,

231
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,110
so I use this instead.

232
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,110
Does it look nice?

233
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,270
Yes.

234
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,880
This is the birthday present

235
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,540
I bought for myself last year.

236
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,110
There's still half left.

237
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,440
Today is your birthday?

238
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,990
I'm turning 19 today.

239
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,280
Happy birthday.

240
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,240
Thank you.

241
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,280
I should have bought you a gift.

242
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,720
I haven't received a gift in ages.

243
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,830
Why don't you perform something for me?

244
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,090
That can be my present.

245
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,030
I don't know how.

246
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,270
Anything will do.

249
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,650
Right there.

250
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,360
Alright,

251
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,180
I'll recite a poem for you.

252
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,110
My friend,

253
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,200
things are always going well.

254
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:21,960

255
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,830

256
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,860
That's it?

257
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:27,970
That's all.

258
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,590
It's from Don Quixote.

259
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,890
I can't remember the exact words.

260
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,680
You like that book?

261
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,110
He's quite romantic

262
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,970
and very brave,

263
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,330
although a bit foolish.

264
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,300
You're brave, too.

265
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,160
Why did you run away?

266
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,720
I'll tell you later.

267
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,480
Hello.

268
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:46,990

Have you seen

272
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,500
this person recently?

273

Dongdong.

What's going on?

275
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,150
There was just a strong wind.

276
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,090
Everything got blown to the floor.

277
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,350
It didn't get blown downstairs, did it?

278
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,080
I don't know.

Dongdong, what are you doing?

282
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,560
Come here.

Sir, please don't hit him.

We didn't do anything wrong.

We were just studying.

287

We were working on our papers.

288
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,070
She was helping me review.

How did he assault you?

Tell me.

Where are you staying
if you're not going home?

00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,200
I live here.

I live in the hutong corner.

304

I can live anywhere.

305

No wonder your father

306
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,700
couldn't find you.

00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,950
You've been hiding here.

308
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,390
Has my dad found out I'm here?

309
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,160
Did your father hit you?

310
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,350
No matter what conflicts you have,

We were just here to study.

be happening now.

357
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,720
It shouldn't happen
before the college entrance exam.

00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,110
You!

386
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,590
Stop hitting!

387
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,070
-Stop!
-How dare you come back?

388
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:28,680
Stop!

389
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,350
Mei.

390
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,750
Tian Hao.

391
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,150
Listen, both of you.

392
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,720
The child is back now.

393
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,400
She is about
to take the College Entrance Exam.

394
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,330
You can't hit or scold her anymore.

395
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,410
Isn't it good that she's back?

396
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,090
Mei,

397
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,350
do you hear me?

398
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,750
Don't hit her again.

399
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,240
Ran.

400
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,550
Where did you find her?

401
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,400
Ask her yourself.

402
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:23,860
I'm sorry.

403
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,220
-It's okay.
-Don't go.

404
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,150
Let me get some dishes.

405
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:26,480
Let's have a drink.

406
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,110
No need.

407
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,440
Your wife...

408
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,400
I just have one thing to say.

409
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,920
Don't give the child a hard time anymore.

410
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,880
We didn't.

411
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,110
Thank you.

412
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,550
Thank you so much.

413
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,900
Let me get some dishes.
Let's have a drink.

414
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,460
Alright.

415
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,340
Thanks.

416
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,800
[Recycling]

417
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:52,400
[Missing Person]

418
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,310
Just settle for this.

419
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,370
I only know how to make simple dishes.

420
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,400
My apologies,

421
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,880
having my bodyguard cook for me.

422
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,680
I've been your bodyguard for two days now.

423
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,160
I need to go back
to being a police officer.

424
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,160
I have to work the night shift later.

425
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,100
I'll come back after my shift.

426
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:12,550
If Wang Kun contacts you,

427
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,750
tell me immediately.

428
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,560
Of course.

429
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,350
I just wanted to help,

430
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,610
but it ended up causing trouble instead.

431
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:22,960
Well...

432
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,570
I was good to Xiaolong.

433
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,130
Xiaolong died.

434
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,040
I went to take care of Li Jing.

435
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,280
Something happened to her as well.

436
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,310
It's so strange.

437
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,830
None of this has anything to do with you.

438
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,960
Don't overthink it.

439
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:45,960
Well,

440
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,610
why can people be so evil?

441
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,520
My mentor said

442
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,210
never ask why about anything.

443
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,810
I guess I should go back.

444
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,000
It's not mine.

445
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,480
He replied to me.

446
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,890
He replied to me.

447
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,250
[I'm leaving. See you, Wang Kun.]

448
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,550
He's left?

449
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,640
Where had you been?

450
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,940
Just tell us, will you?

451
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,870
I really... I just can't understand.

452
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,770
What

453
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:17,640
did we do wrong

454
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,120
to deserve this from you?

455
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,030
Since you were little,

456
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,960
we provided for all your needs.

457
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,350
We rented an apartment

458
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,550
so you could go to school in the city.

459
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,040
All we want is

460
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,000
for you to be safe and sound.

461
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,590
But you just left.

462
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,350
Did you ever think about us?

463
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:41,030
What are we supposed to do if you leave?

464
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,110
This family will fall apart.

465
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,310
Do you know that?

466
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,680
If you're unhappy with us about something,

467
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,640
just say it.

468
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,200
What exactly

469
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,270
did we do wrong?

470
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,400
Just tell us.

471
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,970
And we can change. Isn't that acceptable?

472
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,330
Whether steamed buns taste good or not

473
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,350
depends entirely on the recipe.

474
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,310
If the recipe is wrong,

475
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,640
all your effort is wasted.

476
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,910
The stage you are at now

477
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,800
is just like kneading dough.

478
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,640
You need to follow the proper steps—

479
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,440
how much yeast to add,

480
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,990
how many pieces of sugar—

481
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:19,720
it's not about

482
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,000
doing whatever you want.

483
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,440
There are rules.

484
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:24,960
Of course.

485
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,750
Not everything traditional is right.

486
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,160
In the old days, when making dough,

487
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,680
we would add baking soda.

488
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,270
It made the buns turn yellow when steamed.

489
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,790
Something this serious has happened,

490
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:35,790
and you're still here

491
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,510
teaching her how to make buns?

492
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:40,160
Every time I try to teach our child,
you interrupt.

493
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,960
Every time I try to teach our child,
you interrupt.

494
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:47,240
In education,
correctness isn't determined

495
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,700
by who speaks the loudest.

496
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:50,910
Well,

497
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:54,240
flour comes in high-gluten,
medium-gluten, and low-gluten.

498
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,890
Which one is best for steamed buns?

499
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,200
Medium-gluten.

500
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,250
It must be medium-gluten.

501
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,240
Why?

502
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,550
Because generations of master chefs

503
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,350
have figured it out through experience.

504
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,350
It can't be wrong.

505
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,550
Well,

506
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,800
you need to have a materialistic

507
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,760
view of history.

508
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,520
Understand?

509
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,270
Is this how you teach her?

510
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,170
Stop pretending

511
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,870
to be some intellectual.

512
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,030
Tell her something practical.

513
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,160
How much more practical can I be?

514
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,830
What I'm saying

515
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,480
is as practical as it gets.

516
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,560
What I'm saying

517
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,880
is profound in meaning

518
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,490
yet simple in expression.

519
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,250
Why can't you understand?

520
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,720
You don't read books or newspapers.

521
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,720
That's why you've raised

522
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,830
her to be like this.

523
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,960
You're the one who made her this way.

524
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,160
If this child had been raised
according to my methods

525
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,480
since childhood,

526
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,240
she wouldn't be like this.

527
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:42,970
And now she's

528
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:43,790
ruined.

529
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,400
This child is ruined.

530
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,350
Is this all my fault?

531
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,720
-Aren't you responsible?
-Yes.

532
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,160
Yes.

533
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:51,920
Yes.

534
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,400
I...

535
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:54,960
Yes.

536
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,520
-I've done so much—
-Yeah.

537
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,640
Absolutely right. It's all your fault.

538
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,480
Exactly right. It's all your fault.

539
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,160
I've done so much for this family.

540
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,880
-But you blame me?
-It's all your fault. It's all your fault.

541
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,640
So, shut up.

542
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,880
I work from dawn till dusk

543
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,610
-to serve you two.
-So, shut up.

544
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:08,960
So, shut up.

545
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,630
Shut up!

546
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,280
When steaming buns,

547
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,510
after you wrap them,

548
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,070
you let them proof on the steamer rack.

549
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,590
If they are proofed for too long,

550
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,030
the bottom will fall out
and the soup will leak.

551
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,960
This is the same principle as life—

552
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,550
I want to sleep alone.

553
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,690
The small storage room is fine.

554
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,090
I also want to wear a skirt.

555
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,000
The red one.

556
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,230
Son.

557
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,320
Dad was once

558
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,670
your age, too.

559
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,400
I understand

560
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,610
all your little issues.

561
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:36,590
Dad.

562
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,030
I swear we didn't do anything.

563
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,160
I just wanted to help her.

564
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,120
So, what do you want me to do?

565
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,610
Pretend I didn't see anything?

566
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,210
Left you two alone?

567
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,590
Why not?

568
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,840
Of course not.

569
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,200
I'm a police officer.

570
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,590
Tian Chang's parents

571
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,920
have already filed a report.

572
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,070
Her parents have come to the station

573
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,510
and made a fuss many times.

574
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,000
If I help you cover this up,

575
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,360
I would have to...

576
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,610
I'd have to resign as a police officer.

577
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,480
But your doing will hurt her.

578
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,820
Who's hurting her?

579
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,320
Her parents?

580
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,170
Aren't they her biological parents?

581
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,400
Why would they want to hurt

582
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,670
their own daughter?

583
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,320
Her parents beat her, control her,

584
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:25,920
oppress her,

585
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,960
and don't let her go out.

586
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,000
About the beating,

587
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,460
I've already warned them.

588
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,760
If they dare to lay a hand on her again,

589
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,560
I'll be the first to arrest them.

590
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,990
But about what you mentioned...

591
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,230
control,

592
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,480
what can I do about that?

593
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,590
But we're free, aren't we?

594
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:43,960
Yes.

595
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,190
You can be free.

596
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,800
But shouldn't you finish
the college entrance exam first?

597
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,280
Tell me,

598
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:49,960
if your child

599
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,070
runs away from home every day,

600
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,230
wouldn't you need to

601
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,160
lock her up and keep an eye on her?

602
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,440
Well, think about it.

603
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,410
Why would a girl

604
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,320
stay outside

605
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,880
for so long without going home,

606
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,840
preferring to sleep on the streets?

607
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,510
Why is that?

608
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,320
Maybe it's because she's

609
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,450
being disobedient.

610
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:04,550
Have you

611
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,840
done nothing wrong at all?

612
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,970
What did we do wrong?

613
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,070
Son.

614
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,130
I'm only going to ask once.

615
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,710
Tell me the truth.

616
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,440
Did you two

617
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,290
have sexual relations?

618
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,110
Dad.

619
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:53,840
Why...

620
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,030
Why would you think that?

621
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,320
No matter what your answer is,

622
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,630
I won't tell your mother

623
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,190
or anyone else.

624
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,480
I just want to help you.

625
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,510
But

626
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,230
I hope my son

627
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,190
can tell me the truth.

628
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,150
I didn't.

629
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:46,840
I

630
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,700
have been a policeman all my life.

631
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,670
I've met all kinds of people.

632
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,080
You've already drawn your conclusion.

633
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,960
You won't believe my explanation anyway.

634
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,560
Then give me an explanation!

635
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,050
Would it even help if I explained?

636
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,400
Coming.

637
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,870
Why are you so late?

638
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,460
I've been waiting for you—

639
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,570
Hello, You Jia.

640
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,760
Mr. Wang?

641
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,510
Weren't you out of town?

642
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,680
My schedule changed at the last minute,

643
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,800
so I didn't go.

644
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,360
May I come in?

645
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:30,880
Yes, of course.

646
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,550
Okay.

647
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,500
This little courtyard is quite nice.

648
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,710
Do you live here alone?

649
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,510
Yes.

650
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:50,930
It's very nice.

651
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:52,890
It's very nice.

652
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,000
Recently,

653
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,400
there's been demolition in this area,

654
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,460
so these two families here moved out.

655
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,030
Is this your room?

656
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,400
I find that girls' rooms

657
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,550
are always so cozy.

658
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:10,920
Mr. Wang.

659
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,230
Let me get you some water.

660
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,760
Please sit down.

661
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,420
Have a seat.

662
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,070
Okay, thank you.

663
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:17,670
I'll be right there.

664
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,110
OK.

665
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,900
Sorry to keep you waiting.

666
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,630
Thank you.

667
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,630
How come

668
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,690
you haven't been teaching recently?

669
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,000
I've had some unexpected

670
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,150
issues at home.

671
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,600
I've been dealing with family matters.

672
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,710
Do you

673
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,440
need something from me?

674
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,360
You've disappeared recently.

675
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,620
Everyone's been very worried about you.

676
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,840
You were worried about me, too?

677
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:17,750
Of course.

678
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,440
Of course.

679
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:23,230
You Jia.

680
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,360
Do you know,

681
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,640
of all the students I've taught,

682
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,480
you are the most

683
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,710
talented and gifted

684
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,360
student I've ever seen?

685
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:33,550
Trust me.

686
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,210
I'm never wrong about people.

687
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:48,590
Mr. Wang.

688
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,320
Do you remember Li Jing?

689
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,360
Who?

690
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:57,070
She is also your student.

691
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,480
Li Jing.

692
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,110
I don't remember her.

693
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:03,840
I... I have too many students.

694
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,300
I can't remember them all.

695
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,970
Something happened to her.

696
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,040
She met a psychopath.

697
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,650
And she harmed herself.

698
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,360
Who told you that?

699
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,620
Everyone's talking about it.

700
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,970
You should be careful, too.

701
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:28,800
If it were me...

702
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:31,150
If I ever met him,

703
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,020
I would never let him get away with it.

704
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,400
If you

705
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:40,390
actually met someone like that,

706
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:42,550
what would you do?

707
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,880
I would kill him.

708
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:56,760
I like your attitude.

709
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,710
You Jia.

710
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,510
You told me before that you work

711
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,240
at Anding Hospital, right?

712
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,360
Why did you

713
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,510
do that to Li Jing?

714
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,920
You little brat. I'll strangle you.

715
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:43,670
Help!
