00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,000
we'll eat grilled squid first,

192
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,200
then go to the arcade.

193
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,390
Let's play Cadillacs and Dinosaurs.

194
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,600
One coin to beat the game.

195
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,320
The college entrance exam's in a few days.

196
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,180
You want to repeat the year again?

197
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,240
It's called work-life balance.

198
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,630
My grades are steady now.

199
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,000
Aiming for a bachelor's degree,
settling for an associate's.

200
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,530
It's just my parents
haven't given up on that.

201
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,870
You go.

202
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,540
I don't have time for that.

203
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,000
10 minutes.

204
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,770
Just 10 minutes, okay?

205
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,320
I don't even know how to play.

206
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,440
Dong.

207
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,750
Bro, listen!

208
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,030
I'll tell you the truth.

209
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,200
I got robbed at the arcade

210
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,150
a few days ago.

211
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,390
Just come in with me and back me up, man.

212
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,750
How am I supposed to back you up?

213
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,080
Your dad's a police officer.

214
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,240
I can't help you with that.

215
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,570
Ask my dad to back you up.

216
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,630
No, bro.

217
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,320
Okay class, let's begin.

218
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,870
Turn to page 54.

219
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,480
[45 days until the college entrance exam]

220
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,270
Do you know how long we have

221
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,130
until the college entrance exam?

222
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,550
Do you know how many days are left

223
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,600
until the exam?

224
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,770
[Please keep the door closed]

225
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,280
[Please keep the door closed]

226
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,720
Open your mouth.

227
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,020
You can go back now.

228
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,670
Conservation of energy.

229
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,350
Conservation of energy, right?

230
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,870
Why are you asking me for help with this?

231
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,870
I'm just a nurse,

232
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,870
not a doctor.

233
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,390
Your leader said

234
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,510
there's a national conference,

235
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,390
and all available doctors

236
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,250
have to attend.

237
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,670
It must be because of Xiaolong's case.

238
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,790
They don't want
to get involved with that trouble.

239
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,720
Please help me out.

240
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,320
It's just for intimidation.

241
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,000
That guy

242
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,630
definitely isn't mentally ill.

243
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,890
When I questioned him,

244
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,630
he was yelling,
but he kept covering his eyes

245
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,630
and peeking at me.

246
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,490
He's definitely faking it.

247
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,320
Fine.

248
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,150
I don't have a shift this afternoon.

249
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,670
But let's be clear,

250
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,600
you need to help me too.

251
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:07,960
Okay.

252
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,370
What do you need?

253
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,870
Help me
process my application to go abroad.

254
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,960
I'm going to the U.S.

255
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,960
to find my fiancé.

256
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,910
Our police station...

257
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,970
Can you do it or not?

258
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,960
Jiajia.

259
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,360
Here's the hydrogen peroxide
you asked for.

260
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,200
Thank you!

261
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,510
I'll buy you a soda tomorrow, okay?

262
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:25,960
Sure.

263
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,560
What's the hydrogen peroxide for?

264
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,750
This morning,

265
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,670
Dalong asked me

266
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,320
to get some from the hospital.

267
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,250
Dalong? Crazy Wu's older brother?

268
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,120
Why does he need hydrogen peroxide?

269
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,550
When his wife is on her period,

270
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,480
she'll leave that thing, you know?

271
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,000
This can

272
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,750
clean that thing

273
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,750
out of the fabric.

274
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,330
That thing?

275
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,190
Blood stains.

276
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,800
It works especially well on blood.

277
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,240
Something's off.

278
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:58,960
What?

279
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,340
I have to go now.

280
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,660
Should I come with you
this afternoon or not?

281
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,960
[Nanhuaishu Police Station Fengyang Branch
Yanchuan Public Security Bureau]

282
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,510
Ran,

283
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,130
we're going on patrol now.

284
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,270
Why are you in such

285
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,150
a hurry?

286
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,000
Did you find the doctor

287
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,790
I asked for?

288
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,840
If we can't get an evaluation,

289
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,510
we'll have to release that guy!

290
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,510
I remember correctly.

291
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,110
Mentor, look at these notes.

292
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,390
You were right
to tell me to record details.

293
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,550
In Dalong's yard,

294
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,250
there were new baby's shoes

295
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:40,720
[There's a grape rack in the yard,
with various children's necessities]

296
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,510
and various fabric scraps,

297
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:41,530
probably for making diapers.

298
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,810
[New shoes, diapers, clothes, pants, etc.]

299
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,200
There were also dried sour dates
in the kitchen.

300
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,270
I think Dalong's wife

301
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:46,910
is pregnant.

302
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,440
So what?

303
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,720
What does that have to do with Jian?

304
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,720
Then the hydrogen peroxide thing
doesn't make sense.

305
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,240
Now I have two leads.

306
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,720
What are you

307
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,750
rambling about?

308
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,200
Something's definitely off
with the hydrogen peroxide.

309
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,670
Lan is here.

310
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,510
Ran.

311
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,600
What are you doing?

312
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,130
I'm just doing some chores.

313
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,890
Where's Dalong?

314
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,180
He just went out

315
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,770
to replace the gas tank.

316
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,890
Do you need something?

317
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,750
No, nothing.

318
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,720
You're pregnant, right?

319
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,330
I just got pregnant.

320
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,600
We haven't dared to tell anyone yet.

321
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,400
That's great.

322
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,070
Dalong will be back soon.

323
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,400
I'll call him.

324
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,000
No need.

325
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,480
We're just chatting.

326
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,680
How far along are you?

327
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,530
Two months.

328
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,120
It's not easy for you

329
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,050
to move from that

330
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,130
nice apartment complex to live in

331
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,970
this low-rise hutong here.

332
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,440
Well, this area is going
to be demolished soon anyway.

333
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,720
Have they finalized the area?

334
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,250
How much space will you get?

335
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,650
We'll take whatever they give us.

336
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,270
You should talk to Dalong,

337
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,630
tell him to stop stacking bricks all day.

338
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,720
The space he's walling up

339
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,780
might not count in the compensation.

340
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,120
Okay.

341
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,960
But actually,

342
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,560
he's just fixing up the courtyard wall.

343
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,840
I'll ask around for you later,

344
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,770
and see how much area you might get.

345
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,750
Thank you, Ran.

346
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:32,840
What's this?

347
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,210
Hydrogen peroxide.

348
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,870
What?

349
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,440
Hydrogen peroxide.

350
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,850
What are you using this for?

351
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,450
And so much of it at once?

352
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,450
We're having a baby,

353
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,270
so we're disinfecting the house.

354
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:57,960
I heard this stuff

355
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,020
works best for washing blood stains.

356
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,630
What happened to this jacket?

357
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,090
Why is it washed like this?

358
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,550
Honey.

359
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,440
I'm back.

360
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,770
What's going on?

361
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,030
Ran.

362
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,170
Your wife is pregnant,

363
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,040
so we didn't push her.

364
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,000
She told us herself.

365
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,960
Who is it?

366
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,410
Coming, coming!

367
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,000
Who is it?

368
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,250
Stop knocking.

369
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,560
I'm coming.

370
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,750
Why are you back?

371
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,790
I was right.

372
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,390
Conservation of energy.

373
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,120
It really is conserved.

374
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,320
What happened to you?

375
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,120
I was right.

376
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,750
Where does it hurt?

377
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,010
There's so much blood!

378
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:05,240
It really is conserved.

379
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,920
I'm asking you!

380
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,980
Where does it hurt?

381
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,000
Wang Tianxin's ignoring me.

382
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,380
Come on.

383
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,720
Hold this umbrella.

384
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,609
She's ignoring me.

385
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,400
Who's Wang Tianxin?

386
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,000
His girlfriend.

387
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,410
Ex-girlfriend.

388
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,480
What happened then?

389
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,920
Later I ran outside

390
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,270
and checked several hutongs,

391
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,000
but I didn't see

392
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,270
any blood traces anywhere.

393
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,130
I was confused,

394
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,610
so I quickly cleaned up

395
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,550
my little brother

396
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,270
and sent him back
to Anding Hospital that same night.

397
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,000
This time, we climbed over

398
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,330
the back wall to get in.

399
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,920
Why didn't you call the police then?

400
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,110
Since childhood,

401
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,680
my dad always said

402
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,200
that he gave me all the good things.

403
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,600
After my brother went crazy,

404
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,540
I somewhat felt responsible.

405
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,790
My dad told me to take good care of him.

406
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,590
I owe him.

407
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,240
Ran.

408
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,790
How's my brother?

409
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,790
They're questioning him now.

410
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,030
Uncle Ran and my dad

411
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,270
are old friends.

412
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,080
Please look out for him.

413
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,440
What now, bro?

414
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,290
Have you made up your mind?

415
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,240
I've been thinking about it.

416
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,810
Well, tell us about it.

417
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,750
All molecules and particles...

418
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,320
are constantly colliding,

419
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,920
expanding, colliding,

420
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,270
and expanding again.

421
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,720
At this very moment,

422
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,070
those molecules and particles condensed,

423
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,920
and became what we are now.

424
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,780
That's how we end up sitting here.

425
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,410
What nonsense are you talking about?

426
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:10,550
Don't think

427
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,400
you can fake your way out

428
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,640
by pretending to be crazy.

429
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,750
I'm not crazy!

430
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:16,640
Good.

431
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,060
You're honest.

432
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,880
Let's talk then.

433
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,490
On the night of the 18th,

434
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,720
who did you run into?

435
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,880
Do you remember

436
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,920
who you ran into that night?

437
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,450
Let's just say it's a woman.

438
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,680
Why?

439
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,240
What's the difference
between a woman and a tree?

440
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,790
Then how did you

441
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,790
get all that blood on you that night?

442
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,510
Can a tree bleed?

443
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,070
I stepped on her.

444
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,640
You stepped on her body?

445
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,510
I stepped on her head.

446
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,560
Then she started bleeding.

447
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,160
And then...

448
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,070
and then she became small.

449
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,270
Then I jumped up,

450
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,000
ate a big mushroom,

451
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,030
and I became really,

452
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,440
really tall.

453
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:33,960
That's right.

454
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,440
In the end, she went to the castle,

455
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,550
raised a little flag,

456
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,960
and fired a salute for that.

457
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,760
Right, right!

458
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,600
He's absolutely crazy.

459
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,400
There's nothing we can do.

460
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,830
Jian was just faking mental illness.

461
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,360
But this guy is really sick.

462
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,800
Everything he says is just total nonsense.

463
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,550
Ran,

464
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,640
isn't this Crazy Wu...

465
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,680
from your precinct?

466
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,080
You should know him well.

467
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,520
This kid used to be really smart.

468
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,110
Later when he was a teenager,

469
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,830
he started dating a girl from his class.

470
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,750
Their parents and the school

471
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,920
were totally against it.

472
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,510
They supervised them constantly.

473
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,590
But the more they opposed them,

474
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,440
the more intense their love got.

475
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,310
Later, they planned to elope together.

476
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,110
They agreed

477
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,760
to meet and leave that night.

478
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,480
But somehow,

479
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,310
the girl

480
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,110
fell into a ditch,

481
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,530
and died instantly.

482
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,510
The boy searched for her all night,

483
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,510
and only found her the next morning.

484
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,050
The girl's body was covered with ants.

485
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,680
Since then,

486
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,070
this kid went completely crazy.

487
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,960
He spends all his time raising ants.

488
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,830
He always feels like

489
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,160
the ants can talk to him.

490
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,780
How about this?

491
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,200
Ran knows him better.

492
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,720
Ran,

493
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,040
you should interrogate him.

494
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,890
I can coax him

495
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,520
back to the Anding Hospital.

496
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,010
But to interrogate him?

497
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,790
I don't think I can manage that.

498
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,590
Excessive modesty

499
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,850
is just a sign of pride.

500
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,770
I'll give it a try then.

501
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,720
Why are you sitting here?

502
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,750
You want me to interrogate him alone?

503
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,440
No, Mentor!

504
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,010
You don't need to go in.

505
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,440
The room is small,
and it gets hot with too many people.

506
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,920
It's cooler for you to stay here.

507
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,270
I...

508
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,880
It's too hot.

509
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,510
Drink more water.

510
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,850
It was raining heavily that night.

511
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,550
Did you run away

512
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,810
from Anding Hospital?

513
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,680
Did you go home?

514
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,110
Yes, Ran.

515
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,050
I didn't bring any ants.

516
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,510
I've said before.

517
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,880
It's all a sign!

518
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,310
Nobody listens.

519
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,920
Leaving me here
to hold everything together.

520
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,070
If I'm finished,

521
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,350
this whole hutong will be finished!

522
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:26,960
No matter what,

523
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,920
I can't live without ants.

524
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,880
That night,

525
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,460
did you run into Liu Ke?

526
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,230
This girl right here.

527
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,070
She's pretty.

528
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,900
Where did you meet her?

529
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,960
Right next to my house.

530
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,940
What was she doing?

531
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
She was dancing.

532
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,030
Dancing?

533
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,130
What kind of dance?

534
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,700
Ballroom dancing.

535
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,180
Just spinning around.

536
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:02,790
Ballroom dancing

537
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,400
usually takes two people, right?

538
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,790
Yes, two people.

539
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,340
I'm not talking about you.

540
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,270
I'm talking about that girl.

541
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,830
Dancing.

542
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,780
I was holding her while we danced.

543
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:15,970
Did she want to?

544
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,930
Did she resist?

545
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,980
Yes, she wanted to.

546
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,200
She even laughed.

547
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,610
You asked her to dance,

548
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:23,930
and she agreed?

549
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:27,790
Yes.

550
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,720
I went up and asked

551
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,690
if she wanted to dance with me.

552
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,060
She didn't refuse,

553
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,400
so we danced.

554
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,880
Just dancing?

555
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,310
Nothing else?

556
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,510
I wanted to do something.

557
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,240
Do what?

558
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,160
I said,

559
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,550
"Let's recite a poem together."

560
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,360
Read Gu Cheng's poem.

561
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,510
Gu Cheng?

562
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,770
From which dynasty?

563
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,030
"If you come with me,

564
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,000
you'll count my footsteps.

565
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,110
If I go with you,

566
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,480
I can only see your back."

567
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,960
"If you come with me,

568
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,160
you'll count my footsteps.

569
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:32,200
If I go with you,

570
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,310
I can only see your back."

571
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,030
What was

572
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,140
the girl's reaction then?

573
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,830
She didn't talk to me.

574
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,110
So I got angry.

575
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,680
I got angry

576
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,810
and threw her aside!

577
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,550
What are you doing?

578
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,550
Hey... calm down.

579
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,110
She must've thought I was crazy,

580
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,910
that's why she didn't talk to me.

581
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,510
Take it easy, just take your time.

582
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,640
Then what happened?

583
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,480
I remember now.

584
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,720
I heard her say...

585
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,550
What? Xiaolong, speak louder.

586
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,160
Louder.

587
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:41,640
"As long as the lightning strikes,

588
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:47,110
there will be a dancing flame!"

589
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,310
What the heck?

590
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:00,480
"Man can be as humble as an ant,
yet as beautiful as a God."

591
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,450
That's Gu Cheng's poem, right?

592
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,350
Xiaolong.

593
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,790
We're trying to help you.

594
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,790
You need to tell us truthfully

595
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,440
what you did

596
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,480
and what you saw.

597
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,460
What did you actually do to that girl?

598
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,350
She didn't talk to me,

599
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,000
so I got upset,

600
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,110
and threw her

601
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,440
into the well nearby.

602
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,400
What else did you do?

603
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,720
My ants are calling me.

604
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,250
My ants are calling me home!

605
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,960
-Where are you going?
-What are you doing?

606
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,200
My ants!

607
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,350
Alright, alright!

608
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,920
Let me go home!

609
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,790
I need to see my ants!

610
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,680
Easy, take it easy.

611
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,790
-Alright.
-Be gentle.

612
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,850
Alright, alright.

613
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,110
I think

614
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,630
that crazy guy's the killer.

615
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,800
You saw how crazy he was just now.

616
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,750
And didn't they say

617
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,690
he had some emotional trauma?

618
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,720
He loses control

619
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,170
when he sees girls.

620
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,510
Reasonable motive.

621
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,070
Yes.

622
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,270
The timing, place,

623
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,400
and the motive are right there.

624
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,200
No doubt about it.

625
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,200
I don't think so.

626
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:17,550
I've seen

627
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,830
how he behaved at Anding Hospital.

628
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,960
When interacting with young women,

629
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,000
he was totally normal,

630
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,550
and he's very polite, actually.

631
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,640
He's definitely not the kind of person

632
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,040
who would assault girls.

633
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,000
You recited a poem with him once

634
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,260
and now you feel sympathetic for him?

635
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,790
How many cases have you solved, anyway?

636
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,960
That's not relevant.

637
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,420
Enough.

638
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,970
Stop talking nonsense.

639
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,550
Ran.

640
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,400
What do you think?

641
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,480
Well?

642
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,240
You don't believe

643
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,300
Crazy Wu's the killer either, do you?

644
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,670
Whether I believe it or not
doesn't matter.

645
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,340
What matters is the evidence.

646
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,810
If it really was someone
from the hutong,

647
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:54,590
then why

648
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,120
didn't they do it years ago?

649
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,030
Now that the demolition has started,

650
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,270
the demolition crew and scavengers

651
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:01,880
have all shown up,

652
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,410
and the crimes followed up.

653
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,310
It has to be someone

654
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:05,960
who's familiar with the hutong.

655
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,350
It definitely can't be

656
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,750
a resident of the hutong.

657
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,310
If it's not someone living here,

658
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,030
how would they know the place so well?

659
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,270
A scavenger wandering around
for a month or two

660
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,640
would learn the layout too.

661
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,310
Besides,

662
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,720
he doesn't know how to stake out a spot.

00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,520

[Please keep quiet]

long-term sexual dysfunction,

695
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,830
it can lead

696
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,800
to psychological perversion.

this viciously,

699
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,350
there's a high chance that

700
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,880
he has mental disorder,

701
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:26,400
or even sexual dysfunction.

00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,960
Tomorrow morning,

703
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,620
we'll find out after the test.

704
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,200
Using stamps?

00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,730
How do you check with those?

00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,440
Look here.

707
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,720
Think about it.

708
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,240
What would he do

709
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,240
with this thing?

710
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,720
He uses it as a substitute for himself.

711
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,440
That's his trait.

712
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,550
He can't control himself.

713
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,550
If he's stubborn,

714
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,400
he's soft-hearted.

715
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,700
If he's easily persuaded,

716
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,070
he's cruel.

No, I don't understand.

Can this folk method work?

Well, this is

00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,680
from a professional foreign journal,

are torn evenly,

00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,530
but you have to behave.

761
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:54,960
Mentor.

762
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,390
Could he have torn them himself?

763
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,270
[People's Public Security]

764
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,440
If you keep acting crazy,

765
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,810
I'll send you to the Anding Hospital.

766
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,960
I'm not going there.

767
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,440
Then talk properly.

768
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,000
I told you,

769
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,290
I was playing mahjong.

770
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,000
With who?

771
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,150
With who?

772
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,400
I really don't know them.

773
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,250
Just in that hutong below the water tower.

774
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,760
They needed one more player,

775
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,760
so they called me,

776
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,800
and I joined them.

777
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,280
So they just happened to

778
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,000
need one more player, and it was you?

779
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,320
Yet you didn't even know who they are?

780
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,520
You don't believe me?

781
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,679
Go check then.

782
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:31,840
Fine.

783
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,400
Wait until I check it out.

784
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,030
Hold on,

785
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,710
are you trying to string me along?

786
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,639
You're stringing yourself along.

787
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,159
How big is this case anyway?

788
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,420
So you know it's a big case.

789
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,850
You cops are always like this.

790
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,600
Whenever there's a big case,

791
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,550
you solve one problem and cause another.

792
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,360
You always have
to lock me up for a few days.

793
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,159
I'm used to it.

794
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,800
Then why is it
always you who gets locked up?

795
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,960
Analyze it for us.

796
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,440
Because you think

797
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,760
that only old people like us,

798
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,070
who have no home, no career,

799
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,440
and nothing to lose,

800
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,570
are capable of committing a big crime.

801
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,180
These are all excuses.

802
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,320
All excuses.

803
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,190
Deep down, you think

804
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,150
we're bad guys,

805
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,590
because we don't obey.

806
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,170
In your eyes, we're outsiders,

807
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,840
and we are different from you.

808
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,800
You flash your butt

809
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,200
at young girls every day,

810
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,480
and still expect a home and career?

811
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,650
I'll tell you this.

812
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,800
Back in my hometown,

813
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,470
I had it all— a wife, a kid,

814
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,400
everything.

815
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,670
A state-owned enterprise job.

816
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,070
Dual-income household.

817
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,360
If life was so good,

818
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,280
then why did you run off

819
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,610
to be a trash scavenger?

820
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,690
Money can't buy happiness, right?

821
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,070
At home,

822
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,400
working,

823
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,030
doing chores,

824
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,640
watching the kid every night...

825
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,660
it looked fine on the surface,

826
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,280
but night after night,

827
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,760
I just couldn't sleep.

828
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,920
It drove me crazy.

829
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,320
Why?

830
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,710
Because I wanted to lose my mind and die!

831
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,630
Now, I'm living my best life.

832
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,070
I can wear whatever I want,

833
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,030
I can go naked if I want to.

834
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,840
I'm so free.

835
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,030
Fun, isn't it?

836
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,760
Actually, only those

837
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,420
people with homes and careers

838
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,430
will do the most disgusting things.

839
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,150
They just hide it well.

840
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,710
You can't see

841
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,740
the filth inside them.

842
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,940
So, arresting you was a mistake then?

843
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,630
You're giving us a lecture now?

844
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,840
I don't care.

845
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,670
It's all the same

846
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,160
where I eat or sleep.

847
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,640
But with your method?

848
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,680
You'll never catch anyone.

849
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,000
Don't talk about us.

850
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,200
Talk about yourself.

851
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,510
Tell us the truth.

852
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,710
Dong,

853
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,230
why are you up so early?

854
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,480
You... you...

855
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:36,190
Why are you pouring cold water
on yourself this early?

856
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,190
To wake myself up,

857
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,410
so I can start memorizing vocabulary.

858
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,280
You...

859
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,030
Don't catch a cold.

860
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,190
Unbelievable.

861
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,400
Dong.

862
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,190
You need to eat breakfast.
Don't go to school on an empty stomach.

863
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:55,920
I'm not eating, Mom.

864
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,520
Come here.

865
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,360
I have enough money.

866
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,030
Nonsense.

867
00:37:59,070 --> 00:37:59,800
Just take it.

868
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:00,710
Off you go.

869
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:01,800
I'm leaving.

870
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,400
Don't rush.

871
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:04,670
Dong.

872
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,800
Goodbye, Mr. Guo.

873
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,280
Dong.

874
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:26,760
I'm sorry.

875
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,000
I still want to focus on my studies.

876
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,110
I can't afford to fail another year.

877
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,230
We found two of them under the bridge.

878
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,490
You really found them?

879
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,360
They were indeed playing mahjong.

880
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,510
We haven't found the third one yet.

881
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:55,630
We have them confirmed the photos.
It's definitely Jian.

882
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,710
Then we have to release him.

883
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,770
We can't let him go.

884
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,150
He took off his pants

885
00:38:59,150 --> 00:38:59,960
and flashed young girls.

886
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,400
What kind of person does that?

887
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,590
Besides,

888
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,030
we found a bunch of high heels

889
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:04,920
and stockings at his place.

890
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,360
The owners already reported the theft.

891
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,620
It took a lot of effort.

892
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,910
Then put him in administrative detention.

893
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:25,710
Sign here.

894
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,560
First time making an arrest?

895
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,360
Why did you say

896
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,660
we won't catch anyone?

897
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,500
Every household has secrets.

898
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,510
Just lift the roof,

899
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:54,970
and you'll see.

900
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,330
Just take a look.

901
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,330
It's much more exciting than what's on TV.

902
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:16,850
Beiping.

903
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,150
Sorry to keep you waiting.

904
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:23,550
It's fine.
