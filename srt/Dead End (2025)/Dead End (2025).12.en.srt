Why don't you solve cases then?

that I'm not sick right now.

177
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,200
There's a term called "heart knot."

Yes, exactly like tangles.

In our Criminal Police Team,

440
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,680
there was this really handsome guy,

441
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,000
but he's not smart.

442
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,310
If he talked
for more than three sentences,

443
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,310
he'd go off topic.

444
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,920
So I taught him a trick.

445
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,820
After that, the girls chasing him

00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,810

and your wife get together?

454
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,980
Back in the day, I had just joined
the Criminal Police Team.

455
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,640
I was young and naive.

456
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,550
Someone sneaked into their factory

457
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,550
to peep at the women's bathhouse.

458
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,720
I actually

459
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,050
caught the guy already.

460
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,880
But guess what?

461
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,030
I let that brat go again.

462
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,240
Why?

463
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,930
I let him run across the factory

464
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,480
so I could chase him down.

465
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,830
We ran two big laps

466
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,920
in the factory.

467
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,160
Finally,

468
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,410
in front of all the female workers,

469
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,880
I kicked him down to the ground,

470
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,110
and arrested him.

471
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,440
After that,

472
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,210
I started getting little notes

473
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,830
and messages

474
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,130
from the girls.

475
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,030
So your wife

476
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,960
passed you a note too?

477
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,820
No, not really.

478
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:30,960
In the end, I talked to

479
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,880
their head of security about it.

480
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,000
So your wife is quite impressive, huh?

481
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,440
Yes.

482
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,310
If she were a criminal,

483
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,150
I probably couldn't handle her.

484
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:45,830
Later,

485
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,310
their factory

486
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,640

487
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
Her family

488
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,110
gave her some money

489
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,110
to find another job.

490
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,350
That was right when my mentor

491
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,410
had that accident.

492
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,830
So I took that money

493
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,120
and paid for my mentor's medical bills.

494
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:09,160
She then went south to start a business,

495
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,480
and went through a lot of hardship.

496
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,640
She always wanted

497
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,790
a motorcycle.

498
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,000
But I never bought her one.

499
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:38,960
Isn't that...

500
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,330
who I think it is?

501
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,790
That guy's footsteps

502
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,310
are a bit too neat.

503
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,750

00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,410
you go back and rest?

760
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,070
I'm about to finish my shift too.

761
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,590
Then we'll come back next Tuesday.

762
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:02,280
Thank you.

763
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,510
Mentor.

764
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:10,280
Mentor.

765
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,010
Let's call it a day.

766
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,350
Let's go back.

767
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,440
Come on.

768
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,760
Alright.

769
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,590
Take it easy.

770
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,440
Hello?

771
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,480
This is Caring Sister Hotline.

772
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,410
Please go ahead.

773
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:39,920
Hello, please go ahead.

774
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,920
Hello, my friend,

775
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:45,710
long time no talk.

776
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:48,510
Okay,

777
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,530
please hold.

778
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,670
My friend,

779
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:06,230
it's been a long time

780
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:07,830
since we last talked, right?

781
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:26,320
Yes, sis.

782
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:28,710
It's been too long.

783
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,230
You miss me, right?

784
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:34,630
So,

785
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,230
what do you

786
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,000
want to talk about today?

787
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:40,400
Tell me,

788
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,320
when I slit

789
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,920
those women's throats,

790
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:48,110
what were they thinking?

791
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:50,360
I don't know.

792
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,320
I'll tell you.

793
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,280
They couldn't even react.

794
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:56,150
By the time they realized...

795
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:58,190
do you know

796
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:00,120
what the most interesting part is?

797
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,550
What is it?

798
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:09,670
Hello, Director Zhu.

799
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:10,400
Please quickly

800
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,400
track that phone for me.

801
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,550
Dispatch the nearest officers there.

802
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:14,150
I'm heading there right now.

803
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,510
They couldn't scream at all.

804
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,690
The more they tried to scream,

805
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,960
the less sound they could make.

806
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,400
And then,

807
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:26,800
I dragged them

808
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,860
to the darkest place,

809
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,760
I pulled out the bottle.

810
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,440
I guess at that moment,

811
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,320
they were thirsty.

812
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,320
Their eyes were fixed on that bottle.

813
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:43,320
Maybe they're just craving a drink.

814
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:54,670
At the intersection of Changchun Street

815
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:55,760
and Jingyang Street, right?

816
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,150
Okay.

817
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,670
Why aren't you lecturing me today?

818
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,360
Why are you so quiet?

819
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,960
I'm just

820
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,330
listening to you, aren't I?

821
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:23,800
Something's wrong.

822
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,110
You're acting weird today.

823
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,550
Usually you talk a lot about...

824
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:32,670
psychology,

825
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,960
consciousness, personality and stuff.

826
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:37,710
But today,

827
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:39,640
you don't have a single question.a

828
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,240
[Ask: What do you think
the police will think of you?]

829
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:43,920
I... I certainly have questions.

830
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,580
[Ask: What do you think
the police will think of you?]

831
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:47,660
I just haven't had the chance to ask yet.

832
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,840
[Ask: What do you think
the police will think of you?]

833
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,150
I wanted to ask you,

834
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:52,760
what do you think

835
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,190
the police

836
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:56,440
will think of you?

837
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,840
The police definitely think

838
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:04,150
the hutong killer is a badass.

839
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:07,520
They can't catch me no matter what.

840
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:08,710
Who's better now?

841
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:11,110
I'm driving them crazy.

842
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,580
[Sexual impotence makes you pathetic]

843
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,070
[Sexual impotence makes you pathetic]

844
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:22,230
My friend,

845
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,280
perhaps,

846
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:25,550
perhaps...

847
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,150
the police think you're impotent.

848
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:29,400
You're sexually frustrated,

849
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,150
and that's why you went to stab women.

850
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:31,880
Actually,

851
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,800
you're really pathetic.

852
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,110
You're not alone today, are you?

853
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,230
Of course I'm alone.

854
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:57,730
Right now, the one sitting next to you

855
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:01,400
is the younger one

856
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,070
or the older one?

857
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,760
Say hi for me.

858
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,670
Listen,

859
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,400
why...

860
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,320
did you do that?

861
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:57,000
I can't suppress my urges anymore.

862
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:58,760
Catch me

863
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:02,590
and we'll talk face to face.
