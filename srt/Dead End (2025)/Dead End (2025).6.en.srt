who was in charge of

Did you give him his medication

Yes.

make a copy.

So the person singing this

705

must have been very close to Liu Ke.

I don't drink.

764
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,690
-Have a candy.
-Have this.

765
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,770
Have any of you seen

766
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,230
this person here?

767
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:36,890
Take a look.

768
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,030
I haven't seen

769
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,550
this person.

770
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,480
-No.
-No.

771
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,480
Think carefully.

772
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,260
She was with your boss.

773
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,440
We really haven't seen her.

774
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,150
No impression at all.

775
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:46,760
If we had seen her,

776
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,920
-we would have told you.
-If there's any news,

777
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,000
I'll definitely let you know right away.

778
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,800
That's right.

779
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,000
Bro,

780
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,590
the night is young and time is precious.

781
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,150
I don't drink.

782
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,360
Let's sing a duet of

783
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,840
"My Heart for You to See".

784
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,190
I don't think I can see it.

785
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,510
I see it, that's what matters.

786
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,230
How about you and I have a drink?

787
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,440
Or maybe we sing a different song?

788
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,440
Don't be nervous.

789
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,000
When will you finish unloading?

790
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,130
The entrance has been blocked all day.

791
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,280
If they can't finish unloading,

792
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,680
there's nothing I can do.

793
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,060
I'm only responsible for registration.

794
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,600
What's the rush?

795
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,580
Are you in a hurry to be reborn?

796
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,190
We have rules between us.

797
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,030
You get ten trucks,

798
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,030
our Mr. Hei gets ten trucks.

799
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:44,030
You're really being unreasonable.

800
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:44,920
Rules?

801
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,350
Who made them?

802
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,710
We didn't have enough trucks before.

803
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,770
Now we have enough.

804
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,400
We don't want to share anymore.

805
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:51,800
Fine.

806
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,110
You're the one who said it.

807
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,110
Yes, I did.

808
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:55,800
I won't unload then.

809
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,710
We can't unload the truck today.

810
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:04,770
Everyone, get off!

811
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,630
- Get off!
- Get off!

812
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,110
Get off.

813
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,000
Mr. Hei,

814
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,080
we can't unload the truck today.

815
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,440
Mr. Hei,

816
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,840
the club just called.

817
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,840
The cops are there causing trouble.

818
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,000
Bro,

819
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,410
what's the situation here?

820
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,950
Put the word out to the brothers:

821
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:45,000
I, Little Erhei,

822
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:47,550
am done playing nice
with Crazy Monk today.

823
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,440
Everyone, move in!
