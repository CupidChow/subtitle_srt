-Come on.
-That's not a big deal.

196
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,390
Let's drink together.

197
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,600
Together.

198
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,800
-Together.
-Come on.

199
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,040
-Come on. Together.
-Cheers.

200
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,720
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

201
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,720
Come on, drink up.

202
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,020
I'm going to the bathroom.

203
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,010
This liquor is strong.

204
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,030
Come on, let's drink.

205
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,430
The case is solved.

206
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,390
Why does your apprentice

207
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,650
look like he's lost his soul?

208
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,510
He's stubborn.

209
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,830
He's stubborn, but he's a good material.

210
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,830
He's not like you.

211
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,310
What's wrong with me?

212
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,170
You're greasy.

213
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,070
Think about bearings.

214
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,560
Can it even spin without grease?

215
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,800
It would just be a dead lump.

216
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,930
It would be useless.

217
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,990
My mentor-apprentice pairing is right,
isn't it?

218
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,240
Of course it's right.

219
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,310
Your leadership is brilliant.

220
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,110
Finally, you're talking sense.

221
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,230
By the way,

222
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,360
your wife's business

223
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,160
is doing well.

224
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,940
It made the newspaper.

225
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,600
Come on, drink up.

226
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:36,760
Together.

227
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,800
Interview us?

228
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,510
Yes.

229
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,600
The coverage of you

230
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,680
by foreign journalists

231
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,150
has attracted attention.

232
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,510
It's proof of our city's reform

233
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,510
and ideological development.

234
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,510
[The first adult health products store
in our city opens,]

235
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,290
What do you mean?

236
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:53,390
[causing the attention
of foreign reporters.]

237
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,650
It made the newspaper.

238
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,680
It really did make the newspaper.

239
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,330
May I ask

240
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,390
which one of you is the boss?

241
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:57,720
Her.

242
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,240
Him.

243
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:58,950
Well.

244
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,800
Alright.

245
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,950
Then we'll interview you together.

246
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,810
Yes, together.

247
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,390
May I ask how you two,

248
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,240
as a couple, came up with

249
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,160
the idea of opening

250
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,950
an adult health products store?

251
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,270
We're not a couple.

252
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,060
Right, we're not married.

253
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,830
Then I'd like to ask

254
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,830
why this store

255
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,430
is called ADAN&EVE?

256
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,390
”Adan and Eve“

257
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,560
actually represents men and women.

258
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,600
More importantly,

259
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,730
it represents love.

260
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,750
We Chinese people

261
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,160
are quite reserved

262
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,190
when expressing love

263
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,510
and are not good at expressing it.

264
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:26,990
I

265
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,390
want to use this name

266
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,920
to encourage us

267
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,240
to be bolder

268
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,570
when expressing love.

269
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:33,080
Yes.

270
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,750
Camera.

271
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,669
Bolder.

272
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,630
Okay. Here.

273
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,440
Thank you.

274
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,360
So why did you

275
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,289
open this store?

276
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,150
-Because this is—
-Sir.

277
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,880
You can just stand up straight.

278
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,000
Because this is

279
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,120
a brand new field

280
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,840
and an excellent business opportunity.

281
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,270
More importantly,

282
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,000
it demonstrates

283
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,320
that under reform and opening up,

284
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,510
times are progressing.

285
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,200
Just look at

286
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,960
our products—

287
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,080
Comrade, the line...

288
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,480
Just stand here and speak.

289
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,080
Just take

290
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,200
our products, for example.

291
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,510
They all represent

292
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,090
the rising happiness index

293
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,180
of Chinese people.

294
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,150
So,

295
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,390
under the breeze
of reform and opening up,

296
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,200
we'd like to

297
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,480
be the pioneers of our time.

298
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,390
Put it here.

299
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,270
We'd like to

300
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,800
be the pioneers of our time.

301
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,530
Therefore,

302
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,480
Beiping and I

303
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,080
both coincidentally

304
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,320
opened this store.

305
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,480
Although some people don't understand,

306
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,600
and even have some—

307
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,320
Put it here.

308
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,000
and even have some misunderstandings
about us,

309
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,030
but we will

310
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,120
persevere until the end.

311
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,960
Microphone.

312
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,910
Eventually, they will understand

313
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,600
that we've done something right,

314
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,930
something meaningful.

315
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:30,960
Come.

316
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,680
Thank you.

317
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,360
You spoke so well.

318
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,790
What do you think?

319
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,240
Actually, at first we

320
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,750
wanted to name it
"Nüwa Mends the Sky."

321
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,120
But it was missing a male figure.

322
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,570
Then we thought of naming it
"Pangu Creates the World."

323
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,360
But there were no women inside it,

324
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,480
so we ended up calling it "Adan and Eve."

325
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:50,960
Right.

326
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,210
Now we have both men and women figures.

327
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:56,440

328

Mentor.

332
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:44,960
Why did you

333
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,400
suddenly disappear?

334
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,390
I'm not good at drinking alcohol,

335
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,030
so I went for a walk.

336
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,270
I went back to take a look.

337
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,720
Where?

338
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,750
Under the bridge.

339
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,250
Mentor, do you think it was Crazy Monk?

340
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,270
What do you think?

341
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,150
I originally thought it was him,

342
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,350
but seeing his reaction today...

343
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,600
Are you crazy?

344
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,360
The suspect is already in custody.

345
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,200
Yet you're still obsessing over this.

346
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,350
With your doing,

347
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,720
would the Criminal Police Team
even want you?

348
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,150
I just feel something's not right.

349
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,150
You're not right.

350
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,370
Let me tell you,

351
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,240
I've seen

352
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,390
plenty of people like you,

353
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,510
so obsessed with solving cases,

354
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,570
in the end, none of them turn out well.

355
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,600
These bastards.

356
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,610
They are all actors.

357
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,160
They're all good at acting.

358
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,510
When I was still
in the Criminal Police Team,

359
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,770
there was a colleague,

360
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,000
Mr. Qin.

361
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,530
He was working on a forged signature case.

362
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,870
He investigated for over six months

363
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,670
but couldn't catch the suspect.

364
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,870
One time,

365
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,120
he was delivering documents
to the Director.

366
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,920
After the Director signed them,

367
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,320
he thought the handwriting looked similar.

368
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,450
He tackled the chief

369
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,640
to the ground with one big swing.

370
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,530
On that very day,

371
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,960
I saw myself...

372
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,970
So, I submitted my resignation
to the leader

373
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,200
and left.

374
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,440
In the future,

375
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,080
don't become like that.

376
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,150
Crazy.

377
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,480
Understand?

378
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,710
I understand.

379
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,410
But I still want to investigate it.

380
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,200
You...

381
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,070
You really are

382
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,890
as stubborn as a mule, aren't you?

383
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,340
Let me tell you.

384
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,110
These words of yours—

385
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,000
Just tell me.

386
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,670
Well, I'm

387
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,390
drunk

388
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,400
and will go home to sleep.

389
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,720
And when I wake up,

390
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,670
I'll forget all about it.

391
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,220
Alright, Zhu Dachuan.

392
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,600
You haven't said anything all day.

393
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,450
There's nothing to say.

394
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,270
Fine.

395
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,320
Let's all take a break then.

396
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,080
I just grabbed

397
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,910
a newspaper with me.

398
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,040
Let me read it to you.

399
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,270
This headline—

400
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,960
"Wealthy Woman Found Dead in Cadillac;

401
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,670
the Killer Turns Out
to Be Her New Boyfriend.“

402
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,200
This seems quite relevant to you.

403
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,600
Both involve Cadillacs.

404
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,630
This hardworking woman

405
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,030
who earned money for her boyfriend

406
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,120
never imagined

407
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,080
that her always gentle
and caring boyfriend

408
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,170
would reach out

409
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,370
with his criminal hand at this moment.

410
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,230
Officer,

411
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,030
you need to talk

412
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,000
to the residents around here

413
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,840
properly.

414
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,630
They can't dump garbage here.

415
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,260
Look.

416
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,870
Just fifty meters ahead

417
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,150
is the garbage station.

418
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:41,790
Ms. Du,

419
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,320
we've told them many times.

420
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,670
But now there's talk of demolition,

421
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,270
so everyone cares even less.

422
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,240
Well, how about this?

423
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,970
Take a few people in

424
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,530
and teach them a lesson.

425
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,600
We can't just stand here

426
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,270
catching people who litter.

427
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,440
Then who's going to handle this
if you don't?

428
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,750
These residents around here

429
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,150
don't listen to us at all.

430
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:02,960
Han,

431
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,360
quickly, let's get this cart

432
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:04,870
Got it!

433
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,530
out of here.

434
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,680
This is really frustrating.

435
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,280
What's wrong?

436
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,610
You think solving a big case

437
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,480
means everyone's gotta
treat you like a hero?

438
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,510
But they can't have police officers

439
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,110
guarding garbage every day.

[No Littering]

441
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
From murder cases

00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,970
to picking up trash,

443
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,130
patrol cops have to handle it all.

444
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,090
Slow down.

445
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,550
Take the turn slowly.

446
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,150
Slow down.

447
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,440
Stop!

What instructions do you have now?

453
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,910
You've already caught Crazy Monk.

454
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,960
Are you trying to mess with me now?

455
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960

You can't escape
if you do anything wrong, either.

I need to borrow some people from you.

If they get dirty, Little Erhei will

My poor sister.

She had such a hard life.

497

And her daughter had a tough life, too.

00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,640
This child was so good.

00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,680
She was very well-behaved since childhood,

always asking me for candy.

501
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,640
After eating the candy,

502
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,440
she would save all the wrappers.

503
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,480
She has loved beauty
since she was little.

504
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,160
Her father couldn't afford

00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,440
to buy her new clothes.

506
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,880
So she made them herself.

because she went down the wrong path.

522
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,280
Is that true?

00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,340
Last year, I think.

956
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,190
Didn't we already watch this?

957
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,110
Why are you showing it again?

958
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:00,840
Yeah,

959
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,270
this movie is boring,

960
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,410
long, and terrible.

961
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,140
Watch if you want,
or get out if you don't.

962
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,620
Crazy Monk.

963
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:10,760
Let's go.

964
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,550
What about you? Staying or leaving?

965
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,760
I'm leaving.

966
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,840
I want to go to Shenzhen.

967
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,730
It's close to Hong Kong.

968
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,360
Need money?

969
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,280
Is money all you think about?

970
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,240
I can't bear to leave

971
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,340
just like this.

972
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:26,920
Open up!

973
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,310
Anyone there?

974
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,550
It's me.

975
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,000
So you just

976
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:14,640
let her go like that?

977
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,610
She wanted to keep good memories,

978
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,600
not memories of me being impotent.

979
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,740
Do you know where she went?

980
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:30,290
Who did she go with?

981
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,590
Between us,

982
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:33,920
we never asked
about each other's business.

983
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,000
We just strolled around

984
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,130
and watched movies.

985
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:37,850
What about the day Liu Ke died?

986
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,280
Haven't you already heard it?

987
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,540
I went to buy medicine.

988
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:43,550
After buying it, didn't you test it
on someone?

989
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:45,080
I could test it right there.

990
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,720
I could test it all night.

991
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:21,490
[2012]

992
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,650
Take a look at the calligraphy.

993
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,130
Mentor, he's over here.

994
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:48,800
Have a look?

995
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,110
What's the matter?

996
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,630
How long have you been out?

997
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,540
Two months.

998
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,610
What a coincidence.

999
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:04,700
You just got out,

1000
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,570
and someone committed a crime.

1001
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,260
Just like Zhang Dan's case

1002
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,700
from back then.

1003
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:13,150
Really?

1004
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,600
That is quite a coincidence.

1005
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,680
We saw you on the security camera

1006
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,760
near the crime scene.

1007
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:25,810
Which camera did you see me on?

1008
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,000
Lincui Road.

1009
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:29,210
Little Erhei company, right?

1010
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,000
Yes, I've been there.

1011
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,590
As soon as I got out,
I was planning to deal with him.

1012
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:36,880
But then I saw him

1013
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:39,030
acting like a complete doormat,

1014
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:41,410
bowing and scraping to all those bosses.

1015
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:43,210
I immediately lost interest.

1016
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:44,920
Really.

1017
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:46,550
It was pointless.

1018
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:48,200
Here, have some tea.

1019
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:49,920
I remember

1020
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,360
your old catchphrase was

1021
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,690
"interesting."

1022
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,230
My mother died.

1023
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:01,190
And she didn't even wait for me

1024
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:02,320
to get out of prison.

1025
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,760
My mother died,

1026
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,580
and nothing matters anymore.

1027
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:14,030
Now,

1028
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:16,840
nothing is interesting.
