384
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,160
Tell me,

385
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,720
since things are starting up again
in the hutong,

386
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,510
does this mean even fewer people

387
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,350
will look for my daughter?

388
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,030
We're still looking for her.

389
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,880
What have you found?

390
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,640
He just thinks Crazy Monk is rich,

391
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,960
so he was protecting him.

392
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,070
If I were protecting him,

393
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,400
wouldn't it be better
if I hadn't arrested him at all?

394
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,160
Then ask yourself why.

395
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,790
Just listen now.

396
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,120
No, Mei, it's like this.

397
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,590
We are doing things

398
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,310
according to normal procedure.

399
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,880
We police collect evidence,

400
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,350
and then,

401
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,200
the prosecutor's office supervises us.

402
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,000
Finally, this case

403
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,960
must go to the court

404
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,680
to reach a verdict.

405
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,740
Do you understand?

406
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,200
What procedure?

407
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,020
Don't touch me. Don't push me.

408
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,640
What normal procedure?

409
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,250
You're all protecting him.

410
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,480
Ran Xi, I'm telling you,

411
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,740
we are protecting him.

412
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,550
There's no normal procedure!

413
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,950
What exactly do you want?

414
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,550
We want a new community officer!

415
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,000
That's right.

416
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,090
What are you doing?

417
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,030
Am I wrong?

418
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,040
What's going on?

419
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,100
What did I do?

420
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,330
Did I anything wrong?

421
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,720
If you can't do the job, get out.

422
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,440
Look at him.

423
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,830
Look how bad his attitude is.

424
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,290
Did you see that? How rude!

425
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,640
Don't push me.

426
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,750
Let me tell you.

427
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,510
Did you say anything?

428
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,720
Our child is missing.

429
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:21,750
[Outstanding Organization]

430
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,680
Where did you go?

431
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,520
Did you do what I asked you to do?

432
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,720
There's another incident in our hutong.

433
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,920
I went to check it out.

434
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,450
Did your captain ask you to go?

435
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,100
I went on my own.

436
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,270
Nobody asked you to go,

437
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,400
but you went anyway?

438
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,120
Who do you think you are?

439
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,020
When you left,
who's going to file these documents?

440
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,440
Where are the files

441
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,200
I asked you to deliver?

442
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,400
Did you deliver them?

443
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,640
I'm here to solve cases,

444
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,640
not to do odd jobs.

445
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,040
Without me,
these cases wouldn't get solved?

446
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,650
I'm asking you,

447
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,280
will you deliver them or not?

448
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,350
I can't do it!

449
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,000
No one is allowed to
help him deliver them.

450
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,720
Listen,

451
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,290
deliver them right now!

452
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,240
Otherwise,

453
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,040
I guarantee
you won't work as a detective anymore.

454
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,040
There was a child, seven years old.

455
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,400
He got sick and took medicine.

456
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,000
His parents had to go to work,

457
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,970
so they left him with the neighbors
next door

458
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,290
—an old man

459
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,640
and a blind old woman.

460
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,720
Then at night,

461
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,860
that old man killed the child.

462
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,410
He hung the child's corpse
from the roof beam.

463
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,960
And then he ran away.

464
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,110
I've been hunting that old man,

465
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:10,970
for many years,

466
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,240
but I just couldn't find him.

467
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,720
Someone said he appeared by the river.

468
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,360
So I often walk by the river
when I have time.

469
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,010
It's become a habit.

470
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,070
That was

471
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,270
my first case.

472
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,660
What happened after that?

473
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,510
Later,

474
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,720
I couldn't find him.

475
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,440
My mentor couldn't find him either.

476
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:46,790
I asked my mentor

477
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,200
why.

478
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,720
My mentor said

479
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,370
solving cases is about finding clues

480
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,280
and evidence.

481
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,070
Don't ask why.

482
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,480
If you do,

483
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,690
you'll walk into a dead end,

484
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:01,890
with no way out.

485
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,200
Many things

486
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,090
have no explanations.

487
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,910
Even the best detectives

488
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,170
have mysteries they can't solve.

489
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,680
It's impossible to solve

490
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,740
every single case.

491
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,610
If we can't solve it,

492
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,240
we have to accept it.

493
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,160
I don't accept that.

494
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,030
I'm-

495
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,480
not saying we should give up now

496
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,310
or stop trying to solve the case.

497
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,130
What I mean is

498
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,550
that we should try our best.

499
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,000
But

500
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,910
we also need to let go, right?

501
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,200
You can't let go yourself,
yet you're telling me to?

502
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,110
If I couldn't let go,

503
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,590
I would still be working
as a criminal police officer.

504
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,320
I would keep obsessing over it,

505
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,040
and I'd definitely go crazy.

506
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,310
I've seen many police officers
who couldn't solve cases

507
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,160
and ended up going insane.

508
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,820
There are plenty of examples.

509
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,920
I just didn't want to end up like that,

510
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,920
so I voluntarily asked to step down.

511
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,940
That's not letting go.

512
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,600
That's running away.

513
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,510
Never mind my reasons.

514
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,640
I just want to tell you,

515
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,550
sometimes,

516
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,300
whether it's cases

517
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,590
or other matters,

518
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,740
you can't obsess and struggle with them.

519
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,440
For each case,

520
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,440
we handle it seriously.

521
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,920
We solve whichever ones we can.

522
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,380
Isn't that the principle?

523
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,870
Solve whichever ones we can?

524
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,190
But I want to
solve this particular one now.

525
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,440
This is what we call being stubborn,

526
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,070
you know?

527
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,700
I want to file a report with Captain Song.

528
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,790
Mentor,

529
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,490
I want to be transferred back.

530
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,400
Are you

531
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,280
joking with me?

532
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,000
The Criminal Police Team
and police station

533
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,510
aren't owned by your family!

534
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,510
You think you can come and go

535
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,680
as you please?

536
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,790
You think you can split it up,
even if you want to?

537
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,250
Mentor.

538
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,170
Don't touch me.

539
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,090
Come on, follow me.

540
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,070
Don't pull me.

541
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,060
Just follow me.

542
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,240
Mentor.

543
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,030
Follow me.

544
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,750
Let's go. Come on.

545
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,510
Come on.

546
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,620
Come on.

547
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,730
Look at this.

548
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,390
Come here.

549
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,200
Come.

550
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,230
Look.

551
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,250
What kind of place is this?

552
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,790
I tried so hard

553
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,310
to send you to the Criminal Police Team.

554
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,030
But you're determined to come back,
is that it?

555
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:23,830
If you come back,

556
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,230
you'll be stuck here,

557
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,200
in this dead end.

558
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,200
There's no way out of here, you know?

559
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,750
I can walk out.

560
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,960
Fine. Show me how.

561
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,510
Go ahead.

562
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,460
Come on.

563
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,350
Go.

564
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,250
Come on.

565
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:02,840
Try again.

566
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,270
Come on.

567
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,360
Go ahead.

568
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,750
If you're so tough,

569
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,650
go ahead and knock that wall down.

570
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,160
Go for it.

571
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,510
All you know is charging blindly.

572
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,750
If you come back here,

573
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,480
you'll spend your entire life

574
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,430
stuck here with no way out.

575
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,240
I can get out!

576
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,450
Go ahead.

577
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,030
Charge!

578
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,720
Always charging.

579
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,720
I can get out!

580
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,200
I can get out!

581
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,480
I can get out!

582
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,240
Sister,

583
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,440
she has been lying in a coma

584
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,440
for 7 or 8 days now.

585
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,900
Is she not going to wake up?

586
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,060
Do we have to care for her forever?

587
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,640
You've eaten all of

588
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,270
your sister's supplements!

589
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,720
Shut your mouth!

590
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,480
They were just here.

591
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,080
She can't even eat it anyway.

592
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,640
I was afraid they'd expire
and go to waste.

593
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,110
Sister.

594
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,160
She is awake!

595
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,190
Doctor!

596
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:18,820
Doctor!

597
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,950
[Yanchuan People's Hospital]

598
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,740
Tall or short?

599
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,480
Long face or round face?

600
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,010
What was he wearing?

601
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,070
Long hair

602
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,400
or short hair?

603
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,480
He was always staying behind me.

604
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,310
That red dot you mentioned earlier,

605
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,150
what was that?

606
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:39,790
It's...

607
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:40,790
Well..

608
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,210
Well...

609
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,960
I don't know.

610
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,650
It was just a red dot,

611
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,310
flickering back and forth under my skirt.

612
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,170
back and forth.

613
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,930
A laser pointer.

614
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,210
Yes.

615
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:51,720
Yes.

616
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:52,480
Yes.

617
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,810
A laser pointer.

618
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,310
You work at the electronics factory?

619
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,960
What do you do there?

620
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,440
Electronic components.

621
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,440
I test speakers

622
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,400
by using

623
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,950
hearing aids

624
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,960
to check if there are any unusual sounds
in the speakers.

625
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,880
Then your hearing should be excellent.

626
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,010
Yet you didn't hear anyone behind you?

627
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,720
Yes,

628
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,310
we all have our hearing tested,

629
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,170
and mine is exceptionally sharp.

630
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,890
He made no sound.

631
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,160
That hutong was so quiet,

632
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,570
is it possible he walked without a sound?

633
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,770
He was totally silent,

634
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,920
like a ghost.

635
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,400
Hold these documents carefully.

636
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,160
Don't leave anything behind.

637
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:41,750
Wang Lei？

638
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,030
Let's go.

639
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:43,510
Okay.

640
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:46,830
Zhao,

641
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,590
has the water and electricity
at home been cut off?

642
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,270
Oh, I forgot.

643
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,750
You live in the dormitory, right?

644
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,270
That's perfect.

645
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,790
Come on, go on a business trip with me.

646
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,400
Where to?

647
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,070
Shanxi.

648
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:56,630
Shanxi...

649
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,510
What? Do you have something else to do?

650
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,480
When can I come back?

651
00:32:59,480 --> 00:32:59,880
Well,

652
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,310
everyone has their own family matters
to deal with.

653
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:01,790
But...

654
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,000
This is what we do
in the Criminal Police Team.

655
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,070
Ready to set off at any moment.

656
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,160
Come on, you need to get used to it.

657
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,560
Hurry.

658
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,680
I can't go.

659
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,680
What do you mean?

660
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,880
I really can't go.

661
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,080
Then give me a reason.

662
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:19,870
Captain Song,

663
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,070
there's been another incident
in the hutong case.

664
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,070
I can't leave now.

665
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,240
You foolish kid!

666
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,960
The case you'd be working on this time

667
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,270
is also a major case, you know?

668
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,000
It's robbery

669
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:29,960
in Zhejiang Village,

670
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,030
with four people murdered.

671
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,240
The killer is now delivering goods
in Shanxi.

672
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,200
We've located his hideout.

673
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,920
We need to act fast.

674
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,270
But this case is a serial one.

675
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:35,680
Now...

676
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,200
Why don't you go work in the archives?

677
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,000
It's full of unsolved cases there.

678
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,800
Captain Song,

679
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,310
I just want to go back

680
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,440
and follow up on some leads.

681
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,970
If you go back,
don't bother coming back here.

682
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,530
The cases are piling up.

683
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,760
I can't avoid it.

684
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,110
There are so many other cases.

685
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,440
What about these cases?

686
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,590
There are several stabbing victims too.

687
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,590
What should we do?

688
00:33:59,640 --> 00:33:59,960
Look,

689
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,880
if you can't solve this case,

690
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,350
what then?

691
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,070
Will you spend your whole life on it?

692
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:03,590
There are dozens,

693
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,790
hundreds of cases waiting for us.

694
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:05,480
If everyone were like you,

695
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,740
we might just shut down the police force.

696
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:10,159
But I must solve this particular case.

697
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,190
Fine.

698
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,590
I'll grant your wish.

699
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,120
Go back to the local station

700
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,850
and continue your investigation there.

701
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,800
I'm sorry, Captain Song.

702
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,639
You're not letting me down.

703
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,239
You're letting yourself down.

704
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,090
You're just

705
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,480
simply beyond help.

706
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,600
Be careful out there.

707
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,370
Get to work.

708
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,450
When I leave this hutong someday,

709
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,000
I'll write you a letter.

710
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,230
And when you see that letter,

711
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,590
you'll remember tonight

712
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,530
and think of me.

713
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,230
By then I should be
in the Criminal Police Team.

714
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,110
After the exams,

715
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,360
I want to go out and travel.

716
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,290
Let's go.

717
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,280
Let's go now.

718
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,700
No need to wait.

719
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,670
It's late, no one will see us.

720
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:47,780
Come on.

721
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:27,780
Tian Chang.

722
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,760
Where are we?

723
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,930
I don't know either.

724
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,250
It's beautiful.

725
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,050
Do you remember

726
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,400
those math problems from childhood

727
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,000
about calculating
when two people would meet?

728
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,110
Three, two, one,

729
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,510
go!

730
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,320
Ready, march!

731
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:58,480
Wait!

732
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,150
Your steps aren't in sync.

733
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,480
Your steps need to be together,

734
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,280
so only one sound should be heard.

735
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,210
Let's try again.

736
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,760
March!

737
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,670
We've all had our hearing tested,

738
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,270
our hearings are excellent.

739
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,130
He made no noise.

740
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,620
He was totally silent,

741
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,630
like a ghost.

742
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,930
-89.
-87

743
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,670
-105.
-112.

744
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,760
150.

745
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:20,800
Again.

746
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,760
-15.
-16.

747
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,110
-47.
-47.

748
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,630
Let's celebrate.

749
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:49,840
Our first name...

750
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,970
It was named Pan Gu Creating the World.

751
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,800
There were no women in it.

752
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,150
We finally chose the name "Adam and Eve".

753
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:56,590
Right,

754
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,550
then there are both a man and a woman.

755
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,710
I see, so that's how it was.

756
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:00,670
I'd like to ask

757
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:01,880
when you opened this shop,

758
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,480
did your family support you?

759
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:05,600
They did.

760
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:09,440
My-

761
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,460
my husband is a police officer.

762
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,550
He's very busy with his work,

763
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,570
but he's extremely supportive of me.

764
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,870
He even told me

765
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,320
that we should embrace

766
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,660
the winds of reform and opening up.

767
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,050
Without his support,

768
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,150
I wouldn't have been able to

769
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:29,010
make my business what it is today.

770
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,010
And my son

771
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,880
is about to
take the College Entrance Exam.

772
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,610
I really hope

773
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:35,230
he gets good results.

774
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,320
Good to hear that.

775
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,400
I wish your son

776
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,660
success in his exams.

777
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,480
And thank you both for the interview,

778
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,230
thank you.

779
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,300
I wish your business prosperity.

780
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,380
Now, let's turn our attention
to another piece of news.

781
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,400
When I was little,

782
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:17,130
my dad and I used to play this game too.

783
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,850
I was quite happy back then.

784
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:24,030
Then why do you want to leave now?

785
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:30,510
Why were you crying that day?

786
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,150
Because

787
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,070
I kept blinking.

788
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,400
What?

789
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,880
You can't blink during a fight.

790
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,880
Why can't you blink

791
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,960
during a fight?

792
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,970
Your reactions get slower.

793
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:48,280
Have you learned how to do it now?

794
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:48,940
Yes, I have.

795
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:49,750
Look at me.

796
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:57,290
I didn't blink, right?

797
00:43:58,670 --> 00:43:59,770
You just blinked!

798
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,250
That was a sneak attack!

799
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,240
Sneak attacks don't count!

800
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:14,930
I didn't blink, right?

801
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:16,530
Doesn't count.

802
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,890
Let's try again.

803
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:22,870
Doesn't count. Let's try again.

804
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:24,760
Again.

805
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:27,970
Doesn't count.

806
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:37,510
You really didn't blink.
