Gaokao is just around the corner.

382

Everything else

383
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,930
should be put aside for now.

384
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,770
I'm your homeroom teacher;

385
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:13,720
if something were to happen,

386
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,440
I couldn't take the responsibility.

387
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,920
That's why I called your parents.

388
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,980
Do you understand?

389
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,240
Mr. Chen,

390
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,250
you know my family situation.

391
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,750
If they come to school,

392
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,880
do you think
things will stay calm for you?

393
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,470
This is my problem alone.

394
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,840
I don't want to affect the other students.

395
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,920
I won't run away again.

396
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,180
Is that okay, Mr. Chen?

397
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,510

398
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,110
I won't trouble you anymore.

399
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,320
I absolutely won't run away.

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,100
You've always been a top student.

But I just don't understand

403
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,970
what could be more important than Gaokao?

404
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,160

Your future...

408
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,300
Your future is what lies ahead of you.

409
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,760
What if I don't have a future?

410
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,590
Nonsense.

why I ran away from home.
