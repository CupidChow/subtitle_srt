[BLEND FEELINGS Episode 11]

2
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,370
We can talk now.

3
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,150
How's it going on your end?

4
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,750
Nothing suspicious so far.

5
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,160
They seem quite loving.

6
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,490
Keep a close eye on them.

7
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,400
By the way, Director Gu approached me.

8
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,730
What did he want?

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,380
He offered me 100,000 yuan

10
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,530
to help him find

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,020
some book called the Eight Methods here.

12
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:00,940
Ignore him.

13
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,570
Yes, understood.

14
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,390
From now on, let's use
the incense I made.

15
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,370
But Chairman Gu paid a high price
for that benzoin incense.

16
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,400
We shouldn't waste it.

17
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,960
I'm Chairman Gu's girlfriend now.

18
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,840
I decide what incense we use.

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,920
Then I'll go change it.

20
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:45,039
How is it? My Calming Scent smells nice,
doesn't it?

21
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,240
You'll definitely sleep well tonight.

22
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,250
The Calming Scent does help,

23
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,850
but you also need to create
a good sleeping environment.

24
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:56,650
Like what?

25
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:58,060
For example, both your smell and hearing

26
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,820
should be relaxed.

27
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,910
Try not to think about anything.

28
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,870
Imagine you're lying on a cloud.

29
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,680
Have you ever lain on a cloud?

30
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,510
It's just a figure of speech.

31
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,260
Alright, good night, Chairman Gu.

32
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,660
Don't turn off the light.

33
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,470
But that will affect your sleep.

34
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,700
You're afraid of the dark?

35
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,920
Clause 7, don't ask questions
you shouldn't.

36
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,500
I'll put the lamp here then.

37
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,980
That way there's light in the room

38
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,180
but it's still a distance away from you.

39
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,840
Alright.

40
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,720
Get some sleep.

41
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,320
Good night, Chairman Gu.

42
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:39,700
Boss.

43
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,329
The Hong Kong incense maker
was indeed bribed.

44
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:44,460
I found some records
from 3 months ago.

45
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,510
That person transferred one million to him

46
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,970
through an offshore bank.

47
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,600
He added cocklebur
to your benzoin incense.

48
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,100
Boss.

49
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,750
Should I go teach him a lesson?

50
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,610
Always strike the vital spot.

51
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,570
This matter isn't worth mentioning.

52
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,000
He just took money
and did what he was paid to do.

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,040
The game between me and that person
has only just begun.

54
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,390
Understood.

55
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,140
What's the situation with Gu Jiacheng
and Ma Qingqing now?

56
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,880
Everything is going according to our plan.

57
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,680
They're meeting for afternoon tea
at a cafÃ© today.

58
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,090
Where is Jian Xiangxiang?

59
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,400
Hello, here's your coffee.

60
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,000
Thank you.

61
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,210
Chairman Gu's iced Americano.

62
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,840
Mr. Gao's iced latte.

63
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,100
Ms. Ma's hot flat white.

64
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,570
You'll live a life of wealth and peace.

65
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,360
But...

66
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,990
You're missing something.

67
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,010
What am I missing?

68
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,480
You're missing me.

69
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,840
Qingqing.

70
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,550
I really like you.

71
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,120
Since the moment I saw you.

72
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,770
That jerk is about to deceive
another innocent girl.

73
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,410
No way.

74
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,650
I have to expose him.

75
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,080
Gu Jiacheng is such a player.
I dislike him more and more.

76
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,950
Jerk and mean girl,
stay chained together.

77
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,950
Don't break out and harm innocents.

78
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,120
Calm down! Don't get involved yourself.

79
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,180
The mess will take care of itself.
Let the toxic girl handle the toxic guy.

80
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,790
Be my girlfriend, okay?

81
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,720
Let me think about it.

82
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,440
I'll give you 3 seconds to think,

83
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,400
3, 2, 1!

84
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,680
Who does that?

85
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,040
Say yes, please?

86
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,490
Fine, go ahead.

87
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,880
That's my turf.

88
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,920
Don't worry.

89
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,830
Give me a kiss.

90
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,480
Jiacheng.

91
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,730
What are you doing here?

92
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,690
Who is she?

93
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,930
She's my secretary.

94
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,440
We can talk about work back at the office.

95
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,040
This is my personal time now.

96
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,360
Who is she?

97
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,990
I'm Jiacheng's girlfriend, Ma Qingqing.

98
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,330
Is that true?

99
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,540
Qingqing, just ignore her.

100
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,380
Let's go.

101
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,070
Gu Jiacheng, if she's your girlfriend,

102
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:23,990
then what am I?

103
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,240
After all this time we've been together,

104
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,500
what does that make me?

105
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:30,930
You're crazy.

106
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,970
Qingqing, no, Qingqing, listen to me!

107
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:34,960
It's not like that.

108
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,550
I dealt with Jian Xiangxiang for you.

109
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,400
I did so many dirty things for you!

110
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,080
Are you out of your mind?

111
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,120
Are you out of your mind?

112
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,480
Are you

113
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,409
out of your mind?

114
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,920
Doctor, is the report out?

115
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,390
Due to this miscarriage,

116
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,650
there's been some damage to your uterus.

117
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,210
This may affect your ability
to have children in the future.

118
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,590
Will I still be able to get pregnant?

119
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
It will be difficult.

120
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,169
Assisted reproductive techniques
may be required.

121
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,760
Okay.

122
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,940
Someone wants to talk to you.

123
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,690
I know everything about you and Jiacheng.

124
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,560
This matter ends here.

125
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,240
I've transferred 500,000 yuan
to your account.

126
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,500
I hope you'll take the hint and accept it.

127
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:54,840
And him?

128
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,730
Jiacheng doesn't want to see you.

129
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,130
Take the money and you two are done.

130
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,760
Boss, haven't you considered

131
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,230
what would happen if Miss Jian

132
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,190
doesn't expose this matter?

133
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,780
Back then, she'd rather destroy
Kunshan Jade

134
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,830
than let Gu Jiacheng have his way.

135
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,120
I could tell

136
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,790
she's definitely not
the kind to be bullied.

137
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,870
Even the gentlest rabbit,

138
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,420
once backed into a corner,

139
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,560
will bare its sharpest claws

140
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,920
and learn to fight back.

141
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,480
You truly understand people.

142
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,360
Tomorrow, as always,

143
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,960
don't let anyone disturb me.

144
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,310
But what about the old man...

145
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,090
Ignore him.

146
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,350
Still working this late?

147
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,280
I'm heading out.

148
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,950
Quick, come look! Something big happened!

149
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,120
There's a post online

150
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,910
saying that Yaoge Group's heir

151
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,750
is ruthless

152
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,860
and a total player.

153
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,810
Ms. Lin wrote this.

154
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,400
She used to date Director Gu?

155
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,510
Look at this part.

156
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,460
Director Gu resents Chairman Gu.

157
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,660
He's been desperate to take his place.

158
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,390
Going public like this might hurt him,

159
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,230
but it'll hurt Ms. Lin too.

160
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,740
Poor Ms. Lin.

161
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,910
What a jerk.

162
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,520
Grandpa.

163
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,830
That woman is talking nonsense.

164
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,030
She's slandering me!

165
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:40,060
Dad, Jiacheng may be immature,

166
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,950
but he's not a bad person at heart.

167
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,390
Grandpa. I respect Uncle Jingshi so much,

168
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,070
how could I possibly hurt him?

169
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,750
Dad.

170
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,590
Please give Jiacheng another chance.

171
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,720
He's been working really hard lately.

172
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,820
That's enough.

173
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,820
Jiacheng, starting now,

174
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,750
you're suspended for 6 months.

175
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,080
Take this time to reflect on your actions.

176
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,250
Grandpa.

177
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,330
Don't you think you're being biased?

178
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,380
My father is the eldest son.

179
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,060
-Why does everything go to Uncle Jingshi?
-Shut up!

180
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:12,600
No.

181
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,220
No, Dad.

182
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,820
Please don't be angry.

183
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,940
I know Jingshi is more capable than me.

184
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,460
He's managed the company well,

185
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,260
and I truly respect him for that.

186
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,230
Dad.

187
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,680
Can you stop being such a pushover?

188
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,990
All of you, get out. I need some peace.

189
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,210
Leave it alone.

190
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,170
I'll talk to him.

191
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,460
Jiacheng.

192
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,990
Let's talk.

193
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,900
Dad.

194
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,240
Don't you feel

195
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,800
that we have absolutely no status

196
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,360
at Yaoge Group right now?

197
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,120
Do you really want to spend

198
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,370
your whole life under Gu Jingshi's heel?

199
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,170
Jiacheng.

200
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,850
Accept your fate.
Stop fighting with Uncle Jingshi.

201
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,360
When your grandpa calms down,

202
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,820
I'll plead with him again,

203
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,910
and make sure you
return to the Fragrance Department.

204
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:54,730
Old man.

205
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,240
I couldn't care less
about the Fragrance Department.

206
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,600
I want the entire Yaoge Group.

207
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,880
If you want to settle,
that's your business.

208
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,800
I, Gu Jiacheng, will never settle.

209
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,200
Jiacheng.

210
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,840
[Sir]

211
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,790
Hello, Sir.

212
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,580
What do you need me to do?

213
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,360
Jian Xiangxiang ruined
my plans again and again.

214
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,420
Find an opportunity to get rid of her.

215
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,820
Understood.
