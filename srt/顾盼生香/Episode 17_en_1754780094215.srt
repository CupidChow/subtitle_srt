2
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,360
Mr. Li.

3
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:53,900
Hello.

4
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,500
I'm Jian Xiangxiang,
a perfumer from Yaoge Group.

5
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,130
I've visited you many times before,

6
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,990
but never had the luck to meet you.

7
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:00,940
What do you want?

8
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,720
I heard you have some Benzoin fragrance.

9
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,480
Would you be willing to part with it

10
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,720
and sell me a little?

11
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,320
Mr. Li,

12
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:15,170
I really need this Benzoin fragrance.

13
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,660
Would you...

14
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:18,690
I'm very busy.

15
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,780
Please don't bother me.

16
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,680
If you don't leave now,
I'll call the police.

17
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,530
But I...

18
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:35,890
Hello, Mr. Li.

19
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,590
I'm Gu Jingshi.

20
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,440
What? Even the boss came in person?

21
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,250
From what I know,

22
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,920
15 years ago at an auction in Hong Kong,

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,530
you missed out on something
you really loved.

24
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,520
What are you getting at?

25
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:57,960
I'd like to offer you this "Fleuron"
in exchange for a little Benzoin fragrance.

26
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,960
Would you consider it?

27
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,050
Are you serious?

28
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,010
That's amazing.

29
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,460
With this ingredient,

30
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,329
Glittering Stars & the Moon
will be absolutely perfect.

31
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:25,660
Is that necklace particularly valuable?

32
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,190
Why else would Mr. Li
agree to give it to us?

33
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,700
It's nothing compared to you.

34
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,350
It's a reward.

35
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,810
Glittering Stars & the Moon
is officially available for pre-order now.

36
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,490
[Live Stream Data]

37
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,880
Pre-order numbers are climbing.

38
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,380
These numbers are incredible.

39
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,520
It's getting a lot of attention online.

40
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,570
Looks like everyone's really excited
about our new product.

41
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,910
Now, many up-and-coming influencers

42
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,310
are extremely satisfied with our product.

43
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,630
Chairman Gu, look.

44
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,720
A fresh spring breeze
hits you right in the face.

45
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,720
To me,

46
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,460
it smells like first love.

47
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,110
Delicate floral notes blended
with elegant woody tonesâ€”

48
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,840
long-lasting and innovative.

49
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,320
Definitely collector-worthy.

50
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,180
I don't have fancy words for it.

51
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,650
I'll just say two: buy it.

52
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,080
Glittering Stars & the Moon has broken

53
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,010
our ten-year record
for best pre-sale performance.

54
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,360
Congrats on your perfume's big success.

55
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,660
Thank you.

56
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,570
A Double Seventh Festival gift for you.

57
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,830
Open it and take a look.

58
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,420
Do you like it?

59
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,000
Huh?

60
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,680
I remember

61
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,800
the necklace you gave to Li Nanguang

62
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,120
also had an X mark on it.

63
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,180
Does it have any special meaning?

64
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,980
My mother's name was Xia Hanzhi.

65
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,990
This was her favorite set of jewelry.

66
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,520
Each piece has its own unique mark.

67
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,280
Are you really okay

68
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,780
with giving me this bracelet?

69
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,130
If these pieces just stay in a safe,

70
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,960
they're just cold objects.

71
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,040
But if they're with you,

72
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,810
they'll take on new meaning.

73
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,000
I will treasure this bracelet forever,

74
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,090
just like I treasure our love.

75
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,960
Where are you going?

76
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,160
You're awake?

77
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,080
I'm going to work.

78
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,440
So Miss Jian, you're not going to
take responsibility for me?

79
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,030
Come on, don't be like that.

80
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,560
Let's go have breakfast.

81
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,140
Let's go have breakfast.

82
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,890
I need to take this call.

83
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,560
Hello, what is it?

84
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,310
Boss, something happened to Miss Jian.

85
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,970
She's on the trending topics.

86
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,310
A scheming girl from the slums

87
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,210
used her charms to come between
an uncle and his nephew.

88
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,360
According to online sources,

89
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,200
Miss J and Young Mr. G
had a campus romance,

90
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,060
but she quickly hooked up
with a richer big shot.

91
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,640
To get rid of Young Mr. G,

92
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,330
she even framed him
and had him thrown in jail.

93
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,220
She's basically a modern-day Jezebel.

94
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,280
I know.

95
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,120
That's definitely Director Gu
from Yaoge Group

96
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,500
and his girlfriend Jian Xiangxiang.

97
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,670
She's a perfumer.

98
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,820
Are you an insider?

99
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,040
Please share the gossip, I want the tea.

100
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,860
Big Mr. G is quite an untouchable figure.

101
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,860
This woman is obviously a gold digger,

102
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,120
stopping at nothing for money and power.

103
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,720
Disgusting.

104
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,800
We boycott all perfumes
developed by this gold digger.

105
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,290
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

106
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,820
I'm not afraid.

107
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,110
The innocent will be cleared.

108
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,720
It's just that

109
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,280
this clearly targets me.

110
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,270
Gu Jiacheng is in detention;

111
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,810
Lin Shasha is in a mental hospital.

112
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,090
So it's unlikely to be either of them.

113
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,070
It must be someone very close to him.

114
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,890
This isn't Gu Shenshi's style either.

115
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,040
Who could it possibly be?

116
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,740
It was Li Fang.

117
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,570
Li Fang?

118
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,920
We'll find out once we investigate.

119
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,690
Contact the platform to remove
the trending topic and related posts,

120
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,930
and trace the instigator behind this.

121
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,810
Don't worry. I'm here for you.
