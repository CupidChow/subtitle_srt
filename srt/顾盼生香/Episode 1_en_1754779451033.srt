[Episode 1]

2
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:48,750
You're awake?

3
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,330
Let's play a game.

4
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,210
The rules are simple.

5
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,740
Whoever kills the other

6
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,940
gets to leave alive.

7
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,610
One lives, one dies.

8
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,770
The game...

9
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,090
starts!

10
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:13,610
Gu Jingshi,

11
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,450
you pretended to be lame all these years

12
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,490
just to bait me.

13
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,570
Now that you're dying
by your own woman's hand,

14
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,570
it's exactly what you deserve.

15
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,759
Don't hate me.

16
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,530
What?

17
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,450
You came back early
without telling Gu Jiacheng,

18
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,009
just to spend his birthday with him?

19
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:53,140
That's right, Wang.

20
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,720
I wanted to surprise him
while he was away.

21
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,690
Don't you think he'll be super happy

22
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:00,890
when he sees all this?

23
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,370
Where's my earring?

24
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,410
Found it.

25
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,850
I've got to go now, bye.

26
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,000
Jiacheng,

27
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,470
I love you more and more every day.

28
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,250
By the way,

29
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,570
when are you going to

30
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,570
come clean to Jian Xiangxiang?

31
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,890
What's the rush?

32
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,750
I just got the Kunshan Jade from her.

33
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,910
Let me drain her dry first.

[Jian's Fragrance Making]

35
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,110
What's this?

36
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,810
It smells so good.

37
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,190
It's a traditional scent
I developed with Grandpa.

38
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,110
With this,

39
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,530
Jian's Fragrance will surely be restored

40
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,850
to its former glory.

41
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,090
What's it called?

42
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,650
It's called Kunshan Jade.

43
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,870
Kunshan Jade?

44
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,050
When you're done having your fun,
break up with her.

45
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,579
Don't forget your promise.

46
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,329
Don't worry.

47
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,510
She only knows some

48
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,030
lowly incense making skills.

49
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,760
In every other way,

50
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,590
she's mine to control.

51
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,530
Let me ask you,

52
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,410
after being with her for so long,

53
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,400
haven't you developed
any feelings for her?

54
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,079
What are you thinking?

55
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,250
If not for the Jian family's
secret fragrance manual,

56
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,810
the Eight Methods of Fragrance,

57
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,130
there's no way
I'd be putting up with this.

58
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,210
Honestly,

59
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,350
when I'm with her,

60
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,850
all I can think about is you.

61
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:37,830
What's that sound?

62
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:38,650
Don't worry about it.

63
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,580
Let's continue.

64
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,770
Catching her boyfriend cheating
with her own eyes? That's brutal.

65
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,630
What else can she do but endure it?

66
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,180
Scumbag Gu Jiacheng is the young heir
of a group,

67
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,410
while Jian Xiangxiang
is just an ordinary girl.

68
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,400
What's happening?

69
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,100
Could it be a hallucination
after the electric shock?

70
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:08,780
Who...

71
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,490
Who are you?

72
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,850
Us? We're just bullet comments here
for the drama.

73
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,430
Bullet comments?

74
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,980
What bullet comments?

75
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,650
Let me show you a way out.

76
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,110
Make Gu Jiacheng's
Third Uncle fall for you,

77
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,170
become his woman,

78
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,300
and only then can you change your fate.

79
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,810
The Third Uncle's woman?

80
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,980
You mean Gu Jingshi, the real head

81
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,050
of Yaoge Group?

82
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,210
Don't be ridiculous. Her?

83
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:49,970
Gu Jingshi may be lame, but he's no fool.

84
00:05:59,090 --> 00:05:59,990
It's a hallucination.

85
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,450
It must be a hallucination.

86
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,490
Whether it is or not, you'll see.

87
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,210
In three months,
this scumbag couple in bed

88
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,410
will have you sent to a mental hospital.

89
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,190
Wait.

90
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,370
Why are you back?

91
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,350
Is this a surprise inspection?

92
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,650
Don't touch me.

93
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,190
Gu Jiacheng,

94
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,290
you said you'd never hurt me

95
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,920
and betray me.

96
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,930
But you act like a prudeâ€”

97
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,290
not letting me touch you or anything.

98
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,690
I'm a man.

99
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,190
About this situation,

100
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,110
you can only blame yourself.

101
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,190
Well,

102
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,660
a love triangle

103
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,640
can actually be pretty fun.

104
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,530
You're shameless.

105
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:31,650
Who's that?

106
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,280
Jiacheng, who is that?

107
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:34,930
It's nothing.

108
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,900
Just the TV.

109
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,180
Stop crying.

110
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,590
Hurry up and win over Gu Jingshi.

111
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,090
Stop making noise!
Stop making noise! Stop it!

112
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,850
All of you, get out! Get out!

113
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:02,650
Exactly!

114
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,530
How can someone in a wheelchair
be a big shot?

115
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,860
He's a business genius.

116
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What are these?

117
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,010
His lame leg is just a cover
to lure out his enemies.

118
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,140
Just wait, the real show is yet to come.

119
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,100
Ma'am,

120
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,620
can you see

121
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,180
all these words around us?

122
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,390
Are you crazy?

123
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,460
I'm not!

124
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,080
Scumbag Gu Jiacheng is scared stiff
when he sees him,

125
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,480
like a mouse seeing a cat,

126
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,539
ready to get crushed at any moment.

127
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,130
You made me interested in him.

128
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,860
I'd love to date such a big shot.

129
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,100
Go for it, you coward.

130
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,490
Still crying?
You're gonna get hit by a car.

131
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,650
A car?

132
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,450
Oh my god.

133
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,930
If I hadn't dodged early,
I'd have been hit.

134
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,840
The words I saw earlier
actually came true.

135
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,090
Chairman Gu.

136
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,250
Chairman Gu!

137
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,410
Chairman Gu!

138
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,390
Chairman Gu,
do you have to be so ruthless?

139
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,970
The former Chairman Gu
was always polite to us.

140
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,280
You can't just clean house
when there's a new boss.

141
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,780
As you just said,

142
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,450
"Clean house when there's a new boss."

143
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,620
You...

144
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,510
It's him.
