[BLEND FEELINGS Episode 23]

2
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:39,710
Oh it's you, Jingshi.

3
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,039
The butler said you wanted to see me.

4
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,520
Go see Lawyer Jiang tomorrow.

5
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,289
I've already transferred all my shares

6
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,940
to you.

7
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,700
Only now

8
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,940
do I realize how terribly wrong I was.

9
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,010
I always wanted to maintain a balance
between you brothers,

10
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,680
hoping you would get along harmoniously.

11
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,000
But I never expected

12
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,480
it would lead to this bitter outcome.

13
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,760
Jingshi,

14
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,970
can you forgive your father?

15
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,090
You know very well in your heart

16
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,240
everything that Gu Shenshi has done.

17
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,890
But you still chose to lie to yourself

18
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:35,850
to keep the peace.

19
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,570
No, no.

20
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,000
The person you should apologize to
was never me,

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,960
but my mother.

22
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,620
I have no right to decide whether
she should forgive you or not.

23
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,840
Jingshi.

24
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,010
Please stop hating me.

25
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,400
Jingshi!

26
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,260
I've always been interested in traditional
Chinese culture since I was a kid;

27
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:49,540
[Qingcheng]

28
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,510
especially scent culture.

29
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,260
As the founder of Qingcheng,

30
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,210
did you face any challenges
during development?

31
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,829
There were quite a few.

32
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,579
First was the selection
of raw ingredients.

33
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,180
We had to ensure all ingredients
were of high quality

34
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,980
and met traditional standards.

35
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,900
Second, while preserving
traditional craftsmanship,

36
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,160
we also had to consider
the needs of modern consumers

37
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,890
and environmental standards.

38
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,310
[Jian's Fragrance]

39
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,180
After leaving Gu Jingshi,

40
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,290
I found my own direction in life.

41
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,329
I established the fragrance brand,
Qingcheng.

42
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:20,209
Those bullet comments
that once followed me everywhere

00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,820
[Jian's Fragrance]

44
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,769
have quietly disappeared.

45
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,860
It's like a reminder from fate,

46
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,820
telling me

47
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,740
that I no longer need to rely on
any external guidance

48
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,110
[Jian's Fragrance]

49
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,280
and can rely on myself to define
and pursue my future.

50
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:47,980
Long time no see.

51
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,130
What are you doing here?

52
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,030
Let's talk inside.

53
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,930
[Crush the jerk. Rewrite my fate!]

54
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,000
I bought this place.

55
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,480
I knew

56
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,900
that you might come back someday.

57
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,530
Where did you get these photos?

58
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,580
Are you Chinese?

59
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,430
Yes, I am.

60
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,060
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival!

61
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,780
These mooncakes
were made by the local Chinese association

62
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,310
for our Chinese friends
who are far from home.

63
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,370
Thank you.

64
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,140
You took this photo?

65
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:20,890
I'm sorry.

66
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,140
I didn't mean to intrude on your life.

67
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,060
I just wanted to see you.

68
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,840
But I was afraid that if you saw me,

69
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,720
it would remind you
of those painful memories.

70
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,880
I always thought I was a decisive person,

71
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,520
but with you, I realized

72
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,340
that the more you love someone,

73
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,880
the more afraid you are to get close.

74
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,680
Don't think that saying that
will soften my heart.

75
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,340
Xiangxiang.

76
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,270
Give me another chance.

77
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,970
Let me make up for everything, please?

78
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,340
Chairman Gu.

79
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,610
Have some decency.

80
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,970
[Lin Yu]

81
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,880
Hey, can you tell Gao Yi
to stop bothering me?

82
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,690
Can't you rein him in?

83
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,970
I have no right to interfere in
his personal affairs.

84
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,570
Are you even my brother?

85
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,650
Let me introduce someone.

86
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,350
Jian Xiangxiang.

87
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,560
You're back!

88
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,020
That's great! Let me tell you,

89
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,460
while you were away,

90
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,320
my brother secretly flew to the UK
every month to see you.

91
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,520
He even collected a ton of your photos.

92
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,460
If you hadn't come back,

93
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,540
he would have gone completely mad.

94
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,680
You two are siblings?

95
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,040
Real, biological siblings.

96
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,790
I'll let him tell you all the details.

97
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,390
I have to go now. Bye.

98
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,270
It's actually a simple story.

99
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,520
When my mother was young,

100
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,390
she was abandoned by a jerk.

101
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,520
So she decided to raise Lin Yu on her own.

102
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,560
But her parents felt sorry for her

103
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,520
and didn't want her to be a single mother,

104
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,380
so they secretly gave Lin Yu away.

105
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,520
Then...

106
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
What happened next?

107
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,280
Over the years,

108
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,140
my mother kept looking for Lin Yu.

109
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,910
Until many years later,

110
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,070
she saw her at a cello concert.

111
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,920
By coincidence,

112
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,930
she discovered that
she was her long-lost daughter.

113
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,530
My mother had people investigate

114
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,370
and found out
Lin Yu had loving adoptive parents.

115
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,830
She didn't want to be an intruder

116
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,010
and didn't want to tell her
about the painful past.

117
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,320
So she instructed me

118
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,420
to always take care of her

119
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,260
and keep the secret forever.

120
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,200
Then how did Lin Yu find out
about your relationship?

121
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,320
She's very smart

122
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,600
and sensitive.

123
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,600
After all, in this world,

124
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,960
there's no such thing
as devotion without reason.

125
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,050
Xiangxiang.

126
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,040
Lin Yu was never
the one I couldn't get over.

127
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,040
If there's someone

128
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,440
I've always loved but couldn't have,

129
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,660
it's only you.

130
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,980
This proposal may be 3 years late,

131
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,770
but my love for you will never be absent.

132
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,920
Will you marry me?

133
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,040
You're so cold-hearted.

134
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,060
You're not giving the boss a chance.

135
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,800
My heart is a mess right now.

136
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,740
I'd be lying if I say I wasn't moved.

137
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,730
It's just that

138
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,280
I still feel like
there's a knot in my heart.

139
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,550
Hey, Wang.

140
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,080
I keep feeling...
