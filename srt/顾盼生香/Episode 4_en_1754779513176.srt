00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,210
This is what my boyfriend gave me
on Valentine's Day.

3
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,850
Is it beautiful?

4
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,740
Excuse me.

5
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,460
This is my guest.

6
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,500
Miss Jian, hello.

7
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:56,980
I'm Gao Yi.

8
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,620
Hello.

9
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,220
There's something
I may not have made clear to you.

10
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,880
The position you're hired for
is not a perfumer.

11
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,590
You'll work as my assistant.

12
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,500
You?
I'll be the special assistant's assistant?

[President's Office]

14
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,480
This is your workstation.

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,760
This looks like it was set up temporarily.

16
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,770
Mr. Gao, I'm here to apply for
the perfumer position.

17
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,760
Don't think that it's beneath you
to be the special assistant's assistant.

18
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,850
You should know that

19
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,890
this position is highly sought after
by many people.

20
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,479
Those who can handle it will become
Chairman Gu's trusted subordinates.

21
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,450
Trusted subordinates?

22
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,060
Yes.

23
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,840
So you're very important. Understand?

24
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:42,400
These are Chairman Gu's preferences
and restrictions.

25
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,860
Please read them carefully.

26
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,620
Don't be late.

27
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,060
Don't use strong perfumes.

28
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,000
No flattery or brown-nosing.

29
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:53,060
Don't eat durians in the office.

30
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,370
This boss has such strange requirements.

31
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,590
The chairman can't eat spicy food.

32
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,390
Even the smell of chilies in the air
is not allowed.

33
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,590
Hello, Chairman Gu.

34
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,140
I've already infiltrated into
Gu Jingshi's inner circle.

35
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,050
Next, I'm going to get closer to him.

36
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,620
How do you think
I can make a good impression on him?

37
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,300
Finally, you're showing some sense.

38
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,829
It's right for you to ask me.

39
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,100
Men all like fair-skinned beautiful women
with long legs.

40
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,420
Men are so shallow.

41
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,690
However,

42
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,560
what kind of man is Gu Jingshi?

43
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,300
He has seen all kinds of beautiful women.

44
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,100
Look.

45
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,180
Gu Jingshi, the President of Yaoge Group,

46
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,510
donated one million yuan
to the Stray Animal Rescue Center.

47
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,860
Please!

48
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,020
Just cooperate with me.

49
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,780
Once I succeed,

50
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,510
I'll reward you
with some small dried fish. Okay?

51
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,540
Meow.

52
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,360
What are you doing?

53
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,540
Chairman Gu.

54
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,220
Here's the thing, Chairman Gu.

55
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,540
Today, I saw a stray kitten

56
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,460
standing alone in a busy street,

57
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,120
looking extremely helpless.

58
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,820
I thought it must be very scared.

59
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,400
It had no home,
and no one looked after it.

60
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,820
So I took the liberty
of bringing it back here.

61
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,460
Mimi, don't be afraid.

62
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,420
I'll be your family from now on.

63
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,340
Chairman Gu, look.

64
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,620
Look. Isn't it very cute?

65
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,300
Wow! It actually meowed!

66
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,140
It is said
that cats are the most spiritual animals.

67
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,700
Chairman Gu, your warmth and kindness

68
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,900
must have touched it.

69
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,100
Why isn't he showing any reaction at all?

70
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,030
Maybe I didn't flatter him enough.

71
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,769
Actually, when I was a kid,

72
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,320
I had a cow cat‌ named Mimi.

73
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,980
We were best friends,

74
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,070
eating and sleeping together.

75
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,460
But one day,

76
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,620
Mimi suddenly disappeared.

77
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,500
When I found it,

78
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,190
it had been hit by a car and died.

79
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,900
So when I saw this cat,

80
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,060
it was like seeing my childhood cat,
Mimi, again.

81
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,220
And I just wanted to bring it back here

82
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,540
to give it a warm home.

83
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,200
Your childhood cat, Mimi?

84
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,909
You two ate and slept together?

85
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,970
But you're allergic to cat hair.

86
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,860
Jian Xiangxiang.

87
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,930
Your lying skills

88
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,530
are just so awful.

89
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,080
Life is hard,

90
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,410
and it all depends on your acting skills.

91
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,180
Remember to take some anti-allergy drugs
before you lie.

92
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:26,980
Actually,

93
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,300
this calico cat‌ was picked up by the boss
on the street last year.

94
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,530
The boss had no time to keep it,

95
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,940
so he gave it to Mr. Liu,
the building manager,

96
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,000
with a large sum of money for its care.

97
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,590
If I were her,

98
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,670
I'd be too embarrassed to stay there.

99
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,340
Chairman Gu, you know this cat, huh?

100
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,470
Not only do I know it,

101
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,290
but I'm also quite familiar with it.

102
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,090
This cat belongs to Mr. Liu,
the building manager.

103
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,430
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

104
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,310
I'll take it to Mr. Liu right away.

105
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,970
He must be extremely worried.

106
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,420
I'm doomed.

107
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,220
I must have
made a terrible impression on him.

108
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,900
I hope that he won't fire me.

109
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,210
I didn't perform well.

110
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,860
Chairman Gu.

111
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,620
Gao Yi has something urgent to do.

112
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,730
Call the driver and ask him to pick me up.

113
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,530
Okay.

114
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,740
Mr. Gao isn't here.

115
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,340
Isn't this a good chance
for me to distinguish myself?

116
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,180
The driver didn't answer the phone.

117
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:57,860
Try again.

118
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:58,940
Okay.

119
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,590
Why did he suddenly turn off his phone?

120
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:14,980
Chairman Gu.

121
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,780
How about I drive you to your destination?

122
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,510
I have a driver's license, too.

123
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,460
It's true. And I'm a great driver.

124
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,020
Go get the spare key
from the reception desk.

125
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,680
Okay.

126
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,040
Here's my chance.

127
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,260
[Xiangxiang]

128
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,060
Hello, the number you've dialed is busy.

129
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,220
Please try again...

130
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,580
Since she has already found out about it,

131
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,500
why are you still trying to contact her?

132
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,659
I haven't obtained
the Eight Methods of Fragrance yet.

133
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:54,060
If I break up with her now,

134
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,370
won't all my previous efforts be wasted?

135
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,910
Are you reluctant to give up
the Eight Methods of Fragrance,

136
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,840
or are you reluctant to give her up?

137
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,180
What do you mean?

138
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,650
Jiacheng, I...

139
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,420
Fine.

140
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,860
If you can't make the decision,

141
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,310
I'll make it for you.

142
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,500
Go home.

143
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,420
No way.

144
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,060
I need to seize this great opportunity.

145
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,820
Chairman Gu, I'm feeling a bit dizzy.

146
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,340
I might need to drink some sugar water.

147
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,860
I'll leave when I feel better.

148
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,660
Leave.

149
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,840
Close the door on your way out.

150
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,100
I'll close the door on my way out

151
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,100
and leave at once.

152
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,500
Well, Chairman Gu, I'm leaving.

153
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,660
You really don't know
how to treat a lady properly.

154
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,260
And I even took you back home.

155
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,820
Do you really think
you're a handsome cool man?

156
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,250
I don't believe that

157
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,980
I can't win you over.

158
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,070
Who are you?

159
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,010
Don't come any closer!
