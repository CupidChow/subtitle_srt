[BLEND FEELINGS: Episode 12]

2
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,460
Mr. Wang.

3
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:44,680
Have you seen the trending topics?

4
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,610
What's going on?

5
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,840
My God! You've just found out?

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,680
There's been a twist in Ms. Lin's case.

7
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,410
What's wrong? What's going on?

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,120
Here's the thing.
On the night when the PPT slides came out,

9
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,450
Director Gu's lawyer issued a statement,

10
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,840
refuting every single point on the slides

11
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,590
and claiming
that Ms. Lin had a delusional disorder.

12
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,870
I've heard
that she's in a mental hospital now.

13
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,000
How did she end up in a mental hospital?

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,540
I actually contacted her family
this morning.

15
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,220
They told me Ms. Lin had been

16
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,000
talking to herself at home these days

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,660
and had been quite in a trance.

18
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,150
Moreover,
she even hurt herself on purpose.

19
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,680
So this morning,

20
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,100
her family sent her
to the mental hospital.

21
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,170
Her family was too hasty, huh?

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,050
You're right.

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,080
You know what?

24
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,490
Ms. Lin's parents and younger brother

25
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:25,820
are notorious leeches.

26
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,450
By sending her away,

27
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,430
they could just get all her savings
from these years, couldn't they?

28
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,030
They're literally profiting
from her misery.

29
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:36,280
Alright. Let's stop talking about this.

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,560
None of us should discuss it anymore.

31
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,820
Let's get back to work.

32
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,080
The bullet comments predicted
I would be sent to the mental hospital.

33
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,170
Now it has happened to Lin Shasha instead.

34
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,009
What about me?

35
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,490
Jian Xiangxiang.

36
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,630
When you receive this letter,

37
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,440
I'm afraid
you'll be celebrating my departure.

38
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:00,660
But anyway,

39
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,260
I still want to apologize to you.

40
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:07,260
Because of the poverty of my family
and my parents' favoritism,

41
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,210
I've felt insecure and inferior
since childhood.

42
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,430
So,

43
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,810
choosing Gu Jiacheng was my fastest way
to get rid of the poverty label

44
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,000
and rise to the top
of the social hierarchy.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,640
I always thought
only by becoming powerful and wealthy

46
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,260
could I earn others' respect

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,440
and make my parents realize that

48
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,600
as their daughter, I have value, too.

49
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,329
But this obsession

50
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,120
finally brought me to a dead end.

51
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,200
Jian Xiangxiang.

52
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,400
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,120
Come out.

54
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:30,750
Stop hiding.

55
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,720
Are you following me?

56
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,520
No. I'm just passing by.

57
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,000
According to Clause Three, Party B must
be unconditionally honest with Party A.

58
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,740
Chairman Gu, actually,
I just want to keep you company.

59
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,020
If you don't like it,

60
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,250
then I'll go back now.

61
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,590
Today is my birthday.

62

♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

63
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,520
It's also the anniversary
of my mother's death.

64
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,330
Do you know
why I set up the Fragrance Department?

65
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,360
For the development of the Yaoge Group?

66
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,760
My mother has been dead for so many years.

67
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,400
I have photos
to remember what she looked like.

68
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,440
But as for the warm scent she had,

69
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,870
I've been gradually forgetting it.

70
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,040
So I wanted to
use the Fragrance Department

71
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,720
to recreate her scent.

72
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,600
Then did you succeed?

73
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,290
What kind of scent was that?

74
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,940
It was like cotton.

75
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,040
It felt very warm and cozy

76
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,970
even with a hint of soap fragrance.

77
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,700
Why am I telling you all these things?

78
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,030
Chairman Gu.

79
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,890
I don't need comfort or sympathy.

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,330
If you want to stay here,

81
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,740
just don't say anything.

82
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,940
Come here.

83
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:28,990
So you smiled?

84
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,440
That's wonderful.

85
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,720
My sacrifice to be bitten
by the mosquitoes wasn't in vain.

86
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,280
Chairman Gu.

87
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,580
Happy birthday.

88
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,620
Thank you.

89
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,570

Okay.

93

Where's my hair tie?

94

Are you looking for this?

95
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,250
Where did you find it?

96
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,570
I picked it up from the floor.

97
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,300
You picked it up from the floor?

98
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,950
I'll be in Hong Kong for a week.

99
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,390
On a business trip?

100
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,640
That's quite sudden.

101
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,690
Have you packed your luggage?
I can help you.

102
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,620
No need. Gao Yi has packed it for me.

103

Then I'll see you out.

The air conditioning in Hong Kong
is quite strong.

110

Don't catch a cold.

111
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,240
Okay.

Can you...

116
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:22,970
give me a hug?

that I'll ship the Jian & Gu couple.
