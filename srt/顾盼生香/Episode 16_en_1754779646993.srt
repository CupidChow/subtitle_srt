00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,259
Ms. Liu? What was she doing?

3
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,560
She was taking photos of the blueprint.

4
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,460
What blueprint was she taking photos of?

5
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,840
It's about the security system
for this house.

6
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,830
What? Then let's call the police at once.

7
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,630

8
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,560
What are we waiting for?

9
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,660
If the security system's information
gets leaked, there will be big trouble.

10
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,860
I just want her to leak the information.

The transfer will be completed soon.

17
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,780
Ms. Liu's son is addicted to gambling

18
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,110
and is heavily in debt.

19
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,400
To pay the debt,

20
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,490
she's been taking orders from Gu Shenshi.

21
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,750
And the previous incident
about the benzoin incense

22
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,410
was also caused by Gu Shenshi.

23
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,230
Gu Shenshi?

24
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,370
Isn't that your eldest brother?

25
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,970
Why would he want to harm you?

26
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,870
And I remember
he's quite gentle and refined.

27
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,630
Is he trying to
take revenge for Gu Jiacheng?

28
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,480
So that's why
you didn't want to alert her just now.

29
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,800
You were waiting for them
to contact each other.

30
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,970
I've installed a tracking program
in Ms. Liu's mobile phone.

31
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,329

to Gu Shenshi,

The implanted program

35
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,410
will redirect to Gu Shenshi's server.

36
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:00,370
Then I can gain access to the evidence
of his crimes from these years.

37
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,040
No wonder I've always felt
staying around you is so dangerous.

38
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,770

let those bullet comments come true.

41
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,800

42

happen to you.

That was why he created a car crash,

Why did he do such a thing?

117
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,660
He was afraid I would seek revenge.

118
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,260
He even sent Gu Shenshi abroad overnight.

146
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,840
Gu Shenshi would never give up.

It's been ten years.
He has long wanted to take action.

Gu Shenshi knows
that Ms. Liu has been exposed,

161
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,160
so he won't let her appear
in front of us again.

162
