00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,560
[BLEND FEELINGS Episode 6]

2
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,750
This is the latest product
developed by Director Gu,

3
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,710
Kunshan Jade.

4
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,930
Our star product for the Qixi Festival.

5
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,350
Director Gu, this perfume
is absolutely brilliant.

6
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:55,990
From a professional perspective,

7
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,870
it's layered

8
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,860
and elegant.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,070
I think it will definitely
be this year's best-selling product.

10
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,230
Just this year?

11
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,080
No, how could it be just
this year's best-selling product?

12
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,880
In the future,

13
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,330
it's gonna be a classic.

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,980
Alright, enough compliments.

15
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,350
Let's do a great job this year.

16
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,770
Director Gu will give everyone
big bonuses at the end of the year.

17
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,100
Thank you, Director Gu.

18
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,400
Hello? What is it?

19
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,600
What happened?

20
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,180
The Kunshan Jade formula has been leaked.

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,680
Put agarwood, sandalwood, frankincense,
jasmine, amber, and jujube flower honey

22
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,130
into a stone mortar.

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,570
Grind them into powder.

24
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,990
And then put it into a gauze

25
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,539
and sift out the fine powder.

26
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:40,460
This is the Kunshan Jade formula

27
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,930
that we're sharing with everyone for free.

28
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,400
The detailed formula

29
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,140
will be posted in text form later.

30
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,160
Don't forget to like, save,
and subscribe.

31
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,160
Just one tap.

32
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,180
See you tomorrow, guys. Bye-bye.

33
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,600
Aren't you worried

34
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,050
they'll come after you for posting that?

35
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,090
Come on, I made that formula.

36
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,850
I'd rather destroy them

37
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,230
than let them have them.

38
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,540
You're improving.

39
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:21,290
Boss,

40
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,260
it already has
ten thousand reposts.

41
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,540
A few big perfume bloggers are
reposting and commenting on it too.

42
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,470
It's made it to the top 20 trending.

43
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,310
Keep going. Don't let the hype die.

44
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:29,950
Got it.

45
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,579
By the way,

46
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,040
about that matter you asked me to check,

47
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,100
I found something.

48
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,800
This guy's name is Yan Jun,

49
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,300
a thug who indulges in drinking, gambling
and dallying with prostitutes.

50
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,260
Three days ago,

51
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,770
Lin Shasha paid him

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
to teach Jian Xiangxiang a lesson.

53
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,290
What kind of lesson?

54
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,560
Acid attack.

55
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,470
Collect evidence of his crimes

56
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,579
and hand it over to the cops.

57
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:52,450
What about Lin Shasha?

58
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,530
Don't tip her off.

59
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,620
She might still be useful to us.

60
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,750
Understood.

61
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,270
Jiacheng, the perfume bloggers
and fragrance enthusiasts

62
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,790
have already started recreating it.

63
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,510
Look.

64
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,070
Hurry up,

65
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,720
get that video taken down immediately.

66
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,370
It's too late.

67
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,230
Even if we take down Woof-Woof's video,

68
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,320
the hype won't stop.

69
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,579
The formula has already leaked.

70
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:20,010
This time, Jian Xiangxiang is determined
to get revenge on you,

71
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,070
even if it means mutual destruction.

72
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,040
Get out of my way.

73
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,050
Jiacheng, let me go with you.

74
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:24,610
No need!

75
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,420
Gu Jiacheng, what are you doing?

76
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,120
Get the hell out of here!

77
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,820
Don't come any closer.

78
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,680
If you come any closer,
I'll call the police!

79
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,680
Give it back to me!

80
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,120
You...

81
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:51,890
Boss.

82
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,840
This is the full report on all the losses
from the Kunshan Jade project.

83
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,640
Take a look.

84
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,320
What's the situation
in the Fragrance Department?

85
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,380
I heard it's a mess.

86
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,270
Director Gu lost his temper

87
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,560
and said something about
teaching someone a lesson.

88
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,520
And then stormed off while cursing.

89
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,510
Get the car ready.

90
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,920
You have a meeting in 20 minutes.

91
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,680
Cancel it.

92
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,300
But you worked so hard to
get that appointment with Mr. Smith.

93
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,570
Do you know about
the Misattribution of arousal?

94
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,100
When people are in danger,
their hearts race,

95
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:22,340
but they can easily mistake it
for romantic attraction.

96
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Are you trying to win over Miss Jian?

97
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,900
Once Gu Jiacheng completely loses control,

98
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,300
the person behind him

99
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,260
won't be able to sit still anymore.

100
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,000
Time to close the trap.

101
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,450
Gu Jiacheng, are you insane?

102
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,250
Stop it right now!

103
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,280
Yes, I've gone mad,

104
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,080
and I'll leave you with nothing.

105
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,470
What are you trying to do?

106
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,520
No, don't break that.

107
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,610
Don't break that!

108
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,550
Jian Xiangxiang,

109
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,280
from today on,

110
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,480
no factory in this country
will take your orders.

111
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,250
I'll make sure Jian's traditional scent

112
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,470
has no place left to stand.

113
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,600
Gu Jiacheng, you...

114
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,210
I heard

115
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,960
your Grandpa is still in the nursing home.

116
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,220
I'll go pay him a visit.

117
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,750
What are you doing?

118
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,800
What are you trying to do?

119
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
What am I doing?

120
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,000
Didn't you say I was shameless?

121
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,020
Fine,

122
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,600
I'll show you what shameless really means.

123
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,880
This is for you.

124
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,580
Do you like it?

125
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,980
What are you doing?

126
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,530
Don't you know I'm allergic to jasmine?

127
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:25,970
Gu Jiacheng.

128
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
Jian Xiangxiang.

129
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,640
You're asking for death.

130
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,690
Uncle Jingshi, why are you here?

131
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,250
I came to see you
throwing your weight around.

132
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,170
Uncle Jingshi.

133
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,000
She's the one

134
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,490
who ruined our new product launch.

135
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,290
It was her.

136
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,390
Apologize.

137
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,770
What? Why should I?

138
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,810
You've completely disgraced the Gu family.

139
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,080
Gao Yi.

140
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,620
Call the police.

141
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,200
Yes.

142
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,880
U-Uncle Jingshi.

143
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,460
Three.

144
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,340
Two.

145
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,120
One.

146
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,680
Uncle Jingshi, don't.

147
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,200
I'm sorry.

148
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,600
The password is my birthday.

149
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,660
Boss,

150
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,240
I've arranged for
someone to come clean up.

151
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,980
Chairman Gu, Mr. Gao,

152
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,540
what brings you here?

153
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:29,400
Come here.

154
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,620
Lower.

155
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,700
Just passing by.

156
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,780
Passing by?

157
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,580
Isn't Yaoge Group and your home
in the city center?

158
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,680
My shop is in the suburbs,

159
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,910
and the city center
is more than 20 kilometers away.

160
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,710
How could you be just passing by?

161
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,210
Do I need to lie to you?

162
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,560
No, no,

163
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,910
that's not what I meant.

164
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,150
Thank you so much for today.

165
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,340
If it weren't for you all,

166
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,000
I would've been dead for sure.

167
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,150
Let me make you some tea.

168
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,710
This cabinet isn't very stable.

169
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,990
Be careful.

170
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,360
Let me make you some tea, Chairman Gu.

171
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,280
No need for tea.

172
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,480
Take this card,

173
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,169
let me know if you need more.

174
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,110
Thank you.

175
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,760
Let's go eat.

176
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,660
I heard your Grandpa's
still in a nursing home,

177
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,790
so I'll go visit him.

178
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,420
This dishes don't suit your taste?

179
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:23,730
No, not at all.

180
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,760
Why would it be?

181
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,200
It's scalding.

182
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,970
I-I'm sorry, Chairman Gu.

183
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,010
You can have mine.

184
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,750
Don't drink mine either.

185
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,630
The Kunshan Jade can't go to market.

186
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,190
And the company
has suffered serious losses.

187
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,070
I'm sorry.

188
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,890
That's not what I wanted to hear.

189
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,480
Then...

190
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,840
Can you create something
even better than Kunshan Jade?

191
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,550
You ask me to do it?

192
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,350
Can you?

193
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:11,890
I can.

194
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,030
Gao Yi.

195
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,030
[Technology Equity Investment
& R&D Cooperation Agreement]

196
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,990
Take a look at this agreement.

197
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,880
It says

198
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,970
that if the development is successful,

199
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,210
Jian's Studio will

200
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,730
join as a technical partner

201
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,840
and co-develop the product
with Yaoge Group.

202
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,760
If it fails,

203
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,170
you're out.

204
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,920
Okay.

205
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,300
Chairman Gu.

206
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,960
Actually, Gu Jiacheng and I, we...

207
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,740
Whatever relationship exists
between you two,

208
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,980
I'm not interested.

209
00:10:59,150 --> 00:10:59,950
Also,

210
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,200
the nursing home
where your Grandpa stays

211
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,600
is one of my properties.

212
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,700
I've already told them

213
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,030
to take good care of him.

214
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,260
So you don't have to worry.

215
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,200
Do you have any other concerns?

216
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,790
So, do I still need to work as
Mr. Gao's assistant?

217
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,260
The more capable you are,

218
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,010
the more work you take on.

219
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,340
Now you have your appetite back, right?

220
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,920
Of course.

221
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,840
Gu Jingshi has issued a notice

222
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,570
that the Kunshan Jade project
has been canceled.

223
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,280
Why would he help Jian Xiangxiang?

224
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,160
Don't tell me he likes her.

225
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,960
Impossible.

226
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,400
Uncle Jingshi likes someone...

227
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:02,850
No, wait.

228
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,760
If he's helping Jian Xiangxiang this much,

229
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,020
there must be a reason.

230
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,680
Could it be that he wants
the Eight Methods of Fragrance too?

231
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,480
That's right.

232
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,700
That must be it.

233
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,820
What am I supposed to do?

234
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,800
If Gu Jingshi really gets
the Eight Methods of Fragrance,

235
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,920
won't I be even more
powerless in the company?

236
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,720
Don't worry, I'll think of a way.

237
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,680
What can you possibly do?

238
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,340
If trickery doesn't work,

239
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,870
we'll just take it by force.

240
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,880
Don't worry.

241
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,730
Whether it's
the Eight Methods of Fragrance or

242
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,090
Yaoge Group, they will all be yours.

243
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,730
You treat me so well.

244
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,390
How can I ever repay you?

245
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,840
You know what I want.

246
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,240
Once this is done,

247
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,030
you'll be Mrs. Gu.
