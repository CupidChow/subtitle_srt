00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,120
Xu.

3
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,110
Keep buying trending topics
and fake commenters.

4
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,830
We need to stay in the top five.

5
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,150
Then upload those fake intimate photos.

6
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,970
Fang, bad news.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,600
All the links got taken down.

8
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,780
I don't care.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,280
I paid for them.

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,520
Go upload more links.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,300
Didn’t you go to the concert?

12
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,630
Why are you back so soon?

13
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,520
[Breaking news]

14
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,030
So you did it?

15
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,130
So what if it was?

16
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,470
They ruined Jiacheng like that.

17
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
I just wanted to teach them a lesson.

18
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,940
Now we’re the ones getting punished.

19
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:20,810
What do you mean?

20
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,210
I just got a call.

21
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,090
Our factory’s entire supply chain
has been cut off.

22
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,480
How is that possible?

23
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,260
We opened that factory in secret.

24
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,390
Gu Jingshi doesn’t even know about it.

25
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,640
Do you really think he knows nothing

26
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,920
about what we've been doing?

27
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,180
You pissed him off today.

28
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,180
This is his warning and punishment.

29
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,440
He has no right to treat us like this.

30
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,460
You're both sons of the Gu family.

31
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,370
Why does he get real power

32
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,840
while you’re stuck with
a meaningless position?

33
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,020
I'm going to talk to Mr. Gu.

34
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,740
Just calm down.

35
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,430
Mr. Gu has been favoring him for years.

36
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,560
Don't you know that?

37
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,810
We’d better not mess with him again.

38
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,259
Just keep our heads down.

39
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,200
No.

40
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,330
I won't let this go.

41
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,120
I’ll make Gu Jingshi

42
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,780
regret everything he’s done.

43
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,960
Why bother?

44
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,770
We can't win against him.

45
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,610
Can't win?

46
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,810
Even if we can't win, I'll still fight.

47
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,340
I'll make him pay for this.

48
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,960
I’m not letting this slide.

49
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:23,950
Li Fang.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,720
About the rumors online
about me and Jian Xiangxiang,

51
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,280
I feel the need to clarify.

52
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,810
First, I must admit,

53
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,760
Gu Jiacheng and Jian Xiangxiang's
relationship is a thing of the past.

54
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,260
I don't think this will
affect our relationship.

55
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,530
There are rumors that
Miss Jian deliberately approached you.

56
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,240
Is that true?

57
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,160
Nonsense.

58
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,810
I was the one who pursued Jian Xiangxiang.

59
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,890
I will not allow anyone to hurt her.

60
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,240
If anyone spreads false rumors again,

61
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,430
I’ll take legal action,
no matter the cost.

62
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,660
Do you have anything to say to Miss Jian?

63
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,250
Jian Xiangxiang,

64
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,070
I'm always here for you.

65
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,450
Alright, thank you, Director Gu.

66
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,610
Thank you.

67
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,490
Boyfriend.

68
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,410
You're welcome, girlfriend.

70
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,330
Hello?

71
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,900
You said you’d go shopping with me today.

72
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,430
Why are you still sleeping?

73
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,160
Okay.

74
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,040
I'm coming.

75
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,680
Careful, slow down.

76
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,080
Wang, what are you doing?

77
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,240
-Don’t scare me.
-We’re almost there.

78
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,030
Okay, stop.

79
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,510
What's going on?

80
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,010
Please.

81
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,980
Wang, what are you trying to do?

82
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:43,980
You guys...

83
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,530
Before I met you,

84
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,640
my life was dull and gray.

85
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,410
But you changed everything.

86
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,120
Your smile

87
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,940
and your kindness deeply attract me.

88
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,040
I love you not just for now,

89
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,500
but every day from here on.

90
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,070
Will you marry me?

91
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:54,300
Say yes!

92
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:59,450
Say yes!

93
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,240
My blood sugar is spiking.

94
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,990
This is too sweet!

95
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,270
Those who don’t believe in love,

96
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,270
where are you now?

97
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,920
Time to admit you were wrong!

98
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,340
I do.

99
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:46,960
Oh no.

100
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,870
Here comes the heartbreak.

101
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,560
Get ready for the sad plot.

102
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,960
Five, four, three, two.

103
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,840
Boss.

104
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,150
Wait for me to come back.

105
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:35,530
Gu Jingshi.

106
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,330
What's going on?

107
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,990
Where’s he rushing off to?

108
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,590
Did the company go bankrupt?
