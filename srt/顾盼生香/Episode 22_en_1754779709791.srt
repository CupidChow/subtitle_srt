[BLEND FEELINGS Episode 22]

2
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,280
Boss is truly a mastermind.

3
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,480
And you were worrying about him so much.

4
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,240
Miss Jian.

5
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,080
You're the one who sent
the video of Chen Ping to Boss, right?

6
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,410
Boss, someone sent you a USB flash drive.

7
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,320
Shenshi.

8
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,290
When can I come back to you?

9
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,100
Since you still care about Boss,

10
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,690
why not stay and hear his explanation?

11
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,440
No need.

12
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,430
You stay and clean up his mess for him.

13
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,410
And don't tell him I was here.

14
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,160
Miss Jian.

15
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,800
Our contract is terminated.

16
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,660
This check is your compensation.

17
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,810
So you're really giving up on me?

18
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,490
Isn't there any way
to bring him to justice?

19
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,840
There's a mysterious man
who's been helping Gu Shenshi.

20
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,520
All I know is that
he has a very obvious scar

21
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,140
on the back of his right hand.

22
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,710
And he's around 40 years old.

23
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,340
You're one of Gu Shenshi's men,
aren't you?

24
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,820
You've helped him
do so many terrible things.

25
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,370
I already called the police.

26
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,840
They'll be here any minute.

27
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,520
Neither you

28
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,160
nor he can escape.

29
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:55,940
Go after him!

30
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,520
Who is that man?

31
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,980
Why are you following him?

32
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,280
He's Gu Jingshi's enemy
from ten years ago.

33
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,550
He definitely showed up at the villa

34
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,750
to help Gu Shenshi.

35
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,680
We can't let him hurt Gu Jingshi.

36
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,240
Got it.

37
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,280
The mysterious man is right here.

38
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,450
He never left.

39
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,020
Don't forget to smell him out
with superpowered nose of yours.

40
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,720
What are you doing?

41
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,960
I'm smelling sweat.

42
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,960
Doesn't all sweat smell the same?

43
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,760
When I passed by that man just now,

44
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,900
I caught a bitter scent,

45
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,380
like someone on long-term meds.

46
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,180
He's over there.

47
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,520
What happened to him?

48
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,820
Why did he collapse like that?

49
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,210
Looks like a seizure or something.

50
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,190
I'll get him to a hospital.

51
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:21,700
Get him to the hospital! Quick!

52
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,340
Oh my god!

53
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,920
Call Gu Jingshi.

54
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,280
Tell him to come get him.

55
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,460
With this witness,

56
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,450
he can finally bring
his brother to justice.

57
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,409
Okay.

58
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,810
Chairman Gu, this is Wang.

59
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:58,710
Xiangxiang.

60
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,080
Congratulations.

61
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,820
Your revenge is complete.

62
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,300
Come back with me.

63
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,570
Gu Jingshi,

64
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,200
we're done.

65
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,520
I didn't tell you the truth

66
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,560
because I knew you'd stay by my side.

67
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,620
But that would've been too dangerous.

68
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,360
And I didn't want to put you at risk.

69
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,960
So the whole thing was a setup.

70
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,880
I never intended to...

71
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,540
You never actually intended to
break up with me,

72
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:37,760
did you?

73
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,920
No, I didn't.

74
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,320
So...

75
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,210
you knew from the beginning

76
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,200
that Lin Yu was fake.

77
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,240
Yes.

78
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,060
Gu Jingshi.

79
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,000
Why am I always

80
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,910
the one who's being told

81
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,370
what to accept and to do in your plans?

82
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,280
As if my existence

83
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,490
is only meant to accommodate your pace.

84
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,320
We've never moved forward together.

85
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,360
It's not what you think.

86
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,250
You can have a thousand reasons to explain

87
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,710
that you did it for my good,

88
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,580
but that's not what I want.

89
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,410
I'm sorry.

90
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,840
I ignored your feelings.

91
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,440
I want to

92
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,680
leave this place

93
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,580
and leave you.

94
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,790
Go somewhere

95
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,270
I can live the way I want to.

96
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,370
Xiangxiang.

97
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,520
Please don't go.

98
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,390
Gu Jingshi.

99
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,660
Let's both let go.

100
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,880
Please don't leave me.

101
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,000
I made this myself.

102
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,020
It's called Zen's Dream.

103
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,540
It helps calm people down.

104
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,810
Oh, by the way, Chairman Gu.

105
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,360
I brought you something.

106
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,810
Let me introduce you.

107
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,480
This is my girlfriend, Jian Xiangxiang.

108
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,040
If you don't want to,

109
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,280
then I'll leave.

110
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,760
Sign it.

111
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,570
Don't worry.

112
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,330
I'll definitely protect you well.

113
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,630
I suspect it contains cocklebur.

114
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:38,210
Excessive use can cause headaches,
dizziness, irregular heartbeat,

115
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,680
and even shock.

116
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,280
Chairman Gu.

117
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,010
Happy birthday.

118
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,760
Gu Jingshi.

119
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,880
I like you.

120
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,240
I'll always be here.

121
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,780
Boss, the hospital called.

122
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,060
Gu Shenshi's nervous system
was severely damaged.

123
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,850
He's in a vegetative state now.

124
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,110
That's too good for him.

125
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,650
The mysterious man is called Wang Yong.

126
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,690
He's been handed over
to the police for further interrogation.

127
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:27,670
He'll soon confess

128
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,070
everything about what happened back then.

129
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,120
Also,

130
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,550
Chen Ping and Li Fang
have both been detained.

131
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,400
Have Lawyer Zhao take over Li Fang's case.

132
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,130
Understood.

133
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:48,290
Boss, are you really willing to
let Jian Xiangxiang go?

134
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,610
It's time for her to
see the outside world.
