[BLEND FEELINGS]
[Episode 21]

2
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,030
Mr. Gu.

3
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,980
-Shenshi.
-Thank you.

4
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,440
Fang.

5
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,840
Try my cooking.

6
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,250
What's so special about it?

7
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,930
It's just a bowl of wontons.

8
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,620
Mrs. Yang,

9
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,840
could you get me some vinegar?

10
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,640
Sure.

11
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,280
You're the only one in the family
who likes vinegar in your wontons.

12
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,810
Don't use too much.
It's bad for your stomach.

13
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,740
Would you like some?

14
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,720
I don't like vinegar.

15
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,760
Let's eat.

16
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,770
Today is a trap disguised as a feast.

17
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,180
A good show of brothers
turning on each other is about to begin.

18
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,820
His wontons were poisoned.

19
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,480
Let's go!

20
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,840
What's wrong?

21
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,740
Gu Jingshi is in danger. Let's go!

22
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,500
Jingshi, have another bowl.

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,280
You've lost weight lately.

24
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,710
Let me get you another bowl.

25
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,440
No need. I'm full.

26
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,220
I heard you're planning
to acquire Rong'an Biotech.

27
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,090
They've made great achievements
in biotech.

28
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,910
If the acquisition goes through,

29
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,080
it could significantly shorten

30
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,560
Yaoge's R&D cycle in cosmetics.

31
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,440
I disagree.

32
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,440
Shenshi, you've never cared about
the company's affairs.

33
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,840
From a financial perspective,

34
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,650
this is a huge investment

35
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,410
with uncertain short-term returns.

36
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,550
Also, Rong'an's management style
is completely different from Yaoge's.

37
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,600
Post-acquisition conflicts
are almost guaranteed.

38
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,980
So you want to override me?

39
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,320
Do you think you're qualified?

40
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,990
Or do you think

41
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,410
you'll soon replace me?

42
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,230
Who knows what the future holds?

43
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,080
What are you two talking about in riddles?

44
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,529
Shenshi, are you okay?

45
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,630
I'm afraid he's been poisoned.

46
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,030
Poisoned?

47
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,150
It was you. You poisoned me.

48
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,280
You've got it backwards.
Weren't you the ones who poisoned me?

49
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,380
You've been planning this for so longâ€”

50
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,380
wasn't your goal to kill me today?

51
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,770
Butler, call an ambulance now!

52
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,860
Sir,

53
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,200
there's no signal.

54
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,970
Go outside and get help!

55
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,140
Yes, sir!

56
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:52,760
The signal here has been blocked
by Gu Shenshi,

57
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,650
so that after I was poisoned,

58
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,400
I couldn't get treatment in time.

59
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,000
Too bad it backfired on himself.

60
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,330
Dad, help me.

61
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,880
He's falsely accusing me.

62
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,540
He wants to poison me to death.

63
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,380
Jingshi, how could this happen?

64
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,730
I'm so scared.

65
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,290
Let's get your brother
to the hospital quickly.

66
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,750
You're worried about him?

67
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,920
He's your brother.

68
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,240
Shenshi,

69
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,250
when can I be back by your side?

70
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,050
I'm afraid that in a few days

71
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,810
he'll start suspecting me.

72
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,490
Don't worry.

73
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,460
I've already come up with
a foolproof plan.

74
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,640
What is it?

75
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,690
I'll tell my father

76
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,740
that Gu Jingshi
drove Jian Xiangxiang away for you,

77
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,430
hinting he should talk to you.

78
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,430
Then you'll pretend to be scared

79
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,590
and call Gu Jingshi for help.

80
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,460
Once he enters the old mansion,

81
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,450
I'll use his mother's favorite
three-delicacy wontons as bait

82
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,120
to keep him there for a meal.

83
00:05:59,170 --> 00:05:59,970
A meal?

84
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,690
I got a colorless, tasteless neurotoxin.

85
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,870
I'll put it in his wontons then.

86
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,450
But...

87
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,200
how will we get away with it?

88
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,910
I've already provoked Li Fang,

89
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,630
making everyone believe
she hates Gu Jingshi deeply.

90
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,180
After Gu Jingshi is poisoned,

91
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,420
I'll slip the poison into her bag
during the chaos

92
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,440
making her our scapegoat.

93
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,880
Then by that time,

94
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,720
all obstacles before us will vanish.

95
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,860
And Yaoge Group will be yours.

96
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,080
But you still have a son.

97
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,020
Can you bear to sacrifice him?

98
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,780
That good-for-nothing
isn't worth mentioning.

99
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,640
You can have another son for me.

100
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,720
I will raise our child well

101
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,260
and one day hand over everything
of Yaoge Group to him.

102
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,260
Shenshi, you're so good to me.

103
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,680
How could this happen?

104
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,980
I know everything about you
perfectly well.

105
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,780
Lin Yu!

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,660
You're going back and forth
between my two sons,

107
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,670
stirring up trouble between them.

108
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,210
What exactly do you want?

109
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,960
Jingshi...

110
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,590
Maybe I should call you this:

111
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,080
Chen Ping,

112
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,910
Gu Shenshi's mistress.

113
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,110
Don't be discouraged.

114
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,270
You still have me.

115
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,080
That's right.

116
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,700
The game has just begun.

117
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,190
How troublesome that you've plotted
such an elaborate scheme against me,

118
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:56,120
even having your mistress undergo
plastic surgery to look like Lin Yu.

119
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,370
You think this plan is flawless,

120
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,730
but in fact, it's full of loopholes.

121
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,180
This poison...

122
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:03,870
This poison...

123
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,200
I'm the one who poisoned you.

124
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,700
Fang, why?

125
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:23,960
Miss Jian.

126
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,050
I sent the video to your wife last night.

127
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,520
Fang,

128
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,110
let me explain.

129
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,260
This is all his scheme.

130
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,980
We've been married for decades.

131
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,160
I know exactly where you keep your things.

132
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,130
Last night,
I already swapped out the poison.

133
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:20,920
Just now,
I put the real poison in the vinegar bottle.

134
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,010
Gu Jingshi asked me
to swap out the poison,

135
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,810
but I couldn't accept it.

136
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,230
Why can you two be happy together,

137
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,450
but I have to be your scapegoat?

138
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,290
Since you want to scheme against
Jiacheng and me,

139
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,050
don't blame me for being ruthless.

140
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,240
My son is my weakness.

141
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,530
You won't even spare your own son.

142
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,560
Gu Shenshi,

143
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,860
I have nothing left
to hold on to with you.

144
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,880
Shenshi!

145
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,330
Are you okay?

146
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,370
This was all my idea.

147
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,300
It has nothing to do with him!

148
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,960
I will turn myself in.

149
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,030
You're crazy. You've lost your mind.

150
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,480
What a tragedy.

151
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,540
Such a sin.

152
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,100
What's the point of all this?

153
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,300
It's all because of you!

154
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,690
It's all because of you, you old bastard!

155
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,360
What?

156
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,400
I'm your firstborn son!

157
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,860
My mother was your lawful wife.

158
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,030
What is Xia Hanzhi anyway?

159
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,570
Just a mistress.

160
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,040
My mother died of a broken heart

161
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,230
after you forced her away.

162
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,140
Shut up!

163
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,130
Try slandering my mother again,

164
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,330
and you'll see what happens.

165
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,530
All these years,

166
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,910
this old bastard
only cares about Xia Hanzhi and you.

167
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,010
No matter what I do,

168
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,520
he thinks I'm no match for you.

169
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,010
So you planned the car accident
that killed my mother?

170
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,250
You pushed me to do this!

171
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,840
I just regret that you didn't die
in that accident back then!

172
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,320
Shenshi!
