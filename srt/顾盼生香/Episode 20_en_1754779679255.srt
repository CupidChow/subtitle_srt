[BLEND FEELINGS: Episode 20]

2
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,460
Are you really willing to
just leave like this

3
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,590
without fighting for it one more time?

4
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:50,680
Wang.

5
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,100
Please help me put the studio up for sale.

6
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,200
It's also time for me
to pursue my own dreams.

7
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,600
Okay.

8
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,700
Leave it to me.

9
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,940
He doesn't know how to cherish you.

10
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,840
You'll find someone better in the future.

11
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,440
Let's go.

00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,390
[Gao Yi]

13
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:46,880
Boss.

14
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:49,610
Miss Jian took a 3 p.m. flight to the UK.

15
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,289
Got it.

16
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,050
Jingshi.

17
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,210
Take a break.

18
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,070
This glass of wine is called
Pleasant Dream.

19
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,200
Just as its name suggests,

20
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,540
every sip is like a part of the dream,

21
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,770
which is beautiful but transient,

22
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:21,000
just like the time we once spent together.

23
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,920
Don't work too hard.

24
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,820
Take a rest when you can.

25
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,350
Jingshi.

26
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,150
I love you.

27
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,020
Oh, right.

28
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,890
I still have a teleconference to attend.

29
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,240
Why don't you go out
and walk around by yourself first?

30
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,140
Work comes first.

31
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,120
So Lin Yu is the woman
who abandoned Jingshi back then?

32
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,420
Yes, Dad.

33
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,860
How dare she come back?

34
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:13,770
Wait.

35
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,790
What about Jian Xiangxiang?

36
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,779
What's her stand?

37
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:17,910
She's already gone.

38
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,360
What do you mean?

39
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,779
After Lin Yu came back,

40
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,340
Jian Xiangxiang left here

41
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,340
and went to the UK.

42
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,950
I heard when Jingshi decided to
get back together with Lin Yu,

43
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,080
he drove her away.

44
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,240
He has lost his mind!
Ask Jingshi to come back now!

45
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,720
Dad.

46
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,430
Jingshi is serious about
his relationship with Lin Yu.

47
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,430
Don't force him to break up with her.

48
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,580
Then bring Lin Yu here to see me.

49
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,790
I'd like to see
what kind of person she really is,

50
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,310
who has bewitched my son so much
that he has lost his mind.

51
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,100
I'll go handle it right away.

52
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,370
Jingshi.

53
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,810
Your father will send someone
to take me to the old residence.

54
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,740
Is he trying to break us up?

55
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,960
I'm so scared.

56
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,180
Can you come over and stay with me?

57
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,060
I got it.

58
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,940
How much money is needed
for you to leave my son?

59
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,240
Name your price.

60
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,720
I don't want your money.

61
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,260
I admit I've made some mistakes before.

62
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,750
But I truly love Jingshi.

63
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,640
If you were serious,
why have you been away for so many years?

64
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,300
Who knows
what you've been up to all these years?

65
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,700
Dad, I think they're serious.

66
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,720
Shut up!

67
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,720
Are the Gu family's men

68
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,150
something she can dump

69
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,030
and retrieve whenever she wants?

70
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,440
Jingshi, you're here.

71
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,890
If it weren't for this woman,

72
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,610
I'm afraid you wouldn't even want to
come back to this home, huh?

73
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,440
I'm here to pick up Lin Yu.

74
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,290
Let's go.

75
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,170
How long are you going to
keep causing trouble?

76
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,740
It's been a few years.

77
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,020
Are you still unwilling to come back?

78
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,760
Dad, he doesn't want to come back.

79
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,820
Why do you have to force him to do that?

80
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,310
If you want to be with this woman,

81
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,250
you need to show some sincerity.

82
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,510
At least, you should have a meal with me.

83
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,460
Jingshi.

84
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,740
Your father is getting old.

85
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,880
Just play along with him for now.

86
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,400
Alright.

87
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,120
I'll just have one meal here.

88
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,730
Butler,
tell the kitchen to prepare more dishes.

89
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,870
Braised Fish Tail, Sweet and Sour Pork,
Lotus Roots with Sticky Rice.

90
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,200
These are all Jingshi's favorite dishes.

91
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,620
And the three-delicacy wontons, too.

92
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,080
Yes.

93
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,390
That's right.

94
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,950
Just like his mother,

95
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,289
Jingshi loves the three-delicacy wontons
the most.

96
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,530
Mom,
your wontons are the best in the world.

97
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,310
You're always such a sweet talker.

98
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,090
Go wash your hands now

99
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,020
and then come help me make wontons.

100
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,150
I need to learn how to make them, too?

101
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,690
Of course you must learn how to make them.

102
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:15,210
After you get married,
you can make them for your wife.

103
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,480
Oh, Mom.

104
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,970
Don't think about that.

105
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,970
Let me tell you.

106
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,440
I have an important meeting upstairs.

107
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,630
I need to go upstairs now.

108
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,720
You brat!

109
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,310
Mom,
when I find someone I like in the future,

110
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,560
you can teach me then.

111
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,780
Okay.

112
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,780
You still remember that?

113
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,940
Of course I do.

114
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,260
Jingshi.

115
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,600
Talk to your father for a while first.

116
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,770
I'll go make some wontons in the kitchen.

117
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:42,780
Thank you.

118
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,680
Come and have a seat.

119
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,770
Come on, Jingshi.

120
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,430
Have a seat.

121
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,070
Then I'll go check it out, too.

122
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,390
You already left.

123
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,140
Why did you suddenly come back?

124
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,080
No matter what,

125
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,560
he did change my ending once.

126
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,680
This time, I'm just going to
return the favor to him.

127
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,170
I can't just stand by,
watching him have a bad ending.

128
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,640
What ending?

129
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,850
What bad ending?

130
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,800
I'm getting more and more confused about
what you're saying.

131
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,530
There are so many trees here.

132
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,810
I just can't see clearly.
