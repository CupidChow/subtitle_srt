[BLEND FEELINGS Episode 19]

2
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,069
Is there some kind of misunderstanding?

3
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,380
The Gu family is truly toxic.

4
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,840
Every one of them is a jerk.

5
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,440
That's him, right?

6
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,940
Xiangxiang, let's not wait anymore.

7
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,070
[Alarm]

8
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:48,340
Okay.

9
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,100
One thing though.

10
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,990
The third floor bedroom is off-limits.

11
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,790
Uncle Jingshi

12
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,410
has someone he never got over.

13
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,930
She's a famous cellist.

14
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,530
Compared to her, you're nothing.

15
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,900
This is Lin Yu's room.

16
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:35,460
So,

17
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,720
Gu Jingshi has been waiting
for her to return all this time.

18
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,380
Then what does our relationship even mean?

19
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,620
Did you see the trending topics
last night?

20
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,160
The one about Lin Yu returning?

21
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,240
Of course I did.

22
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,700
I heard she's Chairman Gu's ex-girlfriend.

23
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,500
Tell me more.

24
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,380
A few years ago, our company
held a New Year gala.

25
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,950
We invited Lin Yu

26
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
to perform live.

27
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,630
Suddenly, a crazy fan rushed forward

28
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,390
and tried to hug Lin Yu on stage.

29
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,050
It was Chairman Gu who stepped in to help

30
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,050
and had security remove that fan.

31
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,340
Wow, saving the damsel in distress!

32
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,220
Later, I heard she went to Africa

33
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,240
and disappeared without a trace.

34
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,530
Yesterday, Chairman Gu
was proposing to Jian Xiangxiang,

35
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,250
but as soon as he heard Lin Yu was back,
he ran off.

36
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,440
I actually think Jian Xiangxiang's nice.

37
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,680
Yes, I think so too.

38
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,120
When it comes to love,
being nice means nothing.

39
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,920
Mr. Wang.

40
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,780
Didn't you say gossiping is forbidden
during work hours?

41
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,440
This gossip is just too juicy.

42
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,510
[President's Office]

43
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,410
Miss Jian, Chairman Gu has a guest.

44
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,200
Please wait outside for now.

45
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,200
Alright.

46
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,360
I can wait.

47
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,840
You must be Miss Jian?

48
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,960
I've heard so much about you.

49
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,260
While I was away,

50
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,710
thank you for taking care of Jingshi.

51
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,990
You owe me an explanation.

52
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,050
Wait for me in the car.

53
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,250
Okay.

54
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,360
I need to know why.

55
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,560
I don't want to be dumped
without an explanation.

56
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,460
The contract is over.

57
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,320
This check is your compensation.

58
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:22,990
Gao Yi.

59
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,400
Transfer the money to her card.

60
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:19,910
Miss Jian.

61
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,710
No need.

62
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,900
I can see myself out, thank you.

63
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,230
Don't believe what he said.

64
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:40,980
Why panic?
The boss definitely cares about you.

65
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,750
This used to be your favorite food.

66
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,580
Try it. See if it tastes right.

67
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,120
This is just right!

68
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,600
I've missed it so much.

69
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,640
Let's come to the night market

70
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,200
every day from now on, okay?

71
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,040
Gu Jingshi.

72
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,800
I know you never got over her.

73
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,860
But you've been apart for so long.

74
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,580
Are you sure
there's still love between you?

75
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,120
What are you trying to say?

76
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,050
I'm saying what's lost or never had

77
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,480
will feel more precious

78
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,720
with time,

79
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,000
but that doesn't mean it's love.

80
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,110
You said our contract is over.

81
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,380
Yes.

82
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:01,400
I know.

83
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,670
We started with a contract.

84
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,040
But...

85
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,590
Did you fall in love with me after?

86
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:13,730
I could feel it.

87
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:16,990
So...

88
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,080
Could you not

89
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,760
make such a hasty decision?

90
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,450
Miss Jian.

91
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm sorry my return has hurt you.

92
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,840
But I can't lose Jingshi either.

93
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,110
Watch out!

94
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,560
Jingshi, are you okay?

95
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,570
Are you alright?

96
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,520
Let's go to the hospital.

97
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,740
Miss Jian, please leave immediately.

98
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,360
Stop bothering Jingshi from now on!

99
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,490
You just risked everything to save me.

100
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,520
Instincts don't lie, Gu Jingshi!

101
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,920
Even if it was a stranger,

102
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,580
I would have instinctively saved her too.

103
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,360
But that doesn't mean anything.

104
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,010
I've already said everything
I needed to say.

105
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,870
Please don't disturb us anymore.

106
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:43,960
You...

107
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,840
You really don't want me anymore?

108
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:54,850
Let's go.

109
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,140
The contract is over.

110
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,000
This check is your compensation.

111
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,460
You just risked everything to save me!

112
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,070
Instincts don't lie.
