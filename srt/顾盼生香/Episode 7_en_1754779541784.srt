[BLEND FEELINGS Episode 7]

2
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,780
[Crush the jerk. Rewrite my fate!]

3
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,590
Jian Xiangxiang. You want to die?

4
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,400
I just bought a ParaÃ­ba stone.

5
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,350
5 carats.

6
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,130
Come see it this afternoon if you're free.

7
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,130
Director Gu, I found out that

8
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,500
the Eight Methods of Fragrance
is in Miss Jian's safe.

9
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:53,910
What's going on?

10
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:56,200
What shady thing are you planning again?

11
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,350
Dad, do you really think
I only do shady things?

12
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,170
Gu Jiacheng.

13
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,260
You should know better by now.

14
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,400
Work properly with your Uncle Jingshi
at the company

15
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,540
and stop fooling around all day.

16
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,620
Fine.

17
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,800
Dad, you know you say this so often

18
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,039
that my ears are calloused,

19
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,610
you know?

20
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,300
I'm saying this for your own good.

21
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,010
Hasn't Jiacheng
been quite sensible lately?

22
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,050
Stop nagging him.

23
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:17,170
Exactly.

24
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,500
Doting mothers raise spoiled children.

25
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,210
Hello, Grandpa.

26
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,579
Dad.

27
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,860
Let's eat.

28
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,210
Alright.

29
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,770
I'll get you some porridge.

30
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,850
Dad,

31
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,810
enjoy your meal.

32
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,150
Do you know why Jiacheng chose me
instead of you?

33
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,260
Please step aside.

34
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,390
Because he never liked you.

35
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,210
In his heart,

36
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,690
you're just a useless, pitiful creature.

37
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,079
Says who?

38
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,500
At least I can crush
your dreams of stealing my scent.

39
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,940
Who says we need Kunshan Jade?

40
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:37,960
I've already contacted
the best perfumer in Singapore.

41
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,100
Just wait and see.

42
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,810
No matter how skilled they are,

43
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,300
I'm telling you right now.

44
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,690
The Qixi bestseller will come from me,
Jian Xiangxiang.

45
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,940
As for Gu Jiacheng,

46
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,960
if you want to treat that trash
like treasure, that's your business.

47
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,220
Just leave me out of it.

48
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,680
Who doesn't know how to go off?

49
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,910
[President's Office]

50
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,649
A half-month research trip to Yunnan?

51
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,140
Yunnan
is located on a low-latitude plateau.

52
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,710
It spans various climates,
from tropical to frigid,

53
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,730
which contributes to its plant diversity.

54
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,300
I've already arranged a guide for you.

55
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,460
Get the new project going
as soon as possible.

56
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,570
Alright.
I'll conduct detailed chemical analysis

57
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,900
of the local plants,

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,300
then evaluate
how different extraction methods

59
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,030
affect their scent purity and stability,

60
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,110
and match that with consumer tastes

61
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,450
to develop a perfume that blends
tradition and modernity.

62
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,700
Pack your things.

63
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,159
Leave as soon as possible.

64
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,010
Yes, Chairman Gu.

65
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,070
I'll definitely bring you good news!

66
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,420
Xiangxiang, come have a drink.

67
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,540
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

68
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,480
I didn't buy it.

69
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,640
Ms. Lin got this for everyone.

70
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,680
This is a color developer
I got from a top laboratory abroad.

71
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,100
If Jian Xiangxiang's touches it,

72
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,280
it will remain visible for 48 hours.

73
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,880
So?

74
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,010
If she opens the safe,

75
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,900
the color developer
will remain on the keypad.

76
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,360
When that time comes,

77
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,610
the Eight Methods of Fragrance
will be ours.

78
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,340
It's done.

79
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,630
Chairman Gu, rest assured,

80
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,240
I will definitely work hard

81
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,640
and won't let you down.

82
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,240
This ice-cold man...

83
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,000
Just you wait.

84
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,940
I'll definitely win you over.

85
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:00,930
Just you wait,

86
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,780
I'll definitely win you over.

87
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,330
False alarm.

88
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,070
That scared me to death.

89
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,870
I did recall it, right?

90
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,400
Thank goodness.

91
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,920
Childish.

92
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,920
Boss, as expected,
they've made their move.

93
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,610
Boss, using Miss Jian
as part of your plan,

94
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,640
would that...

95
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,400
Everyone in this world
acts out of self-interest.

96
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,840
Compensate her when it's over.

97
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:44,830
Yes, sir.

98
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,760
Hurry up!

99
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,630
Boss, they've come, just as expected.

100
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,490
Just apply this substance on here,

101
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,890
and her fingerprints will become visible.

102
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:10,690
Look.

103
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,510
There it is.

104
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,480
Quick!

105
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,340
Wait...

106
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,930
How do we figure out the combination
with these numbers?

107
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,530
The darkest mark comes first.

108
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,040
Seven.

109
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,700
Seven.

110
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,990
Six, one.

111
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,360
Why is there another person?

112
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,400
It's open!

113
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,810
Keep it down.

114
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,480
Get up.

115
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,530
If you want money,

116
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,920
I can give you any amount!

117
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,850
Don't hurt him.

118
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,520
Shut up.

119
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,840
Is it him?

120
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,340
The scar is identical.

121
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,070
Sir, it's been taken care of.

122
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,040
It's him.

123
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,000
We wanted to bait Gu Jiacheng.

124
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,130
I didn't expect him to show up instead.

125
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,340
Who is this person?

126
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:25,570
Could he also be
after the Eight Methods of Fragrance?

127
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,110
We were so close.

128
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,610
Did you leak our plan?

129
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,420
H-H-How could I ever betray you?

130
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,230
I didn't tell anyone!

131
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,480
I'll find another way.

132
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,040
Jiacheng, believe me.

133
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,670
Find another way?

134
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,550
I'm starting to question

135
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,640
why I keep you around.

136
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,040
Useless!

137
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,680
Next time,

138
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,000
I'll come up with a flawless plan.

139
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,840
Enough!

140
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,660
Oh no, Miss Jian is back.

141
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,930
Wasn't Miss Jian supposed to be
out of town for half a month?

142
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,730
Why is she back after only 5 days?

143
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,170
Boss, what should we do?

144
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,610
Should I just storm in now?

145
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:27,960
No.

146
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,040
If we act rashly,

147
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,180
Jian Xiangxiang will be in danger.

148
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:31,980
Boss,

149
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,850
we've been waiting for this opportunity
for 10 years.

150
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,250
We can't let it slip away.

151
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,800
Abort the mission.

152
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,580
Yes, sir.

153
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,040
That was too spicy.
