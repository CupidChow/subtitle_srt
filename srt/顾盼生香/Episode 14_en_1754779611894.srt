[BLEND FEELINGS Episode 14]

2
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,090
Oh, by the way,

3
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,180
how come your leg suddenly got better?

4
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,660
Did you go to Hong Kong just to treat it?

5
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:46,120
Actually, I...

6
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,810
And about that fight you just had,

7
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:48,570
how are you feeling?

8
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,450
Does it hurt?

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,720
Nope.

10
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,170
How could it not hurt?

11
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,450
Get up and let me take a look.

12
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,450
Seriously, it doesn't hurt.

13
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,010
Don't worry.

14
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,560
It might hurt a little.

15
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:05,570
Bear with it.

16
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,250
What's wrong?

17
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,210
I'm just...

18
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,110
really happy you're okay

19
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,150
and can stand now.

20
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,470
I'm really happy.

21
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,289
That's great.

22
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,410
Alright.

23
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,900
By the way,

24
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,810
the one who had me thrown into
the mental hospital

25
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,970
must be Gu Jiacheng.

26
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,250
I don't have evidence right now,

27
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,680
but I'm sure it was him.

28
00:01:59,009 --> 00:01:59,810
Alright,

29
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,650
eat first.

30
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,090
I'll get to the bottom of it.

31
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,410
Is it good?

32
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,690
I want that one.

33
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,240
Director Gu, bad news!

34
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,860
Jian Xiangxiang, she...

35
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,140
Calm down.

36
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,550
Gu Jingshi has rescued Jian Xiangxiang.

37
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,490
Hurry!

38
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,960
Book me a flight out of the country, now!

39
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,620
Director Gu, this way, please.

40
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,010
Feels like it doesn't hurt that much.

41
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,110
-Uncle Jingshi.
-Get him! It's him!

42
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,530
Uncle Jingshi.

43
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,079
Your legs are healed now.

44
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,700
Well, Uncle Jingshi.

45
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,660
Now that your legs are healed,

46
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,450
we should celebrate, right?

47
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,490
Where were you heading just now?

48
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,920
Just now...

49
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,140
Uncle Jingshi,
it's the middle of the night.

50
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,320
Why'd you call me out here?

51
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,370
Abduction, kidnapping, and assault
are criminal offenses.

52
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,570
Do you know how many years you could get?

53
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,740
Uncle Jingshi, what do you mean by that?

54
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,160
I don't understand.

55
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,320
Gao Yi.

56
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,470
Uncle Jingshi.

57
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,170
The person in this video
is wearing a mask and a hat.

58
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,890
You can't even see his face clearly.

59
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,970
This is a false accusation.

60
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,570
Director Gu told me to do this.

61
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,030
He even paid me

62
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,420
and told me not to let Miss Jian escape.

63
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,590
You have to believe me.

64
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,190
I had no choice.

65
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,310
Uncle Jingshi,

66
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,100
this can't be considered direct evidence.

67
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,300
Someone might have told him to say this.

68
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,860
You're the one who kidnapped me,

69
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,990
and now you're trying to blame others.

70
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,610
You...

71
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,020
We've got both witness and evidence.

72
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:48,980
Are you still going to deny it?

73
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,700
Uncle Jingshi.

74
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,500
Uncle Jingshi, I was wrong.

75
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,430
Ouch, be gentle.

76
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,220
Uncle Jingshi, I'm sorry.

77
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,680
I'm not the one you should
be apologizing to.

78
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,210
Xiangxiang.

79
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,440
Xiangxiang, I'm sorry.

80
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,340
We've been together for so long,

81
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,420
you know me well.

82
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,740
I may be a bit stubborn,

83
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,600
but I'm definitely not a bad person.

84
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,520
I swear.

85
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,490
I swear I'll never do this again.

86
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,930
And I didn't lock you up

87
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,350
to hurt you.

88
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,570
Not to hurt me?

89
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,590
Then who sent the person to kill me?

90
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,960
Kill you?

91
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,790
Gu Jiacheng.

92
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,520
We all have to pay for what we've done.

93
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:17,570
So this time,

94
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,580
I absolutely won't forgive you.

95
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,530
Xiangxiang! Xiangxiang!

96
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,260
Chairman Gu.

97
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,700
I want to leave this place.

98
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,510
Let's go.

99
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,780
Uncle Jingshi.

100
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,680
Xiangxiang.

101
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,720
Oh, by the way,

102
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,070
all this evidence has been
handed over to the police.

103
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,220
You're playing me?

104
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,460
Whether Xiangxiang forgives you or not,

105
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,060
there's no such word
as forgiveness in my book.

106
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,520
Jian Xiangxiang.

107
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,410
You finally did it.

108
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,380
You finally changed the ending.

109
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,060
Gu Jiacheng never dreamed that

110
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,650
the person was even more anxious than him.

111
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,210
And he would try to kill Miss Jian first.

112
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,340
Have Mr. Zhao follow up on this matter.

113
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,210
Yes, sir.

114
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,380
He slipped away again.

115
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:30,070
Boss, you spent all these years
pretending to be in a wheelchair

116
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,990
just to lower that man's guard.

117
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,940
Now that you exposed
yourself early for Miss Jian,

118
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,440
doesn't that mean all our planning

119
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,230
was for nothing?

120
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,070
I know exactly what I'm doing.

121
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,980
You can go now.

122
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,140
Yes, sir.

123
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,760
What's wrong?

124
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,220
I'm fine.

125
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,480
It's okay now.

126
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,440
Thank you.

127
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,490
Thank you for always showing up

128
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,770
when I'm in danger and need help the most.

129
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,480
Thank you.

130
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,560
Congratulations.

131
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,640
You've defied fate

132
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,100
and survived till the end.

133
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,780
The sweeter it is now,

134
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,780
the more painful it will be later.

135
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,799
Boss will get a bad ending.

136
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,809
He's gonna die a terrible death.

137
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:53,730
What happened?

138
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,820
Nothing.

139
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,900
Can you give me a moment alone?

140
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,040
I need some time alone.

141
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,760
Call me if you need anything.

142
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,850
Bullet comments,

143
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:20,990
please.

144
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,100
Can someone tell me

145
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,740
how to change Gu Jingshi's ending?

146
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,610
Why'd they all disappear?

147
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,760
Come back.

148
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,360
Please, I'm begging you.

149
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,740
What are you doing?

150
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,900
Nothing.

151
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,500
Hello.

152
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,160
Excuse me,

153
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,980
do you know how to get to
No. 98, Shanshui East Road?

154
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:43,520
Here's the thing.

155
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,900
I'm delivering crabs to a boss,

156
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,610
but I've been circling

157
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,470
this villa complex forever
and still can't find it.

158
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,440
No. 98 is in Zone 2.

159
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,700
Just ride further in.

160
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,760
Great, thank you.

161
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,650
If you keep freaking out like this,

162
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,930
we'll be late for work.

163
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,510
Okay, let's go then.

164
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,620
Gu Jingshi,

165
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,520
prepare to die!

166
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,420
What are you holding?

167
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,240
What are you trying to do?

168
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,440
Tell me, who are you?

169
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,200
I'm starving.

170
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,660
I just wanted to eat an egg,

171
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,100
is that a crime?

172
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,030
I'm so sorry.

173
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,940
Are you okay?

174
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,060
I'm sorry.

175
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,000
I apologize.

176
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,770
[President's Office]

177
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,460
Xiangxiang, Chairman Gu's legs
have healed.

178
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,380
He looks so tall and handsome.

179
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,530
He must be at least 1.83 meters.

180
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,920
He must've gone for leg surgery

181
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,570
in this trip to Hong Kong.

182
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,410
Yes, I think so.

183
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,730
Standing Chairman Gu

184
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,280
is even more intimidating.

185
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,070
I don't even dare look at him.

186
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:37,850
Hey, Xiangxiang.

187
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,180
Should we

188
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,900
throw a party for Chairman Gu?

189
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,840
Well, I don't know.

190
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,810
Should we ask Gao Yi?

191
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,440
Okay.

192
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,100
Yes.

193
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,180
Good idea. I'll handle it right away.

194
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,400
Chairman Gu, based on what you described,

195
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,730
it sounds like she's suffering from PTSD.

196
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,090
In this condition,

197
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,950
she may keep reliving traumatic memories

198
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,020
and become overly sensitive
to her surroundings.

199
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,700
It's a defense mechanism.

200
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,910
If it goes on,
it could affect her daily life.

201
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,120
Can she recover?

202
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,420
What should I do?

203
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,680
I suggest

204
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,150
you use happy memories

205
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,100
to gradually cover the bad ones.

206
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,420
Alright. Thank you.
