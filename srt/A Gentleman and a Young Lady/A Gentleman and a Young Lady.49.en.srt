[Episode 49]

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,820
Excuse me, Chairman.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,860
Someone's here to interview for the live-in tutor position.

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,430
Is that so?

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,920
I haven't received any resumes.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,750
The thing is, Chairman...

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,550
Chairman, hello.

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,780
I came after seeing the advertisement for the live-in tutor position.

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,580
What are you doing, Ms. Park?

10
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,140
Are you joking with me?

11
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,330
Chairman, I'm being serious.

12
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,880
I've come here after much consideration.

13
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,520
I know you are looking for a tutor.

14
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,420
As the tutor for Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong,

15
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,470
no one else is better than me.

16
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,670
I believe you would know about that as well.

17
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:19,210
Most importantly, Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong like me.

18
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,820
Chairman, I want to work here again.

19
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,350
Please accept me.

20
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,650
Chairman, please only think of the children.

21
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:35,550
Do not consider your personal feelings in making your decision.

22
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,330
I heard what you are saying.

23
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,090
So please leave now.

24
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,880
Yes.

25
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,470
I will wait for your reply, Chairman.

26
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,240
Please call me.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,430
- What did he say?
- He would think about it.

28
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,810
What is there to think about?

29
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,210
All that issue about Chief Jo is cleared up now.

30
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,230
Shouldn't he thank you for wanting to do the job again?

31
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,020
The children love you to bits.

32
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,400
I know.

33
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,170
- Ms. Park!
- Ms. Park!

34
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,160
Se Chan and Se Jong!

35
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,950
What are you doing here, Ms. Park?

36
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,970
Have you come to see us?

37
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,210
I've come to interview for the live-in tutor post.

38
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,020
Because I want to work here again.

39
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,050
Why would you have to interview for it?

40
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:55,280
Why don't you just start working here?

41
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,410
Your dad put out an advertisement for the live-in tutor.

42
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,580
That's why I came for the interview.

43
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,600
Since I resigned from the post, I need to do it again.

44
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,280
Se Jong and Se Chan.

45
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,040
Would you help me get the job here again?

46
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,390
Yes. We will.

47
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,200
But what should we do?

48
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,640
Please give a good word to your dad about me.

49
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,120
That's a given.

50
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,660
Ms. Park, don't worry.

51
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:34,070
My dad will listen to anything I ask.

52
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:39,110
Really? I will count on you, Mr. Se Jong.

53
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:43,490
Ms. Park, can we have a chat?

54
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,660
Jenny.

55
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,290
Ms. Park, are you trying to come back here so you can date my dad again?

56
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:58,690
Yes. It's true that I want to get back with the Chairman again,

57
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,560
but I want to be with you kids as well.

58
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,560
Ms. Park, I welcome you as our live-in tutor.

59
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,660
But, I object to you as my dad's girlfriend.

60
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:16,440
- Jenny.
- I really don't like the idea of you being my dad's girlfriend.

61
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,920
My dad has to meet someone who could be our mother.

62
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,720
But the idea of you becoming our mother.

63
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,960
Can you picture it?

64
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,430
I can't even imagine it.

65
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:35,080
Jenny. That's what I thought at first as well.

66
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,330
But now, I feel confident.

67
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,730
That's why I wasn't scared of dating your dad.

68
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,410
Wow, it's crazy.

69
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,570
Do you really feel confident about becoming our mother?

70
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,690
Do you know the age difference between you and me?

71
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,870
What would people say if I say you are my mother?

72
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:02,480
My friends would mock me, "how can she be your mom?"

73
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,640
Jenny. I don't think the proper age gap makes the mother and daughter relationship.

74
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,710
Rather than being your mother,

75
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,790
I want to be a friend to you all.

76
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,460
A good friend that understands one another.

77
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,440
Jenny. We've gotten along well all this time.

78
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,070
I know we can get along well in the future as well.

79
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:31,560
Also, I have never thought about the Chairman separately from you three.

80
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,000
Amazing.

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,670
The thought of you having such a thought while dealing with us

82
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:45,300
makes me feel really deceived and betrayed.

83
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:02,320
Dad, we are opposed to anyone other than Ms. Park Dan Dan being our live-in teacher.

84
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,180
Me, too.

85
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,780
Se Chan and Se Jong. Ms. Park cannot be.

86
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,060
I will find a better teacher.

87
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,830
We don't need any other teacher.

88
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:18,390
Lee Se Chan. I've explained to you all along.

89
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:22,080
Ms. Park worked hard to put us behind her.

90
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,220
If she comes here again,

91
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,860
she will have to go through a hard time again.

92
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,980
We shouldn't do that out of our own greed.

93
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,630
It's not because of our greed, but she wants to come back.

94
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,420
She wants it, and we want it too.

95
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,610
No is no.

96
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,960
We can't overturn what's already decided.

97
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,400
So you two also please follow my decision.

98
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,710
You are back to being the old dictator of the past.

99
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,770
You are an old man dictator.

100
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,230
I don't like you.

101
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,740
I really don't like the idea of you being my dad's girlfriend.

102
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,300
My dad has to meet someone who could be our mother.

103
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,260
The thought of your becoming my mother.

104
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,570
Can you picture it?

105
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,600
I can't even imagine it.

106
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,350
I can see how Jenny can feel that way.

107
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,920
That's a normal reaction.

108
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,620
I would have done the same.

109
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,950
Chairman, I want to work here again.

110
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,560
Please accept me.

111
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,470
I heard what you are saying. So please leave now.

112
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,980
But what's up with the Chairman?

113
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,380
How could he treat me so business-like?

114
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,660
Did he meet me for the first time? Does he not know me?

115
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,640
"Please leave now?"

116
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,490
When the Chairman does things like that, it's like he's a stranger.

117
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,870
It's really annoying.

118
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,670
I guess he's sorry for treating me that way.
 [Chairman]

119
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,760
Since he called me right away.

120
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,890
Yes, Chairman.

121
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,470
Now?

122
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,610
I will be right there.

123
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,260
Ms. Park.

124
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,460
I will never hire you as our live-in tutor again.

125
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,190
Please do not wait to hear from me.

126
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,170
Chairman.

127
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:10,520
Is that why you called to meet me?

128
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,930
Do you know what you did when you came to our house just now?

129
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,170
Pardon?

130
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:22,210
Se Chan and Se Jong just barely got used to being without you.

131
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,080
But because you suddenly came by and stirred them up,

132
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,470
my children are having a hard time again.

133
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,050
Se Jong's separation anxiety just got settled.

134
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,670
Why would you act this way?

135
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,890
That's why...

136
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,790
You and I should see each other again.

137
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,750
The children want me, too.

138
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:52,320
Ms. Park. We repeated the same conversation over and over.

139
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,840
I don't want to do that again.

140
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,180
If we get together again, everything will be repeated again.

141
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,700
People's prejudice, your father's disapproval,

142
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,130
and Jenny's opposition.

143
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,780
There is nothing but wound for us.

144
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,670
Even so...

145
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,840
I want to be with you.

146
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,140
Ms. Park.

147
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,850
Let's not repeat the same wounds and mistakes.

148
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:37,160
I know it's been hard for you to end our relationship.

149
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,110
But it's been hard and painful for my children and me, too.

150
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,720
So let's not do this again.

151
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,520
I ask that of you.

152
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,210
What's going on?

153
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,900
Did she discharge?

154
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,670
What are you doing here when you should be at the hospital?

155
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,890
You have to do the pre-operation testing to get the surgery.

156
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,780
I'm not going to get the surgery.

157
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,990
What?

158
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:06,290
Are you saying you want to die like this?

159
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:10,490
I will go to the US, take care of things, and live out my last days.

160
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:15,850
Hey, Kim Ji Young, what are you thinking?

161
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,170
You can live if you get the surgery. So why?

162
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,880
Who said I could live if I got the surgery?

163
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,770
You heard it with me what the doctor said. Surgery is the only option right now.

164
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,840
If you don't get the surgery, you might not even have six months.

165
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,800
Ji Young, if you get the surgery, you will live.

166
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,330
You have to do everything you can. You can't give up.

167
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:42,260
So, please. Let's go back to the hospital.

168
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,400
No, I don't want to.

169
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,940
This way or that, I'm going to die anyway.

170
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,190
I could die while getting the surgery.

171
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:56,110
This is the punishment from heaven, and I will receive it.

172
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,880
I will just accept this fate.

173
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,950
I don't want to struggle to live.

174
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:06,390
So please don't come to see me as well.

175
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:09,080
Ji Young.

176
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,110
Don't do this.

177
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,590
Don't become weak.

178
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:17,980
Please don't do this!

179
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:26,070
This kind of disease came to me again because I avoided the punishment last time.

180
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:30,100
It's because I've done so much wrong.

181
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:35,160
So please don't worry about someone like me.

182
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,870
Do you think it'll all end if you die?

183
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,020
What about Dan Dan?

184
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:46,750
If you die like this, you will leave another scar in Dan Dan's heart.

185
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,570
Soo Chul...

186
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:54,290
So, live.

187
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:58,510
If you are sorry to me and Dan Dan, live.

188
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,050
Live and listen to our resentment, at least.

189
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,930
Dad Dan hates you now.

190
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:09,820
But if you die now, it will rip her heart out.

191
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,490
Soo Chul, I'm sorry.

192
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,310
I'm sorry.

193
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,730
I will keep you alive.

194
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,760
You can live.

195
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:34,300
So please, don't be like this, Ji Young.

196
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,680
- What are you doing?
- Oh, dear.

197
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,720
The young people these days kiss each other anywhere.

198
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,310
I like it. It looks beautiful.

199
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,940
It's only for a time. Maybe they are newlyweds.

200
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,690
Wait, Mom.

201
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,760
Isn't that our Mi Rim? Mi Rim?

202
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,990
Yes, it's Mi Rim.

203
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,830
But the man she's kissing is...

204
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,100
Ah, really.

205
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,980
Isn't that our in-law's son?

206
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,120
Yes, it's him! Oh, my!

207
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,750
But why are they in arms and kissing each other?

208
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,710
I don't know.

209
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,670
Wait.

210
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,940
Wait for a second.

211
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,560
- What's wrong, Mom?
- Just stay quiet.

212
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,960
What is it?

213
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,760
Let's go.

214
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,170
Why are they going in there?

215
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,790
I know.

216
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:09,300
Let's get something to eat. I'm hungry.

217
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,560
I'll make egg rolls and grilled sausages.

218
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,830
Then, I will make the tofu-stew.

219
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,860
Okay.

220
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,930
Who could that be? Is it the landlord lady?

221
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,010
Who is it?

222
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,150
Grandma. Aunt.

223
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,800
Aunt-in-law. Grandma.

224
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,920
What are you two doing here?

225
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,860
Are you two living here together?

226
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,860
Is that it?

227
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,720
Oh my, Mi Rim!

228
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,910
Grandma.

229
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:57,060
So, you've been living here together behind our back?

230
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:02,700
Oh, my goodness. Didn't you say you were living with a friend?

231
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,360
Is this in-law the friend?

232
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,830
Yes, Grandma. We are friends.

233
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:13,590
Friends, my foot! When a man and a woman live together.

234
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:16,390
This is not right. Mi Rim, pack your bag now.

235
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:20,100
No, I want to live here.

236
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:25,220
Also, there is no room for me in your house. I'm comfortable here.

237
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,590
Mi Rim, have you gone insane?

238
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,910
Mi Rim. Are you really my granddaughter?

239
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,360
Please leave this place right now, Grandnephew-in-law!

240
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,480
You two shouldn't be together like this.

241
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,690
I'm sorry.

242
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:46,730
Grandma and Aunt-in-law. Can't you pretend you didn't see us?

243
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:50,380
I want to be here too. I can't break up with Mi Rim.

244
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,770
Oh, my dear. What do we do with these two?

245
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,140
- Oh, my world.
- What's going on here?

246
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:00,900
Joon Oh. If your mother finds out about this, she will freak out.

247
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,620
She will pull every strand of Mi Rim's hair.

248
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,750
So please, you two go separate ways.

249
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,090
- No, we won't.
- No, we won't.

250
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,620
- Oh, my.
- Oh, goodness.

251
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,830
What do we do with these kids?

252
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,990
Guys!

253
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:22,940
What on earth is going on? What should we do?

254
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,710
Yes.

255
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,230
This way.

256
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,460
Oppa, it's me.

257
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,830
Yes, Se Ryun.

258
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,310
Hello, Oppa.

259
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:40,110
Oppa, do you remember her?

260
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,590
Aren't you, Ji Min?

261
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,920
Yes, that's right. It's me, Ji Min.

262
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,230
I feel honored that you remembered me.

263
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,480
It's really been a long time.

264
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,120
But what's the occasion?

265
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,720
Oppa, isn't it time for you to change the paintings in the office?

266
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,980
If so, you can do that through Ji Min.

267
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,150
Paintings?

268
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,730
Ji Min wrapped up her work at the gallery in New York a few months ago.

269
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:11,440
And she came back to Korea and working as a curator in her mother's art center.

270
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,950
Is that so?

271
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:17,250
Yes, my mom cajoled me to come back.

272
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,970
Can you give me your business card?

273
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,550
Yes, Oppa.

274
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,390
Here.

275
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,010
I will call you if there is a need.

276
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,990
But Oppa, can you treat us to a meal since it's been a while?

277
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:34,130
It's lunchtime now.

278
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:37,550
Oppa, do you have time?

279
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:40,800
Yes, sure. Let's do that.

280
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:48,290
Oppa, I went to visit your home a lot in high school.

281
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,800
Do you know why?

282
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,050
In high school? Did she?

283
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:58,180
Hey, I told you. He still doesn't know.

284
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:03,290
His sense is really dull in this department.

285
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,080
What are you saying?

286
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,670
The truth is, Ji Min had a huge crush on you when we were young.

287
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:15,750
That's why she came to our house so often. Almost wore out the doorstep.

288
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,320
Is that right?

289
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,560
Yes.

290
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:25,680
Then I went to study abroad in America. But I missed you a lot that I even emailed you.

291
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,500
Did you send an email to me?

292
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:33,740
Yes. But to my disappointment, you never replied.

293
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,960
Is that right?

294
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,150
Hey, my brother was in the military at that time.

295
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:43,880
Still. But do you know what made me most sad?

296
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,910
I searched everywhere and bought you a nice model figure for you.

297
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,940
But I saw that it was in Se Ryun's room.

298
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,720
I was really hurt by that.

299
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,780
So I ended my one-way crush on you quietly.

300
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,020
What should I do? I'm so sorry.

301
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,390
It's okay.

302
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:13,320
Now that I see you, it reminds me of that time, and I feel nostalgic.

303
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,830
Was I so immature back then?

304
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:21,740
Hey, that's already fifteen, no twenty years ago.

305
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,550
Unbelievable, where has the time gone?

306
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:30,920
That's right. A lot of time has passed.

307
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,560
Let's do cheers.

308
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,550
To bless our present!

309
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,820
Cheers!

310
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,030
Yes.

311
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,500
Se Ryun, haven't you gone home?

312
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:02,080
No. I've been chatting with Ji Min nearby until now.

313
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,100
We had a lot to catch up on.

314
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,310
I came to ask you something.

315
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:13,020
It was something I couldn't say over the phone.

316
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,460
What is it?

317
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:21,520
Oppa, Ji Min asked me to tell you that she wants to date you.

318
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,910
What?

319
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:26,920
Since her divorce, she never thought of marrying again.

320
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,290
But after seeing you today, she's changed her mind.

321
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:35,510
She's still attracted to you and asked me to ask you.

322
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,290
It's a little early, right?

323
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,970
Given Ms. Park and all that.

324
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:47,030
No, Se Ryun. Tell her I'd like to see her.

325
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,930
Really?

326
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,370
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

327
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,640
The card isn't working.

328
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,880
It's not working?

329
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,680
Why is that?

330
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,930
Then, try this one.

331
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:12,200
I'm sorry. This one isn't working too.

332
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,810
- This one isn't working either?
- No.

333
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,580
That's odd. Why aren't they working?

334
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,670
Both of the cards show up as suspended cards.

335
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:26,930
What did you just say? It's suspended?

336
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:30,000
That can't be right.

337
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,300
Has he already given up on Ms. Park?

338
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,360
If he's even willing to see Ji Min.

339
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,300
What is it, Mom?

340
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,110
Why did you call?

341
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,320
Se Ryun!

342
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,340
I'm at the Intedugo Hotel right now.

343
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,410
Come here quickly.

344
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:04,450
Have you been staying at the Intedugo Hotel all this time?

345
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,460
What?

346
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,170
Mom, just hang up the phone.

347
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:12,890
Whether you're humiliated or taken to the police station,

348
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,230
I don't care anymore!

349
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,740
My goodness...

350
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,750
What?

351
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,930
4,560,000 won?!

352
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,890
Yes, that's correct.

353
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,500
I'll pay with this card.

354
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:45,600
Thank you.

355
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:51,640
Se Ryun, let's go together!

356
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,240
Mom, do you have to be like this?

357
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,020
You're not in a position to be relaxing at a five-star hotel!

358
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,400
Hey, Lee Se Ryun.

359
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,190
Then am I supposed to go to a rundown motel at my age?

360
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,940
I'm going to reject your calls from now on.

361
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,860
This is it. This is where I draw the line.

362
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,940
All right?

363
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,230
My gosh, Se Ryun! Lee Se Ryun!

364
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:18,880
Lee Se Ryun. What am I supposed to do then?

365
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,120
Where do you want me to go? I have nowhere to go.

366
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,260
Why are you asking me that? Gosh.

367
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,590
Wait for me! Goodness, Se Ryun!

368
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,970
Don't be like this.

369
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,250
I can't go to Se Ryun or Madam Jang.

370
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,130
All of my credit cards have been frozen.

371
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,640
And now I'm completely penniless.

372
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,710
Fine. Everyone is asleep at this hour anyway.

373
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:53,430
Let me go in secret. I'm going to die in this house, no matter what.

374
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:16,100
If we get together again, everything will be repeated again.

375
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,750
People's prejudice,

376
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:22,010
your father's disapproval, and Jenny's opposition.

377
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:25,430
There is nothing but wound for us.

378
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,800
Even so...

379
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,750
I want to be with you, Chairman.

380
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,260
I reserved a table for you at Black Label tomorrow at 12.

381
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,580
I hope things work out with you and Ji Min

382
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,010
since you agreed to meet her.

383
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:56,320
Go with positive thoughts, okay?

384
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:13,300
Ms. Park. I will never hire you as our live-in tutor again.

385
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,890
So don't expect a call regarding that.

386
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:20,030
I'm sure it was tough for you to get over me.

387
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:26,000
But it's been hard and painful for my children and me to get over you, too.

388
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,280
So let's not do this again.

389
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:36,290
Is the Chairman really thinking of ending things with me?

390
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,980
No.

391
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,660
He still likes me.

392
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,160
That's a definite fact.

393
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,930
I can tell by the way he looks at me.

394
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,590
[60th Chicken]

395
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,950
What do we do?

396
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,990
About Mi Rim and Joon Oh.

397
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,730
What are we going to do?

398
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:03,080
It's not like we can physically keep them apart.

399
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,240
Older-sister-in-law can be so naive sometimes.

400
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,020
Joon Oh stays out so much. How did she have no idea?

401
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:13,570
He probably lied, saying he was staying over at a friend's place.

402
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:19,370
She'll probably be furious if she finds out Joon Oh and Mi Rim lives together.

403
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,810
- Younger-sister-in-law.
- Oh, gosh.

404
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:25,220
What did you just say?

405
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,310
Wait.

406
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:34,620
What do you mean Joon Oh is living with Mi Rim?

407
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,910
Are they living together?

408
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,650
Mi Rim.

409
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,600
I think we'll have to tell my mom.

410
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,260
Are you sure you can handle it?

411
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:48,690
Your uncle already caught us, and to Dae Beom Hyung too.

412
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:51,980
We've been caught by Auntie and Grandma too.

413
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:56,260
It's only a matter of time before my mom finds out.

414
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:00,430
She has to know about us eventually anyway.

415
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:03,490
If you're fine with it, then I'm fine too.

416
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,160
All right.

417
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,740
Then let's power through this.

418
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,160
Everything will be solved if we can get my mom's approval.

419
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,470
I'll face it head-on no matter what.

420
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,740
- Mom!
- Ms. Jang!

421
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,190
My goodness! What is all this?

422
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,150
Are you really my Joon Oh?

423
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:28,780
What are you doing here with Mi Rim?

424
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,440
What happened here?

425
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,040
Are you out of your mind?

426
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,270
Mom, I'll explain everything. Calm down.

427
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:40,670
Are you really living here with Mi Rim?

428
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,010
Is that it?

429
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:48,770
That's right, Mom.

430
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:52,430
Oh, my! You're out of your mind!

431
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,220
How could you do this?!

432
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,260
Is this how I raised you?

433
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,790
Please don't do this.

434
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,510
Please calm down.

435
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:03,670
How could you move into a place like this with a woman?

436
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,250
How could you do something like this?

437
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:12,750
You've been deceiving me all this time. Only I didn't know.

438
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,380
My dear in-laws...

439
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,440
How could you do nothing after seeing them like this?

440
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,510
How could you keep me in the dark?

441
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,870
That's a misunderstanding.

442
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:25,480
We just found out about it.

443
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,740
And we tried to talk them out of it.

444
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:33,630
But they were too stubborn, so what could we do?

445
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,220
No.

446
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,220
This is absurd.

447
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,550
This is wrong.

448
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:42,920
My Joon Oh wouldn't do this.

449
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,310
Right, I must be dreaming right now.

450
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:49,280
No!

451
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,880
Mi Rim, I'll be right back.

452
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,390
Mom! Mom!

453
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:59,060
Goodness, what are we going to do about this?

454
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:02,110
See! That's why we told you to end it.

455
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:06,830
What are we going to do?

456
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,090
Aunt... Grandma...

457
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:26,680
Mom, drink some water, and please hear me out.

458
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:38,140
Joon Oh, listen to me.

459
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:43,040
I'll pretend I didn't see anything.

460
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,320
I'll pretend that I never saw

461
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,300
you living in that shabby house with Mi Rim.

462
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,970
I'll erase it from my head,

463
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:54,310
so you should forget about it all, too.

464
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,760
Let's pretend like it never happened.

465
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,890
No, it never happened. It was just a dream. Okay?

466
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,830
Mom.

467
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,660
No matter how much you deny it,

468
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,360
I really like Mi Rim,

469
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,630
and I lived there with her.

470
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:14,840
I've liked her since before you found out we're in-laws with her family.

471
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,840
So please accept it, Mom.

472
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:22,210
Do you really want to see me die?

473
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:25,610
How could you, out of all people, do this to me?

474
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:32,140
I raised you to be pure without any blemishes.

475
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:37,390
How could you taint yourself by living with a woman before marriage?

476
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,330
Mom!

477
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,780
What did you just say?

478
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,590
I tainted myself?

479
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,610
Are Mi Rim and I living together something dirty?

480
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:51,010
Is cohabiting dirty?

481
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:55,070
Is that how you think of me and Mi Rim?

482
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,500
Joon Oh.

483
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,580
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

484
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:04,410
Don't interfere in my life anymore.

485
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:09,380
I'm going to continue living there with Mi Rim.

486
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,770
Joon Oh.

487
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:19,320
Joon Oh! Joon Oh...

488
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:25,650
What's gotten into him?

489
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:29,230
What am I supposed to do?

490
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,540
What do I do?

491
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:36,430
Oppa, I feel like I'm dreaming.

492
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:40,110
I can't believe I'm having a meal like this, just the two of us.

493
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:44,150
When I had a crush on you back in high school,

494
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:49,000
I fantasized about dining with you like this.

495
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,990
Now my dream has finally come true.

496
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:58,150
Oppa, we've finally met each other again after all these years,

497
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:00,450
and we've both been hurt,

498
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,510
so let's not put pressure on ourselves.

499
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:05,490
Let's just meet casually.

500
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:09,930
Sure, let's do that. We can occasionally meet and eat together comfortably

501
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:13,160
and talk about our interests and how we're faring.

502
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,380
I'd like that.

503
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:17,170
We can go to recitals and museums,

504
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:21,530
or go golfing together to see if we're a good match.

505
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:26,330
I have a good feeling about this. Am I moving too fast?

506
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:33,550
But Ji Min, you know I have three kids, right?

507
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:35,600
Of course, I do.

508
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,360
I made a promise to my children

509
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:42,380
that if I were to date someone, they would be the first to know.

510
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:48,420
I can't think of myself separately from my children.

511
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,470
I understand what you mean, Oppa.

512
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:53,440
Se Ryun told me time and time again

513
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,590
how much you value and adore your children.

514
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:01,970
With that being said, would you like to meet them first?

515
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:08,530
You have to get along well with my kids before we can take this any further.

516
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:11,860
Why are you so careful talking about that?

517
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,790
Of course, I should meet them.

518
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,530
I want to see your kids too.

519
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:20,250
I would be happy to meet them even tomorrow, so go ahead and set it up.

520
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:24,000
Okay. Thank you for understanding.

521
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,900
We ate so well at your baby's birthday party. You don't need to treat us again.

522
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:40,200
I'm just thankful. And I wasn't able to talk with you all because I was so busy that day.

523
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,150
Let's go, hurry.

524
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:46,880
And I can use this as an excuse to get some fresh air while my husband watches the baby.

525
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,760
Hello.

526
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:05,060
Ah, yes. Hello.

527
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,040
Excuse me, then.

528
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:22,000
I wonder if that's the Chairman's girlfriend.

529
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,870
Let's go in, Dan Dan.

530
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:28,710
You go in first. I'm going to use the restroom.

531
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,990
Okay.

532
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,640
Who's she to link arms with the Chairman?

533
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,780
Who is that woman?

534
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,520
There's someone you have to meet tomorrow with me.

535
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,230
Who is it?

536
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:02,220
It's your aunt's friend and someone I know from the past.

537
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,120
I'm thinking of dating her.

538
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:12,570
Dad, are you saying you're going to date my aunt's friend?

539
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:17,860
I'm thinking of getting into a serious relationship with her if all of you feel okay after meeting her tomorrow.

540
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,270
It'll be bad if you say you don't like her later on.

541
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:25,720
Dad, it hasn't been too long since you broke up with Ms. Park! How could you meet some other woman?

542
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,210
I don't think this is right at all.

543
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,240
Se Jong, what do you think?

544
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,040
I agree with my brother.

545
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,170
Se Chan and Se Jong, I'm not saying I'm going to move forward with her right away.

546
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,940
I just want you guys to meet her first.

547
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,410
If you say you don't like her after meeting her, I'll reconsider.

548
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:47,190
Let's go see her tomorrow together, okay?

549
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,070
Okay, Dad.

550
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:55,220
Hey, Lee Se Chan, Lee Se Jong, do you want our dad to live alone forever?

551
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:58,490
Dad needs to meet with many people too.

552
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:00,850
Okay, then let's meet her.

553
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:04,090
I'm sure she won't be good as Ms. Park.

554
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:08,570
There will be no girlfriend that's better than Ms. Park.

555
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,570
It feels like spring now.

556
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:19,440
The night air is still cold,

557
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,760
but the wind is gentle. Don't you think so?

558
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,850
Ah, yes. You're right.

559
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:33,310
Dan Dan, to tell you the truth,

560
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:36,610
I'm so happy that I met you again.

561
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:42,930
I liked you when we were in school too. Did you know?

562
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:49,670
Really? I didn't know at all.

563
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:52,290
You're so bad at catching these things.

564
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:56,920
I bought drinks only for you and waited for you whenever you stayed late.

565
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:03,350
I thought you found me comfortable.

566
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:06,040
So, on that note...

567
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:10,420
Dan Dan, would you like to go out with me?

568
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,080
I'm sorry.

569
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:22,600
I like someone else.

570
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,320
Is it the Chairman from earlier?

571
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,090
I knew it.

572
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:32,470
That's why I'm telling you now.

573
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:37,180
That Chairman and you don't fit together.

574
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,680
And that Chairman has another woman.

575
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,240
Sunbae.

576
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:48,120
I don't know what makes you say the Chairman and I don't fit together,

577
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:52,040
but I liked him, and I still haven't gotten over him.

578
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:57,520
I don't think it's right to accept you when I have feelings for someone else.

579
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,880
I would like to keep our relationship as it is.

580
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,470
- Dan Dan–
- I'm really sorry.

581
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,650
I'll get going first.

582
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,910
Chairman, thank you for coming out so late.

583
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:57,420
Ms. Park, what is it that you have to ask me?

584
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:01,630
Chairman, who was that woman from today?

585
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,520
What is her relationship with you?

586
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,180
What relationship do you have with her where she can link arms with you?

587
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,400
Why do you need to know?

588
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,780
Chairman, why are you letting anyone hold arms with you?

589
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:18,220
Who is that woman?

590
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:23,410
It's not just anyone. She's someone that I'm dating.

591
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:29,760
Someone you're dating?

592
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,360
Yes.

593
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:35,400
We are similar in age and have a similar background.

594
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,420
So I'm planning to get into a serious relationship with her.

595
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:45,000
So I hope you meet someone that fits you too.

596
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,430
Chairman, what are you talking about right now?

597
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:55,000
You're going out with her because you're similar in age and have a similar background?

598
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,730
Not because you like her?

599
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:04,220
I said no to someone who said they liked me because

600
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:08,100
I still like you.

601
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:15,110
It's not right for them to meet a new person when you like someone else.

602
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,090
So are you here to say this?

603
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,740
Yes.

604
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,180
Chairman, you're trying to get closure with me

605
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:30,930
and get rid of me by meeting another woman, aren't you?

606
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:34,880
I'll be straightforward. That's wrong.

607
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,070
Meeting another woman when you still like me

608
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:41,000
is not something you should do to that woman.

609
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,080
- Ms. Park–
- Go ahead,

610
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,170
say whatever you need to say.

611
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:49,000
I handle my own business.

612
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,540
You seem to have said everything you needed to.

613
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:55,900
I'm going to head in now. Go home safely.

614
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,860
Chairman, I'm telling you,

615
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:03,390
it won't work out with her because you like me!

616
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:06,690
You'll see I'm right!

617
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:27,750
Those damn people... Were they lying to me the whole time?

618
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,350
[Tasty 60th Chicken]

619
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:38,430
In-law. When did you find out about this?

620
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:41,300
How could you leave me out when you all knew about it?

621
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,510
So were you going to lie to me

622
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:46,750
and make Joon Oh your son-in-law?

623
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,580
Sister-in-law, was that the plan?

624
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,540
No, no.

625
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,310
I told you, we found out yesterday too.

626
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:58,200
You should've told me then. Why didn't you tell me right away?

627
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,910
We were trying to make them split up before you found out.

628
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:05,230
But then Joon Oh said he couldn't break up with her at all. So what could we have done?

629
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:10,220
And Joon Oh said that extended in-laws can legally get married.

630
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,250
What?

631
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:15,000
- Did my Joon Oh say that?
- Yes.

632
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,930
My mom and I heard it together.

633
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:22,010
I won't accept them.

634
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:24,440
Of course.

635
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,410
It doesn't make sense. We don't accept it either.

636
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:30,190
How could in-laws become in-laws?

637
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:33,600
- I'm totally against it.
- Yes, Sister-in-law.

638
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,610
Please, persuade Joon Oh,

639
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:39,700
and stop him from dating Mi Rim.

640
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:41,830
Okay.

641
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:44,580
Well, I should.

642
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,410
What did I just hear?

643
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:48,400
What's this about Joon Oh and Mi Rim?

644
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,690
Soo Chul, you didn't know either.

645
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:55,670
Soo Chul, what are we going to do?

646
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:59,890
Mi Rim and Joon Oh were living together behind our backs.

647
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:01,780
What?

648
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:04,340
Were they living together?

649
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:20,890
Hyung. I don't know what it is,

650
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:23,700
but I think something's happening over there again.

651
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,480
It looks serious.

652
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,390
You're right. I wonder what's up.

653
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:32,140
I don't think that family is good.

654
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:35,920
I thought Dan Dan was good for Hyun Bin because I adore her,

655
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,930
but I'm concerned.

656
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:41,710
It seems like something happens in that family every day.

657
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:44,240
If Hyun Bin marries that family,

658
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,930
he won't survive a day.

659
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:51,050
Why do you worry about their household?

660
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:54,150
We can just bring Dan Dan.

661
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:57,810
You worry too much.

662
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:07,290
Joon Oh and Mi Rim,

663
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:10,290
what were you thinking? Living together without letting the adults know.

664
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:14,560
Joon Oh, you tell me. What are you planning to do?

665
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:20,700
We were dating before my mom and you found each other.

666
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,970
We don't think it was wrong for us to have lived together.

667
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:26,010
- You little punk!
- Noona, stop.

668
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:32,650
What's wrong with living with someone you like? Living with someone you don't like is wrong.

669
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:34,410
We didn't do anything wrong.

670
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:39,220
I'm going to keep dating Mi Rim.

671
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:42,610
So stop telling us what to do based on the adult's standards.

672
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:49,590
I'm all grown up, and I'm at an age where I can live independently without parental agreement and even marry.

673
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:52,340
Are you saying you did a great job?

674
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:54,480
You're not even dry behind the ears,

675
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,330
and how dare you live together!?

676
00:46:57,330 --> 00:47:01,760
Mom, we were there for each other when we were suffering.

677
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,270
So don't speak of us so easily.

678
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:11,190
And you don't have the right to judge us even if you're family and adults.

679
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:14,230
- Let's go, Mi Rim.
- What? Hey!

680
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:17,290
- Joon Oh!
- We'll get going.

681
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:20,020
- Hey! Joon Oh!
- Mi Rim!

682
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:22,760
What do we even...

683
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:26,880
Oh, my goodness...

684
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,940
I mean, Soo Chul, why is Joon Oh acting like this?

685
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,820
He's not that kind of person.

686
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:35,710
Oh my, now that I saw that,

687
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:39,640
I can see that Joon Oh was the one that lured Mi Rim.

688
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,320
What's going to happen to Mi Rim?

689
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,610
After all that happened,

690
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:47,770
shouldn't Joon Oh be responsible for Mi Rim?

691
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:51,610
In-law, what do you mean he should be responsible?

692
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:54,370
How could you say that in modern times?

693
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:57,850
It's not the Joseon dynasty or something.

694
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:02,720
I mean, the man must take responsibility just because they lived together?

695
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:07,030
- That's nonsense!
- It's not nonsense!

696
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:10,660
Joon Oh ruined our Mi Rim's future marriage!

697
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,640
And they're living together right now.

698
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,280
Shouldn't they get a marriage registration as soon as possible?

699
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,150
Oh, my goodness!

700
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:20,640
Marriage registration!?

701
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,240
How could you say such a terrible thing!

702
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:30,480
Do you think I raised Joon Oh so preciously just to give him to that kind of girl?

703
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,700
Joon Oh is a medical student.

704
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:39,700
You needed to bring three keys back in the day if you wanted a doctor as your son-in-law.

705
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:44,000
How dare you think of snatching him up?

706
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,100
My goodness, how could you talk this way?

707
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:54,040
- Mom...
- Our Mi Rim is also a precious granddaughter to me.

708
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,110
How could you say that?

709
00:48:57,110 --> 00:49:02,180
Our Mi Rim lost both her parents on the same day and time to a car accident...

710
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:04,520
She's a poor child...

711
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,020
Don't be like this to her.

712
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:11,800
Do you know how kind Mi Rim is?

713
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:15,040
I wasn't able to raise her as precious as you did with your son,

714
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:19,320
but she's a precious granddaughter that I raised with my love.

715
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:23,150
Oh my, oh my...

716
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:25,960
What is all this?

717
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,930
Soo Chul, what is all this?

718
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:34,360
How can you and I become in-laws?

719
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:40,820
I was fixing up next door to let you move in.

720
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:43,720
I really...

721
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,840
I don't think I can see you for a while.

722
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,700
Oh really, what is all this!?

723
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,850
Noona. Noona!

724
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:55,600
- Noona! Noona!
- Older-sister-in-law...

725
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,800
- Noona!
- Mom,

726
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,760
what did she just say? She's fixing up next door?

727
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,590
What do we do?

728
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:04,350
It's all because of Mi Rim.

729
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:07,810
Now we can't live in her house!

730
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:11,770
You idiot! That's not the problem right now!

731
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:14,750
She's looking down on Mi Rim like that!

732
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:18,000
I can't allow this!

733
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,810
My goodness...

734
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:40,650
Why didn't Ms. Yeoju fry some meat?

735
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:43,260
So annoying.

736
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:02,480
I thought I was going to starve to death.

737
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:10,740
This is so good.

738
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:34,350
What's this?

739
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:39,340
Did someone make bibimbap last night and eat it?

740
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:44,320
Wait, there's no one who'd eat this kind of bibimbap in this house.

741
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,070
That's weird.

742
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:50,130
Who ate this so cleanly?

743
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,160
Good morning.

744
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,300
Yes, Chairman. Good morning.

745
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:01,850
Chairman,

746
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:06,470
did you eat bibimbap last night by any chance?

747
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:08,380
Excuse me?

748
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,780
N-n-no, it's nothing.

749
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:13,890
Chairman would never do that.

750
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,330
Oh, right. Last time Jenny and Se Chan said they went to Ms. Park's house

751
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:25,410
and enjoyed having bibimbap.

752
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:28,300
Could it have been the kids?

753
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,840
Excuse me, what's going on here?

754
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,440
What happened to the people that used to live here?

755
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:57,020
I don't know. We're doing construction on it because it's an empty house.

756
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,100
Excuse me? An empty house?

757
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,480
Yes. No one lives here.

758
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,270
Thank you.

759
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:12,640
The number you have dialed is not in service.

760
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,810
Please check the–

761
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:24,680
Hello.

762
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:28,150
Has Ms. Jo Sarah come here recently by any chance?

763
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:32,160
Ms. Jo Sarah? No, she hasn't.

764
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,680
Ms. Sarah left this job a long time ago.

765
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:40,040
Thank you.

766
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:44,950
[Seoul Prison]

767
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,120
Thank you for the money.

768
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:58,340
Mom... Why did you do it?

769
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:04,870
I did stupid, dumb, idiotic things because I wanted to be with Se Jong,

770
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:09,070
but why did you commit that?

771
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:11,760
Because I was sorry.

772
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,590
I did it because I was sorry.

773
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:19,800
What?

774
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,070
What do you mean?

775
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:27,220
You gave your youth to that family.

776
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:30,880
But how could they just kick you out like that?

777
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,120
It was unfair.

778
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:37,120
It was unfair, so unfair, that's why I did it!

779
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:45,080
Mi Sook told us to move out right around that time,

780
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:50,890
so... I went to Dae Ran.

781
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:55,970
Dae Ran, who has a pile of gold in her safe,

782
00:54:55,970 --> 00:55:01,300
and I asked if she could lend me just 200 million won, but she said she has no such money.

783
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:06,440
So I lost my mind.

784
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:12,720
Sarah... I must've been possessed or something.

785
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:17,390
I'm sorry, Sarah.

786
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:20,370
I'm so sorry.

787
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:25,020
Mom...

788
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:31,970
I'm not going to come to see you anymore.

789
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:34,390
Sarah...

790
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:37,260
When you get out of here,

791
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:42,500
you shouldn't look for me as well.

792
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,100
Sarah, what are you saying?

793
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:53,400
Mom, you're embarrassed by me,

794
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,910
and I'm embarrassed by you.

795
00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:04,350
So you and I should live on our own.

796
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:13,390
I came for the last time to say this.

797
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:18,810
I'm going to go now.

798
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:23,660
Take care of your health.

799
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:34,280
Sarah... Sarah...

800
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:39,430
Sarah, I'm sorry...

801
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:43,560
You're mom's sorry...

802
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:50,060
I'm so sorry, Sarah...

803
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:51,820
Sarah...

804
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:55,990
I'm sorry...

805
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:01,630
I did it wrong, Sarah...

806
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:59,030
What do we do with Mi Rim?

807
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:03,960
Mom, everything Joon Oh and Mi Rim said was right.

808
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:08,200
Who are we to make a fuss when they're staying together because they like each other.

809
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:12,990
That's what I think. They're not saying they'd get married right away either.

810
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,200
I'm worried because of the in-law.

811
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,880
If they break up, Mi Rim is the only one who'd be affected.

812
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,200
It's still a hard world for women.

813
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,220
If I get reborn, I want to be born in France.

814
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:29,150
There's no disadvantage for women even if people live together before marriage.

815
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:32,100
Do you want to be reborn in the first place?

816
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:36,050
But where did my husband go after leaving the store alone?

817
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:38,800
Hey, where did your dad go?

818
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:43,190
He called a while ago and said he couldn't come because he had to take care of something.

819
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:45,920
What does he have to take care of this early in the morning?

820
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,000
- Okay.
- I'm going on a delivery.

821
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:54,240
He has kept leaving the store recently.

822
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,690
Why is it so bugging me?

823
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:04,620
The patient is done with the tests.

824
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:06,720
Thank you.

825
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:28,390
What is this?

826
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:31,430
Ginger tea. Try it.

827
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:36,920
It's good for the immune system. It should be tasty because I put some honey in it too.

828
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:44,030
How is it?

829
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:46,370
It's tasty.

830
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:50,680
Don't think about giving up again, okay?

831
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:55,670
The doctor also said that the patient's will is important.

832
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:58,150
Be strong.

833
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:03,280
Since you got tested today, you should get surgery if they say it's possible.

834
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,900
Okay?

835
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:07,090
Okay.

836
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:11,830
You have to eat well to get through surgery.

837
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:18,480
I'll stay beside you until the end like last time, so trust me and do as I say.

838
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:23,090
But what if your wife finds out about this?

839
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:26,350
She won't just sit back.

840
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:30,150
I'll take care of it, so don't worry.

841
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:33,780
She'll understand if she finds out you're sick.

842
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:36,320
She's not a harsh person.

843
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:40,340
Drink some more.

844
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:52,290
Yes, Se Chan.

845
01:00:52,290 --> 01:00:56,060
Ms. Park. I'm so upset.

846
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,310
Why? What's wrong?

847
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:03,160
I think my dad has a new girlfriend.

848
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:04,440
What?

849
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:10,350
I thought you'd be back because you came to interview for the job,

850
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:14,040
but my dad said you wouldn't come back.

851
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:19,500
I think it's because my dad has a new girlfriend.

852
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:25,470
He said he's going to introduce us to his new girlfriend at the pasta place we went to last time,

853
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:29,300
but I really don't want to go.

854
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:35,520
Even if my dad gets a new girlfriend and we get a new teacher,

855
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,480
I'll never forget you.

856
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,630
I won't betray you.

857
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:48,520
Okay. Thank you, Se Chan.

858
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:55,250
Ms. Park, even if it's just us, can you meet outside with Se Jong and me?

859
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:58,660
Okay. Let's do that.

860
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:11,980
Say hello when she arrives, okay?

861
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:32,550
Welcome. This is Ms. An Ji Min.

862
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:34,700
Hello, kids.

863
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:38,150
This is Lee Jenny, my oldest daughter,

864
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:41,530
Lee Se Chan, the middle child, and the youngest, Lee Se Jong.

865
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:43,660
Kids, say hello.

866
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:45,210
Hello.

867
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:47,570
Nice to meet you.

868
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:57,450
I ordered what the kids like first.

869
01:02:57,450 --> 01:02:59,690
Okay, that's good.

870
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:06,920
Dad, let's cheers to celebrate this meeting.

871
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:10,310
Shall we?

872
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:13,390
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

873
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:24,250
Why don't you try some food?

874
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:29,640
How old are you?

875
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,730
I'm twelve.

876
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,730
Excuse me for a moment.

877
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:11,280
Dad, where did you go?

878
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:16,940
I had something urgent to take care of, so I was on the phone for a moment.

879
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:21,750
Your kids are very quiet and well-behaved.

880
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:24,110
They are at the age to be mischievous.

881
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:27,680
It's not because you don't like me, is it?

882
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:32,220
I worked really hard on my style today before I left.

883
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,500
It's not that. They're just shy.

884
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,370
Right?

885
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:51,330
Did the kids get home safe?

886
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:54,780
Yes. I just came back from dropping them off at home.

887
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:59,130
You had something to say?

888
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:07,530
Ji Min, I actually have someone I used to like,

889
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:10,260
and I don't think I'm done with those feelings.

890
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:14,220
I don't think it's right to go out with you in this state.

891
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:19,460
I'm sorry, Ji Min.

892
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:28,750
I'm a little relieved to hear you saying that.

893
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:32,530
To be honest, I was a little surprised when I saw the kids.

894
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:36,430
I knew you had three kids, of course,

895
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:42,380
but seeing them there in real life was different from thinking about them.

896
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:49,310
So I was about to tell you I'm not confident about it either.

897
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:52,660
Is that so?

898
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:58,900
But I feel less guilty because of what you said.

899
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:00,950
You don't have to feel guilty.

900
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:04,490
It was good to see you anyway, Ji Min.

901
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:05,940
Me, too.

902
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:10,170
I hope you meet someone good.

903
01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:12,790
Thank you.

904
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:55,570
Do you know what you did when you came to our house?

905
01:06:55,570 --> 01:07:02,560
Se Chan and Se Jong just barely got used to being without you.

906
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:07,480
But because you suddenly came by and stirred them up, my children are having a hard time again.

907
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:12,340
Se Jong's separation anxiety just got settled. Why would you act this way?

908
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:14,740
Cheers.

909
01:08:01,350 --> 01:08:03,510
It's me.

910
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:12,750
I'm coming for the last time because I have something to say to you.

911
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:17,250
Go ahead.

912
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:25,320
Chairman, you said you wanted to break up with me

913
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:28,820
because you felt guilty for me suffering and getting hurt

914
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:32,150
due to the fact that I was going out with you.

915
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:36,480
You told me to meet someone that's blessed by everyone.

916
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:42,280
But what you said was wrong.

917
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:47,630
No matter what pain and suffering came to me,

918
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:51,320
even if people pointed at and judged me,

919
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:56,120
I was happy because I was beside you.

920
01:08:56,120 --> 01:09:01,840
And I wasn't scared because you were beside me.

921
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:08,100
So until now, I didn't think any of that was a struggle.

922
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,210
Ms. Park...

923
01:09:14,210 --> 01:09:19,350
But Chairman, do you know that?

924
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:27,230
The person who hurt me the most was you.

925
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:37,900
The person who hurt me the most is no one else and nothing else but you.

926
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:42,650
About me, or my feelings,

927
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:45,500
you don't know anything about it.

928
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:50,110
Because of you acting like that,

929
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:55,190
it feels like my heart is getting ripped out.

[Young Lady and Gentleman]

955
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:21,680
Why is my dad making it so difficult by liking Ms. Park when everyone is against her?

956
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:26,290
Your dad has three children. It'll be hard to find someone who'd like your dad for who he is.

957
01:12:26,290 --> 01:12:28,000
Ajussi, what are you doing?

958
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,710
Take it, I said! I'm not a beggar!

959
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:31,310
You're pregnant right now, Sarah.

960
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:34,360
I don't want to receive something like this from you.

961
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:35,490
Where's your dad?

962
01:12:35,490 --> 01:12:37,650
Dad said he'd be late because he had something to take care of.

963
01:12:37,650 --> 01:12:40,330
Did that woman actually not go to the US?

964
01:12:40,330 --> 01:12:43,820
