00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,470
[Episode 40]

2
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,000
Yes.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,270
As you'd requested, I've found out about Ms. Park Dan Dan's biological mother.

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,520
Have you?

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,800
Her mother's name is Kim Ji Young.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,590
Kim... Ji Young?

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,120
We looked into the hospital records where Ms. Park was born.

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,090
Her mother's name is recorded as Kim Ji Young.

9
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,830
So we traced Kim Ji Young.

10
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:41,420
But we only found that she left for the US less than three months after giving birth.

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:48,800
Her whereabouts after that are a bit hazy but would you like us to keep looking?

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:01:02,270
I heard that my mom abandoned me and ran away when I was an infant less than 100 days old.

13
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,530
Ms. Park.

14
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,420
I don't want to look for the mother who abandoned me.

15
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:14,080
Chairman, please cancel the search for my mom.

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,170
No, it's enough.

17
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,400
Thank you.

18
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,120
Kim Ji Young?

19
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,380
The US?

20
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,930
Is it Anna Noona?

21
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,430
What am I thinking?

22
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,830
Kim Ji Young is a common name.

23
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:50,750
I guess my mom was a terrible person that I couldn't even meet.

24
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,080
But Chairman.

25
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:59,350
Even if everyone says my mom is a bad person,

26
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,070
I still want to find her.

27
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:09,310
I want to see her just once, even from the back.

28
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,010
Hello?

29
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,270
Please locate Ms. Park Dan Dan's mother, Kim Ji Young, as soon as possible.

30
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,630
Yes, please.

31
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,110
Dan Dan agreed to wrap up everything in that house by the end of the week.

32
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:40,320
Please hurry and finish the documentation to go to the US before she changes her mind.

33
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,070
Do it as quickly as possible.

34
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:48,030
Okay. I will look into a flight for next week.

35
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,850
Does that mean I can meet with Dan Dan now?

36
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,550
Yes, go ahead.

37
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,720
But don't forget what I told you.

38
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,970
Okay. I won't be found out.

39
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,900
I will be careful and more careful.

40
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,690
I will make sure she doesn't ever find out I'm her mother.

41
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,940
I promise.

42
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,290
Oh my, those two, they are meeting again.

43
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,690
Okay, I need to secure evidence.

44
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,840
There is something not right about these two.

45
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,200
- Hyung, Hyung.
- Hey, you.

46
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,480
Where have you been instead of sweeping here?

47
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,410
Look, look at this.

48
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:01,930
I didn't think Mr. Park was that kind of person, but he met up with that woman again.

49
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,730
Oh my. It really is Mr. Park.

50
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,920
Look at the vibe between Mr. Park and this woman.

51
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,700
Doesn't it look like an affair?

52
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,250
Mr. Ma.

53
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,600
What do you mean? Are you talking about my Soo Chul?

54
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,820
This is CEO Anna with my Soo Chul.

55
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,900
So, are you saying you know the woman?

56
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,400
Of course. I know her very well.

57
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,410
But did you say these two were having an affair?

58
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,910
Pardon? Aigoo, no, we didn't.

59
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,400
He was just talking nonsense.

60
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,210
It's not nonsense.

61
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:42,320
They looked strange to my eyes.

62
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:45,160
Where was this taken?

63
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,730
It's the coffee shop next to the vet over there.

64
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,730
You reckless bastard.

65
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:57,590
I can't ignore this. I should call Mr. Park and let him know about this.

66
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,330
You can't do this, at least for social justice.

67
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:05,610
What if a family gets destroyed because of us?

68
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,960
Why is that because of us? It's because of Mr. Park, who had an affair.

69
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,240
He really was with her.

70
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,730
Honey.

71
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:33,450
Why are you looking at her so longingly? Have you been seeing her secretly?

72
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,470
Have you been having an affair with Anna Kim?

73
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,130
What are you saying?

74
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,960
Then why are you meeting with her? When you've decided not to go to the US?

75
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,080
I had to see her because of Dan Dan.

76
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,660
Dan Dan? What about Dan Dan?

77
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,250
Why are you acting like this on the street? Let's talk at home.

78
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:03,190
What? Is Dan Dan going to the US with CEO Anna next week?

79
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,760
Yes.

80
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,460
That's why I met up with CEO Anna, because of Dan Dan.

81
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,310
If that was the case, you should have told me.

82
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,140
My daughter is going to the US next week, and why did I not know that until now as her mother?

83
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,730
Do you even think of me as your wife?

84
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,040
Things happened very quickly.

85
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,370
I was going to tell you when everything was decided.

86
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:28,110
But why does everything have to be in such a rush?

87
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,160
It's not like she's going to Jeju Island.

88
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,810
If Dan Dan stays in Korea, she won't be able to end it with Chairman Lee.

89
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:39,880
So I met with CEO Anna to make the request since she's going back to the US next week.

90
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,810
Father, did Dan Dan say she would go to the US?

91
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,650
Yes.

92
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:52,550
Wasn't she saying she would never break up with Chairman Lee? How did she agree to go?

93
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:59,680
I told her that if she goes to the US for three years to study and work

94
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,560
and still can't forget Chairman Lee, I will reconsider their relationship.

95
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,800
So she agreed.

96
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,140
Even so, I'm grateful to the CEO.

97
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,420
She's willing to take Dan Dan with her.

98
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,350
Yes.

99
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,540
But Noona, how could you say such absurd things about my brother-in-law?

100
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,860
What? An affair?

101
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,320
You are such a troublemaker. A troublemaker.

102
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,080
Is Soo Chul someone who'd do such a thing?

103
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,370
There would be no misunderstanding if he told me first.

104
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,980
The younger boss at the Jokbal restaurant said something strange.

105
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,360
That younger boss is bad.

106
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,510
He goes around gossiping.

107
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:46,830
The older boss is decent.

108
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:51,820
If you end up splitting with Soo Chul, you can go live with the younger boss at the Jokbal restaurant.

109
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,060
Mom!

110
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,430
Dan Dan must be busy getting ready to go to the US.

111
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,890
- How come she's not home?
- That's true.

112
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:07,280
She hasn't told the children about it yet, so after that, she would wrap up her work and come home.

113
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,760
The children seemed to like her a lot.

114
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,120
I think Unni will be crying when she's leaving the house.

115
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:38,970
I really can't tell the children I am leaving.

116
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:44,600
How about if I tell them when you find the new teacher?

117
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,620
I will tell the children.

118
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,830
I think it would be better if I told them.

119
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,450
Okay, I get it.

120
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:19,750
Se Chan. Se Jong.

121
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:28,790
Ms. Park and I have agreed to go our separate ways.

122
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,970
So she will stop working here.

123
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,960
You can't hold her back this time.

124
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,320
It's because she's going to the US with CEO Anna Kim next week.

125
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,730
For her future, let's let her go, okay?

126
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:57,030
I will tell Jenny about this separately.

127
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:01,610
Since she doesn't know about us, I will only tell her about Ms. Park leaving the job.

128
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,090
You know what I am saying, right?

129
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:11,110
You and Ms. Park broke up because Ms. Park's father was against you two, wasn't it?

130
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,680
Right? This doesn't make any sense!

131
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,770
Se Chan.

132
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,410
People can't live alone.

133
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,650
You also live with me, Jenny, and Se Jong.

134
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:35,070
Ms. Park also has a family she loves.

135
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:38,630
A family is the biggest shelter for a person.

136
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,680
So if the family opposes until the end,

137
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,190
even if you love each other very much, you can't just push ahead.

138
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:50,600
I know you and Se Jong like Ms. Park very much.

139
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,940
I am very sorry for saying these things.

140
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,190
Why are you sorry?

141
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,350
It's not your fault that things turned out this way.

142
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,100
Ms. Park told me this a while ago.

143
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,620
When you meet someone, you'll have to say goodbye eventually.

144
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,650
That's why it happened.

145
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:13,870
It's okay since it's not your fault.

146
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,990
Yes.

147
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:35,420
Se Chan. Se Jong.

148
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:40,150
Ms. Park. We just heard everything from my dad.

149
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,920
That you will be leaving us.

150
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:48,100
Ms. Park, are you really going to the US?

151
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,160
Se Chan. Se Jong.

152
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,580
I am sorry.

153
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,650
I am so sorry.

154
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,120
Don't be sorry. We are still young,

155
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,580
but we understood everything that my dad said.

156
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,850
So, please do not be sorry.

157
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:11,290
Ms. Park, please be happy in the US.

158
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,730
Thank you, Se Chan and Se Jong.

159
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:26,180
Se Chan, Se Jong, I will come back in three years.

160
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:31,090
So please be healthy until then.

161
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,480
Are you really going to quit working here?

162
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,810
Is that why you are packing your bags?

163
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,160
That is, Jenny... I will explain everything.

164
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,550
How can you quit overnight like this?

165
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,650
I didn't know you were as irresponsible as this.

166
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,360
I am honestly disappointed.

167
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,900
Jenny.

168
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,940
Can we talk, please?

169
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:29,100
I don't want to say anything to you.

170
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,830
Jenny.

171
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:35,490
I am going to the US with CEO Anna.

172
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:38,290
That's why I had to quit.

173
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:42,540
I couldn't tell you sooner because it was a sudden decision.

174
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,670
I am really sorry, Jenny.

175
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,340
You said you would stay until March.

176
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,540
How can you break the promise unilaterally?

177
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,140
I don't want to see you. Please get out of my room.

178
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,750
You don't know anything to be speaking like that.

179
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,010
You know how much Ms. Park loves us.

180
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,980
Don't you think she had an unavoidable reason to do this?

181
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,960
A reason? What kind of a reason?

182
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,730
Never mind, she has her reasons.

183
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,720
So, don't upset her feelings anymore!

184
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,300
That's why I am asking you to tell me.

185
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,200
Hyung, please don't.

186
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,530
Ms. Park. Please tell us.

187
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,570
What are the reasons?

188
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,500
No, Jenny.

189
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,080
The date for the US departure moved up.

190
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,540
I'm so sorry, Jenny.

191
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,160
I am sorry.

192
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,630
Noona, why are you acting like this?

193
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:50,410
Even if we can't let her go happily, we shouldn't make her sad.

194
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:54,320
How do you think she feels leaving us behind?

195
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,180
Yes.

196
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,660
Jenny.

197
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,730
Ms. Park.

198
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:21,700
I am sure you have a reason why you had to do this.

199
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,080
I'm sorry for acting terribly.

200
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,770
It's not because I hate you.

201
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:32,010
I don't want to say goodbye to you.

202
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:35,760
But when you said you were leaving suddenly,

203
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,000
I was so sad. That's why.

204
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,810
Maybe I'm still more immature than Se Chan and Se Jong.

205
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:48,670
I am really sorry, Ms. Park.

206
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:53,490
No, Jenny. I'm the one who's sorry.

207
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:56,970
Please look after Se Chan and Se Jong.

208
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,940
And you have to take good care of yourself too.

209
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,710
I trust you, Jenny.

210
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,790
- Ms. Park.
- Ms. Park.

211
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:44,670
Ms. Park...

212
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,220
Yes.

213
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,240
Oh my dear, what brings you to my room?

214
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,490
Madam. Thank you for everything until now.

215
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:05,980
I will be leaving after this week.

216
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:10,830
Oh my! Are you leaving? Really?

217
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,410
Yes. I will be going to the US next week.

218
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,240
The US?

219
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,390
Why all of a sudden?

220
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,220
Is Young Gook sending you there?

221
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,620
No, Madam. I got a job in CEO Anna's company.

222
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,090
I will be leaving with her.

223
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,750
Oh, CEO Anna.

224
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,830
Then...

225
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,460
What happens with Young Gook?

226
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,950
Did you split? Did you break up?

227
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,080
Yes.

228
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,490
Oh, really!

229
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,400
You made the right decision!

230
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,080
It's good that you broke up with him.

231
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,550
Yes, you and Young Gook are really not a good match.

232
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,160
That's the right thing to do.

233
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,370
Maybe because you're young, you're good at understanding my words.

234
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,140
With your sensibility, you will do well in the US, too.

235
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,710
I hope you achieve the American Dream there.

236
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:11,560
I hope you meet a guy of your age over there, get married, and have children.

237
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,620
I will get going.

238
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,740
Okay.

239
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,500
It feels liberating.

240
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,470
I feel alive now.

241
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,370
Oh, my...

242
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,030
Ms. Park, what's this?

243
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:42,000
Is this a goodbye gift?

244
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,970
You've looked after me and stood by my side all this time.

245
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:49,010
Thank you very much.

246
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:53,430
Thank you. It was nice to have you since I could rely on you.

247
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,220
It's such a shame for you to go. I'm sad.

248
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,420
But how did you decide to go to the US all of a sudden?

249
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,760
Who are you going with?

250
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,210
I got a job at CEO Anna's company.

251
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,200
So I will be leaving with her next week.

252
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,810
Really? That's great.

253
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,380
She's a really good person.

254
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,940
Yes, she is.

255
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,670
She's always treated me well, like a daughter.

256
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:23,530
Maybe she's been extra good to you because she has no family.

257
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,090
According to the lady who worked here before me,

258
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:30,960
CEO Anna went to the US by herself to become successful when she was young and lived a hard life.

259
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,170
But then, she got in a car accident and almost died.

260
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:38,720
She had plastic surgeries on her face more than ten times due to a severe injury.

261
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,010
Plastic surgeries?

262
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,480
- Really?
- You saw it yourself.

263
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,610
When Chairman turned 22 years old again, he didn't recognize her and kicked her out of the house.

264
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,820
Ah, that's why he did that.

265
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,060
I thought that was a bit strange at the time.

266
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,210
I didn't know the background story.

267
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,010
How fortunate it is that she's a huge success.

268
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:04,860
Ms. Park. It might be much better

269
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:09,160
for your long-term future to go to the US with CEO Anna.

270
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,480
You made the right decision.

271
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,120
Ms. Park.

272
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,820
It's all up to your mindset.

273
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,370
Forget about everything here.

274
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:23,340
And be happy in the US.

275
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,910
Yes.

276
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,460
Thank you.

277
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,540
What? A goodbye trip?

278
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,470
Ms. Park has gone through a lot because of us.

279
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,740
We can't just let her go like this.

280
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,940
It's Friday tomorrow. So let's all go to the vacation home, and go fishing,

281
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,260
play games, and do barbecue.

282
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,910
That would be a great goodbye trip.

283
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,970
I don't know.

284
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:58,170
Ms. Park won't be comfortable unless you agree.

285
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:02,050
Dad, we want to create good farewell memories with Ms. Park.

286
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:05,230
Dad, please, yes?

287
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,570
Okay, let's go on the goodbye trip.

288
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,390
Yes!

289
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,850
Dad, you agreed!

290
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,170
We will ask Ms. Park now.

291
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,450
Okay.

292
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,630
Let's go ask her.

293
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,630
Really? Your dad agreed?

294
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,310
Yes!

295
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,570
We can't just say goodbye like this.

296
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,640
That's right.

297
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,600
Please?

298
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,940
Okay, I got it.

299
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,980
Let's go on the trip.

300
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,120
We can play games and eat delicious food.

301
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,570
And take lots of pictures.

302
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,580
Let's have a lot of fun together.

303
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,320
Awesome!

304
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:56,850
It'll be so much fun!

305
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,860
What? An affair?

306
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,110
The more I think about it, it's ridiculous.

307
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,490
I guess I look like a dummy since I'm staying quiet?

308
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,200
Even if they are the building owners,

309
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,220
how can they falsely gossip about my pure Soo Chul having an affair?

310
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,890
I won't leave them alone.

311
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,430
[Brothers' Jokbal]

312
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,080
Younger Boss!

313
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,130
You can't do that.

314
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,020
Me? What did I do?

315
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,470
If a man has coffee with a woman, do you call that an affair?

316
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:34,470
You can't look at everything through those lenses.

317
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,160
You only see what you know.

318
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,650
This is why our society is getting muddied.

319
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,100
What are you saying without the context?

320
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,490
The woman, who my Soo Chul had coffee with yesterday,

321
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,680
is someone who runs a very large company in the US.

322
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,660
Soo Chul met up with her to talk about our Dan Dan going to the US with her.

323
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,440
And what did you say? An affair?

324
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,930
I can't believe it.

325
00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:00,350
Because of what you said, I almost killed him.

326
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,060
No, that's not it.

327
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,750
They might have just had coffee in a coffee shop yesterday.

328
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:09,110
But I saw them walking arm-in-arm before.

329
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:12,200
What did you say? Arm-in-arm?

330
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,370
- Is that true?
- Of course, it is.

331
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:19,560
I'm someone who even boils the pig feet with honesty.

332
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,110
I don't speak lies.

333
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,320
Goodbye.

334
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,950
Dong Pil, what's wrong with Dae Beom's mom?

335
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,880
Don't you know?

336
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:47,250
I've scouted Ms. Park to come with me to the US.

337
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:54,760
And I thought it would be nice if Driver Park, Mr. Park Soo Chul, could come with us.

338
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,390
We'll provide accommodation and vehicles.

339
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:01,810
The annual salary will be $100,000 at minimum.

340
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:04,790
I will increase the salary to $200,000.

341
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,190
I'm asking you to persuade Driver Park.

342
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:09,950
Look at the vibe. Doesn't this look like an affair?

343
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,340
Mr. Ma.

344
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,770
What are you saying? Are you talking about my Soo Chul?

345
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,900
This is CEO Anna and my Soo Chul.

346
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,550
They might have just had coffee in a coffee shop yesterday.

347
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:25,810
But I saw them walking arm-in-arm before.

348
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:30,570
That woman tried to take my Soo Chul to the US.

349
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:33,560
I didn't even know that.

350
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,820
Was I going to send my Soo Chul to her for money?

351
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,440
That vixen.

352
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,770
That thief wench!

353
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,660
Open the door. Open it!

354
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:52,200
Why did she come here?

355
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:06,200
- What brings you here?
- You.

356
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,760
By saying you will give my husband $100,000 and $200,000.

357
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,770
What was the reason for you to entice my husband?

358
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,520
That was...

359
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,590
By using money to seduce him,

360
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:19,980
what was your reason for trying to take my husband to the US?

361
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,150
You're interested in my husband, aren't you?

362
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,610
How dare you hold my husband's arm?

363
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:27,610
Who do you think you are to keep seeing my husband? Why!

364
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,870
I think you have some misunderstandings.

365
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,930
I briefly met up with Driver Park about Ms. Park going to the US.

366
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,800
There was no other reason.

367
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,680
The reason why I held his arm was that I was unwell at the time.

368
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,960
So I got his support for a second...

369
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,690
Oh, my.

370
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:47,990
So you really were in arm-in-arm with my husband.

371
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:51,230
How dare you get supported by my husband? Who do you think you are!

372
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:54,650
I was sick at that time. That's why...

373
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:57,930
Were you sick?

374
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:03,460
Did you have cancer surgery?

375
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,670
Yes, how do you know about that?

376
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:11,700
I'm speechless. Was that all because of you?

377
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,890
He put all of the store work aside,

378
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,600
helped someone with hospitalization and everything,

379
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,440
and stayed overnight at the hospital. Was that all because of you?

380
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:23,070
Did you call my husband during the night and make him take care of you when you were sick?

381
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:26,670
You evil wench. What did you do to my husband?

382
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:30,110
You thief wench!

383
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:33,250
Come over here!

384
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:36,140
You evil wench! Who the heck are you?

385
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,960
[New oil every day. Only 60 chickens!]

386
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,540
Mr. Park.

387
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:48,140
There's big trouble, Mr. Park.

388
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,170
What's wrong?

389
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:55,400
My brother spoke nonsense to your wife.

390
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,420
I don't have good feelings.

391
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:05,400
I think your wife went to see the woman you had coffee with yesterday.

392
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,630
What do we do? Go there, quick. Quick.

393
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:11,020
What?

394
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,880
Did my wife do all this?

395
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,880
What's going on with your wife?

396
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,980
What did she hear from where to do this?

397
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,470
Did you tell her about us? Is that why?

398
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:35,420
Why would I tell her such a thing?

399
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:40,510
Someone saw us being together.

400
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:45,210
You didn't say something strange to my wife, did you?

401
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:50,140
I told her you came to the hospital when I was sick.

402
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,850
But I didn't say anything you'd need to worry about.

403
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:58,070
I didn't say anything besides I'm taking Dan Dan to America.

404
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,310
So, please go.

405
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:03,990
Don't worry about here.

406
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:33,310
What? Is Dan Dan going to the US?

407
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,590
Yes. She's going next week.

408
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:39,140
Oh, my world. Next week?

409
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:42,910
How come you tell me this now?

410
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:45,870
We only found out about it yesterday.

411
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:51,370
This is because of Chairman Lee Young Gook, right?

412
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,880
To break up Ms. Park and Chairman Lee.

413
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,800
Yes. I think that's how it happened out of the blue.

414
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:03,580
I understand where Soo Chul's coming from.

415
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:08,510
But how can he send Dan Dan all the way to the US?

416
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:11,750
I don't know what's the right thing to do. It's confusing.

417
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,720
So, did Dan Dan agree to go?

418
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,460
Yes. She will work in CEO Anna's company.

419
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:25,910
I guess it's thankful to CEO Anna

420
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:28,600
since she's looking after our Dan Dan.

421
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,310
Mom.

422
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,330
What? What's that?

423
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,520
These are donuts. I heard it's really trendy right now.

424
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,270
I spent my own money.

425
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,670
I got it with my part-time money, so please have some.

426
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,460
Please have some too, Mi Rim.

427
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,040
What's this smell?

428
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,440
Did you put a pain relief patch?

429
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,840
I've been working at the fish market these days.

430
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,810
- I was a bit achy.
- My goodness!

431
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:55,130
I can't stand it.

432
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:59,060
When did I ask you to work at the fish market so you could buy me donuts?

433
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,610
How long are you going to be like this?

434
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:05,970
My son, Joon Oh. Please go back to your school!

435
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,530
Mom!

436
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:10,500
I'm happy these days. So please don't say anything.

437
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,100
Also, I just want to do things for you since I'm making money.

438
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,850
That's why I bought you donuts.

439
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,530
I know you like it.

440
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,650
Hey, I don't like you.

441
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,080
So, just go home. Go.

442
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,380
I'll go since you say so.

443
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:27,950
But, Mom. If you eat this donut with coffee, it's really delicious.

444
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:32,180
Please eat it together, Mi Rim.

445
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,190
I love you, Mom.

446
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,400
Oh, that terrible boy.

447
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,810
I don't know why he's acting like that lately.

448
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,840
What's the big deal about these donuts?

449
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,420
What am I going to do with him?

450
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,230
Take a look.

451
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,830
Wow!

452
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:56,630
What? When did you come? And what's this?

453
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,870
Ta-Da!

454
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:02,650
It's a gift for you. Valentine's day is around the corner.

455
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:08,570
I got this because we were supposed to go to the amusement park on that day, but you couldn't go because of your work.

456
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:12,220
Wow. It's so beautiful.

457
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,800
Do you like it?

458
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,770
Of course. It's the first time I've received something like this.

459
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,330
I love it!

460
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,890
Do you like it that much?

461
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:24,720
Yes. I don't have to go to the amusement park. This is plenty.

462
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,110
I am so happy to see you like it so much.

463
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:34,090
It was worth it to work hard with pain relief patches on me.

464
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:36,180
Joon Oh, thank you.

465
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,160
You don't have to do this. Can you do it here, too?

466
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,310
- Joon Oh.
- Yes?

467
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:43,380
I like you more and more.

468
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,860
You, too? Me, too.

469
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,240
What? Come here. I'll massage you more.

470
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,280
That feels good.

471
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,860
Thank you.

472
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:59,190
One. Two. Three. Four.

473
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,960
Fighting!

474
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:07,080
♫  A smile blooms in every step  ♫

475
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,270
You're doing great!

476

♫ It's a shiny day because of you ♫

477

Go, Se Chan!

479
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,410
♫ Strangely ♫

480
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:23,010
Se Chan, you almost got it! Wow!

481
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:27,400
♫ Nobody will understand me. You're the only one that I was looking for ♫

482
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,440
He cheated!

483
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,760
- Let's get our dad! Dad!

484
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,260
♫ Woo, it's a happy day like a dream, yeah ♫

485
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,660

Look at my dad!

00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,990
♫ Woo, you are my love ♫

491
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,540
♫ You're mysterious ♫

492
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:10,940
♫ like deep ocean ♫

493
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:17,380
♫ I'm happy to just look at you. You're the only one that I was looking for ♫

494
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:20,580
♫ Woo, ♫

501
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,540
Ms. Park, see you again.
[See you again]

502
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,610
Ms. Park, fighting!
[Ms. Park, fighting!]

503
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:02,100
Ms. Park, I hope you meet a nice guy!
[Ms. Park, I hope you meet a nice guy! - Jenny]

504
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,830
Wow, amazing!

505
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:16,630
- It's pretty.
- Goodbye. So long.

506
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:19,060
Goodbye.

507
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,430
Bye-Bye.

508
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,920
Bye-Bye!

509
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:37,310
I'll come back no matter what. Let's meet again.

510
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:41,210
Ms. Park. Be happy, please.

511
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,980
You had an affair with her, didn't you?

512
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,960
What did you do? Did you sleep with her? Tell me what you did together!

513
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,860
Tell me! What did you do?

514
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:27,830
What did you two do? I'm going to kill you!

515
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:34,120
No, if I accuse someone without evidence, I would only be the crazy one.

516
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,270
I have to find evidence.

517
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:43,810
There's definitely something going on between them.

518
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:58,940
Thank you for everything until now.

519
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:07,120
Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong.

520
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,640
I want to thank you.

521
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:16,120
Please don't get sick and stay healthy.

522
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:40,170
Please give me the bag. We will see her off.

523
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:52,300
Let's go.

524
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:11,120
It's like she's a high-powered lady! Why is everyone making a big deal?

525
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,180
It makes no sense.

526
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:17,250
♫ When I walk this road, ♫

527
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:20,830
♫  it makes me cry  ♫

528
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:27,720
♫ It reminds me of that person's touch
 ♫

529
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,840
♫ I couldn't hold her ♫

530
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,290
♫ and just trembled my heart ♫

531
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:42,050
♫ My beautiful love ♫

532

♫ It seems like love is bitter
 ♫

533

♫ The more I try to grasp it, the further it gets ♫

♫ Why do you run away, love
?

 ♫

537
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,880
Ms. Park!

♫ It would be nice  ♫

542
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:49,050
♫ to take a break ♫

543
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,350
Yes, give that to me.

544
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:57,630
- She's here!
- Dan Dan's here.

545
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:02,370
Grandma. But why did everyone gather? Joon Oh's here, too.

546
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,590
Hello, Noona.

547
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:08,780
We've all been waiting to see you. I heard that you are going to the US next week.

548
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,970
Yes.

549
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:13,810
That's right. So we gathered to see you

550
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:18,210
and to have food together. Come and sit!

551
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:19,360
Yes.

552
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,690
Dan Dan, I made your favorite, bulgogi.

553
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:24,460
It looks good.

554
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:29,000
Dan Dan, I'm envious. Please invite me when you get all settled.

555
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,710
Hey, me, too!

556
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,720
Me, too, Unni.

557
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,630
Okay, I will.

558
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:40,210
Let's eat. The soup's getting cold.

559
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,990
- It looks delicious.
- Mom, please go ahead and eat.

560
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,210
Bon appétit!

561
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:46,460
Thank you for the food!

562
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:50,150
- It's delicious, Aunt!
- Dan Dan, have this.

563
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,630
Did Ms. Park leave this house?

564
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:24,950
Yes. She broke up with Young Gook and quit her tutor job.

565
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:28,660
She's going to America with CEO Anna.

566
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,990
She's going to America with CEO Anna?

567
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:37,700
Yes! Driver Park adamantly opposed the relationship between Ms. Park and Young Gook.

568
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:42,890
I thought Ms. Park's family planned it all to seduce our Young Gook.

569
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:45,160
But seeing how Driver Park is totally opposed,

570
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:49,350
I guess I might have thought it wrong.

571
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:51,550
I see.

572
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,220
We've gotten rid of Ms. Park, that bothersome vixen.

573
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:00,760
At the time like now, if Young Gook looks back at you,

574
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,790
it would be great. But that cold bastard!

575
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,900
Hello, Jo Sarah.

576
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:25,250
Are you trying to restart with the Chairman? Are you?

577
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:29,590
But what's with this car? Have you opened a flower shop?

578
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,500
Sarah, let's talk.

579
00:41:54,500 --> 00:42:01,310
If you come and bother me like this, I will report you to the police.

580
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:06,490
I'm really sorry for the last time. I want to apologize.

581
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:15,690
Sarah. I really regret breaking up with you.

582
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:19,470
Sarah. Where is our son?

583
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,290
You gave birth to my son.

584
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:27,110
I want to find our son and three of us to start again.

585
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:33,080
What? Where did you hear such nonsense?

586
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,730
Do you really want to die?

587
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:38,220
Get out. Get out, you bastard.

588
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,720
- I said, get out!
- Hey!

589
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,840
Get out!

590
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:51,400
Sarah, let's talk again later.

591
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,470
Oh no, Ajussi!

592
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:57,940
- That punk is here again.
- I'm so sorry.

593
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:00,180
What did he threaten you with today?

594
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,580
I told you to call me when he comes.

595
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,710
What should I do?

596
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:07,240
Did you hear me? Call me.

597
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,450
Answer me, please.

598
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:13,160
Ajussi, why are you like this to me? Please don't be good to me!

599
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:17,430
I'm more bothered by you than that bastard.

600
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,520
Hey, Mi Sook!

601
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,440
- Hey!
- What? Oh, my!

602
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,140
Aren't these scallion pancakes?

603
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:35,670
I've been craving something like this. How did you know?

604
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:37,710
I know you like scallion pancakes.

605
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:39,760
Try some.

606
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,330
Oh, really.

607
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:43,950
How is it?

608
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:47,770
By the way, you look great.

609
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:52,470
You said you couldn't sleep. Did you fix your insomnia?

610
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:54,990
Yes.

611
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,290
That's good.

612
00:43:57,290 --> 00:43:59,430
Sleep is the best medicine at our age.

613
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:02,850
If we don't get enough sleep, we can get sick with every ailment.

614
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:04,110
That's right, yes.

615
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:05,700
Eat it with this sauce.

616
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,730
Next is heartwarming news.

617
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:14,880
Last January, an anonymous donor left 500 million won in front of Soojung Orphanage, which became a hot topic.

618
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,950
To relay their gratitude,

619
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:23,060
the orphanage is looking for an anonymous donor who gave the wonderful gift.

620
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:29,010
The anonymous donor is presumed to be a woman in her late fifties.
[The Orphanage is in search of an anonymous donor who made a 500 million won donation to thank them]

621
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:30,680
Oh, my world. 500 million won?

622
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,300
She disappeared in a hurry.

623
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:37,150
In the bag, she left a note, "Please spend this on something good for the children."

624
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:42,090
It's me who made that donation.

625
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:46,150
Does that mean they are looking for me right now?

626
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:50,200
The orphanage said they wanted to find the donor to thank them.

627
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:54,730
What's wrong, Gi Ja?

628
00:44:54,730 --> 00:45:00,070
It's nothing. The drink went down the wrong pipe.

629
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:05,690
I don't know who's that donor, but that person is great.

630
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:12,370
How could they donate not 5 million won or 50 million won, but 500 million won?

631
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:17,730
That person will go to heaven for sure.

632
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:23,010
My goodness, Gi Ja. You are covered in a cold sweat.

633
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:25,260
This is not okay.

634
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:29,640
You should go to the hospital and get a comprehensive physical exam.

635
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:34,230
Do you have some internal illness?

636
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:37,640
What?

637
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:41,290
Right, I should do it.

638
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:42,910
Right...

639
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:46,540
What do you think, Ms. Park? Aren't these colors pretty?

640
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,880
Yes, they are so pretty.

641
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,440
Which one do you like more?

642
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,080
I don't think I can choose.

643
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,620
- Why don't you try these on?
- Okay.

644
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,240
It's beautiful.

645
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,470
Ms. Park. I think these will suit you very nicely.

646
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:19,670
CEO Anna, you've already bought me too much.

647
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:21,400
I think we could stop now.

648
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:26,430
You will be my employee now. Can't I do this much?

649
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:27,630
But still.

650
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:29,420
Think of it as a uniform I'm buying for you.

651
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,860
Hurry, let's go inside.

652
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:50,810
Yes, it's me.

653
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:53,040
Now?

654
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,060
What's the problem?

655
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,570
Okay.

656
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:13,050
I'll be out for a few minutes.

657
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:14,980
Where are you going?

658
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:17,380
Someone came to see me nearby.

659
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,380
Okay.

660
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:24,670
Mom, I'll be out for a few minutes.

661
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:27,650
If you all go out, what can I do by myself?

662
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:30,760
- I'm back.
- Dae Beom's here.

663
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:34,110
What's going on with my mom?

664
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:36,420
I don't know.

665
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:49,870
Excuse me.

666
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:53,580
Where did he go?

667
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:04,210
What's going on?

668
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:07,710
I went shopping with Dan Dan just now.

669
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:15,320
We talked while we were shopping. She seemed like she's gotten herself together.

670
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:20,330
It seems like she's firmly decided on going to the US.

671
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:23,210
She should be.

672
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,160
I'm relieved. All the documentation is complete.

673
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:30,810
And I've bought the plane tickets. We are ready to go.

674
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:34,670
That's good.

675
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:39,240
You could have told me that on the phone.

676
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:46,160
I have something to give you so that I asked you to see me.

677
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:51,420
Please take this.

678
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:52,790
What is it?

679
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:56,240
I feel sorry to you for everything until now.

680
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,850
And thankful for many things.

681
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:05,170
Think of it as child support for raising Dan Dan or alimony if you'd like.

682
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:08,200
I'm so grateful that you are sending Dan Dan away with me.

683
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,730
- That's why.
- What?

684
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:12,830
Do you think I'm sending Dan Dan to give her to you?

685
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:15,440
Don't delude yourself. I told you this before.

686
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,110
Do not reveal you are her mother.

687
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:19,490
Child Support?

688
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:23,480
You are simply CEO Anna to our Dan Dan. Got it?

689
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,680
What do you mean she's Dan Dan's mother?

690
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,480
What is going on here?

691
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:39,530
Is this woman Dan Dan's mother?

692
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:43,320
This woman, Anna Kim, is?

693
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,360
That makes no sense.

694
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,100
Have you two been seeing each other behind my back?

695
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,890
Deceiving me all this time?

696
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:52,620
How can you do this to me?

697
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:54,910
No, Honey, that's not it. Just a minute.

698
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:56,350
Let's go talk outside.

699
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:58,040
Is this woman Dan Dan's mother?

700
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,870
Is that why you were going to go to America with this woman?

701
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:04,220
How can you do this to me? How?

702
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:05,530
Let's talk outside.

703
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:08,330
Let go of me. Let go!

704
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:09,830
- Let go!
- Honey!

705
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:12,100
Let go of me.

706
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,480
Let go of me!

707
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:21,600
Just come out.

708
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:25,150
Let go. Let go of me!

709
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:27,690
Out of all people, how can you do this to me?

710
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:31,100
Honey, calm down and listen to me.

711
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,980
It's not what you think.

712
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:36,920
Didn't you say she was Dan Dan's mother?

713
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,220
Yes, she is. That's right.

714
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:43,200
So, were you going to go to the US with her and Dan Dan

715
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,790
and set up a new household together?

716
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:47,290
How can you do that to me?

717
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:49,060
Do you think I'm crazy?

718
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:51,900
You know how much I hate and despise that woman.

719
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,220
But you were going to go to the US with her!

720
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:57,090
That's when I didn't know who she was!

721
00:50:57,090 --> 00:51:01,350
I also didn't know she was Dan Dan's mother at first!

722
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:03,110
What?

723
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:06,010
What do you mean?

724
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:10,120
Think back carefully.

725
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:14,020
That woman doesn't have Dan Dan's mother's face.

726
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:16,710
Dan Dan's mother's face?

727
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:24,500
That's right. That's not the face I saw twenty-seven years ago.

728
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,040
What happened?

729
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,860
She had a huge accident ten years ago.

730
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,750
And undergone more than ten plastic surgeries on her face.

731
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:32,690
So I didn't recognize her at first as well.

732
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:36,840
When I found out she was Dan Dan's mother, I refused to go to the US.

733
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:40,840
That's why I didn't go even though you insisted that I should go.

734
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,050
Is that really true?

735
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:45,550
Then why are you sending Dan Dan to her now?

736
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:47,870
Why do you think I'm sending her?

737
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:50,730
It's because I have no other option.

738
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:53,310
Dan Dan hasn't blossomed yet.

739
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:56,860
Do you want her to live raising Chairman Lee's children? That's why I'm sending her.

740
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:00,650
Since she's Dan Dan's mother, at least.

741
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:04,970
So you are saying there was nothing else between you and her.

742
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:07,600
Of course not!

743
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:16,900
Honey, so please trust me and pretend you don't know about this.

744
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:22,100
Dan Dan won't go to the US with her if Dan Dan finds out she's the mother who abandoned her.

745
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:26,550
Honey, once Dan Dan leaves for the US next week, it'll all be over.

746
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:28,240
I will have no reasons to see her again.

747
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:32,400
So please, Honey. Will you?

748
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:47,480
Nothing won't go wrong, will it be?

749
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,900
Thankfully, I could move on.
[Soo Chul Oppa]

750
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:57,420
My wife decided to pretend that she didn't know.

751
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:01,610
As we promised, please take good care of our Dan Dan.

752
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:06,680
That's a relief.

753
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:10,930
Thank you. Thank you.

754
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:27,060
Se Jong.

755
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:29,520
Se Jong, where are you?

756
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,320
Dad, what is it?

757
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,340
Jenny and Se Chan, have you seen Se Jong?

758
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:36,840
He was in his room earlier.

759
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,510
He's not in his room.

760
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:41,370
Let's look for him.

761
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,270
Dad, wait a minute.

762
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:57,900
Dad and Noona! Se Jong is here.

763
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:05,440
Se Jong, why are you here?

764
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,650
Dad, when is Ms. Park coming?

765
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:21,360
I guess you miss Ms. Park.

766
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:26,280
Se Jong, Ms. Park would go to America

767
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,260
and said she would come back later.

768
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:33,190
So is Ms. Park really not coming now?

769
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:36,950
Should we go to your room now?

770
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:39,400
It's past your bedtime.

771
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,510
Dad...

772
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:46,040
I can't sleep since Ms. Park is not here.

773
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:49,770
Then, should we go to sleep together?

774
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:55,030
I want to go to bed with you and Se Jong, too.

775
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:57,670
Shall we? What about you, Jenny?

776
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:00,410
I'm fine.

777
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:03,540
Okay. Se Chan and Se Jong,

778
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:06,960
let's sleep together in dad's room tonight.

779
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,740
Your brother already fell asleep, but are you still having trouble sleeping?

780
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:24,090
Yes. Dad, I can't sleep.

781
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:29,620
Then, let me count numbers from one for you.

782
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:31,840
You'll fall asleep soon.

783
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,820
Okay.

784
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,450
One.

785
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:40,800
Two.

786
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:43,340
Three.

787
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,000
Four.

788
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,910
Five.

789
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:51,440
Six...

790
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,060
Seven...

791
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:05,700
Se Jong, are you okay? What should I do?

792
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:15,380
Yes, it's me.

793
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:18,550
Oppa. I think you have to come home right now.

794
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:20,470
Something's wrong with Se Jong.

795
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:23,020
I think he's very sick.

796
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:26,400
What? Is Se Jong sick?

797
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:37,570
Se Jong got sensitive since he was very sleep-deprived,

798
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:40,450
so I prescribed a tranquilizer.

799
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:45,810
Dr. Kim, Se Jong never had this kind of issue before.

800
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:49,040
I think it's a symptom of separation anxiety.

801
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,130
Separation anxiety?

802
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:52,980
Yes.

803
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:58,100
If he can't sleep or eat and continues to vomit,

804
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,880
he needs counseling and hospitalization.

805
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:06,720
But I think this happened from the shock of his tutor resigning suddenly.

806
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:13,550
So I think for her to come back and to calm Se Jong is the best solution.

807
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:16,400
Ah, okay...

808
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:27,260
The more I think about it, it's ridiculous.

809
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:29,630
Anna Kim, that wench is absurd.

810
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:31,960
She even changed her face with plastic surgery.

811
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,980
Didn't she approach my Soo Chul on purpose?

812
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:37,510
And she came to me, talking about money

813
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:40,410
and trying to take my husband away from me?

814
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:43,210
I won't leave that wench alone.

815
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:48,680
Open the door! I said, open the door!

816
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,980
- Why are you doing this? Please stop!
- Why am I doing this?

817
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,660
You thief wench!

818
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:07,410
You even changed your face and came back.

819
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:09,580
How dare you try to take my Soo Chul away?

820
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:12,420
This evil wench. This scary wench!

821
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:13,970
You thief wench!

822
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:19,400
How dare you change your face and show up when you abandoned your infant daughter!

823
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,850
You thief wench!

824
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:27,520
If you contact my husband one more time, I won't stand still.

825
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,880
I'm putting up with you because of my Dan Dan!

826
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,560
Do you understand?

827
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,720
How can you show up by changing your face?

828
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,650
You scammer, thief wench!

829
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:13,330
Soo Chul.

830
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:15,600
It's me.

831
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:21,210
How long do I have to suffer my hair getting pulled?

832
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:23,870
What do you mean by that?

833
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:26,010
Did my wife come by again?

834
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:31,860
How long do I have to suffer like this!

835
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:36,200
You're the one who told me to take Dan Dan to America with me.

836
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:39,600
Can't you talk reason into her?

837
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:45,270
What if Dan Dan sees your wife coming at me like this?

838
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:56,670
When did you come home?

839
00:59:56,670 --> 00:59:59,290
Seriously, what are you doing?

840
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:02,490
Why did you go there again?

841
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:06,890
Did that wench already call you?

842
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:09,510
Are you two secretly communicating with each other?

843
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:11,340
It's ridiculous.

844
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:14,490
Are you siding with her in front of me now?

845
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:17,420
Honey, please.

846
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:20,290
Can you please tolerate until Dan Dan goes?

847
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:23,090
If you want to vent, please vent on me.

848
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:30,330
Are you that sad because Dan Dan's birth mother got hit by me?

849
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:34,100
How could you only think of her instead of my broken heart?

850
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,630
By saying a hundred thousand, two hundred thousand dollars!

851
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:41,800
She tricked me! Thinking of that made me infuriated, so I grabbed her by her hair.

852
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:45,240
But does that breaks your heart that much?

853
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:49,760
She changed her face and even tried to seduce you.

854
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,280
But how can I not get angry!

855
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:56,790
Honey, calm down. It's not that I don't know your feelings.

856
01:00:56,790 --> 01:01:01,290
But I'm worried that Dan Dan might find out if you keep acting like this.

857
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:03,390
Honey, it's not late to reconsider.

858
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:06,600
I don't think you should send Dan Dan with that woman.

859
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:10,400
She will use Dan Dan to seduce you.

860
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,830
She'll use Dan Dan as an excuse to call you to America.

861
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:15,850
How am I supposed to endure that?

862
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:19,870
It's like giving a fish to a cat!

863
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:24,920
Does it make sense to send Dan Dan to the mother that abandoned her?

864
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:31,490
What are you saying now?

865
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:37,850
The one who will take Dan Dan to America is Dan Dan's mother?

866
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:41,580
Mother-in-law... The thing is...

867
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:51,630
Father, I don't think it's right.

868
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:55,100
How would Dan Dan feel if she knew about it later?

869
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:58,980
She would feel betrayed. This is not okay.

870
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,480
I don't think it's right, too.

871
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,270
I also think it's not right.

872
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:11,320
I mean, it's her mother who's taking Dan Dan, so she'll take good care of her in America.

873
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:16,430
It might be okay if this secret can be kept forever.

874
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:22,270
But no secret can be kept forever.

875
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:28,700
Honey, you should tell Dan Dan everything now.

876
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:31,220
It's not that she likes a thief.

877
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:34,930
There are only two things that he has three kids, and he is older than her.

878
01:02:34,930 --> 01:02:37,140
Do you have to do this far?

879
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:39,680
Honey, please stop.

880
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:43,250
If we all keep it secret, there won't be a problem.

881
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:46,290
How will Dan Dan find out about it if she goes to America?

882
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:48,910
Since that woman also promised to keep the secret forever,

883
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:54,370
I want you to endure for Dan Dan until she goes.

884
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:58,790
If Dan Dan goes to America, she can forget about everything and start anew.

885
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:07,720
Sure. Dan Dan's your daughter. We don't have any rights.

886
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:12,270
But if she knows about it later, it'll be a big problem.

887
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:15,460
That's why we are worrying about it.

888
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:17,450
But I get it.

889
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,370
Don't worry, Mother-in-law.

890
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:24,320
It'll be all over when she leaves in two days.

891
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:28,330
That woman promised me that she wouldn't tell the fact that she was Dan Dan's mother until her death.

892
01:03:28,330 --> 01:03:30,080
So please don't worry.

893
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:37,230
Also, if you go to America to see her or you contact her in secret,

894
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:42,370
I'll call Dan Dan and tell her that woman is her mother.

895
01:03:42,370 --> 01:03:44,630
You better make that clear.

896
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:46,880
It won't happen, so don't worry.

897
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,320
I'm home.

898
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:55,750
What is it? Why is everyone being quiet since I come in?

899
01:03:55,750 --> 01:04:00,300
It's suspicious. Were you talking bad about me?

900
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:04,080
Wow, you're a genius. How did you know we were talking bad about you?

901
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,220
What? Is it true?

902
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:08,380
I'm kidding.

903
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:13,290
We talked about how empty it would be since you're going to America.

904
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:16,000
Why don't you change into comfy clothes? Let's have a beer.

905
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,900
Beer sounds great! Okay, I'll come out in a second.

906
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:29,370
Please keep it secret so that Dan Dan can go to America.

907
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:31,150
I got it.

908
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:34,910
Everybody, watch your words.

909
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:16,590
Look! There are many dishes that Se Jong likes.

910
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:21,530
Se Jong, would you like to try a shrimp?

911
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,260
Se Jong,

912
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:29,370
you like sausages, right? Why don't you have this?

913
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:41,220
What should we do?

914
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:46,440
Se Jong, you don't have to eat it. If you don't want to eat, it's okay.

915
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:51,470
Let's have some rest with me in your room, Se Jong.

916
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:56,670
Let's go.

917
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:05,320
I think his separation anxiety is not fake!

918
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:08,420
What should we do?

919
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:24,410
Se Jong, if you don't want to eat, you don't have to eat.

920
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:26,160
Okay?

921
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,850
Yes.

922
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:34,840
But you told me that you want to become a cool soccer player when you grow up.

923
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:39,480
If you don't eat anything like now, you won't grow tall nor have strength,

924
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:43,510
so I wonder if you can kick the soccer ball nicely.

925
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:46,950
Since you have to become an incredible soccer player,

926
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:52,220
should I make some plain rice porridge for you?

927
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:58,510
I don't want to eat anything right now.

928
01:06:58,510 --> 01:07:00,990
Can you make that for me tomorrow?

929
01:07:00,990 --> 01:07:05,120
Okay. Please close your eyes and have a good sleep.

930
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:08,380
When you have a good night's sleep, you'll feel better.

931
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:14,280
But Dad, I want to sleep, but I can't.

932
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:18,290
Then, should I count numbers for you?

933
01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:20,700
Dad.

934
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:28,840
You counted numbers for me more than 500 last night,

935
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:31,260
but I couldn't sleep.

936
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:37,890
Dad, I feel like I can sleep if Ms. Park comes.

937
01:07:52,730 --> 01:07:55,010
That one looks great on you!

938
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:57,340
Wear these glasses, too!

939

One, two, three!

940
01:08:03,930 --> 01:08:07,250
Ms. Park, be happy in America as well.

941
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:09,800
Ms. Park!

942
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:28,390
Wow, look at that!

01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:30,360

Yes, Chairman.

Ms. Park.

949

I'm sorry to call you this late.

950
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:08,000
But can you please come here just once?

951
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,620

962
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:09,940
I'm going to the US in two days! So stop acting like this to the Chairman.

963
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:11,690
- Let's play this!
- I don't know how to play it.

964
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:12,690
Enjoy your meal.

965
01:10:12,690 --> 01:10:14,050
Hello, Uncle.

966
01:10:14,050 --> 01:10:17,790
I broke up with Dae Beom, but strangely it doesn't feel like we did.

967
01:10:17,790 --> 01:10:19,190
Don't try to push it like that.

968
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:22,310
I forgot to bring the USB that has today's fashion show's materials.

969
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:24,150
Could you go to my place?

970
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:26,410
This looks just like my baby photo.

971
01:10:26,410 --> 01:10:27,620
Isn't it Chief Jo?

972
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:29,610
She's coming twice a week to do the flowers.

973
01:10:29,610 --> 01:10:30,930
Does my brother know about this?

974
01:10:30,930 --> 01:10:32,280
It would be better if you didn't come here.

975
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:34,680
Are you saying CEO Anna Kim is Park Dan Dan's birth mother?

976
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,460
- I would like to see you for a moment.
- Alright.

977
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:39,750
That's right. She is your birth mom.

978
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:43,430
Is CEO Anna my mom?
