[Episode 27]

2
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,040
Park Dan Dan.

3
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,370
Where are you right now?!

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,470
Me?

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,050
I'm at home right now.

6
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,980
Chairman, what's going on?

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,940
Ms. Park, why didn't you say anything this whole time?

8
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,130
Why didn't you tell me we were in love with one another?

9
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,220
Why did you stay silent like an idiot? Why!

10
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:44,680
Chairman, has your memory come back?

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,000
Yes.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,870
We need to meet right now. Immediately.

13
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,910
What do I do now?

14
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:13,280
It's all over now. Now...

15
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,100
What do I do about this now?

16
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,350
What?

17
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,930
She wants me to go to that house and apologize?

18
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:37,310
Wow, I would rather die than do that.

19
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,670
Oh, that little girl. Oh, my headaches!

20
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,330
Oh, dear.

21
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,000
Yes, it's me, Chief Jo.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,980
Madam, we're in big trouble.

23
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,690
Oh, Chief Jo. I have a splitting headache because of Se Ryun, so let's talk later.

24
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,160
Madam!

25
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,390
Now the Chairman...

26
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,290
the Chairman's memory has returned. All of it!

27
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,000
What?

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,420
Young Gook's memory is back?

29
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes.

30
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,000
The Chairman told me our engagement is over.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,700
He badgered me, saying, "Why did you lie to me and concoct this engagement?"

32
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,340
Are you sure?

33
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,210
Are you positive his memory is back?

34
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,330
Yes, Madam.

35
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,760
What do we do now?

36
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,350
What do you mean by that? Hang up the phone for now.

37
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,100
Before Young Gook strangles me to death, I need to get the hell out of this house.

38
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,130
Oh, my! Young Gook's memory is back!

39
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,360
There's no way.

40
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,130
The plot I concocted with Chief Jo,

41
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,940
lying to set up their engagement so I could take this house,

42
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,080
I'm about to get caught with all of it!

43
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,690
Why did I do such a thing? I can't believe it.

44
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,810
I'm crazy! Oh my god, I'm crazy!

45
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,820
I must have lost my mind! I have to run away now.

46
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:12,500
♫ When I walk this road, it makes me cry  ♫

47
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,210
It's me, Ms. Park. Park Dan Dan.

48
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:22,610
Me, this tree, do you not remember any of it?

49
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:26,770
I don't remember anything, so stop asking if I do.

50
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,270
If I remembered, I would've said that I did!

51
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:32,030
Do you even understand what it feels like to lose your memory?

52
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,870
Wow, this is outrageous.

53
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,130
Ms. Park, you're Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong's teacher.

54
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,830
Are you my teacher?!

55
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,510
Why are you trying to lecture and school me?!

56
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,140
Who do you think you are!

57

♫ Goodbye is easy ♫

58
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:02,660
♫ My unforgettable love ♫

♫ Why do you run away, love ♫

00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,320
♫ Like a shy child ♫

61
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,650
Ms. Park.

62
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,470
Ms. Park! Ms. Park!

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,100
Chairman...

64
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,950
Ms. Park!

65
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:44,860
♫ What am I looking for on this road wandering ♫

66
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,770

♫ Why do you run away, love ♫

68

71
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,010
Chairman!

72
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,290
Chairman!

73
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,290
Chairman! Please wake up!

74
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:03,080
Chairman! Someone, please call an ambulance!

75
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,850
Chairman!

76
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,010
Chairman, please wake up!

77
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,530
Chairman!

78
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,380
What? What are you saying?

79
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,010
The Chairman fainted?

80
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,860
And Chief Jo isn't answering her phone?

81
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,970
Okay, I got it. I'll contact everyone.

82
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,750
Okay. If anything happens, let me know.

83
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,640
It seemed like the Chairman's memory came back,

84
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,220
but why did he suddenly faint?

85
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,180
Chairman. Please open your eyes.

86
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,000
It's me, Park Dan Dan.

87
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,490
Please, wake up and say something.

88
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,540
Ms. Park, what happened to my brother?

89
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,760
Why is my brother like this?

90
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,460
Ms. Park, were you with my brother when he fainted?

91
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,510
Yes. I was in the neighborhood,

92
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,420
and as the Chairman was crossing the crosswalk,

93
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,110
he suddenly fainted.

94
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,340
As he was crossing the crosswalk?

95
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:43,020
Oh no! It could've been really bad!

96
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,610
What did the doctor say? Why did he faint?

97
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,070
Have they not done any tests yet?

98
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,570
The doctor just visited and left.

99
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,980
Luckily, he said the tests didn't show any problems

100
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:58,310
and that we should wait and see if his condition improves.

101
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:02,160
Se Ryun, you stay here. I'll go talk with the doctor.

102
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,490
Okay.

103
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:14,080
Oh, I was so scared I thought my heart was going to drop.

104
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,910
I'll stay here with Jung Woo Oppa,

105
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,690
and you should go home and be with the kids, Ms. Park.

106
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,680
And don't tell the kids that my brother fainted.

107
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,760
Yes, I won't.

108
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,530
But what the heck is up with Chief Jo?

109
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:54,240
She's his fiancée, but how can't I even get a hold of her when my brother fainted?

110
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,790
The Chairman is going to be okay.

111
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,680
He's going to wake up.

112
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,550
He wasn't in an accident,

113
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,340
and he wasn't hurt.

114
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,950
- Oppa!
- Young Gook.

115
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,140
Oppa, are you alright?

116
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,830
Do you recognize me?

117
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,770
Se Ryun, you didn't go to America?

118
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,290
You said you were going to the States.

119
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,660
America?

120
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,420
Oppa, what's the matter? It's been so long since I came back from the States.

121
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,590
But this looks like a hospital. Why am I here?

122
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:29,040
You fainted while crossing a crosswalk and were brought here by an ambulance.

123
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,770
Don't you remember fainting?

124
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,390
I was in the mountains today.

125
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:38,530
Oppa, what do you mean by the mountains?

126
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,510
Why do you keep talking nonsense?

127
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,200
The mountains?

128
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,090
Young Gook, did you go to the mountains today?

129
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:54,680
Yes. I had some things to think about, so I went to the mountains.

130
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:00,440
Young Gook, your memory is back.

131
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,460
What do you mean by my memory is back? What're you talking about?

132
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,690
Yes, you went to the mountain.

133
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:10,240
But then you got into an accident on the mountain and lost your memory.

134
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,770
I had an accident and lost my memory?

135
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,060
Yes, that's what happened.

136
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,080
You didn't remember anything after age 22,

137
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,650
and that's why you lived like you were 22 this whole time, for three months.

138
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,720
What do you mean, three months passed?

139
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,860
I went to the mountain this morning.

140
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,900
Oh my god, what is this?

141
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:41,080
Do you have no memory of living like a 22-year-old for three months?

142
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,330
Doesn't it, Jung Woo Oppa?

143
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:49,520
- Young Gook, you and Chief Jo Sarah got engaged recently.
- That's right.

144
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,180
Do you remember that?

145
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:58,800
What? I got engaged to Chief Jo?

146
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,390
Hey, Koh Jung Woo. What on earth are you talking about?

147
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,700
Hey, did you run out of the house?

148
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,590
Hey, if I stay in that house, who knows what Young Gook would do to me.

149
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:24,230
But where's Chief Jo? Has your daughter not come home yet?

150
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:29,340
Sarah's in so much shock, and she's in her room lying in bed.

151
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,810
You've come, Madam?

152
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:35,240
Oh my, Chief Jo! Come here, sit, sit.

153
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,400
What happened? Give me all the details.

154
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,450
How much do you think Young Gook knows? Does he seriously remember everything?

155
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:45,670
Yes. It seems his memory has returned.

156
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:51,110
He said we were never planning on getting engaged and asked why I lied to him.

157
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:56,620
Oh, my god. It's over. It's all over.

158
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:01,840
Chief Jo, please keep me out of this.

159
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,290
Excuse me? What are you saying?

160
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,990
From the beginning, this was all your plan.

161
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,550
I didn't know about this. Okay?

162
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,700
Hey, Dae Ran.

163
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,110
Madam.

164
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,900
Oh, come on, let's be real.

165
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,350
If you two break your engagement, you're just strangers.

166
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,380
Is Young Gook going to sue you or what?

167
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,280
But not me. For the rest of my life, Young Gook and Se Ryun

168
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,600
are going to strangle me.

169
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,170
So, Chief Jo, I'm asking you for this favor.

170
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,850
From the beginning, you did this all on your own.

171
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,850
I had no idea from the start, okay?

172
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,610
Hey, Wang Dae Ran! How can you be like this?

173
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,480
You latched onto Sarah, begging her to save you.

174
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,810
You came to her and begged her to save you and lured her into all this! But how can you do this now?

175
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,170
Hey, say something.

176
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,590
Wait, I got a phone call.

177
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,900
Hey, it's Se Ryun.

178
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,170
Be quiet. I'm going to ask Se Ryun if she's seen her brother.

179
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,250
Just wait.

180
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,680
Hurry and pick up.

181
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,830
Yes, Se Ryun. It's your mother.

182
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,540
Mom, big news. Oppa's memory is back.

183
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:14,410
Really? Young Gook's memory is back? Is that true?

184
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,550
Yes! But, Mom, don't freak out.

185
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,730
Now Oppa doesn't remember the time being 22 years old.

186
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:25,460
He only remembers what happened before he went to the mountains.

187
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:29,010
Does he only remember until he went to the mountains before he got into the accident?

188
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:34,880
Yes! Oppa doesn't even remember him and Chief Jo getting engaged.

189
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:41,510
He doesn't remember getting engaged to Chief Jo?

190
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,530
Wait, wait. So you're saying

191
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:52,410
he doesn't remember the last three months living like a 22-year-old?

192
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,970
Do you seriously don't remember anything about the last three months?

193
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,270
No, not at all.

194
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,100
Tell me about that.

195
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,420
About Chief Jo and I got engaged. How on earth did that happen?

196
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,940
Before you lost your memory,

197
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,260
so, before your accident, you and Chief Jo

198
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,610
were promised to marry each other.

199
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,600
And that's why you were getting engaged.

200
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,760
What kind of nonsense is this?

201
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,200
Chief Jo and I were never in a relationship like that.

202
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,560
Not for one second.

203
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,560
Really?

204
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,040
Chief Jo didn't say it like that.

205
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,000
She said that, because of the kids, you both were dating in secret.

206
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,810
She said you were really together.

207
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:51,600
Chief Jo said that? Chief Jo herself?

208
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,160
That's what she said. She even came to me to tell me.

209
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,360
So I told Chief Jo

210
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,200
that do the engagement or marriage when Young Gook's memory comes back.

211
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,000
But in the end, the engagement happened.

212
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,760
Madam Wang said to do it, and you did, too.

213
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,270
I said I would do it?

214
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,280
That's why the engagement went on.

215
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,260
If you said "No," how could this ever happen?

216
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:28,420
But, how could I say that I wanted to be engaged to Chief Jo?

217
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,040
This makes no sense.

218
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,510
Now that you mention it,

219
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:38,680
you seemed really confused on that day.

220
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,890
Right, you didn't look happy at all.

221
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:49,660
Young Gook, didn't Chief Jo plan this all?

222
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,940
Isn't this all Chief Jo's scheme?

223
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,410
Lawyer Koh, I'll find out about this.

224
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:59,900
Young Gook...

225
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,820
And let's talk again.

226
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,330
- Here you go.
- Yes, thank you.

227
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:11,730
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

228
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,150
How does it taste?

229
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:22,570
This can be a hit.

230
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,360
I agree with this one.

231
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,810
What?

232
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:31,150
If he's approving, it's going to be a real hit!

233
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,660
Also, the customers earlier said this was delicious,

234
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,870
so we decided on this for our main menu.

235
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,190
It's going to be great.

236
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,550
Plus, you put up a new sign out front.

237
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,430
It's going to be a huge hit.

238
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,220
Thank you so much.

239
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,270
Mom, table 4's chicken is ready.

240
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,300
Okay.

241
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,840
- Oh, Uncle, you're here!
- Yes, you're doing a great job.

242
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,650
- Noona, Brother-in-law, I just got here.
- Are you coming back from work?

243
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:04,300
But how is there more family member whenever we come here?

244
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,500
Your family is really big.

245
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,290
Is this your son who works for the big corporation?

246
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:16,500
Yes. He got in under competitive circumstances as a driver for a big corporate this time.

247
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,700
Geon, introduce yourself.

248
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,040
They are the owners of the jokbal restaurant across the street.

249
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,550
Oh, how are you? It's nice to meet you.

250
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:28,370
- He's handsome.
- Have a seat.

251
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,640
Oh, yes, yes.

252
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,050
Oh, Driver Park.

253
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,740
What brings you here at this hour?

254
00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:01,050
I just got done with work, and I wanted to swing by on my way home.

255
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:04,500
You must be tired after working all day.

256
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,040
No, I'm okay.

257
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,700
- Have a seat.
- Yes.

258
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,500
Did you eat anything?

259
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,950
Yes. I had some of the hospital's porridge.

260
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:27,630
You need to eat well.

261
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,300
Have you scheduled a surgery date?

262
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,890
Yes. It's next week.

263
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:36,520
Don't worry too much. Everything will go well.

264
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,130
People say our country's cancer surgery is the best.

265
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:46,310
If you have surgery, someone should be here next to you.

266
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,630
Have you contacted your family?

267
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:56,210
I... don't have anyone.

268
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,760
Is that so.

269
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:10,190
Then, if it's okay with you, on the day of your surgery,

270
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,260
I'll be next to you.

271
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:18,310
Really?

272
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:21,760
Thank you very much.

273
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,110
Oh, don't mention it.

274
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:27,970
I'm always grateful to you, CEO.

275
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:38,930
But, wouldn't I be burdening you too much, Driver Park?

276
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,860
No, not at all.

277
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,550
If there's anything I can do to help you, CEO,

278
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:47,150
I would like to do it. It's okay.

279
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,730
- It's from Chairman.
- What?

280
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,930
Hello?

281
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,940
Right now?

282
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,140
Yes, I understand.

283
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:32,420
What? What did he say?

284
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:36,910
He's in front of the house. He has something to say, so he wants me to come out.

285
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,890
Chief Jo!

286
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:43,410
Wait! Would you please leave me out of it?

287
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:49,090
I didn't know anything about it from the beginning. You did it all alone, okay?

288
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,090
Chairman, what brings you to come here during this hour?

289
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,510
Did you miss me, so you came?

290
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,690
Chief Jo.

291
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,330
Yes, Chairman.

292
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:24,660
I heard that you and I got engaged.

293
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,020
Yes?

294
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,680
Why are you asking that?

295
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:36,270
My memory came back.

296
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:40,560
Really? Did your memory come back?

297
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,840
Is it true?

298
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,320
Everybody worried because your memory wasn't coming back.

299
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,460
It's a relief.

300
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,940
I'm glad, Chairman.

301
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,710
What are you doing now?

302
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:05,580
- Chairman...
- Chief Jo, tell me the truth.

303
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:13,190
For as long as I remember, there was no special relationship between us. Not even once.

304
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:17,320
But how could we promise to get married?

305
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:22,100
What I remembered is you left my house.

306
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:33,300
Did you lie to people and Lawyer Koh to get engaged to me who lost my memory?

307
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,490
Chairman.

308
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:44,070
- Chairman.
- Please answer me quickly, I am asking you.

309
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,300
You're right.

310
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:57,370
Actually, I lied on that part.

311
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,940
It is true that I lied.

312
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:04,980
How could you..?

313
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,530
What the heck did you do to me!

314
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:12,280
Chairman, you said you liked me.

315
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:18,590
The 22 years old Chairman liked me, and you didn't have anyone except me.

316
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:22,280
But why are you doing this now?

317
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,170
What did you say?

318
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:31,400
Did I like you?

319
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:40,600
Did you forget what happened recently?

320
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:44,120
Wasn't your memory all come back?

321
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,800
My memory came back,

322
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:55,130
but I don't remember the last three months after the accident.

323
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:58,210
Chairman.

324
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:03,890
No, how could this happen?

325
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,410
It's not possible.

326
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,680
I had feelings for Chief Jo?

327
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,590
At first, Madam asked me to come.

328
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,410
Saying you had lost your memory and that everything was a mess.

329
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:20,350
She asked me to help, so I ran back to your house.

330
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:23,180
I worried about your state of illness

331
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,170
and the children too.

332
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,760
I couldn't ignore it.

333
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,930
So I was going to just help you with the work for a while,

334
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:37,710
but the 22 years old you

335
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:41,220
came close to me first.

336
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:44,900
He sincerely loved me.

337
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:51,330
And then, you proposed to me.

338
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,750
That's not possible. How could it happen?

339
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:04,430
Chairman, I have liked you since before.

340
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:08,750
But you said you liked me,

341
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:12,150
so I didn't want to miss that chance.

342
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:15,950
That's why I wanted to get engaged

343
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,970
and also wanted to get married.

344
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:26,170
That's why, I said,

345
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,530
that you and I were in a relationship already,

346
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:34,430
that you and I were in love.

347
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,920
That's why I lied.

348
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,710
What did you say?

349
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,350
Even so, how can you do something like that?

350
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:46,010
Chairman, you liked me.

351
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:48,610
I had hoped that even if your memory came back,

352
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:52,320
you would love me.

353
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,700
Then...

354
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:02,650
Then the engagement rings that we shared mean nothing to you?

355
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:08,090
The engagement we did in front of people and your children,

356
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:11,110
does that mean nothing to you?

357
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:26,490
You and I, just two of us,

358
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,890
went to an island and the vacation home.

359
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:35,580
We truly loved each other, and we were really happy together.

360
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,440
That's why...

361
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,490
That's why we got engaged.

362
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:47,990
But if you do this now, what should I do?

363
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:50,620
Stop, stop!

364
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,380
I got it, so stop it.

365
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,630
The one I liked was Ms. Park.

366
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:25,890
But how... How did this happen?

367
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,640
Is it true, Aunt?

368
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,610
Did my dad's memory really come back?

369
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:38,090
Does he remember all of his old memories?

370
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:40,710
Yes, he said he remembers it all.

371
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,710
My dad's memory came back.

372
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:48,320
Wow, I'm happy!

373
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,420
It was right that Chairman's memory came back.

374
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,900
But there is a little problem.

375
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,510
Problem? What problem?

376
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:02,350
His memory from when he lived as 22 years old after the accident

377
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,490
seems to have disappeared altogether.

378
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,970
He doesn't remember that at all.

379
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:10,870
What does that mean? Cute dad is gone,

380
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:14,970
but only the dictator dad has come back?

381
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:18,070
We played with a ball together, video games,

382
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:21,390
hide-and-seek, and went to karaoke.

383
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,540
But he doesn't remember any of it?

384
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,640
My dad was really fun.

385
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,140
So I'm telling you this beforehand, in case you might get surprised.

386
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,880
It's great that your dad gained back his memory,

387
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,130
but he can't remember the last three months he lived as 22 years old.

388
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:43,500
So even if your dad says nonsense, please understand him.

389
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,350
It's ridiculous.

390
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:49,430
How can his memory come in and out?

391
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:54,620
Then, I guess he won't remember that he was engaged to Chief Jo.

392
00:29:54,620 --> 00:30:00,090
No. So I'm telling you this not to be surprised.

393
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,440
I get it, Aunt.

394
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,830
Where is my dad now?

395
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:07,390
He has some business to do.

396
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:10,100
He will come back soon.

397
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,240
But Aunt, is my dad okay?

398
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,350
He lost his memories for three months, so he must be very confused.

399
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,940
Right. He's very confused.

400
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,900
So when your dad asks for help,

401
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,910
you have to fill in the gap for him, okay?

402
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,990
Let's go to bed now.

403
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:52,260
Chairman!

404
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,740
Ms. Park.

405
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,170
Chairman.

406
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:35,860
Are you feeling better?

407
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:38,230
I'm better now.

408
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:44,940
I heard that your memory had come back.

409
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,740
That's right.

410
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:51,270
But, I only remember before the accident.

411
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:53,970
After the accident,

412
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:56,050
I have no recollection yet.

413
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:58,620
It's all gone.

414
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:08,100
Regardless, it's a relief that your memory has returned.

415
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,330
Ms. Park,

416
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:26,220
I'm sorry.

417
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,280
Because of me, things must have been so difficult for you.

418
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:35,400
As you watched me getting engaged to Chief Jo

419
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,930
and how much that must have hurt you,

420
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:44,180
it really breaks my heart when I think about that.

421
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,600
Chairman,

422
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,330
I have only one thing to ask you.

423
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:01,560
Chairman, why did you...

424
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,540
Why, when you were dating Chief Jo,

425
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,720
did you hang a handkerchief on this tree

426
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,650
and receive my feelings?

427
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:15,100
When you're seeing another woman, you're not supposed to take my feelings as well.

428
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,560
Chairman, are you a cheater?

429
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,680
Did you take my heart just to play with it?

430
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,670
Ms. Park,

431
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:24,130
that's absolutely not the case.

432
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:26,470
I was never with Chief Jo then.

433
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:31,320
I never played with your feelings, Ms. Park.

434
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:35,410
But, how?

435
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:38,980
How could you..?

436
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:43,020
I also don't understand why I did that,

437
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:47,140
and if I could, I would turn the last three months around.

438
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:56,230
Yet, in front of people,

439
00:33:56,230 --> 00:34:00,340
and in front of the children, I got engaged.

440
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:03,700
I can't irresponsibly just ignore this.

441
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:07,460
The reality is that I got engaged to Chief Jo,

442
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,780
and there's no way I can deny that reality.

443
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:15,400
The person who got engaged is me,

444
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,510
and the person to take responsibility for this situation is me.

445
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:32,050
Ms. Park.

446
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:45,500
I'm so sorry that these are the only words I can say to you.

447
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:52,050
I sincerely apologize.

448
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:01,390
Yes, Chairman.

449
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:05,060
I understand what you're saying.

450
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,800
From now on,

451
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,740
I don't think I can be near you any longer.

452
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,850
I'm very sorry to the children,

453
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:17,950
but I will quit and leave tomorrow.

454
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:31,110
♫ Why do you run away, love ♫

455
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:35,170
♫ Like a shy child ♫

456
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:41,900
♫ In case I lose it, I hold it tight  ♫

457
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:49,040
♫ But love always runs away, chased by longing  ♫

458
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:57,220
♫  It would be nice to take a break  ♫

459
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:15,190
So, Ms. Park and my dad were truly in love with each other,

460
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:20,130
but when dad lost his memory, he wrongly got engaged to Chief Jo?

461
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,360
And that's why Ms. Park is leaving?

462
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,380
If that's the case, there's no way I can let Ms. Park go.

463
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:31,650
If my dad and Ms. Park love each other,

464
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,710
there's no way I can let them break up like this.

465
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:39,310
I'm going to bring the two of them back together!

466
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,770
Se Jong.

467
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:45,050
Lee Se Jong!

468
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:49,120
Hyung, what's the matter?

469
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,050
Is it already morning?

470
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:53,080
Hey, wake up.

471
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,290
This isn't a time for you to be peacefully sleeping.

472
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:01,260
Why, what's going on?

473
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,500
Lee Se Jong,

474
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,290
you need to listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

475
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:07,240
It's incredibly important.

476
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,390
What is it?

477
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:11,430
Can you live without Ms. Park?

478
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,500
No!

479
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,500
I can't be without Ms. Park.

480
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:21,280
Right? Then, we have to protect Ms. Park from the witch.

481
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,830
How did this happen?

482
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:11,350
Where are my clothes?

483
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:18,420
What's this? My cell phone's missing...

484
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,130
And where did my bag go?

485
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:24,180
How did this happen?

486
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,440
Lee Se Chan, Lee Se Jong.

487
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,120
Hyung, the door opened.

488
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:34,280
Oh, no! I guess the door opens towards the inside.

489
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,900
Se Chan, Se Jong, what are you doing here?

490
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,610
To make sure you don't leave, we're on guard.

491
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:44,700
Ms. Park, you absolutely cannot leave.

492
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,170
Did you kids hide my clothes?

493
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,090
My bag and my cell phone as well?

494
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:52,700
Yes. You will also find your shoes missing.

495
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,570
- Why?
- It's because you might leave.

496
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,050
Se Chan, Se Jong,

497
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:02,100
I told you already.

498
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:06,160
That I have a specific reason why I have to go.

499
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,590
So can you please let me out?

500
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:16,210
No. Ms. Park, you promised you'd be next to me.

501
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:20,060
Ms. Park, breaking promises is wrong. You're bad.

502
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:23,200
Ms. Park, you can't leave anyway!

503
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,840
We hid all your clothes, bags, and shoes.

504
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,450
So just stay here, please?

505
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,600
What's this commotion?

506
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,450
Are you kids over here protesting?

507
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:39,780
To stop Ms. Park from leaving, you hid her clothes and shoes and barricaded her door with the sofa?

508
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,180
My goodness, you kids!

509
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,500
- Ah! You freaked me out!
- Chairman.

510
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:51,900
I don't think Ms. Park can go. The kids hid all of her clothes and shoes to prevent her from leaving.

511
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,100
Ms. Park,

512
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,820
the kids love you so much, so just stay. Why on earth do you want to quit?

513
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:00,040
When the kids are trying to hold onto you this much, how can you go?

514
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,400
There's no way we can let Ms. Park go!

515
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,090
You were supposed to stay with us until next March.

516
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:10,220
Ms. Park, can't you just stay with us until then? Please?

517
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:13,300
Ms. Park, if you leave like this,

518
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,000
I'm going to follow you.

519
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,480
Ms. Park...

520
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,980
We're opposed to this! We're opposed to this!

521
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:30,680
Okay, I got it.

522
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,450
I won't leave.

523
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:37,460
Ms. Park, you're serious, right? You promised!

524
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,690
You're serious, right?

525
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:42,410
- Yes!
- Nice!

526
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:45,090
We did it!

527
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:04,410
For several reasons, it's right for me to leave.

528
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:07,600
But I think I've been thinking of myself too much.

529
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:12,250
I should have considered the children's hearts as well.

530
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:17,560
I've become very close with children throughout the time.

531
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:22,390
Thanks to them, I was able to stay here comfortably.

532
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:28,590
So hurting them by leaving like this doesn't feel right.

533
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:33,320
So as I promised, I will stay here for the remaining three months.

534
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:41,700
During the last three months, I'll organize it well so that the kids can accept it.

535
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:47,610
Are you sure that would be okay?

536
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:52,290
Yes. It's fine.

537
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:57,590
The truth is, you and I

538
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,770
won't have many reasons to see each other.

539
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:04,930
Ms. Park.

540
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:07,810
I really appreciate you.

541
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:12,820
And I'm very sorry.

542
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,220
Lee Se Jong, you did great.

543
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,760
You did great, too, Hyung.

544
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,220
But Se Jong, we need to get our minds right.

545
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,900
We only have three months left.

546
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:48,810
If we don't succeed with our project in three months, then we'll never see Ms. Park again, you know?

547
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:51,550
Yes. But Hyung,

548
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:55,410
can we bring Noona into our project?

549
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:58,440
We can't. Noona's in puberty right now.

550
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,790
Even aliens can't beat puberty.

551
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:04,580
Since she's so sensitive, she might like Ms. Park as our teacher,

552
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,310
but there's a chance that she won't like Ms. Park being our mom.

553
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:10,000
If she's against it, it's harder for us.

554
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,560
Hyung, would you really like it if Ms. Park became our mom?

555
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,750
Se Jong, to me, I think Ms. Park becoming our mom,

556
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:23,330
compared to Chief Jo becoming our mom, is a hundred-a thousand times better.

557
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:24,510
Me, too.

558
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:29,920
Se Jong, right now, Ms. Park and our dad are in a sad love situation.

559
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,030
So, we have to become their love bridge.

560
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:35,810
Love bridge?

561
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:38,320
Hyung, what's that?

562
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,330
You still haven't read the Gyunwoo and Jingnyuh?
 [T/E: It's Korean folklore like Romeo and Juliet.]

563
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:45,590
You've got to read a lot of books.

564
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:52,000
Chairman.

565
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:54,570
Where did your ring go?

566
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:56,870
Did you take it off?

567
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,670
For now, I've put it away safely.

568
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:04,950
- But still, Chairman, how--
- Chief Jo.

569
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:07,240
I thought about it all night.

570
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,120
The situation between you and me,

571
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,900
and the fact that I have no recollection of it now, leaves me very confused.

572
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,940
That being said,

573
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:19,620
I would like it if we went back to dealing with one another as we used to.

574
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:24,030
So, what you're saying is that you'd like to treat me, not as your fiancée,

575
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:27,540
but as a butler who works here?

576
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,860
For the time being, I think that would be best.

577
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,910
Chairman.

578
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:35,740
I have absolutely no feelings for you, Chief Jo.

579
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,810
Don't you think I also need time?

580
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:42,620
Perhaps in time, last three months I lost, just as I recovered my memory this time,

581
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:45,080
I think I will be able to remember again.

582
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,460
Regarding you and me,

583
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:51,230
let's discuss it again once my memory returns.

584
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,890
I hope you will understand my position.

585
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:57,680
This is my request, Chief Jo.

586
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,660
Yes. I understand.

587
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:09,310
Isn't this Young Gook?

588
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:12,400
Why is Young Gook calling me?

589
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,420
Has his memory come back?

590
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,430
- Hello?
 - Ji Young Noona.

591
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:20,670
It's me, Young Gook.

592
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:24,000
Oh, yes, Young Gook!

593
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,040
Did your memory come back?

594
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:33,700
You seriously don't remember the last three months after your accident?

595
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,730
Not a thing.

596
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:39,220
It's still such a relief that your memory came back like this.

597
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:45,350
About the company, about the kids, I was worried about a lot.

598
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:47,710
I must've made you worry a lot, Noona.

599
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:49,470
You did.

600
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:55,400
For me, all I did was worry. But you, it must have been really hard on you.

601
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:02,610
In a matter of a day, you lost your memory and returned to age 22. You must have been so confused and scared.

602
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:07,230
I heard I was rude to you. Mrs. Yeoju told me.

603
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:08,920
Yes, you did.

604
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,850
Do you know how you were? "You're seriously my Ji Young Noona?"

605
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:18,500
"What is this bull shit? Get out of here, now!"

606
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:27,030
And then you were glaring at me and shouting so that I couldn't say a word to you, and I got kicked out on the spot.

607
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:32,600
I... I was that harsh?

608
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,360
Yes, you were.

609
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:38,470
Even if I wanted to go check on you since I was worried about you,

610
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:44,440
I was afraid of being chased out again, so I'd just ask Lawyer Koh for updates instead.

611
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,290
Is that so.

612
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:48,080
I'm sorry, Noona.

613
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,340
No need to be sorry.

614
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:55,280
I understood. How could a 22-year-old you recognize my face?

615
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:02,160
Since I got in that car accident in the States and had to have facial reconstructive surgery, of course, you didn't recognize me.

616
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:05,440
But Noona, have you been sick?

617
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,710
You look so pale.

618
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:09,250
Oh, really?

619
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:11,010
I'm not sick.

620
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:14,370
I've just been working a little too hard lately.

621
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:17,260
Take it easy on your work. If you don't, you'll destroy your body.

622
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:20,040
Aigoo, okay, I get it.

623
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:24,090
Since my memory's back, let's see each other more often.

624
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:26,630
Okay, let's do that.

625
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:31,280
Now that your memory is back, now my heart is at ease.

626
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,680
Hey, Young Gook.

627
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,520
I'm just saying this in case.

628
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:42,940
But if something happens to me,

629
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:48,170
I'd like you to take care of my work.

630
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:50,890
What are you talking about?

631
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:56,060
With your accident this time, and mine in the past,

632
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,540
we really don't know what might happen.

633
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:02,510
If something like that happens again,

634
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,800
I'm asking you to finish things up for me.

635
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:10,140
You're the only person I can trust.

636
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:13,010
Of course, I will.

637
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:16,010
But why are you talking like that?

638
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:18,620
Oh, just because.

639
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,740
What are you going to do about your engagement issue?

640
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:24,890
Didn't you get engaged to Chief Jo?

641
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:29,360
When I clear that up, I'll tell you then.

642
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,480
Okay.

643
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,430
Here.

644
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:45,530
CEO, what is all this?

645
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:48,460
Eat as much as you want, Ms. Park.

646
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:53,640
It's been so long since I've cooked, I wonder if you'll like it.

647
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:59,080
I was craving a home-cooked meal, so I started cooking, and then I thought of you.

648
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,690
You're going to eat with me, right?

649
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:05,870
Of course. Thank you so much.

650
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:08,230
Please, try it.

651
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,360
It's so good.

652
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,480
Oh, really? What a relief.

653
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,060
The egg roll is so good too.

654
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:25,780
Since the egg roll has onion, carrots, and green onions, the color is so pretty as well.

655
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:29,550
Here, try some of the bulgogi.

656
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:35,720
The bulgogi is good, too.

657
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,900
CEO, you should eat as well.

658
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,750
Okay.

659
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:42,810
Eat well, Ms. Park.

660
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:57,870
I'm finally making food for my daughter.

661
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:02,600
Thank you for liking my food, Dan Dan.

662
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,050
Ji Young, Ji Young, why are you doing this?

663
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:10,220
Then what about me? What about our Dan Dan?

664
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,960
CEO.

665
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,050
What's the matter?

666
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:39,270
I just thought about my past.

667
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:41,820
Ms. Park.

668
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:49,290
Can I hold you in my arms once?

669
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:51,200
Yes.

670
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:02,340
Ms. Park, thank you.

671
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:10,830
I'm sorry, Dan Dan. I'm really sorry.

672
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:13,330
I'm sorry.

673
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:18,220
Why is the CEO being like this?

674
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:23,230
Does she have a tragic story?

675
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:30,400
Since she's crying, it makes me shed tears, too.

676
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,600
I'm Anna Kim, who spoke with you over the phone.

677
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:51,550
I'm here to write my will.

678
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:06,450
Grandmother, Mother. How do you do?

679
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:09,870
Oh my, young lady! How did you find this place?

680
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:11,560
Oh my, who is this?

681
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,810
Young lady, how can you come back here?

682
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:18,070
- What is it?
- Grandmother.

683
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:20,850
I'll do this. Have some rest.

684
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:24,630
Why are you acting like this?

685
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:28,950
Please stop that and go. Dae Beom's father will flip if he sees you.

686
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:32,110
Mother, please think of me as a part-time staff.

687
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:37,690
I am going to work here until we are allowed to marry.

688
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:40,390
Why is this young lady so stubborn!

689
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,820
Please go before Dae Beom's father comes.

690
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:45,540
Please, leave now.

691
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:49,680
Ms. Se Ryun. What are you doing here?

692
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,310
Why are you here?

693
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:54,880
Honey, she was just passing by and came in.

694
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,530
Please go, go.

695
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:07,130
Father. It's okay if you don't give us permission now.

696
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:10,040
But, please give me a chance.

697
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:15,560
I will show you what sort of person I am by working here.

698
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,340
After that, you can reject me and kick me out.

699
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:22,200
I know my mother treated you terribly.

700
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:27,890
But please don't hate me because of it.

701
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:32,060
Dae Beom and I love each other very much.

702
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:36,970
Please think of it as saving us.

703
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:41,660
Please don't tell me to go.

704
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:44,230
Even a dead person's wish could be fulfilled.

705
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:47,710
Why can't you hear my wish?

706
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:53,480
Se Ryun, why are you here?

707
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:58,130
Let's go outside, Se Ryun. Let's go out for now.

708
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:00,550
Welcome!

709
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:03,670
Please come this way.

710
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:08,290
What can I get for you?

711
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:09,390
What's the best menu?

712
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:12,070
Honey, let's talk for a second.

713
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:20,700
Honey, she's giving so much effort. Why don't we give her a chance?

714
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:25,760
Dae Beom seems to like her very much too.

715
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,910
Why don't we let it go?

716
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:33,780
Are you saying we should approve their marriage? That's never happening.

717
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:37,770
That's not what I mean. I'm saying let's see how she does.

718
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:43,440
Let's just think of her as a part-time staff for now, as she said so.

719
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,270
She hasn't done anything wrong. It's her mother who has wronged.

720
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:54,630
Her mom is terrible, and that doesn't mean she is.

721
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:59,740
Just make sure she knows we will not approve their marriage.

722
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:01,880
Okay, Honey.

723
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:18,790
I doubted it, but what the heck are you doing here?

724
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:20,700
And what are you wearing?

725
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,380
Hey, are you over here peeling garlic?

726
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,640
How can you make her do this crap!

727
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:27,000
What the heck are you doing in someone else's house!

728
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,060
Here! Here!

729
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:33,540
Dae Beom's grandmother, and Driver Park can't approve of our marriage.

730
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:36,770
Until you get on your knees and beg for forgiveness, they won't give us their blessing.

731
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:41,000
So come with me now and get on your knees and apologize.

732
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:46,240
What am I going to do with Se Ryun?

733
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,680
What if she gets pregnant by staying with him?

734
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:54,080
Then it's a done deal.

735
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:57,020
No matter how crazy about the shares I am,

736
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:00,470
I can't leave my only daughter there.

737
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:02,310
Right.

738
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:13,480
Mrs. Jang, where are you now?

739
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:23,280
Oh my goodness, you must be so upset.

740
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:28,070
I can only speak to you about this.

741
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:32,710
I'm so embarrassed, and my pride hurts.

742
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:38,570
No matter how poor they are, how can they be so fraudulent?

743
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:42,530
Wasn't it enough for them to sneak in and live at your place?

744
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:44,750
I've never seen such a thing.

745
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:48,010
My Se Ryun keeps saying that's not the situation,

746
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:52,650
but I think the father who used to be our driver made his son do this.

747
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:55,890
They've tricked my daughter.

748
00:56:55,890 --> 00:57:00,440
Oh, my goodness. How intricately must they've planned the whole thing

749
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:05,010
for her to have fallen so deeply until now?

750
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:08,320
They really are a terrible family!

751
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:14,320
Right? They will be punished by heaven.

752
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:20,720
I went there to look for my Se Ryun,

753
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:24,210
and she was wearing a laborer's pants

754
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:30,600
and peeling garlic in that house!

755
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:35,910
What did you say?

756
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:39,330
Was she peeling garlic?

757
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:43,220
Oh, my goodness. Those people decided to make her their daughter-in-law

758
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:50,390
and gas-lit her so much for her even to do that!

759
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:54,110
There's no doubt they approached your daughter

760
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:56,930
knowing that she has the right to the company's share.

761
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:59,720
Seriously...

762
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,580
I really feel like I will get sick.

763
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:08,070
I have to bring my Se Ryun out of that family.

764
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:14,530
There is no way I can watch my daughter's shares going to that family.

765
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:18,320
Please save me, Mrs. Jang.

766
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:21,910
How can there be such a trashy family?

767
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:29,690
No matter how poor they are. How can they lure a rich family's daughter to change their future?

768
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:33,920
There are too many bad people in the world.

769
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,860
I'm so excited. What movie should we see?

770
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:40,090
- Whatever you want to see.
- Whatever I want to see?

771
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:45,950
What's wrong, Joon Oh?

772
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:49,390
My mom's over there.

773
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:52,130
- Your mom?
- Yes.

774
00:58:56,770 --> 00:59:01,580
Your mom is very stylish. She looks chic.

775
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:08,820
Let's go now.

776
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:10,480
Okay.

777
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:19,580
Se Chan, you wanted to talk to me about something, but why did we come to a bookstore?

778
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:24,360
That's because since you don't remember being 22 years old.

779
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:28,570
So if I told you what we did at that time,

780
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:31,530
I thought it might help you to remember it.

781
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:36,110
Then I suddenly remembered that I needed to buy workbooks.

782
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:39,340
Workbooks? What kind?

783
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:41,980
These ones.

784
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:44,510
They are right here.

785
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:47,180
Is that all you need? Shall we go now?

786
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:51,870
No, while I'm here, I need to get some more books.

787
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:54,540
I like reading these days.

788
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:57,960
Okay. I approve of reading lots of books.

789
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:01,140
Get whatever books you want to read.

790
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:09,480
Why isn't Se Jong here yet?

791
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,340
Did he forget our plan?

792
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:17,080
Isn't that Se Jong over there?

793
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,220
Hyung.

794
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:24,550
How can I run into you here, Se Jong?

795
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:29,120
Hyung, what brought you here?

796
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:32,070
I came here to buy workbooks, of course.

797
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:34,520
What brought you here?

798
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:38,380
I came here to buy children's books.

799
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:41,430
Gyunwoo and Jingnyuh.

800
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:47,650
Dad, I'm hungry all of a sudden.

801
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:51,000
Can we go for pizza after we are done here?

802
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,980
I'm hungry too, all of a sudden.

803
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:56,190
Dad, please buy us pizza.

804
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:58,530
Okay, let's go for pizza.

805
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,000
Awesome!

806
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,080
Nice!

807
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:08,970
Then, I will get going first.

808
01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:13,190
You can't. You have to come with us since we came here together.

809
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:16,020
That's right. Please come with us.

810
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:22,150
If you go first, we will feel very bad.

811
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:24,260
Please.

812

Like before.

818
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:18,680
Good idea, Se Jong!

819
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:22,860
You and Ms. Park hold hands with each other first.

820
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,860
And I hold Ms. Park's hand.

821
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:27,850
Then I will hold Dad's hand!

822

Hey, Jin Sang Goo. What're you doing here? What do you think we are?

01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:28,350
Sarah. Lend me some money.

833
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:30,940
What? Money?

834
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:34,840
I betrayed you because of that damn money.

835
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:38,140
Now, I've got nothing because of my divorce.

836
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:41,160
I'm not saying just give it to me. I'll pay you back.

Crazy bastard.

838
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:45,430
Hey, hey. I will pay you back double.

839
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:47,320
Move aside.

840
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,120
Just hear me out.

841
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,690
- Move aside!
- I'd pay you back.

842
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:53,390
I said I'd pay you back.

843
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:58,470
Are you okay, Chief Jo?

844
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:00,820
What are you doing?

845
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:03,110
This dude is here again.

846
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:08,600
Chief Jo. Who is this guy to keep coming over to harass you?

847
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:15,210
Acquaintances are talking here. Who the heck are you to interrupt?

848
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:17,390
Do you know this person?

849
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:20,800
Were you really having a conversation with him?

850
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:25,370
No, I have nothing to talk about with this person.

851
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,110
Chief Jo says nothing to say to you. What are you going to do?

852
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:34,660
Should I call the police, or do you want to take me on?

853
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:40,670
Okay, I will go today.

854
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:45,780
But think of my request. I will be in touch.

855
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:05,340
It's a good thing I saw you on the way to get my stuff. What would you have done?

856
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:11,780
I don't know what it's about but if you need my help in the future, let me know.

857
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:17,990
Please do what you've come for.

858
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:45,870
Hello, CEO Anna, it's me.

859
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:50,270
I've brought some porridge, can I come up?

860
01:05:50,270 --> 01:05:55,620
Oh, no. I'm at a beach right now.

861
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:59,580
Pardon? A beach?

862
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:02,430
In the middle of the night, by yourself?

863
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:06,240
Yes. I wanted to see the ocean.

864
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:14,860
CEO.

865
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:18,260
CEO, are you alright?

866
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:20,990
CEO! CEO!

01:06:22,930 --> 01:06:28,590
Driver Park, I am okay.

868
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:31,920
Where are you now? I will come there.

869
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:39,790
Taxi. Taxi!

870
01:06:39,790 --> 01:06:41,550
Taxi.

871
01:06:57,510 --> 01:07:00,530
CEO Anna.

872
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:02,610
CEO Anna!

873
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:07,960
CEO.

874
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:27,240
CEO. The wind is cold. Why are you here like this?

875
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:31,000
You are getting surgery soon.

876
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:35,540
CEO Anna. Let's go.

877
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:39,370
Seeing the ocean sitting here like this,

878
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:44,350
I realized what a fool I was.

879
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:51,020
For what did I live struggling so much?

880
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:54,940
This is all there was.

881
01:07:54,940 --> 01:08:01,330
One step forward, and everything could end.

882
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:12,200
Why did I cause such pain and suffering?

883
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:16,480
Am I getting punished for that?

884
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:22,170
The ocean wind is cold.

885
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:25,020
Let's go. I will take you home.

What if I don't wake up from the surgery?

890
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:52,230
I still have things left to do.

891
01:08:52,230 --> 01:08:57,920
I don't want to die. I want to live.

Is he drawing the line on Chief Jo?

How can you do this to me, Chairman!

- What did you say?
- Am I a toy you can play with and then throw away?

What are you doing right now!

- You are here, too, Ms. Park.
- Yes.

I really don't know what to do.
