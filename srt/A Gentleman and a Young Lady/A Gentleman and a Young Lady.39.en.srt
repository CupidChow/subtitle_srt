Dan Dan! Dan Dan!

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,140
Dan Dan! Dan Dan, wait!

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,870
Dan Dan!

5
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,900
Dan Dan!

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,260
Dan Dan!

7
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,060
Dad...

8
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,620
Dad!

9
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,090
Dad!

10
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,920
What should I do?

11
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,320
Dad, what should I do?

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,820
Please wake up, Dad!

13
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,820
What do I do? Wake up, Dad!

14
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,400
Dad!

15
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,840
What do I do?

16
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,090
Dad!

[Ambulance]

18
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,790
Soo Chul!

19
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,020
Soo Chul, what happened?

20
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,130
What happened to him?

21
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,770
What happened, Soo Chul?

22
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,730
It's me, Soo Chul.

23
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,620
Open your eyes.

24
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,710
Dan Dan, what happened?

25
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,890
Why won't he open his eyes?

26
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,450
Did he hurt his head?

27
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,930
You were with him when he got in the accident. What happened!

28
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,830
Dad was chasing me on his motorcycle.

29
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,730
What? Did this happen because of you?

30
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:01,460
So why did you run away?

31
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,460
What are you going to do?

32
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,810
What are you going to do if your dad dies?

33
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,330
Noona, calm down.

34
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,620
Why are you being harsh to Dan Dan? She must have been shocked.

35
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,580
Honey, what should I do?

36
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,410
Honey, don't leave me.

37
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,370
Sister-in-law, calm down.

38
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,700
Why would he die?

39
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,630
Dan Dan, did the doctor examine him?

40
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,000
What did they say?

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,080
Fortunately, he's fine everywhere else.

42
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,990
But he had a slight fracture on his left arm, so they did a soft cast.

43
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,950
Is that really the case?

44
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,380
Nothing else's wrong?

45
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:42,790
But he had a slight injury to his head.

46
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,590
So he needed to be admitted for further tests.

47
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,780
The results will be out in the morning.

48
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,040
Does he need further tests?

49
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,090
Could he be in a vegetative state?

50
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,980
Oh, no! What do we do?

51
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,020
Sister-in-law, how can you say such unspeakable things?

52
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,960
How can you say a vegetative human?

53
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,620
She's right, Yeon Sil.

54
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,270
How can you speak so carelessly?

55
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,810
My son-in-law Park will be okay.

56
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,730
Mom, Father will be fine.

57
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,510
So please calm down.

58
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,250
Mom, uncle has opened his eyes.

59
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,710
Yes, he has.

60
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,100
Can you see me, Honey?

61
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,480
Soo Chul, Soo Chul, this is your sister.

62
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,600
Your sister. Can you see all of your family here?

63
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,920
- Yes.
- Oh, Honey.

64
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,010
Oh, Honey.

65
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,320
- It's good.
- Dan Dan.

66
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,930
Dad.

67
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,370
Are you alright?

68
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:51,120
Dan Dan. You can never be with Chairman Lee.

69
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,380
Please don't go there.

70
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,620
Please stay at home, okay?

71
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:01,520
Dad. Why are you acting like this?

72
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,480
Hey, Park Dan Dan!

73
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,820
What's wrong with her?

74
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,620
Honey...

75
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,910
Chairman, my dad...

76
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,210
My dad got into an accident because of me.

77
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,260
What are you saying?

78
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:31,090
Ms. Park. Please tell me what happened calmly.

79
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,250
That is...

80
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,260
I was running away from home.

81
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:43,640
My dad was following me on his motorcycle.

82
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,980
And he got into an accident.

83
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,850
So, we are in an emergency room.

84
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,200
He just barely woke up.

85
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,680
Even in that state,

86
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,050
he told me to break up with you.

87
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,730
What do we do, Chairman?

88
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,000
Ms. Park.

89
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,560
Which hospital are you at?

90
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,150
I will go there now.

91
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,620
When the test results come out tomorrow morning,

92
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,750
he will be discharged unless something shows up.

93
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,370
Please go home, Sister-in-law.

94
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,930
I will stay here.

95
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,360
Yes, please, Noona. Please take your mom home, Joon Oh.

96
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,120
- Yes.
- Sister-in-law.

97
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,950
Please call me as soon as you get the result. Okay?

98
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,690
Yes, Sister-in-law.

99
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,520
You should take mom home too, Geon.

100
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,840
And Dae Beom, please finish the closing at the store.

101
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,060
Okay. Let's go, Grandma and Uncle.

102
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,360
Dan Dan, go home with your grandma as well.

103
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,900
No, Mom. I will go later.

104
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,310
Sure. Dan Dan should stay.

105
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,900
She won't feel right staying at home.

106
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,640
We will go now. Stay with your mom.

107
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,370
- Yes.
- Let's go.

108
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,690
Please rest, Brother-in-law. We'll get going now.

109
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,910
Go ahead.

110
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,990
Please go and get us something to drink.

111
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,350
I have something to discuss with Dan Dan.

112
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,760
What?

113
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,120
Okay.

114
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,540
Can he not speak in my presence?

115
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,880
He's constantly excluding me and talking to each other.

116
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,050
If he weren't injured, I would have hit him once.

117
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,280
This is why Dan Dan doesn't take me seriously.

118
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,420
Dan Dan.

119
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:55,900
Because you work in that house and see Chairman Lee every day,

120
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,180
it won't be easy to end your feelings for him.

121
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,200
So like I told you, you should quit right now and leave that house.

122
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,100
If you don't see him,

123
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,730
you will forget about him in no time, like magic.

124
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,160
Dad.

125
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,420
My feeling for the Chairman is not a momentary emotion.

126
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:20,570
I thought about it over and over if this was the right thing to do.

127
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,160
No matter how much I think about it,

128
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,860
my feelings for the Chairman are genuine.

129
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,370
I... like him a lot.

130
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,350
So Dad,

131
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:36,400
can't you just trust me and watch?

132
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,050
- Dad, please.
- Park Dan Dan.

133
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,630
When I'm begging you like this,

134
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,800
won't you listen to me?

135
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,750
This is something that shouldn't happen. It shouldn't!

136
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,930
I came after hearing you got injured.

137
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,710
- How are you feeling?
- How dare you come here?

138
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,910
With whose permission?

139
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,800
Leave immediately. Right now!

140
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,180
Why are you doing this, Dad?

141
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,630
I told him that you were hurt,

142
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,690
so he came because he was worried about you.

143
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,770
It feels like this happened because of me. I'm so sorry.

144
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,660
I don't want to hear that from you!

145
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,200
Dan Dan will quit working at that house.

146
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,550
So please pack all her things and send them to us!

147
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,380
Dad.

148
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,950
For someone at your age, what are you doing with a young child?

149
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,390
Are you not embarrassed?

150
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,200
Dad, you're going too far!

151
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,970
Honey, calm down.

152
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,600
Tell this person to leave.

153
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,960
Chairman, I think it would be best if you left for today.

154
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,710
Because of his accident, he's not in good shape.

155
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,380
Why don't you talk with him next time?

156
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,240
Okay.

157
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,800
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,200
Please get well soon.

159
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,150
Dad, I'm telling you clearly.

160
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,930
Even if you act like this,

161
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,350
I won't ever break up with the Chairman.

162
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,220
I'm really sorry,

163
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,540
but I'm going to leave with the Chairman.

164
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,160
Let's go.

165
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,560
Dan Dan, you stay there!

166
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,290
Let's leave now.

167
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,730
Ms. Park, just stay here.

168
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,950
Stay with your father and take care of him today.

169
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,220
Please do so.

170
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,940
Then, I'll be leaving.

171
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,180
Goodbye.

172
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,310
Dad, you're going overboard.

173
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,880
Chairman came all the way here to see you.

174
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,850
I will see him off, at least.

175
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,720
- Dan Dan. Park Dan Dan!
- Honey.

176
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,590
She will only see him off. Let her go.

177
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,060
Oh, my goodness!

178
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,260
It's just me.

179
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,360
Why are you so startled?

180
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,210
I was surprised since you suddenly hugged me from behind.

181
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,980
Why would you be surprised like that?

182
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:42,430
Aren't I the only woman in the world who can hug you from behind?

183
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:46,530
That is true. But it was so unexpected.

184
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,820
Why are you out here when I told you to stay there?

185
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:55,040
Since you came all the way here, I wanted to walk you to the parking lot.

186
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,410
Let's go.

187
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:04,660
Don't you like it that I've come to see you off like this?

188
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,630
Are you touched?

189
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,100
I like it. I'm touched.

190
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:18,140
We got here so quickly.

191
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,520
I can't help it.

192
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,180
I will walk you back inside.

193
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,740
It's okay.

194
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,530
I've come to see you off, so please go on home.

195
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:37,500
Then, I will go after I see you go inside. Please go inside first.

196
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,450
Please go first, Chairman.

197
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:44,680
I will go after I see you off.

198
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:49,440
I can't stop your stubbornness.

199
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,930
I give in.

200
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,080
It's cold out. Please go inside.

201
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,820
Chairman. Fighting!

202
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:11,210
Yes. Fighting!

203
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,300
- I'm going.
- Yes.

204
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:29,590
I'm sorry, Chairman.

205
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,030
What should we do, really?

206
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,200
What's going to happen with Dan Dan?

207
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,740
I don't think my uncle will approve till the end.

208
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,880
I also think he won't approve.

209
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,380
But I never thought that Dan Dan would have such a shocking relationship.

210
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:10,130
I only saw this kind of relationship in TV shows or movies, not in real life.

211
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:16,050
Even among my friends, I don't know anyone dating an older man.

212
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:22,760
I think uncle is more bothered by him being the father of three children than his age.

213
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,640
I don't know any couple like that either.

214
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,820
They are a shocking couple.

215
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,160
What would you do in their shoes?

216
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,240
What if your daughter was in such a relationship in the future?

217
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,940
Hey, you are going too far. I'm not even married, and how can I be thinking of a daughter?

218
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,920
I said, what if!

219
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:53,770
Actually, we are more of a problem than Dan Dan.

220
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:57,360
Joon Oh, what's going to happen to us?

221
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,280
We are not a shocking couple at all.

222
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,890
Just that we are in-laws, that's the only thing.

223
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:09,900
So Mi Rim, do not worry.

224
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:14,750
Mi Rim, why don't we go over there and have a fish cake?

225
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,930
Okay.

226
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,360
Daughter-in-law, I need some money.

227
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,050
Not too much, just a little. About 50 million won.

228
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:35,900
My friends and I are going to Hawaii for a vacation.

229
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:43,240
Mother-in-law, I've told you many times already.

230
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,230
I can't give you any more than your allowance.

231
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:50,050
So you will need to go on a trip within your allowance budget.

232
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:54,640
I'm saying I'm not just crossing the Han River.

233
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,780
We are going to Hawaii. Hawaii.

234
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:05,790
But still, my husband told me not to give you any other money than your allowance.

235
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:10,170
Absolutely not! You know that he said that.

236
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:14,330
So I will pretend I didn't hear your request. Okay?

237
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,050
Honey, my darling, I'm home!

238
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,670
Oh, my husband is here!

239
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:35,680
Honey, my darling. I bought a diamond necklace for you.

240
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,390
Oh, Baby! Thank you so much.

241
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,840
These diamonds are so big!

242
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,700
They are beautiful.

243
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,660
- Do you like it, Baby?
- Yes, I love it.

244
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,930
It's more beautiful because the rock is big. I love it very, very much!

245
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,850
It freaks me out just thinking about it.

246
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,610
What should I do if that ever really happens?

247
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:25,450
No, no. That can't happen.

248
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,030
Yes, I have to split them up.

249
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:32,380
I have to destroy the entire fraudulent family.

250
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,690
It's no time for me to be idle.

251
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,760
Oh, what brings you to my house?

252
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,740
Right! Are you here to apologize to me?

253
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,580
Hey, the head of the fraudsters.

254
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,150
No matter how much you love money.

255
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,730
How could you covet our Chairman Lee?

256
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,090
You couldn't make it work with my Se Ryun.

257
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:04,590
So you turned your niece into a gold digger to take over the Madam of the house?

258
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,980
What?

259
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,620
What did you say? A gold digger?

260
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:13,610
Are you talking about our Dan Dan now?

261
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:17,820
Yes, you, head of the fraudsters. You planned this all out, didn't you?

262
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:24,640
How can such a young girl go after our Chairman Lee? Isn't that a gold digger?

263
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,630
Get her off of our Young Gook this minute.

264
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,950
Take your niece out of our house!

265
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,290
If you don't, I will not be quiet.

266
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:36,420
Oh my, unbelievable. Isn't that what I should be saying?

267
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:40,790
I'm not at the FT Group level, but I have enough money to live on!

268
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,780
I don't lack anything anywhere.

269
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:48,290
And I don't approve of Chairman Lee, neither does my brother, Soo Chul!

270
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:54,730
My young baby Dan Dan is dating old Chairman Lee, who has three children. We are all in shock.

271
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,160
My brother Soo Chul has been hospitalized!

272
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,020
Aigoo, are you saying that family disapproves of my Young Gook?

273
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,720
Do you expect me to believe that?

274
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:11,580
Believe it or not! At least, we don't sell our daughter like you!

275
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:16,190
What? What did you say? When did I sell my daughter?

276
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:20,750
You're just a fraud who's scamming other families!

277
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:26,370
You are the head of a fraud group!

278
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,990
- Hey, you!
- Oh, my goodness!

279
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:34,010
You only see what you are! You, mere mistress!

280
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:37,260
You wanted to get the company's share so bad

281
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,830
that you were going to sell your daughter! Am I wrong? You mistress wench!

282
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:45,090
Oh my God, did you just call me a mistress wench?

283
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,610
You head fraudster wench!

284
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:53,080
- Hey, you!
- Let go, let go of this, you mistress wench!

285
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,790
- You mistress wench!
- Please, stop!

286
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:03,390
Chief Jo, she called me a mistress wench and accused me of selling my daughter!

287
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:07,370
Gi Ja, that mistress wench said!

288
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:12,140
That I am the head of the fraudster parasite family!

289
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,830
Hey! You are the head of the fraudulent family!

290
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,310
- Hey, hey.
- Hey!

291
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:23,000
- Parasite!
- Mistress wench!

292
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,270
You'll pay for this!

293
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:31,050
- Mistress wench!
- The head of the fraud!

294
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,760
- Hey!
- Mistress wench!

295
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:40,030
Is Mi Sook Ms. Park's aunt? There's nobody you can trust in this world.

296
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:45,010
But how did she keep that from us all this time?

297
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:49,460
- Did you really not know?
- Of course, not!

298
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:54,630
Did Mi Sook really plan all this out, as Dae Ran said?

299
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:59,850
To get her niece, Ms. Park, to be with Chairman Lee?

300
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,680
What have you been doing until now, not even knowing about that?

301
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:07,330
No way. Mi Sook is not that conniving.

302
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,960
But has that Chairman Lee gone insane? After he calls off the engagement with you,

303
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,430
he's just with that country bumpkin, Ms. Park?

304
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:20,070
I'm speechless since it's too ridiculous.

305
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:27,460
But is that true that Driver Park disapproves of Ms. Park's relationship with the Chairman?

306
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,820
You heard that with me.

307
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:34,760
He locked up Ms. Park to stop her from seeing Chairman Lee.

308
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:40,450
But what does that matter to us at this point?

309
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:45,330
Don't even look that way. I'm sick of it.

310
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,290
That head of the fraudsters!

311
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,160
Driver Kang. Please go to the office, instead of home.

312
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,600
Yes, Madam.

313
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,610
Those lowly boggards are disrespecting me.

314
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,510
I won't leave them alone.

315
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,270
That head of the fraudsters!

316
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:08,170
For someone at your age, what are you doing with a young child?

317
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,730
Are you not embarrassed?

318
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,950
Chairman Lee.

319
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:24,420
I just saw Madam Jang.

320
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,810
Are you really thinking about marrying Ms. Park?

321
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,840
Did you go to introduce yourself formally to them?

322
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,160
Yes, I did.

323
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,660
What?

324
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,660
I heard that Driver Park disapproves of you.

325
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,140
You got kicked out of that house.

326
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,960
This is humiliating.

327
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,210
Hey, I'm scared the world will find out.

328
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:52,100
How can you be rejected by that parasite family?

329
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:57,190
Did you come to my workplace to talk about that?

330
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,920
What's more important than this at this moment?

331
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:05,370
Why? Are you embarrassed because I pointed out your foolish behaviors?

332
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,890
Then please get yourself together now!

333
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:12,030
Do you know how your father established this FT Group?

334
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:15,920
Every part of it is from his blood and sweat.

335
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,910
But you will marry the daughter of that fraudulent parasite family

336
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:24,620
and give them everything your father worked for?

337
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,410
Even if you have lost your mind from being bitten by that gold digger,

338
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:32,910
your father will wail in heaven!

339
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:38,380
Secretary Yoon and Secretary Kim, please come in.

340
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:47,070
Please escort her out.

341
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,680
Hey, Chairman Lee!

342
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,670
Also, prohibit her from entering my office or the building without my consent from now on.

343
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,100
Please advise that to the security.

344
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,200
Yes, sir.

345
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,720
Let's go, Madam.

346
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,380
Hey, get out of my way and let go of this!

347
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,910
Hey, I lived with your father for more than twenty years.

348
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,890
I'm the mother of your sister, Se Ryun.

349
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,310
That means I am a mother to you as well!

350
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,070
This immoral bastard...

351
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:20,620
You rude bastard.

352
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,010
Get out of my way!

353
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,250
I'm speechless.

354
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,010
Your brother banned me from the company.

355
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,300
As if I were some salesperson!

356
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,490
Why did you go to Oppa's workplace?

357
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,110
Then am I supposed to sit back

358
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:49,010
and watch that girl taking over the main bedroom?

359
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:54,030
Rather than receiving an allowance from that wench, I'd bite my tongue and kill myself.

360
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:58,110
Mom, it's not like Oppa will marry Ms. Park right away.

361
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,820
Why all the fuss?

362
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,200
You have no idea.

363
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,640
Your brother went to see Ms. Park's family. What does that mean?

364
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,340
He's thinking of marrying Ms. Park.

365
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,930
What? Did he go to see Driver Park's family?

366
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,170
Yes.

367
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:19,970
But of all things, Driver Park rejected him.

368
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:23,660
It's because he's too old and has three kids.

369
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,150
It's too ridiculous that I'm speechless.

370
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,840
Is that for real?

371
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,361
Yes, it is.

372
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,370
Chief Jo, what brings you here?

373
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,610
What's with all the flowers?

374
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,750
I'm here instead of Ms. Jung.

375
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,350
I'm here to do the flower arrangement.

376
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:44,280
Are you working at Ms. Jung's flower shop?

377
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,110
Yes. It worked out that way.

378
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:53,850
But where is Ms. Park?

379
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:56,300
I think something happened to her.

380
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,940
Jenny said Driver Park came here and took her away.

381
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,670
I think that means...

382
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,090
I heard from Ms. Jung.

383
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:11,580
We will need arrangements for living rooms here and upstairs and the Chairman's office and bedroom.

384
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,470
Also, Madam's room. It's five places.

385
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,920
I'm sure you know it well.

386
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,010
Yes. I'll look forward to working together from now on.

387
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,530
The flowers look nice today.

388
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:38,530
They smell nice too.

389
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:42,310
Chief Jo, thank you always.

390
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,100
Se Jong, hello.

391
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,010
Chief Jo Ajumma.

392
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:07,170
Se Jong, have you been well?

393
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,840
Yes.

394
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:13,950
Se Jong, will you go up and put your bag down, wash your hands and come down?

395
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,360
I will have snacks for you.

396
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,170
Yes.

397
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:34,440
Right. I'm okay with this much humiliation.

398
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,480
Since I can see Se Jong this way,

399
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,610
that's good enough.

400
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,200
Dad.

401
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,310
Since you've been discharged without a problem,

402
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:58,550
I will go back now.

403
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,640
Would that be okay?

404
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,570
Dan Dan, let's go together in a bit.

405
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:07,110
Let's have tea first.

406
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,030
Why would I go with you?

407
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,990
I can go by myself.

408
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:14,190
Where are you going when you are not well?

409
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:18,520
No, no. Let's go right now.

410
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,820
Dan Dan, I will go with you and get your things.

411
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,040
Dad.

412
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:27,450
You can't stay there. Listen to me.

413
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,330
Why are you acting like this, Dad?

414
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,750
I've explained to you that my feelings towards him are genuine.

415
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,610
Then, shouldn't you give it consideration?

416
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,700
Why are you just saying no?

417
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,340
I'm twenty-seven. I'm an adult.

418
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,390
I have the right to choose the person I like.

419
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,730
Dan Dan.

420
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:50,180
If I were going to break up because you disapproved, I would not have started it in the first place.

421
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,870
And I'm still the children's teacher.

422
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,860
I have things to do there.

423
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,470
I will get going now.

424
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,520
Dan Dan. Park Dan Dan!

425
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,500
- Dan Dan!
- That's enough.

426
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,470
You got into an accident chasing after her. Wasn't that enough?

427
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,870
Let go of me!

428
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,410
Chairman.

429
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:17,560
Ms. Park, how did you get here?

430
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,940
Is your father okay now?

431
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,440
Yes. There is no issue with the test results,

432
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,650
so he is discharged.

433
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,360
Really?

434
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,320
That's great.

435
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,490
By the way, why did you come here?

436
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,150
Did...

437
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:38,930
Did your father give his blessings for us?

438
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,760
No.

439
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,600
I just...

440
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,720
I ran away again.

441
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,350
Chairman.

442
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:59,220
I won't go home from now on.

443
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,210
I am sorry for my dad,

444
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,920
but I have already told him.

445
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:09,170
That I have the right to choose who I like.

446
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:13,090
If we believe each other and live happily,

447
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:16,370
my dad will understand eventually.

448
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:19,010
So, Chairman.

449
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:21,850
Please don't change your mind.

450
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:26,290
I also...

451
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:29,690
I also won't change my mind ever.

452
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:34,000
Okay.

453
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,800
I won't change my mind.

454
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,710
So don't worry.

455
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:45,170
Chairman.

456
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:04,590
Ms. Park, have you not eaten lunch yet?

457
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,510
Are you hungry?

458
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,240
Come to think of it, I didn't even eat breakfast today,

459
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,880
and didn't eat lunch too.

460
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,500
What did you say?

461
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,130
Didn't you eat breakfast and lunch?

462
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:18,920
Let's go. I'll treat you to a pork cutlet.

463
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,530
Yes.

464
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:23,800
But, Chairman... We're in front of the office.

465
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,510
Is it okay to hold hands like this?

466
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:31,520
I am holding my girlfriend's hand. What's the matter?

467
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:35,090
You are an amazing man, Chairman!

468
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,530
How can Young Gook in front of the office...

469
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:54,740
What if someone sees? What is he doing with Dan Dan?

470
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,830
Kids, I am here.

471
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:01,770
Jenny, Se Chan, Se Jong!

472
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:04,600
Ms. Park!

473
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,290
Are you really back?

474
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:12,160
- Are you okay now?
- Yes.

475
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,480
I am okay.

476
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,200
You must have worried about me a lot.

477
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,520
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

478
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,160
It's fine since you're here now.

479
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,910
It's like a family reunion.

480
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,850
It hasn't even been that long. You're overreacting.

481
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:29,520
Ms. Park, I think you can't leave again.

482
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,790
Thank you for the welcome, you guys.

483
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,640
Yes.

484
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,280
Noona, what's going on?

485
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,290
Young Gook, what are you doing?

486
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,210
What do you mean?

487
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,930
- What are you talking about?
- You and Ms. Park

488
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,520
held hands and hugged right in front of the office.

489
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,150
What are you trying to do?

490
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,060
- Noona--
- Young Gook, this really isn't right.

491
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:03,890
She is only 27 years old young girl, how can you do that to her?

492
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,650
If people know about it,

493
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:09,110
people will say FT Group's Chairman is going around with a young girl.

494
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:12,560
And people will gossip about Ms. Park.

495
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,430
What are you thinking, doing something like this?

496
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,070
Noona, please stop.

497
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:23,220
Even without you saying this, Ms. Park and I have a hard time already.

498
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:27,710
- Why are you acting like this too?
- I'm telling you because you don't seem to make a rational judgment!

499
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,840
So you can come to your senses.

500
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,990
You are also a father of a daughter.

501
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,180
What if when Jenny is 27,

502
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:38,090
she brings a man, who's 14 years older than her and has three children. How would you feel? Would you be happy?

503
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:41,870
Would you be able to send her off like it's no big deal?

504
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,060
Noona.

505
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:53,170
Chairman Lee, something urgent came up that we need to discuss.

506
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:56,660
Young Gook, please think carefully.

507
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:59,290
This is not right.

508
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,430
I heard everything from outside.

509
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,460
She was yelling loud enough for me to hear.

510
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,840
What's wrong with CEO Anna?

511
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,100
Even if you guys are close,

512
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,600
that was too harsh.

513
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,900
It doesn't seem like she said it for your benefit.

514
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:25,530
If other people hear it, they would think CEO Anna is Ms. Park's mom.

515
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:40,990
Driver Kim, please pull over.

516
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:43,620
- How many hotteoks are you going to have?
- I'll have two.

517
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:47,350
- I want to have two, too!
- I want a thousand.

518
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:50,120
I'll get myself home, so you can get off from work now.

519
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,150
Are you going to have a thousand hotteoks?

520
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,020
It'll be delicious.

521
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,370
- It'll be tasty.
- A thousand?

522
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,870
I want ten thousand!

523
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:06,590
It's Dad!

524
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,830
Where are you all going?

525
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:17,810
To celebrate Ms. Park coming back, we're going to get hotteok.

526
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:20,680
- Dad, please come with us.
- Hotteok?

527
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,620
I wanted some hotteok, too. That's great, let's go together.

528
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,020
Let's go!

529
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:30,590
How many are you going to eat, Dad?

530
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,780
- I'll eat...
- Four?

531
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,070
Ms. Park and Dad. Let's take pictures over there, too.

532
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,570
- What do you think?
- That sounds fun.

533
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,370
Let's do it!

534
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,020
Okay.

535
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,260
Let's go, let's go.

536
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,270
Dad, come on. Hurry up.

537
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,990
I'm going to wear glasses.

538
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:06,230
Se Chan, how does Se Jong look?

539
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,040
You are a king!

540
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,500
♫ You're the only one that I was looking for ♫

541
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,490
♫  Woo, it's a happy day like a dream, yeah  ♫

542
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,810
One, two, three.

543
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:21,070
- It looks great.
- One, two, three!

544
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,200
[My Dan Dan]

545
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:51,690
The customer you are trying to reach is unavailable. Please leave a message after the beep.

546
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:00,490
Dan Dan, where are you now?

547
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:03,080
I am in front of the Chairman's house now.

548
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,760
Pack your stuff and come out. I'll be waiting.

549
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:12,930
Your message has been recorded. Thank you for—

550
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:26,460
- Why did you call?
- Dan Dan's dad, we need to meet right now.

551
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,720
Why would I see you?

552
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,550
I'm busy. I'm hanging up now.

553
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,760
It's about Dan Dan.

554
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:37,260
- What?
- You said you would take care of it.

555
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,110
But why is Dan Dan still seeing Young Gook?

556
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,520
Come right now. I have something to talk to you about.

557
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,300
Don't worry about it and just mind your own business.

558
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,890
I said come now!

559
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:50,540
Otherwise, I'll come to your store.

560
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,920
What did you say?

561
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,510
What's the matter with you?

562
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:59,430
Are you threatening me now?

563
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:03,240
Who are you to tell what to do for Dan Dan?

564
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,300
Right, as you say,

565
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,670
I don't have any right for my Dan Dan.

566
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,610
So I was going to stay out of it.

567
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,590
I believed that you would resolve it.

568
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:18,230
But what have you been doing? Dan Dan and Young Gook are still dating.

569
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,630
I met up with Young Gook.

570
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,860
They don't seem like they will break up.

571
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,630
Are you just going to let Dan Dan be like that?

572
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:29,250
If you are going to, I'll take Dan Dan with me to America.

573
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:33,970
Even now, I'll tell her that I'm her mom and take her.

574
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:36,550
What did you say? You'll tell her what?

575
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,950
What?

576
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,460
You'll take my Dan Dan and go to America?

577
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,630
With who's permission?

578
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,610
Even if the world collapses, that won't happen.

579
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:47,640
So leave Korea right now.

580
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,930
You better think wisely.

581
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:54,170
As long as she's in Korea, Dan Dan won't be able to forget about Young Gook.

582
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:56,540
If it's going to be like this, isn't it better for her to come to America with me?

583
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:01,510
Why should Dan Dan have to become the mother of three kids at such a young age?

584
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:04,530
I'll take Dan Dan to America and take good care of her.

585
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,850
Let her come with me.

586
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:10,830
She had to go through so much hardship since she was young.

587
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:15,010
- Shut your mouth!
- This is all because of you!

588
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:17,690
If you had taken good care of her,

589
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:20,380
Dan Dan would've been going out and having fun.

590
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:23,290
Why would she work as an in-house tutor watching over someone else's kids

591
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:27,380
at such a young age when she should be living life?

592
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,190
If she didn't work at that house, it would not happen.

593
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:32,380
You are the one that did this to her,

594
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,160
and why won't you let me do anything?

595
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:39,170
Dan Dan never got to live a proper life.

596
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:45,210
Even if I die, I can't stand to watch her becoming a mother of someone else kids!

597
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:59,700
What should I do?

598
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,940
Father.

599
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,350
Father. Why are you doing this?

600
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:35,380
Chairman.

601
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:39,690
Please, I'm begging you.

602
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:45,170
Please break up with my Dan Dan.

603
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:50,980
Please let her go.

604
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,490
I'm begging you like this.

605
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:57,330
You have a daughter too.

606
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:02,300
Please think about this once from the perspective of a daughter's father.

607
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,680
Dan Dan is only 27.

608
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,900
She's a young lady with a future ahead of her.

609
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,730
Chairman.

610
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:17,280
What should I do for you to break up with her?

611
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,780
I will do anything you ask.

612
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,690
So please,

613
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,970
let her go.

614
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:27,720
Please, I'm begging you.

615
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:36,230
As a fellow father,

616
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:40,670
please think about Dan Dan just once.

617
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:50,960
I understand what you are saying.

618
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,220
So, please...

619
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,870
Please stand up.

620
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,520
Thank you.

621
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,670
Chairman.

622
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:14,330
I...

623
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:17,660
I'll trust you.

624
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,520
Ms. Park.

625
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,300
Chairman.

626
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,510
Chairman.

627
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,210
For me...

628
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:37,610
When I turned 20,

629
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:40,880
I felt like I had become an adult.

630
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,570
And I started working,

631
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:45,650
received a salary,

632
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:50,450
and got the confidence that I could live on my own.

633
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:53,940
So I thought, now I'm an adult,

634
00:42:53,940 --> 00:43:01,450
and I can live my life the way I want, doing what I want.

635
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:06,980
But, the life that I've lived until now

636
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:10,440
wasn't only with my own strength.

637
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:20,350
My parents and my family's sacrifice made it possible.

638
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:23,690
I had forgotten about that.

639
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:31,300
I love my dad more than anyone in this world.

640
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:36,570
Just like you loved your mother.

641
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:45,120
My loving dad is even kneeling to oppose our relationship.

642
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:49,500
I was hurting him that much...

643
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:59,350
I told you many times not to change our minds.

644
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:05,910
I'm so sorry to make this conclusion.

645
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:08,700
Ms. Park.

646
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,930
I understand what you are saying.

647
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:17,210
So, you don't have to say anything more if it's too hard.

648
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,610
I'll tell the kids

649
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:23,420
that I'm quitting.

650
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,710
Then, excuse me first.

651
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,710
Dad.

652
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:57,050
I broke up with the Chairman.

653
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,900
Really?

654
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,100
Yes.

655
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:14,090
Thank you, Dan Dan.

656
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:18,240
But Dad, just because I broke up with him,

657
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,440
I can't quit my work immediately.

658
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,330
I have to work until they get another tutor for the children.

659
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:27,340
You understand that, right?

660
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:30,740
Well, as long as you're certain,

661
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,730
that's fine.

662
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,150
Then I'll be going.

663
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,250
Dan Dan.

664
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:41,990
You can't change your mind. You promise me.

665
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:46,080
- You're really ending it with Chairman Lee.
- Yes.

666
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,210
Don't worry.

667
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:51,840
Dad, I'm leaving now.

668
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,820
Chairman, this is Dan Dan's father.

669
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:18,590
Yes, please speak.

670
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:23,390
Chairman, I just saw Dan Dan.

671
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:29,500
She said she broke up with you. Is that true?

672
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,410
Yes.

673
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:33,820
We broke up.

674
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:40,020
Thank you.

675
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,580
But, Chairman.

676
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:45,950
I'm sorry, but I have one more thing to ask you.

677
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:49,670
Please find a new tutor for the children quickly.

678
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:52,560
So that Dan Dan can leave that house.

679
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:57,260
Being in the same house would be uncomfortable for both of you.

680
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:01,570
Yes. I'll do that.

681
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:04,160
Don't worry.

682
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,070
I'll leave it to you then.

683
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:38,830
Ajussi.

684
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:41,020
How did you know that I was here?

685
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:44,130
I went to your house to see you and met your mother.

686
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:46,940
She told me that you work here.

687
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:49,590
My mother did?

688
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:53,020
But why didn't you tell me you started working here?

689
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:57,020
We decided to be friends. Does it make sense for a friend not to know this?

690
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:59,130
When did I say I would be your friend?

691
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:01,220
Let's just be friends.

692
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:03,390
I became your friend when we first met.

693
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:05,870
You should leave now. I'm busy.

694
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:09,360
The flower shop is pretty.

695
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,470
It suits you.

696
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:13,380
Ajussi.

697
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:16,070
I came to buy flowers.

698
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:20,220
Please make me a pretty carnation flower bouquet.

699
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,550
Carnations?

700
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:24,870
It's for my mom.

701
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,920
What kind of flower is this?

702
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,720
It's Ranunculus.

703
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:00,780
And this one?

704
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,200
It's Delphinium.

705
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,550
Del... Delphi... It's so difficult.

706
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:08,420
And this?

707
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,170
It's roses.

708
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:12,030
Do you not know roses?

709
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:14,630
It's a Victoria Rose.

710
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:16,800
Oh, it's a rose.

711
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,310
I know what a rose is.

712
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:23,060
Please wrap up the rest.

713
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:41,500
Young Gook, seeing what happened to you.

714
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:45,340
I feel like it's all my fault.

715
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:51,950
After what happened to Young Ae, I felt like you had found the right person.

716
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:54,760
So I was very happy.

717
00:49:54,760 --> 00:50:00,560
That's why I encouraged you to go for it.

718
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:03,710
All the stuff you were worried about,

719
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:10,130
I might not have taken them seriously.

720
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,150
I'm sorry, Young Gook.

721
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:23,920
As a person raising children,

722
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:29,030
I can understand where Ms. Park's father is coming from.

723
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:33,860
That's why you chose to end the relationship, I'm sure.

724
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:40,470
I couldn't think about Ms. Park's father's point of view.

725
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:46,040
I only wanted a fresh start for you.

726
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:50,330
Because I just wanted you to be happy again.

727
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:54,460
I only thought about you.

728
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:40,220
♫ When I walk this road, it makes me cry  ♫

729
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:46,410
Where did that handkerchief come from?

730
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:49,010
No.

731
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:52,290
I have to think about my age.

732
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:54,980
I even have three children.

733
00:51:54,980 --> 00:52:01,220
♫  My beautiful love  ♫

734
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:08,890
♫  It seems like love is bitter  ♫

735
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:11,190
♫ The more I try to grasp it  ♫

736
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:15,870
Why did that handkerchief fly by that time? I still don't understand.

737
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:23,410
♫  Goodbye is easy  ♫

738
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:30,250
♫ My unforgettable love  ♫

739
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:34,440
♫ Why do you run away, love? ♫

740
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,820
Chairman.

741
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,060
Ms. Park.

742
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:42,790
Where have you been at this late hour?

743
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:46,150
I'm coming back from the convenience store.

744
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:52,900
Chairman, did you have a drink?

745
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:59,280
Yes, a little.

746
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:07,500
If you act like this, it's hard on me and upsets me.

747
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:12,710
Why are you acting like that, seriously?

748
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:14,180
I am also...

749
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:18,940
♫ The wind is blowing ♫

750
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:21,450
I'm holding everything in.

751
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:23,210
♫ I get teary ♫

752
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:27,500
Just wrap things up and forget about everything.

753
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,190
Ms. Park.

754
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:32,820
Don't worry about me.

755
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:34,960
I'm fine.

756
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,370
I am really okay.

757
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:44,560
But I worry that you might have a hard time.

758
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:50,080
♫ Why do you run away love, like a shy child? ♫

759
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:56,270
♫ In case I lose it, I hold it tight ♫

760
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:58,490
Chairman.

761
00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:04,110
♫ But love always runs away, chased by longing ♫

762
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:10,710
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

763
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:18,810
♫ I have to abandon the longing and the grief ♫

764
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:24,900
♫ What am I looking for on this road wandering? ♫

765
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:32,550
♫ Why am I here for what? ♫

766
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:40,810
Dan Dan, what are you saying right now?

767
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:45,250
As you said, I was really going to break up with the Chairman.

768
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:51,020
But Dad, it's too difficult to end it with him.

769
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:55,330
I know you want me to be happy.

770
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:58,490
You are worried that it will be difficult for me to be with the Chairman.

771
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:01,660
But Dad, I can be happy with him.

772
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:04,350
I don't think I can break up with him.

773
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:07,460
Can't you give in just this once?

774
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:12,880
Dan Dan. It's not easy breaking up with someone you once liked.

775
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,760
But if you endure a little, time will heal everything.

776
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:22,750
Dad. I don't think I could ever forget Chairman.

777
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:25,770
I think I really love him.

778
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:30,050
Dan Dan, but you promised me to break up with him.

779
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:33,270
Why are you making me upset?

780
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:36,040
Get out of that house now.

781
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:39,450
Don't wait until they find a new tutor.

782
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:42,410
Okay.

783
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:45,000
Fine. I'm sorry.

784
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,130
Dan Dan.

785
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:49,180
- Dan Dan!
- Honey.

786
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,810
Can't you just let her be with him?

787
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:55,360
She loves him that much.

788
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,490
What are you saying?

789
00:55:57,490 --> 00:55:59,890
Are you saying we should allow their relationship?

790
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:02,040
What's wrong with that?

791
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,290
It's not something that bad.

792
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:07,860
Chairman Lee has a lot of money, so why do you worry?

793
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:11,520
I know you're concerned about the children, but money raises children these days.

794
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,010
They could study abroad later.

795
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:19,730
To be honest, compared to a life of a struggle with someone her own age,

796
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:24,040
it would be better for her to live comfortably married to Chairman Lee.

797
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,990
What's the big deal about a fourteen-year age difference?

798
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:30,350
Couples with a twenty-year difference get married and live happily.

799
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:32,440
He has three children, three!

800
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:36,280
Do you want our twenty-seven years old Dan Dan raising the three children?

801
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:40,890
Are you speaking carelessly because she's not your daughter?

802
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:43,610
What did you just say?

803
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:46,820
Is that how you've thought of me all this time?

804
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:50,840
I spoke out of pity for Dan Dan. How can you say such a thing?

805
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:54,610
I speak carelessly because she's not my daughter?

806
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:57,770
Since Dan Dan was a baby,

807
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:00,130
I changed her poopy diapers and raised her.

808
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:03,990
I am saying this because I'm her mother!

809
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:06,810
Rather than her having a hard life with someone her age,

810
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:11,280
it's better for her to be with Chairman Lee, who she loves. How is that careless?

811
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:19,700
You are driving me mad.

812
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:24,000
Why do you speak to him like that when he's already upset?

813
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,500
I don't care! I feel better for saying what I wanted to.

814
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,120
Did I say something wrong?

815
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,840
I'm not scared of him anymore!

816
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:34,320
Oh my, stop it.

817
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:46,340
Hey, are you crazy?

818
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:48,520
Do you want to screw me over?

819
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,070
How can you bring an infant here!

820
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:53,470
I'm sorry.

821
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:14,690
I raised my Dan Dan with all my might.

822
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:33,580
You said you have something to talk to me about.

823
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,100
You...

824
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:44,960
Take Dan Dan with you to the US.

825
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,940
Soo Chul.

826
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,640
Really?

827
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,660
Are you sure I can do that?

828
00:58:54,660 --> 00:59:00,570
In return, you shall never reveal that you are her mother.

829
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:02,830
Dan Dan knows her mother abandoned her.

830
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:07,900
So if she finds out you are her mother, she will not go to the US with you.

831
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:12,070
So no matter what, don't reveal it to her.

832
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:15,260
Okay, I will do that.

833
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:21,240
But since you are her mother, I'm trusting you to take good care of her.

834
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:27,290
Make her forget Chairman Lee and begin a new life.

835
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:30,580
Yes, Soo Chul. Do not worry.

836
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:33,110
I will take good care of our daughter, Dan Dan.

837
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:36,750
I will make her be a successful designer in the US.

838
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:40,560
Thank you. Thank you very much.

839
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:45,700
I'm not sending Dan Dan with you not because I approve of you or because I forgive you.

840
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,850
Don't forget about that.

841
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:51,160
I know.

842
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,610
I know, of course.

843
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:06,710
I'm sorry.

844
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,290
I'm sorry...

845
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:26,660
Yes.

846
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:30,650
It's better to send her off to the US,

847
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:33,540
than having her end up with a guy with three kids.

848
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:40,170
Dan Dan.

849
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:48,190
Here.

850
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:55,730
I gave it some thought.

851
01:00:55,730 --> 01:01:00,230
I think the reason you keep getting swayed even after you said you would break up with Chairman Lee

852
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:04,870
is that you're still physically close to him.

853
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:07,330
To forget him, you have to be far away from him.

854
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:13,240
Which is why, Dan Dan...

855
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:18,190
Why don't you go to the US with CEO Anna next week?

856
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:20,350
Dad?

857
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:26,690
I met up with CEO Anna, and it just happened to be that the person who was supposed to go can't anymore.

858
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:29,660
So I told her I'd let you go and she was very happy.

859
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:31,120
Dad...

860
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:35,720
You may think you're all grown up, Dan Dan.

861
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,730
But you're still a kid in my eyes.

862
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:39,890
You have never lived your own life properly yet.

863
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:44,980
I can't watch you end up with Chairman Lee.

864
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:53,300
You'll forget about Chairman Lee once you go to the US.

865
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:58,400
Go and study more and do whatever you want to do.

866
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,930
You said before that you wanted to study design.

867
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:04,730
What better opportunity is there than this?

868
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:06,880
Dad.

869
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,210
I'm not saying you should settle down for good there.

870
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:13,340
Just for three years,

871
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:19,340
study a little more and live your own fantastic life like how other young folks do.

872
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:22,690
Even after that, you think about Chairman Lee

873
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:27,430
and can't forget him after all that.

874
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:31,090
Then I'll reconsider about it.

875
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:34,940
Do you really mean that?

876
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:37,810
So then...

877
01:02:37,810 --> 01:02:41,910
If I say I still want to be with Chairman after three years,

878
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:46,170
will you really think about allowing us?

879
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:49,960
Yes. I will do that.

880
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:54,830
So try living there for just three years for now.

881
01:02:54,830 --> 01:03:01,210
Dan Dan. This is my last wish.

882
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:09,860
All right, Dad.

883
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:12,780
I will do that.

884
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:18,070
Thank you, Dan Dan.

885
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:20,410
Thank you.

886
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:32,230
Young Gook.

887
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:36,380
I heard that you broke up with Ms. Park.

888
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:39,060
You made the right choice.

889
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,790
Noona.

890
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:48,440
Is that what you came to talk about?

891
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:55,390
Well, the truth is, Ms. Park's father, Driver Park,

892
01:03:55,390 --> 01:03:58,240
came by to see me.

893
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:03,960
He pleaded to me to take Ms. Park to the US with me, so I said I will.

894
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:07,770
Ms. Park was supposed to work with me anyway.

895
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:13,610
I came here today because I thought you should know too.

896
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:16,050
Okay. I understand.

897
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:22,980
Now that everything has come to this end, you should move on too, Young Gook.

898
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:25,290
Don't worry.

899
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:30,710
Ms. Park and I decided to end things.

900
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:34,040
All right. Thank you, Young Gook.

901
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:37,770
But, Noona.

902
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:46,780
Why would you thank me for breaking up with Ms. Park?

903
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:51,700
Well, you see...

904
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:55,940
The two of you aren't a good match.

905
01:04:55,940 --> 01:05:01,050
You also got an opportunity to meet a better person.

906
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:03,410
That's why I said it.

907
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,950
Noona.

908
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:11,280
You have loved someone before too.

909
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:17,980
You know well how hard it is when you break up with that someone.

910
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,710
Honestly, I'm struggling right now.

911
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:23,970
I didn't break up with Ms. Park because I wanted to.

912
01:05:23,970 --> 01:05:29,980
I only broke up because I put myself in Driver Park's shoes as someone who has a daughter also.

913
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:34,150
But for you to do this to me makes me feel awful.

914
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:37,200
You don't seem like the Ji Young Noona I knew.

915
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:42,730
I thought you would take my side no matter what the situation.

916
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:47,800
All right, Young Gook. I'm sorry about that too.

917
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,570
The fact that that's all I can say to you.

918
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:55,560
But this is all for your sake.

919
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:58,370
What?

920
01:05:58,370 --> 01:06:03,470
This is all for my sake? How so?

921
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:07,490
If it was for my sake, you should be rooting for our love.

922
01:06:07,490 --> 01:06:13,870
I'm hurting this much from breaking up with Ms. Park. But you're saying this is all for my sake?

923
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:18,390
Noona. I have something to ask you too.

924
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:23,090
Fine. I understand Driver Park not agreeing to our relationship.

925
01:06:23,090 --> 01:06:25,610
I fully understand how he feels.

926
01:06:25,610 --> 01:06:30,300
But why are you so against our relationship to this extent, Noona?

927
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:35,330
Young Gook.

928
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:37,240
You see...

929
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:40,890
It's because I'm worried people will point fingers at you.

930
01:06:40,890 --> 01:06:43,170
I'm truly worried for you.

931
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:48,820
Noona. I beg you...

932
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:53,410
But don't ever say it's for my sake again.

I know. I heard from CEO Anna.

938
01:07:34,290 --> 01:07:39,850
Chairman. Can you wait for me?

939
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:43,100
I'm going so that I can see you again.

940
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:46,290
My dad told me to try living three years in the US.

941
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:48,320
But if I still can't forget about you,

942
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:52,400
then he said he would reconsider our relationship.

943
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:57,570
I'll be well in the US and come back.

944
01:07:57,570 --> 01:08:02,290
So you can't forget me, Chairman, okay?

01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:04,000
Okay.

946

Then I will wait for you this time.

01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:11,110
So you go and don't think about me.

948

974
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:32,650
- Do you have a death wish?
- Oh, no!

975
01:10:32,650 --> 01:10:34,070
Do you want to go on a farewell trip?

976
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:35,550
We can't just say goodbye like this.

977
01:10:35,550 --> 01:10:37,510
I am going to return no matter what.

978
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:39,110
Let's make sure to meet again.

979
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:41,040
Be happy, Ms. Park.

980
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:44,870
She was going to take my Soo Chul to the US.

981
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:46,440
Please take this, Soo Chul.

982
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:49,190
Didn't I tell you? Never to reveal you're her mother.

983
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:51,860
What do you mean she's Dan Dan's mother?

984
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:54,120
What are you saying?

985
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:55,480
♫ What am I looking for  ♫
