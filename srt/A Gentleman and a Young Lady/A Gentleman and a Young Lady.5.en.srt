[Episode 5]

2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,740
Ms. Park, let's talk.

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,010
With me?

4
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,720
Chairman, I'm so sorry about yesterday.

5
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,340
I was so startled and worried because Jenny was missing.

6
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,400
So I said things I didn't even mean.

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,570
- I'll be careful from now on--
- Come into my office for a second.

8
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,350
Ms. Park, please have a seat.

9
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,840
Okay...

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,560
Chief Jo, give her her tea first.

11
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,010
Okay.

12
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,060
Why don't you have a sip, Ms. Park?

13
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,850
Yes, yes!

14
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:02,230
Don't be nervous. I didn't ask you here to scold you.

15
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,620
I'm sorry?

16
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,340
Ms. Park.

17
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,120
Thank you.

18
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:14,910
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have known Jenny was having a tough time.

19
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,740
And what you said yesterday was all correct.

20
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,920
Nothing you said was wrong.

21
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,390
I thought I was paying attention to my children,

22
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,850
but that wasn't attention.

23
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:36,880
I was too negligent of my children until now.

24
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:44,740
Please help me, Ms. Park.

25
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,850
Me? With what?

26
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:54,020
I want to get closer with my children, but I don't know how to.

27
00:02:54,020 --> 00:03:00,690
My kids aren't easy to get close to, but you seem to have gotten close quickly.

28
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,590
I want to get close to them,

29
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:08,820
so I want your help.

30
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,710
Of course, I'll be happy to help you.

31
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:22,170
Then... I'm not fired, right?

32
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:27,060
Why would I fire you? You are doing a great job.

33
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,960
Keep up that good relationship going with my kids.

34
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,100
Yes, I will! I'll work even harder!

35
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,070
By the way, Ms. Park?

36
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,250
Yes?

37
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:44,630
It's important to keep the promise with the kids,

38
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:50,670
but I hope you tell me even the small things about them. I think it'll help me get to know them more.

39
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,130
Okay, I'll do that.

40
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,380
So, on that note, I know it is a hassle,

41
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:03,740
but please report daily about the events with the kids.

42
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:10,920
Yes, I understand. I'll do that. Thank you! Thank you!

43
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:29,470
Teacher, can we play just one game at the arcade?

44
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,220
Se Jong, we can't play it today.

45
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,520
Just once, please?

46
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,360
Okay then, after kindergarten. If we play now, you'll be late.

47
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,410
Okay. Then promise to let me play later.

48
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,910
Okay.

49
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,060
Yay! I'm so excited!

50
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,650
Ms. Park.

51
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,160
Can we talk for a second?

52
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,690
Okay...

53
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,300
What did you talk about with the Chairman?

54
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,740
He gave me work orders...

55
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:26,840
Work order? Like what in detail?

56
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,890
The Chairman said he was negligent of the children,

57
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:36,490
and he wants to pay more attention to them from now on.

58
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:42,150
So he told me to report daily about the kids.

59
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,980
Well, Ms. Park.

60
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:54,500
Since we are talking about that, why didn't you tell me about Jenny?

61
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,800
Ah... That...

62
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:04,480
I promised Jenny not to tell anybody, so I couldn't tell you.

63
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:13,050
I see. Promises with kids are important, but because of that,

64
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:19,030
what if something happens to Jenny or the other kids? Who will be responsible for that?

65
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:25,950
It's the adults' responsibility. That's why we hired a live-in tutor.

66
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:30,110
I think you're too young to understand your work,

67
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:36,680
but make sure you report to me about the kids as well.

68
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,780
Okay, I will.

69
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,110
You can go now.

70
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,620
Okay.

71
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,240
There's so much to teach her because she's just a kid.

72
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:03,650
Well, a naive girl is better than a cunning one.

73
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,740
Am I... not a woman to you?

74
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,360
To me you are...

75
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,050
a good friend.

76
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:26,600
Then, now, and in the future too.

77
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,500
Hey! Gook Hee!

78
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,480
Gook Hee! Are you really going to leave me alone?

79
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,840
Are you serious?

80
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,500
I'm not leaving forever. Stop overreacting.

81
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,970
I'm just going to Eun Young's in Hawaii to rest a bit.

82
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,630
In that case,

83
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:59,220
let me go with you to Hawaii.

84
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:07,740
Unni! I'm not just staying in Hawaii. I'm going to travel around.

85
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:14,530
I just want some time alone. Don't worry about me.

86
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,080
Gook Hee...

87
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,200
Then... Don't be gone too long, okay?

88
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,580
Okay.

89
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:39,860
I'm so frustrated. Why did she have to like Young Gook out of all the men in the world?

90
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:48,880
Since you are determined to go, you have a passionate relationship when you see a handsome man,

91
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,540
no matter of their nationality, okay?

92
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,500
Okay. I'll do that.

93
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,750
Hey, Gook Hee. What? Where are you going?

94
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:20,700
Hawaii. I won't be able to see you for a while, so I called you.

95
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,560
Why are you going?

96
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,730
I'm going to stay with a friend in Hawaii.

97
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:34,080
I'm going to surf and get some fresh air.

98
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,090
That sounds fun. Have a good trip. Keep in touch with me when you're there as well.

99
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,870
Okay.

100
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,950
Don't cry because you miss me.

101
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,890
Take care.

102
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:16,370
Teacher, you didn't forget our promise this morning, did you?

103
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,040
Of course not, Mr. Se Jong.

104
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,220
But it's only once, okay?

105
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,050
Okay.

106
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,440
Up, up!

107
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,110
Up!

108
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,230
This is mine!

109
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,160
This is mine, this! This!

110
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,430
No, no! It's mine!

111
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:39,360
Oh, it went over.

112
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,430
Lee Se Jong.

113
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,730
Ms. Park.

114
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,350
What are you doing here with Se Jong?

115
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:04,070
It's just... We were going home, but kindergarten is over, so...

116
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:12,500
Dad. I begged Ms. Park to play just one game.

117
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,600
Ms. Park. You let this happen because he begs?

118
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,790
Especially as a teacher who's supposed to teach him not to play such games,

119
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,970
and you even play with him?

120
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,300
Is this what you did with Se Jong every day?

121
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,470
Dad, stop scolding Ms. Park.

122
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:39,270
Ms. Park said no, but I begged her.

123
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,600
Lee Se Jong. Who told you it's okay to play this?

124
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,140
It's bad to play games on the street.

125
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,680
All the other kids play it!

126
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,420
But why can't I?

127
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,500
Listen to your dad. This is bad.

128
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,770
It's not bad! It's fun!

129
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,410
I hate you!

130
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,940
Se Jong!

131
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,840
What...

132
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,040
Yes, Mom.

133
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:23,790
Joon Oh. I am so lonely and sad right now.

134
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:29,460
Your aunt left to Hawaii all of a sudden.

135
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:33,510
I'm so scared to be all alone in this huge house, and...

136
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:37,450
Mom, I'm late for class. Bye.

137
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,410
Hello? Hello?

138
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:46,400
He hung up first on me!

139
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,020
He thinks he's so great.

140
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:57,130
Oh? It's the realtor.

141
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,610
Hello?

142
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,010
W-what did you say?

143
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,990
Did you say you put our apartment unit 101 on the market?

144
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,700
W-Who did that?

145
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,310
I-I'm the owner of the house. Who did this?

146
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:17,630
It's your friend who lives in apartment 101.

147
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:22,420
She told me to talk with you because it's not her house. You didn't know about this?

148
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,970
Did you two fight?

149
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,610
S-she...

150
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,310
Does she think I'm her maid?

151
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,200
She calls me up all the time and asks, "do this for me, do that for me."

152
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,660
I'll leave instead.

153
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,650
What is it?

154
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:43,440
I heard you put this house on the market.

155
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,760
You told me to leave.

156
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,950
- When did I say that?
- You said you couldn't stand me.

157
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,220
That's the same with telling me to leave, isn't it?

158
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,220
Even so, you put the house on the market without even speaking with me?

159
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,590
Whatever, I'm leaving because you told me to,

160
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:03,210
so now you know. Leave, please.

161
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,180
Do you even have money?

162
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,470
How are you going to find a house in Seoul without any money?

163
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:13,270
Hey. Do you think I have nowhere else to go?

164
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:18,480
Stop being so arrogant because you have some money.

165
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,430
When was I arrogant because of money?

166
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,480
Didn't you? Huh?

167
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:29,210
You said our Sarah didn't know her place and looked down on us!

168
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:35,810
Speaking of, then why did your great sister Gook Hee get dumped by Chairman Lee?

169
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,560
Y-you... Are you my friend Lee Gi Ja?

170
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,160
You... How could you say that to me?

171
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,040
Gook Hee was so wounded because of that... and left Korea.

172
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,210
She left?

173
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,730
You're so mean...

174
00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:01,110
Okay, I get your point. I'll put the house on the market.

175
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,280
Leave. I won't stop you!

176
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,730
Gook Hee, just because she was dumped,

177
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:17,420
she left the country at that age?

178
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:24,910
Was I too hasty to say I'm leaving..?

179
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,450
No.

180
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:30,120
Even if I don't have money, I have my pride.

181
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,150
I can't live with that girl any longer!

182
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,860
I won't!

183
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,100
Leave! I'll leave!

184
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,180
Was everyone waiting for me?

185
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,100
I told you I'm not eating dinner because I'm on a diet.

186
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,520
Go ahead. Eat.

187
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,180
Well... It's because of Se Jong.

188
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,430
Se Jong says he won't eat because he's pouting.

189
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:00,110
Why would Se Jong do that?

190
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:07,080
Is that little kid already on a hunger strike?

191
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,460
What is he upset about it?

192
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,620
I'll calm him down and get him here.

193
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,590
Yeah, yeah. Chief Jo needs to step forward,

194
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,490
to get things solved.

195
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:19,440
Eat, eat. You guys eat. Eat!

196
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,830
I won't eat!

197
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,290
Why are you keep talking to me? I don't want to eat with Dad!

198
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,390
Se Jong, are you going to keep this up?

199
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,660
Dad does whatever he wants.

200
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,900
I can't even talk with him. I'm so tired of it.

201
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:46,860
Tell him I will never eat with him again.

202
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,590
Lee Se Jong. How dare you? You're very rude.

203
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:54,470
Why are you scolding me?

204
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,730
I don't want to talk to you! You're the same with Dad!

205
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,550
Get out of my room!

206
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,470
Is Se Jong really not going to eat with me?

207
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,100
No... I think it'd be best to eat first.

208
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:21,570
When Se Jong calms down, I'll make sure to get some food for him.

209
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,300
Jenny, Se Chan, let's eat.

210
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,350
- Yes.
- Yes.

211
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,550
Lee Se Jong. Let's talk.

212
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:54,570
If you don't allow me to play games, I'm not going to talk with you.

213
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,930
I won't even eat.

214
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:01,410
Lee Se Jong. Do you really want to get scolded?

215
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,190
I don't want to talk with you.

216
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:09,450
Other dads buy gaming consoles and play with their kids too.

217
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,190
You are just a boomer dictator like what Noona said!

218
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,770
What did you say?

219
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:19,880
Chairman. You said you want to be close to the kids

220
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,670
and communicate with the kids. Did you not mean that?

221
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,480
I meant it.

222
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,080
I meant it, but what's wrong is wrong.

223
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:36,520
The kindergarten kids communicate with games, and sometimes even becomes friend playing games.

224
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,290
Of course, playing without restriction, I'm against that too.

225
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:45,840
But if you allow three times a week...

226
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,300
Three times a week? That's way too much. No.

227
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:54,020
Chairman. Se Jong isn't even drinking water.

228
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:58,880
What if Se Jong gets sick keeping this up?

229
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,570
Then try talking to him about playing once a week.

230
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,130
I won't allow more than that.

231
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,810
Once a week is too little.

232
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:14,740
How about... Twice a week?

233
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:19,610
I can't talk with Se Jong for less than that.

234
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:23,860
Okay. Let's do that.

235
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,620
Twice a week. You promised!

236
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,510
Really? Did Dad really say that?

237
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:39,500
Yes. He said you're allowed to play a game twice a week.

238
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,330
Yay! I'm so happy!

239
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,850
Are you that happy?

240
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,420
Yes, I am!

241
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,600
Then, shall we go downstairs and eat food?

242
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,720
Yes!

243
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:02,930
Dad. Keep your promise about playing games twice a week.

244
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,500
Okay. A promise between men.

245
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,390
But you have to promise no more than twice.

246
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:11,750
Okay. A promise between men.

247
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,510
A promise between men?

248
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:19,720
It's nice to hear laughter in a while.

249
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,770
Since you finished your meal,

250
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:26,920
- should we try this too?
- Yes!

251
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,300
You're eating so well. You'll be so tall.

252
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,830
Yes. I'm going to be like Dad!

253
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:41,370
Then make sure you eat a lot and eat that every day too. Okay?

254
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,650
Yes.

255
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,400
You said you have something to tell me?

256
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,900
Yes. It's related to Se Jong.

257
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,770
Go ahead.

258
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:03,830
Chairman, letting Se Jong play games twice a week,

259
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:09,540
especially in the middle of a dirty street, seems wrong.

260
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:13,340
I understand your concern.

261
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,630
I also thought the same.

262
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:20,940
But, we can't just use our adults' way of thinking to control the children.

263
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,270
I'm sorry?

264
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:26,520
Ms. Park told me that children these days

265
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,940
communicate and become friends through games.

266
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,200
I don't think it's wise to just stop him.

267
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,680
You saw how Se Jong was protesting.

268
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,660
Well, that... I'll talk to Se Jong and try to get him to understand--

269
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,620
No. It's fine.

270
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,920
I don't want to ruin our relationship by forcing him.

271
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,820
Also, twice a week seems okay.

272
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,670
- But, Chairman--
- Chief Jo.

273
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:55,150
I want you to focus on the housework from now on.

274
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:58,940
I'll deal with the children myself.

275
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:03,860
Oh... Okay, I will.

276
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,170
Why are you scolding me?

277
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,080
I don't want to talk to you!

278
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,510
You're the same with Dad!

279
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:24,470
Get out of my room!

280
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:30,330
He's like that to me because I'm not his mom.

281
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,500
For Se Jong...

282
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,880
I will become the wife of that family no matter what.

283
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,010
No matter what.

284
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,660
I'm going to school.

285
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,930
Lee Se Chan, wait.

286
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,070
What?

287
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,100
Put your hat on correctly.

288
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,200
I'm going now.

289
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,420
Se Chan... That rascal...

290
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:55,210
You're their dad, and you don't even know the fashion these days.

291
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:59,100
It's the trend to wear it like that.

292
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,780
I'm going, too.

293
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,050
Jenny.

294
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,670
Do you want me to drive you to school?

295
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:09,520
What? Why are you suddenly like this?

296
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:14,140
Oh, that girl! So fussy!

297
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:22,000
Se Jong, do you want to get a ride in your dad's car today?

298
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,620
I'd like that!

299
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,000
Really?

300
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,370
Great! I'll drive you to the kindergarten.

301
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:31,820
Yes. I'm going to kindergarten now.

302
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,690
Let's go!

303
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:40,130
The kids got a lot brighter since you came.

304
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,310
Really?

305
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,610
Yeah, really.

306
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,190
Especially Se Jong.

307
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:48,980
He laughs like he used to when the late wife was still alive.

308
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:53,380
Thank you for saying that.

309
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:58,790
I hope you keep taking good care of Se Jong, the youngest prince of this house. Okay?

310
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,640
Yes.

311
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,290
I can still remember it like yesterday.

312
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:10,480
The late wife really loved Se Jong.

313
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,160
Even though he was adopted, she loved him truly.

314
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,850
Adopted?

315
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,810
Se Jong is?

316
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:24,870
Se Jong was born from the heart. The late wife suggested it.

317
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:28,800
So, an adopted child.

318
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,970
I really didn't know.

319
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,540
Of course.

320
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,020
Chairman was against adoption at first, apparently.

321
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,320
The late wife insisted and adopted him.

322
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,520
She treated him like her own blood.

323
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:45,640
The late wife and the Chairman are really good people.

324
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,460
Ahjumma!

325
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:54,810
Ahjumma! Are you out of your mind?!

326
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:57,670
Are you crazy?! A nut!?

327
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:03,230
Who says Se Jong is an adopted child?! Who?

328
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,330
N-No...

329
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:09,440
Se Jong is the child of this family! The son of the Chairman!

330
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,890
Do you understand?!

331
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,670
Y-y-yes... O-of course.

332
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:17,070
Do you not want to work here?! Is that why?

333
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:20,030
Should I make it so that you don't work here?

334
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:24,010
If the Chairman knew you do this, you'd be fired right away!

335
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,790
Do you want that to happen?!

336
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:33,670
Chief Jo, I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

337
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:37,530
Ms. Park. Listen carefully.

338
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:42,100
I'm saying this once more. Se Jong is not an adopted child.

339
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,430
He is this family's son.

340
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:49,510
So, Mrs. Yeoju's story,

341
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:52,910
you never heard that story.

342
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:55,420
Understand?

343
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,220
Y-yes.

344
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,140
Ajumeoni...

345
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:08,540
Mrs. Yeoju has no manners.

346
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,470
Say something idiotic like that again!

347
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,200
I won't just sit back.

348
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,810
Wow. Nice shot!

349
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,530
Oh, it's nothing.

350
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:26,600
By the way, didn't you say the lady of Mi So Steel Company comes here too?

351
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,910
Sometimes, yes.

352
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,770
Speak of the devil.

353
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:35,180
There she comes. The lady of Mi So Steel company.

354
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,020
Is it her?

355
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,610
Yes.

356
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:46,280
Oh, she is so young and elegant.

357
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:51,480
Can you introduce me to her? Please?

358
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:57,870
I heard rumors of marriage. Is that true?

359
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,760
Marriage? No.

360
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,130
My son has a girlfriend,

361
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,480
but it hasn't been too long.

362
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,100
How did they meet?

363
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,940
They met at Central Park while jogging.

364
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:17,930
Oh, it's like a movie. So romantic!

365
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:21,490
I wonder if the name of the club is Central Park.

366
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,060
Of course,

367
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:27,960
she can't admit they met at a club dancing. That's low class.

368
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,830
My daughter saw them at a restaurant,

369
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,040
and she said they look great together.

370
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,610
She said the girlfriend looks prettier than a celebrity.

371
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:41,960
Se Ryun is quite beautiful. She got it from me.

372
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,020
I haven't met her yet,

373
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,270
but he said he'll introduce her soon. So I'm excited to meet her.

374
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:52,680
Didn't you say your daughter was going on a blind date?

375
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,380
What happened?

376
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:58,360
She needs to hurry since she's 36.

377
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:03,080
36 years old is still a baby these days.

378
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,700
My daughter had a boyfriend, too, apparently.

379
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:11,970
She said she'll introduce him soon, so I'm looking forward to that.

380
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,450
How snobby. Look here, lady.

381
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,690
Your son fell for my daughter hard.

382
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:28,280
Let's be good friends, future family.

383
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,190
Oh, where are you?

384
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,750
Are you with him by any chance?

385
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:51,720
Yeah. I'm out for a bit. I'm on a date.

386
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,670
What is it?

387
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:57,390
Oh, you're on a date!

388
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:01,250
Okay, have fun on the date. Don't fight.

389
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,230
Of course.

390
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:06,190
Did you call just to say that?

391
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:08,670
No, of course not.

392
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:11,470
Well, you know, their family or ours,

393
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:15,140
it's better to introduce each other. That makes it more solid.

394
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:19,170
Mom! We agreed to talk about that in due time.

395
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:21,210
Okay, okay.

396
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,940
Oh, right, Se Ryun.

397
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:30,220
Is the club where you two met called Central Park?

398
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,830
Mom... What are you talking about?

399
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:36,900
Oh, nothing. Bye. Have fun.

400
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,070
They're doing great.

401
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:44,730
Oh, no. Are my eyes sagging again?

402
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:47,740
Mr. Park, stop by the plastic surgeon on the way.

403
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,920
Yes, ma'am.

404
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:55,780
Why is it keep sagging? So annoying.

405
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,650
We just bought something like that.

406
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:05,180
It's not that...

407
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,300
It reminded me of my mom.

408
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,800
Mom really likes this kind of style.

409
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,810
Buy it.

410
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:16,890
No, next time. I was just looking.

411
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:19,220
What do you mean next time?

412
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,940
Why do you do that?

413
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,600
I can't believe you're still not used to this.

414
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,060
What did I say about my money?

415
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:29,300
I told you it's your money!

416
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:34,590
Your mother is like my mother too.

417
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,620
Se Ryun.

418
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,760
Why are you always so heartwarming?

419
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,450
You're driving me crazy.

420
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:44,230
I don't know!

421
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:47,710
I must really love you.

422
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,770
What am I going to do!

423
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:52,810
I love it!

424
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,630
What is that smell?

425
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:07,050
It smells like ramen...

426
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:11,790
That's weird. Why does it smell like that here?

427
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,920
It is ramen.

428
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,020
Is Mr. Park cooking ramen to eat?

429
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,430
Oh, it's hot--

430
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:31,880
Mr. Park. Are you inside?

431
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,970
Wait.

432
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:38,920
Mr. Park left in the morning with the Madam...

433
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,810
There shouldn't be anyone here right now.

434
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,390
Why does it smell like ramen in an empty house?

435
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,830
Is someone in there?

436
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,130
W-w-what?

437
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:06,920
Is it a ghost?!

438
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:13,190
Oh, that cunning woman.

439
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,340
Did she do all that because of the ramen smell!?

440
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,200
Oh, my. My heart.

441
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,640
I hope I don't get caught.

442
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:28,040
Ms. Park! Ms. Park, Ms. Park!

443
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,030
What's going on? Is something wrong?

444
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:34,210
Ms. Park, something's strange. The house in the back...

445
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:37,650
The house in the back? What about it?

446
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:40,870
Mr. Park left with the Madam this morning,

447
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,060
and there shouldn't be anyone there.

448
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:48,590
But I can smell ramen from that empty house!

449
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,870
Ramen smell?

450
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,420
No way.

451
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:57,010
I know, right? It's just the streets outside. Why does it smell like ramen?

452
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:59,460
It feels so strange and creepy!

453
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,480
Ms. Park, come with me.

454
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,830
Come on!

455
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:11,640
Ms. Park, you can smell ramen, right?

456
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,570
I can't tell.

457
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,880
It feels like I do smell it...

458
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,850
or not!

459
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,880
I don't smell it as much as before...

460
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,800
This is the smell of ramen!

461
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,930
I don't think so.

462
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:35,460
Ms. Park, is your nose clogged? Sinus infection?

463
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,960
Is there someone in there?

464
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:43,280
Ms. Park. Maybe...

465
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,000
Maybe someone's squatting here secretly, like in the movie.

466
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,320
No way!

467
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,770
You're right.

468
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,860
Mr. Park would never do that.

469
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,140
Is there a ghost eating ramen or something? I can't even check!

470
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,660
It's disturbing!

471
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:10,240
Dan Dan is going to make a scene.

472
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,160
That cunning fox has a nose of a hound!

473
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,750
How did she smell ramen?

474
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:29,680
Mom, you almost got caught!

475
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:35,280
Mom, Dad's not even there. How could you eat ramen?!

476
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,790
I knew she'd be like this.

477
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:46,580
Mom, do you even have a brain?

478
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,850
If you get caught, how would that make Dad look?!

479
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:52,780
If you are going to do that, leave now,

480
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,610
and go to a sauna or something!

481
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:57,190
Why are you hiding there? Are you a criminal?

482
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:00,180
What? Criminal?

483
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,960
How dare she!

484
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,020
Hey. What did you say? A criminal?

485
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,760
Is that something for you to say to your mom?

486
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,910
Am I hiding there because I want to?

487
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:17,500
I'm there because I have nowhere to go!

488
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:22,300
Why do you have nowhere to go? At least go to a sauna.

489
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:26,480
How can you have smelly ramen without a thought?

490
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,530
Dad's already having a tough time.

491
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:31,860
But instead of being helpful, why are you keep making it worse?

492
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,800
Oh, my... Look at her talking.

493
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,040
What did I do so wrong?

494
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,640
I was hungry.

495
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,710
So I ate one ramen. Is that such a big crime?

496
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:46,440
I'm not talking about the ramen!

497
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,550
Don't you feel bad for Dad at all?

498
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:54,470
Dad is working his ass off every day.

499
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,090
If you have a conscience,

500
00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:01,350
shouldn't you at least try to wash dishes in a restaurant?

501
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:04,440
I may be an incompetent mom,

502
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,380
but you can't be like this to me if you thought of me as your mom.

503
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:11,950
You're doing this because Geon and Dae Beom lost the house, right?

504
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:16,730
Right. Geon and Dae Beom did lose the house and the deposit.

505
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:21,090
But did they do it on purpose? Did they?

506
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:25,810
Your uncle Geon loved you so much. He was giving you piggybacks all the time!

507
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:31,500
How do you think your grandmother and Geon feel after running away like that?

508
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,170
I don't even know if they're dead or alive.

509
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:36,930
My heart is in so much pain...

510
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:38,810
I don't care about anything else.

511
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:43,630
Stop making Dad suffer.

512
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:47,200
How can she be so ungrateful...

513
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,210
I'm telling you,

514
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:53,930
you'll regret treating me like this. You mean girl!

515
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,340
Don't even call me mom from now on!

516
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,780
Dae Beom...

517
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,290
Why did you eat ramen there?

518
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:21,570
It looks like she was worried about you and father getting caught and being treated like scammers.

519
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:24,880
Even so, if it were you, you wouldn't have done that to me.

520
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,310
"Mom, be careful from now on," "Mom, if you're hungry, I'll buy you food."

521
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:31,810
You would've done that.

522
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:34,540
That's true...

523
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:38,560
Mrs. Yeon Sil... My dear mom, my love.

524
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,970
Dan Dan is a little bit jerk, you know.

525
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:47,280
Right? Not just a little bit, but a big jerk!

526
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,020
By the way...

527
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,490
Hey.

528
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,370
Dae Beom. This all looks like luxury brands' stuff.

529
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:06,070
The quality is luxury quality.

530
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,610
These dress shoes, t-these are Guccia dress shoes.

531
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:12,280
I don't think they are knock-offs.

532
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,280
You look like a different person, like a chaebol family's son.

533
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,750
Do I? Do these clothes look good on me?

534
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,850
It looks great, but...

535
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:28,380
How did you buy this? Where did you get the money?

536
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,870
Did you..!

537
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:32,780
Mom, don't worry. I didn't do anything bad to buy it.

538
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,170
Are you sure? You're not going around doing bad things, are you?

539
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:40,220
Mom. How could you think of me like that?

540
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,960
Yes, sure.

541
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:49,160
Even if we don't have any money, don't commit crimes.

542
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,590
"And don't make other people struggle."

543
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:55,120
I've heard that to death. I'm your son, Mom!

544
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,030
Then what is it? Did you win the lottery?

545
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:01,760
What? Yes, it's something like that.

546
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,220
Like what?

547
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,020
Mom, I'll tell you later.

548
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:11,330
This is yours, Mom. Some clothes and a bag.

549
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:14,580
This is a jacket for Father.

550
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:17,750
This is a sweater for Dan Dan.

551
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:21,590
Oh, my. Why did you get all these?

552
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:24,610
Hey. Why did you buy something for Dan Dan?

553
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,510
That ungrateful girl.

554
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:31,980
Mom, stop it. Think of all the trouble we caused...

555
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:42,300
Well, you chose a color she likes.

556
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:44,330
Isn't it great?

557
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:46,080
My child.

558
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:50,500
- Of course, I'm your child. Who else's?
- My precious son!

559
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,140
Honey.

560
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,240
Dae Beom's dad!

561
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:00,220
Where were you? And why didn't you pick up the phone?

562
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:04,490
Honey, were you worried because I was gone?

563
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:07,260
I didn't know my phone battery was dead.

564
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,990
This isn't your house. You can't come and go as you wish!

565
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:13,250
There was a situation today.

566
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:17,930
What's all this?

567
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,170
This?

568
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:22,410
Let's get inside first.

569
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:25,120
What is it?

570
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:30,200
The toy train is my favorite thing in the world.

571
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:44,090
Right. Geon and Dae Beom did lose the house and the deposit.

572
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:46,210
But did they do that on purpose?

573
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:48,270
Did they?

574
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:54,330
I'm telling you, you'll regret treating me like this. You mean girl!

575
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:58,130
Don't even call me mom from now on!

576
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:16,030
Dan Dan, can you come out for a second?

577
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,130
I heard about what happened today.

578
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:27,410
That your mom... almost got caught eating ramen.

579
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:32,160
- I heard you had a fight outside too.
-Yes.

580
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,020
I'm nervous about Mom living secretly in your room,

581
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:40,450
and I feel weird acting like we don't know each other.

582
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:49,770
If a new driver comes in, we will leave right away. So hold on a little longer.

583
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:52,650
Mom will be more careful from now on too.

584
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:54,780
Okay.

585
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:58,950
Please, tell her to be careful.

586
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:01,550
Oh, right.

587
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:03,530
Here.

588
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:06,090
What's this?

589
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:12,910
Apparently, your mom met up with Dae Beom today. Dae Beom bought this for you.

590
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:15,820
What money does he have to buy me this?

591
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:21,430
Dad, isn't he going around making trouble?

592
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:28,100
Dan Dan. Don't assume about your brother so easily and be quick to speak ill of him.

593
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,700
Dae Beom is not the kind of person to go around and make trouble.

594
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:37,130
I didn't raise you guys like that. Understood?

595
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:40,020
Understood.

596
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:45,590
Go inside before someone sees us.

597
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:48,430
You go first, Dad.

598
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:50,910
Okay.

599
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:08,830
This is a super expensive brand.

600
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:12,540
Where did he get the money to buy this?

601
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,860
Hi.

602
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:29,050
How have you been?

603
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:33,910
Jin Sang Goo... Why are you here?

604
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:36,060
You recognized me even though it's been a while.

605
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,230
Well, you should recognize your husband.

606
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:43,010
How dare you come here? Get the hell out of here.

607
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:46,600
I don't want to look at you even for a second.

608
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,100
- Just one moment, Sarah.
- Let me go!

609
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,920
We have a history, so stop being like this.

610
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,770
I'm just here to ask you about something.

611
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:57,280
Let me go.

612
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,510
Okay.

613
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,430
Okay.

614
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:07,880
Hey, Jo Sarah, let me ask just one question.

615
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:14,130
The kid you gave birth to six years ago is my kid, right? This Jin Sang Goo's child.

616
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:15,530
What?

617
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:21,310
Back then... When we broke up... Were you... pregnant?

618
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:24,110
You should've told me.

619
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:27,050
Why did you give birth without letting me know?

620
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:31,260
You crazy bastard.

621
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:34,620
Jo Sarah, your hand still stings.

622
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:41,530
Hey, Sarah, you might get in trouble treating me so roughly.

623
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:48,670
Tell me before you go. Was that my child?

624
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:54,530
I just need to know that. Somebody told me that they saw you heavily pregnant at a gynecologist.

625
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:59,210
Hey, Jin Sang Goo.

626
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:06,120
Why would I like a man who married another woman behind my back?

627
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:09,370
A man who is so shameless?

628
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:12,400
Why would I get pregnant and give birth for someone like you?

629
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,120
Do you think I'm an idiot?

630
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:20,400
Do you think I'm a fool? Why would I do such a crazy thing?

631
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,510
So, you're saying that's not true?

632
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:25,600
You're saying that friend was mistaken, right?

633
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,650
Should I call your wife over here? Would you get away then?

634
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:34,770
Okay, fine. I'm leaving.

635
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:40,820
Sarah, I'll believe I have no kid then.

636
00:47:56,870 --> 00:48:00,390
Sarah... Jo Sarah.

637
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,040
Mom.

638
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:09,330
W-Who is that bastard?

639
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:14,290
W-What was that bastard talking about?

640
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:17,720
It's not true, is it? Is it?

641
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:23,070
No. Everything he said was gibberish. Don't pay any mind to it.

642
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:26,230
Hey, hey! Sarah! S-Sarah!

643
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,400
Sarah! Open the door!

644
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,810
Talk with me!

645
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,080
Hey, Sarah!

646
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:40,380
Mom, it's nothing. You misheard it, so don't worry about it.

647
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,310
Sarah! Jo Sarah!

648
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:44,870
Jo Sarah!

649
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,400
Sarah, hey, Sarah. Open the door, please.

650
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,540
Talk with me, please.

651
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,770
Today's report.

652
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:12,140
Jenny went to school from 8 AM to 4 PM,

653
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:14,870
and went to after-school tutoring from 4 PM to 7 PM.

654
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:18,940
She said she made a new friend called Heo Won Seo at the English tutoring.

655
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:22,350
Se Chan came home two hours late,

656
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:25,420
but he told me he was going to a friend's birthday party beforehand.

657
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:32,850
Se Jong ate his food without being picky at home and also at the kindergarten.

658
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,160
But on the way from home from kindergarten,

659
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:48,600
I bought Se Jong a junk food named Opollo from a stationary store.

660
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:52,820
Se Jong's friends were all eating it, so I couldn't help it.

661
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:55,800
I'm very sorry.

662
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:03,460
Okay.

663
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,120
But if you can, I'd rather him not eat junk food.

664
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,800
If he eats it again, please let me know in advance.

665
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,590
Okay.

666
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:15,110
Good night.

667
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,120
Good night to you too.

668
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:33,100
I survived another day.

669
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:59,490
Please... Help me...

670
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:30,460
[Baby Box]

671
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,230
Mom.

672
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:23,260
Sarah. Was it then?

673
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:30,070
What are you talking about in the middle of the night?

674
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:32,060
I'm going to sleep. Get out.

675
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:34,850
Six years ago...

676
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:38,500
You told me...

677
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:43,570
You told me that you're going on a trip.

678
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:47,160
And you were gone for half a year.

679
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,530
Was it then?

680
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:55,080
Did you give birth, all alone?

681
00:52:56,590 --> 00:53:01,250
Tell me... Tell me the truth!

682
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:04,100
What did you do to the baby?

683
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,920
Did you abandon him?

684
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,470
Or did the baby die?!

685
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:13,190
Mom, really! What baby?

686
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:16,420
No. It's not true!

687
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:21,700
Why are you doing this?! Get out!

688
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:25,060
In the past, I...

689
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:28,720
I saw you clutching onto a baby blanket...

690
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:33,420
I saw you hopelessly weeping, holding a baby blanket.

691
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:37,160
That's not something a young lady would do!

692
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,480
Where is that baby blanket?

693
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,630
Where is it? What did you do with it!

694
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:44,560
I don't have anything like that. Mom!

695
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,620
Mom, get out, now!

696
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,810
Let go of me!

697
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:54,690
Mom, no! No! Not that!

698
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:04,510
W-Who is this?

699
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:06,880
T-This is...

700
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:13,560
T-This is... the little Se Jong's photo...

701
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:20,950
Why do you... Why do you have so many of his photos?

702
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:26,760
You... Did you..?

703
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:29,130
Yes.

704
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:34,220
Se Jong... Se Jong...

705
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:37,970
Se Jong is my child.

706
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:46,380
Mom...

707
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,800
I can't believe this.

708
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,690
It doesn't make any sense...

709
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:58,620
How can...

710
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:04,940
How can this happen?

711
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:26,530
How can this happen?

712
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,080
Let's talk for a second.

713
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,600
I'm late.

714
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,890
Do you think work is more important?

715
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:56,160
Who was that guy from yesterday? Does he have any money?

716
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:02,060
That bastard... He has a wife, and he's broke.

717
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:04,370
Don't talk about that bastard to me.

718
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:09,050
Why did you get with such a broke idiot?

719
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:11,300
Are you crazy?

720
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:14,140
Do you think I knew all that at the time?

721
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:16,830
I didn't know he was someone like that!

722
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:21,900
You should've told me earlier. Why didn't you tell me?!

723
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:25,210
I was worried that you would give up your life.

724
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:28,820
You are the only one I have.

725
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,160
So...

726
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:40,790
So, that's why you were so devoted to the Chairman Lee..?

727
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:43,760
Because of Se Jong?

728
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:48,270
Because you wanted to be Se Jong's mother?

729
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:51,290
I'm going to work.

730
00:56:54,690 --> 00:57:01,030
I didn't even know that until now...

731
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,840
What are you saying?

732
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,800
Se Jong's grandmother took him?

733
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,530
Yes. Se Jong called her grandma, so...

734
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:25,470
I'm new to this kindergarten, so I thought she was his grandmother.

735
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:28,120
Maybe it's the Madam...

736
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:32,350
It couldn't be. She went out with Dad earlier...

737
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,670
Yes, Ms. Park.

738
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,440
Chief Jo! There's a problem.

739
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:51,610
I'm at the kindergarten right now to pick up Se Jong,

740
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:56,350
but apparently, some grandmother came and took Se Jong with her!

741
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:57,790
What are you saying?

742
00:57:57,790 --> 00:58:00,590
A grandma? What grandma?

743
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:03,120
That's why I'm calling you, Chief Jo.

744
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:07,880
Madam went out earlier with Dad-- I mean, with Mr. Park.

745
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,490
But they called the person "grandmother."

746
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:13,350
Does Se Jong have another grandmother aside from the Madam?

747
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:15,640
Someone Se Jong calls grandma?

748
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,990
There's nobody!

749
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:19,990
Then what do we do?

750
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:22,960
Could it be... my mom?

751
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,870
Chief Jo, we need to do something!

752
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:29,260
I'll report to the Chairman first and call the police!

753
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:31,770
No, Ms. Park, wait!

754
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:35,270
I'll look into this and give you a call, so please wait a moment.

755
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:37,880
Just one minute!

756
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,170
Mom.

757
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:47,990
Hey, Sarah! I'm with Se Jong right now!

758
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:54,350
That's why I want you to come here too. This place is...

759
00:58:56,220 --> 00:59:00,420
Alright. Alright.

760
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:04,430
My goodness...

761
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:10,080
Ms. Park, it's me. Don't worry about Se Jong.

762
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,650
Really?

763
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:17,920
Then did you find out who is the grandma who took Se Jong?

764
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:21,660
Yes... It was my mom.

765
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:24,190
I'm sorry?

766
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:27,250
It was your mother?

767
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:33,060
So don't worry, and come home! I'll explain all of it later.

768
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:36,990
But Chief Jo, what do I tell the Chairman?

769
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,570
I do need to report to him.

770
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:45,540
Oh, that too. Let's talk about that later as well. Alright, Ms. Park?

771
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:49,200
Okay... I will.

772
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:57,540
Seriously?!

773
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:59,250
Try this too!

774
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:01,070
Grandma...

775
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:03,650
Are you crying?

776
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:06,130
No, Se Jong.

777
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:08,880
I think something went in this grandma's eyes.

778
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,200
Why don't you check for me?

779
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,530
- But Grandma...
- Yes?

780
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:16,660
I want to go home.

781
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:20,290
Already?

782
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:24,220
If you wait a bit, your favorite person will be here, Se Jong!

783
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,220
Let's wait a moment.

784
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:28,870
Hey, Sarah!

785
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,400
Se Jong.

786
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:39,420
Chief Jo, I want to go home.

787
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:41,860
Chief Jo..?

788
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:43,500
Oh, gosh...

789
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,400
Yes, Se Jong, let's go.

790
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,960
Hey.

791
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:51,070
No...I mean, there's some ice cream left.

792
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:52,930
I want to stop eating.

793
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:55,940
I think I'll get a stomachache.

794
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,760
Hey, this...this, what about all this then?

795
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:06,930
Sarah! Hey, hey!

796
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:15,510
I thought Grandma came to pick me up instead of Ms. Park.

797
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:19,320
Today, Grandma was going to take Se Jong home...

798
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:24,450
But Grandma had a lot of ice cream coupons!

799
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:28,240
So she wanted to buy you ice creams, Se Jong.

800
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:31,590
It's because you're so cute, Se Jong.

801
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:35,320
- Ah, I see.
- Yes.

802
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:54,250
Yes?

803
01:01:56,830 --> 01:01:59,470
Ms. Park.

804
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:01,330
What about Se Jong?

805
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:04,630
Se Jong just came home and washing his hands.

806
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:08,060
Can we...talk for a moment?

807
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:10,350
Sure.

808
01:02:13,450 --> 01:02:18,000
My mom took Se Jong today...

809
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:24,520
because she had business near his kindergarten, and she was so delighted to see him.

810
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:28,480
So she couldn't just go and had to buy him ice cream.

811
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,390
My mom also has been very affectionate with him since he was a baby.

812
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:36,640
Ah, I see...

813
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:40,200
So, Ms. Park...

814
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:45,440
What happened today... I'm hoping you won't report it to the Chairman.

815
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,220
I'll report to him myself.

816
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:52,690
I think there might be misunderstandings if I don't tell him directly,

817
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:58,150
and my mom did that just because she was affectionate to Se Jong.

818
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:01,670
Okay, I get it.

819
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:07,180
Mom, are you mad?

820
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:10,370
What kind of idiotic action was that!

821
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:16,800
What is so wrong about me buying ice cream for my grandson?

822
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:21,450
What have you done good, to be shouting at me?

823
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:25,680
This is why I didn't tell you because I knew you'd act this way!

824
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:30,420
Mom, I, no matter how I'd miss Se Jong!

825
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:33,090
No matter how much I wanted to touch him!

826
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:37,590
I held back and held back more!

827
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:42,570
Mom! I...

828
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:45,180
I held back for six years.

829
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:48,010
For six years!

830
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:49,970
Then why did you do that!

831
01:03:49,970 --> 01:03:53,610
Why?!

832
01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:59,730
Mom, if you can't hold yourself back right now, all my plans will fall apart, everything!

833
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:02,170
Will it fall apart?

834
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:06,570
Alright... Alright. I won't do that again.

835
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:10,920
I won't go looking for him anymore.

836
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:19,160
Oh, my poor baby...

837
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,970
My poor baby...

838
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:27,220
Today's report.

839
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:32,610
Jenny and Se Chan returned from their school and tutoring without any issues at their usual time.

840
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:36,610
Se Jong was picked up by Chief Jo today.

841
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:39,170
Jenny and Se Chan finished their homework.

842
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:45,500
And Jenny's grown brighter these days.

843
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:48,540
Thank you for your good work. Rest well.

844
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:52,910
Thank you! I hope you have a good night as well, Chairman.

845
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,980
Yes, Noona?

846
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:07,120
What? You're coming to Korea?

847
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,690
When?

848
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:12,390
Okay. I'll have your room cleaned.

849
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:14,230
Ajumeoni.

850
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:16,100
Oh, yes, Chairman? Do you need something?

851
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:18,160
No, it's not that.

852
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,990
There will be an important guest tomorrow, so can you prepare some food,

853
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:24,440
and get the guest room ready?

854
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,940
The guest room?

855
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:32,550
Is it Ms. Anna Kim, who visited last time, coming?

856
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:34,060
How did you know that?

857
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:38,960
I knew it because your face is so bright, for the first time in a long while, Chairman!

858
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,860
Then please take care of it.

859
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:44,370
Ah, please make the marinated shrimp dish. You know that, right?

860
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:46,410
Yes. Don't worry.

861
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:50,900
I'll tell Mr. Park to go to the seafood market and buy some fresh shrimp in the morning.

862
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:52,670
Thank you so much, Ajumeoni.

863
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:54,850
Yes.

864
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:59,640
Ms. Anna Kim's visiting in a while! What should I make more?

865
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:02,120
Aren't you going to sleep?

866
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:07,760
Oh, there will be an important guest from the States tomorrow! I was thinking about what I should make.

867
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,800
An important guest?

868
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:13,140
She's someone who's like a true older sister to our Chairman.

869
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:15,560
She's the daughter of the nanny who raised the Chairman back then.

870
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:19,650
She has a lot of our company's shares, and our Chairman cares a lot about her

871
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:23,040
to the point Madam can't say anything to her either!

872
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,260
I see.

873
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:29,550
Ji Young!

874
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:32,870
I feel suffocated. I feel like I'm going to die!

875
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:34,190
This isn't living.

876
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:37,810
It's like a prison! Like a cave without light!

877
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:40,470
Just consider me dead!

878
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:42,610
Ji Young! No!

879
01:06:42,610 --> 01:06:45,130
Please don't go!

880
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:47,570
No!

881
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:54,080
Are you okay? Did you have a nightmare?

882
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:56,470
Huh?

883
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:59,920
No. It's nothing.

884
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:03,690
It's something!

885
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:07,130
You're drenched in a cold sweat!

886
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:17,450
You're having nightmares because we need to leave here soon.

887
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:27,920
I find it hard to sleep peacefully too.

888
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:55,880
[Welcome, Anna Kim]

889
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:05,730
Are you from Chairman Lee Young Gook's company?

890
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:09,080
Yes! Are you CEO Anna Kim?

891
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:12,070
Yes. I'm Anna Kim--

892
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:20,430
CEO!

893
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:35,160
♫  Why do you run away, love, like a shy child ♫

894
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:41,760
♫  In case I lose it, I hold it tight  ♫

895
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:49,010
♫  But love always runs away, chased by longing  ♫

896
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:55,810
♫  It would be nice to take a break  ♫

897
01:08:55,810 --> 01:08:58,490
♫  I have to abandon the longing and the grieves  ♫

898
01:08:58,490 --> 01:09:01,430
[Young Lady and Gentleman]

899
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:04,530
He looks like him. He looks so much like Soo Chul Oppa.

900
01:09:04,530 --> 01:09:05,960
She's our teacher!

901
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:08,130
Hello! Nice to meet you.

902
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:11,330
What right do I have to think of Oppa and Dan Dan?

903
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:12,330
Lee Jenny!

904
01:09:12,330 --> 01:09:13,900
Are you keeping tabs on me?

905
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,060
What about you? What are you doing with a boy on the streets?

906
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:17,700
Chairman, you're really hopeless.

907
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:18,730
W-What?

908
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:20,040
Isn't he Chairman Lee?

909
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,910
W-Who the heck is she?

910
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:23,590
The Chairman and Ms. Park?

911
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:26,510
It seems like my son came to pick me up with his girlfriend!

912
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:29,970
They'll all be so surprised when they realize I'm Se Ryun's mom!

913
01:09:29,970 --> 01:09:32,600
My Noona lives in this mansion? What happened?

914
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,010
Isn't this the back of our house?

915
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:35,450
What noise is this so late at night?

916
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:36,700
Who are you!

917
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:37,790
Ah! No!

918
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:40,880
Ms. Park?
