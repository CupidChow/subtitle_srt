00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,200
[Episode 34]

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,740
Ms. Park.

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,750
What?

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,830
What line did I cross?

5
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,850
Just look at yourself now.

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,150
In this cold weather, without a coat,

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,110
you've been calling for me over and over,

8
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,660
looking for me like you've lost your mind.

9
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,810
That's what crossing the line looks like.

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,380
Maybe you don't know me well.

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,500
I don't feel cold much.

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,870
When I was in the military, I even jumped in the icy water with no clothes in winter.

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,690
This is nothing.

14
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:49,380
I go for a walk like this a lot.

15
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:55,250
Then why were you yelling out my name for the whole village to hear?

16
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,060
On top of that, when you just saw me, you grabbed my shoulders tightly

17
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,140
and asked me if I was okay.

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,970
That's not all. When I told you I was stuck at the last bus stop, you came to pick me up right away.

19
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:11,650
And then you took me to a nice restaurant to make me feel better, even cutting up the steak for me.

20
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,670
Also, when I said the teddy bear was cute,

21
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,210
you drank down the beer to win the bear.

22
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,680
All of these shows that you're not just looking at me as a private tutor.

23
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,610
These are things you do because you like me.

24
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:33,040
Chairman, please stop hiding your feelings.

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,100
And let's just like each other.

26
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,980
Okay.

27
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,320
I made a mistake.

28
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,380
I wanted to comfort you because you were going through such a hard time.

29
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,900
But I guess that confused you.

30
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:57,690
But even if it were Mrs. Yeoju or Chief Kim going through a hard time, I would've done the same.

31
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,530
Really?

32
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,640
Yes, really.

33
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,660
So please stop with your strange misunderstanding.

34
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:11,050
Let's both really not cross the line from now on.

35
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,760
Then, let's go home.

36
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,490
Okay! I will not cross the line from now on as well!

37
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,140
I can't do anything for Ms. Park at all.

38
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,700
When I do, she misunderstands it weirdly.

39
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,820
No, I'm the problem, just like Ms. Park said.

40
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,400
I am the one who crossed the line.

41
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,150
I should get myself together.

42
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,540
This is a coat for you, Mom.

43
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,680
This is a health supplement for you, Grandma.

44
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,790
Why did you get this suddenly? It's not my birthday.

45
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,520
Mine is a long time away, too.

46
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,000
Grandma, you're working hard these days.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,260
- Try this one.
- These are precious ones!

48
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,250
I feel healthier already.

49
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,670
- You have one, too.
- Shall I?

50
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,410
Thank you.

51
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,470
This is so good.

52
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,110
It's really nice.

53
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,830
And, this is spending money for Grandma. And this is for you, Mom.

54
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,940
What? You even prepared money for us?

55
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,770
Dan Dan, why are you doing this?

56
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,950
Mom, I didn't know how you felt all this time.

57
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,890
You must have been upset because of me, haven't you?

58
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,210
I'm sorry, Mom.

59
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:56,150
It's only because we didn't tell you.

60
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,050
It's okay.

61
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,970
I appreciate this, but I won't take it.

62
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,670
Your dad would get angry at me if I did.

63
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,670
Why? It's not that much.

64
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:11,400
You raised me all this time. Surely I can do this.

65
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:18,260
Mom. I will give you spending money more often.

66
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:25,150
Thank you for raising me well, Mom.

67
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,010
You are making me cry.

68
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,110
Dan Dan.

69
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,810
When Dae Beom was young, he was weak.

70
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,260
That's why I took care of him a bit more.

71
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,370
It's not because I was discriminating.

72
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,970
When you were angry with me saying I treated you differently,

73
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,620
that made me very sad.

74
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,880
I was trying my best.

75
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,990
But I was inadequate.

76
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,100
No, you weren't.

77
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,510
I'm sorry, Mom.

78
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:13,540
I am really sorry.

79
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,110
Dan Dan. I'm sorry.

80
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,550
And thank you.

81
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,090
Thank you, and I'm sorry.

82
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,590
Father, including these, there are thirty chickens.

83
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,160
- Hello!
- Hello!

84
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,240
Honey, did we get a group order?

85
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,600
Father's going to the orphanage today.

86
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,480
That's right. Yes.

87
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,400
But why the bosses of the Jokbal restaurant are here?

88
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,310
We have to participate, of course.

89
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:59,560
Mr. Park has been supporting the orphanage all this time.

90
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,780
We should participate.

91
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,720
We are paying for the ten of them.

92
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,650
Thank you!

93
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:13,240
Mr. Park. Please tell them ten chickens are from us, the Brothers' Jokbal.

94
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,850
- Of course.
- Thank you.

95
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,090
- Pack it well.
- Yes.

96
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,730
Ms. Anna!

97
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,980
Ms. Anna!

98
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,800
This is a gift for you.

99
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,110
Hyung Sik.

100
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,440
Thank you very much. It's very pretty.

101
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,380
I think you are the prettiest in the whole wide world.

102
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,100
Really?

103
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,020
Thank you.

104
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,230
CEO Anna.

105
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,430
I heard you are going back to the US.

106
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,950
Yes, Sister.

107
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,500
When would you return next time?

108
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,900
I think I won't be able to come back for a while.

109
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,690
But I will continue to pray for you and the children.

110
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,080
And continue to send financial support to the orphanage.

111
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,410
Thank you, CEO Anna.

112
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:22,330
The children and I will pray for you as well.

113
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,670
Thank you, Sister.

114
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,380
What brings you here?

115
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,700
Soo Chul.

116
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,210
Did you see the text I sent you?

117
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,630
Yes, I did.

118
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:25,150
When I finish my work,

119
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:30,770
I will disappear like a wind. I promise.

120
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:42,370
Please be healthy, at least for Dan Dan's sake.

121
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,250
I'll get going.

122
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,870
Hello, Mr. Park.

123
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,790
Hello!

124
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,570
Our children will be happy since they've been waiting for you.

125
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:04,970
That's great. And today, the Brothers' Jokbal across the street from us paid for ten chickens.

126
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:09,360
Is that right? Please give them our thanks.

127
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,590
By the way, do you know CEO Anna, who was just here?

128
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,320
Pardon?

129
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,220
Yes, a little, through work.

130
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,660
Isn't she a very good person?

131
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,080
Pardon?

132
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,280
She's been financially supporting our orphanage for over ten years.

133
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,100
Whenever she's in Korea, she never forgets to come here

134
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,240
and volunteers at least once a week.

135
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,590
She's very friendly with the children as well.

136
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,160
She's a really spectacular person.

137
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,150
Sarah, eat some fruit.

138
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,460
- What?
- I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

139
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,680
What's going on, Sarah?

140
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,100
What's wrong?

141
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,700
Sarah, what's wrong?

142
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,260
What happened?

143
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,140
Did you have a bad dream or something?

144
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:37,620
Did you have a dream of a Grim Reaper coming to drag you to hell?

145
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,040
Did that happen?

146
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,400
No, Mom. It's nothing.

147
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,770
I will go out for a bit.

148
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,990
Sarah.

149
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:53,720
Where are you going like that?

150
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,810
Hey...

151
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,150
It seems like only half of her is there.

152
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,850
And she's getting more gaunt every day.

153
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,770
What should I do with her?

154
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:13,650
What should I do? It feels like it's all because of me.

155
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,890
I should be the one to be punished.

156
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:20,790
But I feel like my Sarah is getting punished because of me.

157
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,450
My Sarah...

158
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,300
It's so fun.

159
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,340
Se Jong.

160
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,530
Is that Chief Jo?

161
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,130
Hello.

162
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,460
Yes, hello.

163
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,200
Se Jong, have you been doing well?

164
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,880
Yes. But, Chief Jo.

165
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,930
Did you come here to see me?

166
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,270
Yes, I did.

167
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:02,950
I came to see you because I was nearby.

168
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:08,690
Why? You don't work in our house anymore.

169
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,740
What? Right...

170
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,240
That's true.

171
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,960
But I saw a toy you might like.

172
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:25,610
So since I was passing by...

173
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,020
I got this for you.

174
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,780
It's one I really like.

175
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,630
Really? Do you like it?

176
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,650
Yes, I do.

177
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,070
Thank you, Chief Jo.

178
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,280
You're welcome.

179
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,050
Are you healthy and everything?

180
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,980
Yes, I am.

181
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,970
That's good.

182
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,060
You should be healthy.

183
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:58,500
Se Jong. I missed you a lot.

184
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,760
Did you miss me at all?

185
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,780
Se Jong! Come back!

186
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,430
I'm coming!

187
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,950
Chief Jo, I will get going.

188
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,290
My girlfriend is calling me.

189
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,450
I'm coming!

190
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,000
[Teddy Bear Ajussi]

191
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,360
It's cold out.

192
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,350
Aren't you cold?

193
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:58,190
No, I am not.

194
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,690
We've walked a lot.

195
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,070
Aren't your legs sore?

196
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,570
No, they aren't.

197
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,250
Let's walk some more.

198
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,040
I can't help it anymore.

199
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,990
Let's go to a cafe nearby and have a hot tea.

200
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,850
Or I will go get it.

201
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,380
I like the fresh air. It feels refreshing.

202
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,630
That's why I want to keep walking.

203
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:32,740
Your face is turning blue, but is it refreshing?

204
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,080
Yes.

205
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:39,770
Let's walk some more and get something to eat.

206
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,420
Okay, then.

207
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,670
Let's walk some more.

208
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:11,590
Something happened to you today, didn't you?

209
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,440
No, nothing happened.

210
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,940
I'm just getting teary for no reason.

211
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,970
I'm sorry. I don't know why.

212
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,820
It's okay.

213
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:36,620
All wounds need time to heal.

214
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:42,190
But there's no wound in the world that won't heal.

215
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:45,350
Until your wounds are healed,

216
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,340
I will be by your side.

217
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:52,540
If you want to cry, go ahead and cry.

218
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,510
Thank you.

219
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,660
Thank you, Ajussi.

220
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:18,390
Do you know it's been ten years since we last saw a movie?

221
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,820
What?

222
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,280
Is it been ten years?

223
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,270
Didn't we see the Thieves not long ago?

224
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,370
That was ten years ago, Ajussi.

225
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:31,480
I forced you to go even then.

226
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,980
I forced you by saying we were the only ones who didn't see that movie.

227
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:40,120
What made you want to see a movie?

228
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,270
You are acting suspiciously.

229
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,410
What?

230
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,640
Oh, my...

231
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,800
I hear a lot of things from just asking you to see a movie.

232
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,270
Don't you see?

233
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:56,390
You took me to a nice restaurant for spaghetti.

234
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,650
You are doing things you don't normally do.

235
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,230
Does that make you happy?

236
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,620
Of course!

237
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,710
Then let's go on dates like this more often.

238
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:12,290
Really? You said it!

239
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:18,040
- I didn't like it much.
- I surely did.

240
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:28,030
Honey, do you want flowers?

241
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,960
Please give me the money instead.

242
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,860
Flowers are nice to look at, but it's a pain to throw them out.

243
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,420
Please give me the money. I like money best.

244
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,900
My goodness...

245
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,460
I am kidding.

246
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,440
Why don't we buy meat with the money?

247
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,100
Let's gather all together tonight and grill some meat.

248
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,050
Let's buy beef. And call Dan Dan too.

249
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,050
Okay, let's do that.

250
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:58,300
I love you more than flowers.

251
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:04,460
So are you saying you prepared this party for Dan Dan?

252
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,990
Yes. It would make her feel better if we all got together and made some noise.

253
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,440
Thank you, Younger-sister-in-law.

254
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,930
Thank you for taking care of Dan Dan like this.

255
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:18,230
It hurts to think of what Dan Dan must be going through.

256
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,600
She keeps saying she's okay.

257
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,140
But how can she be really okay inside?

258
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,310
Her feelings must have been bruised.

259
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:32,150
But how can her birth mom not come to see her even once?

260
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:36,200
How can a person be like that?

261
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,570
Mom, she probably can't come because Soo Chul would beat her to death.

262
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,300
Let's stop talking about that.

263
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,190
Okay, okay. Let's all forget about that after tonight.

264
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,080
Yes, Mom. Let's stop.

265
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,200
That's right. All of you, don't bring this up in front of Dan Dan.

266
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,010
We are partying to have fun.

267
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,360
Yes, Grandma.

268
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,100
Yes, we will do as you say.

269
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,920
How come Dan Dan isn't here yet?

270
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,140
Oh, she's here.

271
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,130
You are all here.

272
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,770
Even my aunt is here!

273
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,750
Come on in, Dan Dan.

274
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,210
Is today a special day?

275
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,810
Our restaurant is going well, so we thought we should get together.

276
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,810
Please sit, Dan Dan.

277
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:23,240
Now that she's here, let's start grilling the meat.

278
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,290
Please sit, Dan Dan. Dae Beom will cook them nicely for you.

279
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,700
- Yes, Uncle.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

280
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,730
Why aren't you doing it, Geon?

281
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,340
Since we are all here together,

282
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,290
let's make a toast.

283
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,490
That sounds good.

284
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,770
To our family's love and happiness!

285
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:44,730
Cheers!

286
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,040
It's tasty.

287
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,960
Why don't you grill, Dae Beom?

288
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,110
Eat a lot, everyone.

289
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,950
Chairman!

290
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,960
Why, Ms. Park?

291
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,150
♫ It reminds me of that person's touch ♫

292
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,830
What am I doing?

293
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,960
Have I gone crazy?

294
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:56,590
♫ My beautiful love ♫

295
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:04,420
♫ It seems like love is bitter ♫

296
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:09,090
♫ The more I try to grasp it, the further it gets ♫

297
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,610
Chairman, I'm not crossing the line with this.

298
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:16,930
I bought a gift for you while I was buying it for my family.

299
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:19,510
When I was going through the most difficult time,

300
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:25,800
I received the warmest and the biggest comfort from you. It gave me lots of strength.

301
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,860
So I prepared this to thank you, even if it's small.

302
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:35,750
Please use it when you need to refresh your mood while you work.

303
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:40,360
Chairman. Thank you very much.

304
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:47,510
♫ But love always runs away, chased by longing ♫

305
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:54,040
♫ It would be nice  ♫

306
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,900
♫ to take a break ♫

307
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,080
Se Jong. Did you wake up while sleeping?

308
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,460
Yes, Dad. I want to sleep with you tonight.

309
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:26,530
Wow, that's very interesting and pretty! What is that?

310
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,900
It's a music box.

311
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,720
A music box? Can I have it?

312
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,890
I think my girlfriend will like it.

313
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,800
What? Do you want to give this to your girlfriend?

314
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,840
Yes, Dad. You will give it to me, right?

315
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,440
I can't, Se Jong. It's a gift from a friend.

316
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,290
If you really want one, I will buy you one similar to this.

317
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:59,560
I like that one. Why don't you get a new one?

318
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,810
I'm sorry, Se Jong. This is precious to me.

319
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:10,480
Okay, then. I don't want to sleep with you anymore.

320
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,550
Se Jong...

321
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:22,440
But still, that's not right. It was a gift.

322
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:31,160
Se Jong. Where have you been? Did you have a bad dream?

323
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,190
That's not it.

324
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:38,880
I woke up, so I was going to sleep with my dad but just came back.

325
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,210
I'm mad at my dad.

326
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,240
Why? Why are you mad at him?

327
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:51,920
I asked him to give me his toy with music coming out, but he said no.

328
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,290
Do you mean by the music box?

329
00:23:53,290 --> 00:24:00,730
Yes, a music box. My dad said it's precious to him, so he won't give it to me. He's so mean.

330
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:28,120
Chairman, thank you for saying the music box I gave you is precious to you.

331
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:33,710
I'm moved by how you expressed your feelings for me.

332
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,210
What is she saying?

333
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,380
Ms. Park, I guess Se Jong said something to you.

334
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:49,220
But it's not right to give away a gift that you received.

335
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,700
I used that expression in the manner of education.

336
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,580
So please don't misunderstand.

337
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:05,100
He denies it after his feelings got revealed again.

338
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,830
I almost thought you crossed the line again.

339
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:16,400
If you say you didn't, that's fine. Goodnight.

340
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,300
Why did I use that expression?

341
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,860
Ms. Park is driving me crazy.

342
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:39,120
Hello. Can you hand this to CEO Anna Kim in apartment 1801?

343
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,290
Is that so?

344
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,810
She's coming right over there.

345
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:50,910
CEO! Hello.

346
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:54,500
Ms. Park. What brings you here?

347
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:59,590
I came to give you this gift.

348
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,970
I told you it's okay.

349
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,140
Thank you anyway.

350
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:13,460
CEO Anna. Let me buy you coffee. I have something to say to you.

351
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,700
Would it be okay if you told me here?

352
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:21,180
I have no time to go to a cafe at the moment.

353
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,700
Well...

354
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,560
I've done wrong to you, CEO Anna.

355
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,810
You've been taken good care of me.

356
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:36,220
But I said I would go to the US and changed my mind.

357
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:41,360
And then I came and asked you to find my mom.

358
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,210
I'm truly sorry.

359
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,980
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

360
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,440
It was beyond my capacity.

361
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:02,290
It's okay. I decided to stop looking for my mom.

362
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:06,600
So please don't feel bad about it.

363
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,150
I'm sorry for all sorts of different things.

364
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,680
Right.

365
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,090
I've recruited someone else,

366
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:24,290
so you don't have to worry about anything and be well.

367
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:27,930
I will accept this gift gratefully.

368
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:31,500
When do you leave for the US, CEO Anna?

369
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,330
Maybe in two weeks?

370
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:38,660
In two weeks? That quick?

371
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,010
Yes, things worked out that way.

372
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:46,000
I would like to buy you a meal before you go.

373
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,920
No, it's okay. I'm busy, and so are you.

374
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:57,690
It's enough that we saw each other like this. Please stay healthy and well.

375
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:02,960
I have to go in because I am busy. Goodbye.

376
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:35,350
CEO Anna. I'm sorry I can't go to the US with you.

377
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:41,540
To think that we will have to say goodbye to each other soon makes me feel sad.

378
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:45,520
For treating me warmly and loving me like a mom,

379
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,200
I will never forget for the rest of my life.

380
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,590
CEO Anna. Thank you for everything.

381
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:56,360
What do I do with my Dan Dan?

382
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,270
Dad.

383
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:25,450
Dan Dan! What are you doing here at this hour?

384
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:29,180
I just came by because I was out running errands.

385
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,250
Did something happen?

386
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:42,050
The thing is, Dad...

387
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:44,070
it's about CEO Anna.

388
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,130
She's acting a little strange.

389
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,270
I think she's really mad at me.

390
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:53,860
She doesn't treat me like she used to anymore.

391
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,210
Why?

392
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,410
She gave me a good opportunity,

393
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:00,370
but since I told her I couldn't go to the US anymore...

394
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:04,650
I think I disappointed her a lot.

395
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,210
Why did you even go there?

396
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,660
She saw you in the past because she needed you.

397
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:15,300
But she's hired someone else now, so she must feel uncomfortable seeing you.

398
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:19,340
Don't make her uncomfortable by going to see her or contacting her from now on.

399
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,790
There's no reason to see her anymore.

400
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:32,460
But strangely...

401
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,240
I feel so sad.

402
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,130
Regardless of everything else,

403
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,720
I thought CEO Anna and I...

404
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,140
I thought we had a special relationship.

405
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,970
She treated me so well.

406
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:50,360
I guess I unknowingly relied on her a lot.

407
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:55,080
She said she'll be leaving to the US two weeks later.

408
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:01,560
It's strange, but I feel incredibly heartbroken.

409
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:10,150
I wonder if she was unknowingly drawn to her mom?

410
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:13,520
Dan Dan.

411
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,450
She's a businesswoman.

412
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,430
She only meets people for business reasons.

413
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:21,210
You won't ever see her again,

414
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:27,240
so just think you met a good person in your life and forget about her. Okay?

415
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:45,600
Seeing my Seung Ho and Se Ryun together like this,

416
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,210
they look really good together.

417
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:53,010
Maybe it's because they liked each other when they were studying abroad together?

418
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:57,990
I completely agree. Just looking at them makes me happy. They're a perfect match, as people say these days.

419
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:00,030
This should've happened sooner.

420
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:02,000
But they both took too many detours.

421
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,930
When I asked Seung Ho,

422
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:08,680
I heard that the two of them go golfing, horseback riding, and look at art together.

423
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:12,790
I would like her to continue seeing my Seung Ho happily like now.

424
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,530
What do you think, Mrs. Wang?

425
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:18,260
I would love that!

426
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:22,510
The more I look at Seung Ho, he's so dependable. Just looking at him makes me happy.

427
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:26,780
I've only seen him a handful of times, but he feels like my son.

428
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,580
Thank you, Mother.

429
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,690
"Mother?" Oh my, he said, "Mother!"

430
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,720
"Mother!"

431
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:39,360
Shall the four of us go golfing all together once?

432
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,540
I'd love that! I think that'll be so fun if the four of us go.

433
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,580
Shall we do cheers to that then?

434
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:51,570
I hope things work out well between the two of you.

435
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:55,160
I have to drop Se Ryun off, so just water for me.

436
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,510
I like that!

437
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:08,320
Hey! Until when are you going to cling onto my Se Ryun?

438
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,220
Until when are you going to ruin her future like this?

439
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,680
What should we do?

440
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,470
It's so tough for us.

441
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,180
Mom.

442
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,740
I don't know if it's because that young lady, Se Ryun, isn't coming by anymore.

443
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,830
But Dae Beom seems low-spirited.

444
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,080
She was doing everything in her power

445
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,920
to gain Son-in-law Park's approval to marry Dae Beom for a while.

446
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,400
Did they break up?

447
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,190
Do you think so?

448
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:02,050
Hold on! Did that lady dump our Dae Beom then?

449
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:04,970
I guess she did...

450
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:06,500
It's delivery for Donghae Apartment.

451
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,510
All right. Hey, Dae Beom.

452
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:13,680
Why hasn't that young lady, Se Ryun, come by these days?

453
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,440
She's not coming because of you.

454
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,520
Se Ryun was trying to do her best.

455
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,220
You made her feel terrible whenever she made a mistake.

456
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,860
Would you want to come if it were you?

457
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,260
Oh, gosh! Check out this guy!

458
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,370
Dae Beom got mad at me just now, right, Mom?

459
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:32,740
Of course, he is. He's saying she's not coming because of you.

460
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:38,830
I think Dae Beom really likes that young lady, seeing how he's acting.

461
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:43,380
Was I too harsh to her? Being older isn't a big deal.

462
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:48,160
Don't you think it's better for Dae Beom to marry a daughter from a rich family, Mom?

463
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,590
That's a no-brainer!

464
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:54,630
Regardless of everything, the most important thing is that Dae Beom likes her.

465
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,330
You're right.

466
00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:01,230
I should've been treating that good luck charm like a princess. What have I done?

467
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,640
Is it too late for me to go run after her and make things right?

468
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,010
- Gosh!
- What if they broke up because of me?

469
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:09,040
Please just feign ignorance and don't do anything!

470
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,710
If they're meant to be, it'll happen.

471
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:16,560
If they're not, no magic in the world will help. That's destiny.

472
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,480
Thank you for driving me to the door.

473
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,740
Why would you thank me for something that's a given?

474
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:45,780
Se Ryun. Can I have a cup of tea at your place?

475
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:49,210
Also, I want to check out your place.

476
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:51,180
Next time.

477
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,950
All right. You have to let me up next time.

478
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:57,360
Oh, right. The painting you liked at the gallery,

479
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,580
it'll arrive at your place the day after tomorrow.

480
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:04,300
What? Gosh, that's too much.

481
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,290
No, I can't take that.

482
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:09,100
It's just a gift I'm giving to you.

483
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:13,670
I want to repay you for how I hurt you in the past.

484
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:17,120
If looking at that painting makes you happy,

485
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,410
I think that will make me very happy too.

486
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:24,310
All right. Thank you, friend.

487
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,990
- Drive safe back home.
- Okay.

488
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:31,480
- What am I looking at right now?
- All right.

489
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,420
What is she doing right now? Hey!

490
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,500
Hey!!

491
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,850
Oh, my goodness. Look at you.

492
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,630
I knew you'd do this.

493
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:46,370
How could you do this to Dae Beom?

494
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,040
Are you cheating on him?

495
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,150
Se Ryun. Who is this Ajumma?

496
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,110
I'm sorry, Seung Ho.

497
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:57,630
I'll explain everything later. Hurry up and go.

498
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,980
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

499
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,620
What are you two?

500
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,960
Answer me!

501
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,310
Let him go!

502
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:06,300
He's my friend.

503
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,460
Don't be rude to my friend.

504
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,600
W-what?

505
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,620
Oh, my goodness, how unbelievable!

506
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:19,120
How dare you blabber like that when you're cheating on my Dae Beom?

507
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,130
Hey! You've been flattering us, saying that you like Dae Beom, who was way younger than you.

508
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:25,370
What are you doing right now, you evil girl!

509
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,540
That's not it.

510
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,730
He's my friend, a long-time friend.

511
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,220
"Friend?"

512
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,250
There's no such thing as friends between men and women.

513
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:38,350
You were hugging just now!

514
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:41,020
Hurry up and leave, Seung Ho. I'm begging you.

515
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,650
All right. I'll talk to you later.

516
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:46,380
- Hey!! You!!
- Mother!

517
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,250
He's really my friend!

518
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,330
- That's all he is!
- Friend, my foot!

519
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,660
- Hey!
- Mother!

520
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,380
That guy...

521
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,460
Seriously!

522
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:01,620
You! This is why I told you not to play with Dae Beom.

523
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,960
Do you think you can do anything with money?

524
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,510
You messed with Dae Beom's heart when he was trying to give his best in life.

525
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:10,080
You were trying to impress us so hard to become our daughter-in-law.

526
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,360
It turns out you're a total two-faced.

527
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:18,420
Don't you ever show up in front of my Dae Beom again.

528
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:23,120
I'm the crazy wench who brought over side dishes to feed you!

529
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,690
Mother!

530
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:35,550
What do I do...

531
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,570
You idiot!

532
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,210
What's wrong, Mom? That hurt.

533
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:44,690
You pushover! I told you not to hang out with her!

534
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,950
I said she would dump you after she had her fun with you!

535
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:50,130
Do you know that she's seeing another guy now or not?

536
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,530
What are you saying, Mom?

537
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:58,440
I went over to give her these side dishes, and I saw her with another guy!

538
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,750
Oh, that guy?

539
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:04,840
I know him too. He's Se Ryun's friend. She wouldn't do that.

540
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,950
"Friend?" Who hugs their friend so affectionately like that?

541
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,660
End it with her.

542
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:14,010
I can't watch you get hurt by her anymore.

543
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:18,000
It's better to end it like this than have anxiety over when she'll leave you.

544
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,660
She just wanted to have a taste of ramen because she got bored of steak.

545
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,910
That's the kind of girl she is. So just forget her and end it, all right?

546
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,840
I said she's not like that!

547
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,230
Why are you doing this when you don't even know the details?

548
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:32,650
Don't talk about her like that!

549
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:35,690
Hey, Dae Beom! Dae Beom!!

550
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:40,250
Gosh, what do I do with him?

551
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,120
Se Ryun... My mom said something strange earlier.

552
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,640
Is it true?

553
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,440
It's true.

554
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,800
It's the friend you saw last time.

555
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,050
Why do you keep meeting that friend?

556
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,650
It's not because I'm suspicious of you...

557
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:02,710
I was going to call you, Dae Beom.

558
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,630
I have something to tell you.

559
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:07,660
Something to tell me? What is it?

560
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:11,570
I love you, Dae Beom.

561
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:15,630
That's why I wanted to be together and do everything with you.

562
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:20,210
But because you said it's hard for you to conform to me,

563
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:24,750
I tried to fit with you. I tried working part-time at your store

564
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:29,420
and tried my best to get close to your family as well.

565
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:33,320
But just as it's hard for you to conform to me,

566
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,830
it's so hard for me to conform to you too.

567
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,120
What?

568
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,010
Which is why...

569
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:45,650
Since it's so tough for both of us,

570
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:48,890
there's only one choice left.

571
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,870
I'll cut ties with my family.

572
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:53,000
You also cut ties with your family.

573
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,860
It'll just be the two of us.

574
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,220
What do you think?

575
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,680
Se Ryun...

576
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,070
I'll do whatever you want, Dae Beom.

577
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:04,100
If you want to open a café at Gangnam Station, I will!

578
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,050
Or if you want me to open a gym for you, I'll do that too!

579
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,680
If you don't like any of that...

580
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:16,890
let's go live abroad, just you and I. What do you think?

581
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:21,380
I can't keep going on like this anymore.

582
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:25,220
So you decide on what to do, Dae Beom.

583
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:28,130
I'll follow your decision.

584
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,320
Se Ryun...

585
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,600
I tried to do what you did too.

586
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:42,110
Even if you criticize me and say it's petty pride, I won't deny it.

587
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:44,670
But I have to succeed on my own.

588
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:48,130
That's the only way I'll be proud enough to face you and myself.

589
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,980
If I can't do that, our love will be shameful.

590
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:55,790
So, Se Ryun...

591
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:58,480
It may take some time,

592
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:04,350
but can't you understand and wait for me a little?

593
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:09,470
Then let's take some time from each other and think about it.

594
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:12,530
I think that'll be good.

595
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:17,960
All right.

596
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,540
Ta-da!

597
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,350
It's a present for you.

598
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:41,580
Present? Out of nowhere, why?

599
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,970
Just open it.

600
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:45,560
What is it?

601
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,860
Let's see.

602
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,090
Oh, it's a scarf.

603
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:56,240
Your son did really hard work to buy this.

604
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,080
I bought it with the money I earned.

605
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,480
What?

606
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,520
- You bought this with money you earned from hard work?
- Yes.

607
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,090
Mom, try it on.

608
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:08,820
Should I?

609
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:12,880
Ta-da!

610
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,130
Wow.

611
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:18,460
It looks so good on you!

612
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:22,720
Mom, you look like a celebrity wearing this scarf.

613
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,170
Really?

614
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:27,320
I have the prettiest mom.

615
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,300
I'm thankful for the gift,

616
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,190
but you really shouldn't do that tough part-time job--

617
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:34,810
- Mom.
- Yes?

618
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:37,970
I love you. I've got to go.

619
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:39,430
Where are you going?

620
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:43,640
Do you want anything for dinner?

621
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,470
Seriously...

622
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:53,140
Did my son work hard with his baby hands to make money to buy me this scarf?

623
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:57,250
Whoever raised that kid did a fine job.

624
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:01,120
My Joon Oh is all grown up.

625
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:06,840
- It's a scarf.
- What do you think? Do you like it?

626
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,040
Yes. It's so pretty.

627
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:17,000
It's so pretty.

628
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,990
I love it.

629
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:22,100
Since you like it, I feel so good.

630
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,650
I'm seriously so moved.

631
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:28,180
I'm really touched!

632
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:32,580
Joon Oh, thank you.

633
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,930
It looks good on you.

634
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:45,720
Now I'm full.

635
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:50,040
You're the one who called me out to eat, but why aren't you eating?

636
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,940
I ate enough.

637
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:55,280
If we're done eating, should we leave?

638
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,290
Why so early? Since we're out,

639
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:00,690
let's just drink more. Should we go somewhere else?

640
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:02,950
No, no. I'll pass it tonight.

641
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,870
I can't drink another drop.

642
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,530
Jung Woo,

643
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:12,440
should we go watch a late-night movie like old times?

644
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,220
Watch what?

645
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:15,980
The two of us?

646
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,190
- Are you crazy?
- Why not?

647
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:21,190
Guys who are friends can go watch movies together.

648
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:24,280
Do you... have feelings for me?

649
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,180
What're you talking about?

650
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,370
We used to go watch movies all the time.

651
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:31,600
Let's go watch a movie for old times' sake.

652
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:35,900
Chairman, what is it this time?

653
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,240
Just tell me.

654
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,940
I just asked you to go to a movie. But what do you want me to tell you?

655
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:46,320
Hurry up and talk, or else I'm just going to leave.

656
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,040
You're acting like this because of that young lady.

657
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,150
Just go the way your heart leads.

658
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:56,080
- And go watch that movie with that lady.
- Hey.

659
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,790
Jung Woo.

660
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:04,520
The thing is...

661
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,500
I've been trying to wrap things up,

662
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,190
but it's harder than I thought.

663
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:11,450
I thought I had gotten over her,

664
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:15,150
but then I kept showing my feelings to her.

665
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,690
I told her not to cross the line,

666
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:21,870
but then I crossed it.

667
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:25,110
If you want to wrap it up, you just do it.

668
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:27,650
Why can't you do it?

669
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:30,690
It'd be easier if I didn't see her,

670
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,590
but it's a problem since I see her every day.

671
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:37,880
Do you have feelings for Mrs. Yeoju?

672
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,050
What?

673
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:43,350
I'm joking, joking.

674
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:47,800
It's that young lady, your kids' tutor.

675
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,390
It's Ms. Park, isn't it?

676
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:55,940
I'm right. I nailed it.

677
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:58,500
I never even thought of Ms. Park.

678
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:02,190
Why didn't I think of Ms. Park?

679
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:06,340
Jung Woo.

680
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:09,660
What do I do now?

681
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,610
What's so difficult?

682
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:13,440
She says she likes you,

683
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,560
and you like her that you can't control your feelings.

684
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,580
Who said you guys have to get married right away?

685
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,750
Just go out with her.

686
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:24,550
Go where your heart leads and just date.

687
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:30,660
I'm 41 years old right now.

688
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:33,700
I'm an Ajussi with three kids,

689
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,300
and she's a 27 years old young lady.

690
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,790
But you are telling me to just go out with her?

691
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:42,220
Why not? It's not illegal.

692
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:46,070
It's fine. Just do it.

693
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:08,610
Please use this. It's raining pretty hard.

694
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:11,230
Thank you very much. Here's your key.

695
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:35,650
Ms. Park, where are you coming from at this hour?

696
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:39,760
I had to buy worksheets for the kids, and I also needed to buy some books.

697
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,200
But then it started raining all of a sudden, so it was hard to grab a taxi.

698
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,180
That's why I'm late.

699
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:47,550
Give that to me.

700
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:49,930
It's okay. It's not heavy.

701
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:51,880
Just give it to me.

702
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,300
Let's go inside.

703
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,300
Chairman, your clothes are wet.

704
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,130
I am okay.

705
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:12,340
If you get wet, you'll catch a cold.

706
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:15,550
That's the same for you too.

707
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:19,640
Let's use the umbrella together!

708
00:49:57,450 --> 00:50:02,350
Ms. Park, what did you do just now?

709
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:09,250
That was..! Without realizing it..!

710
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:12,240
I didn't do it on purpose.

711
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,320
Out of nowhere, your face was beaming,

712
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,640
and you looked very handsome, and because I like you very much.

713
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,440
Without realizing it, I did that.

714
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:25,650
Ms. Park, I said don't cross the line with each other.

715
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,140
If two people who like each other kiss, is that crossing the line?

716
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:33,590
Chairman, you like me, too.

717
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:37,300
When did I say I like you?

718
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:42,000
I clearly told you that I don't have any feelings for you.

719
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,450
Chairman! Please don't say this kind of lie to me again.

720
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:49,680
You like me as well, which is why your heart pounds when you see me.

721
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:55,710
And when I'm going through tough times, you want to hug and comfort me.

722
00:50:55,710 --> 00:51:00,380
I will say it to you clearly. Please don't act like that again.

723
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:04,950
How can we live in the same house if you keep crossing the line like this?

724
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:08,770
I only think of you as my kids' teacher,

725
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:11,310
so just know that.

726
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,340
What? He doesn't like me?

727
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:23,320
He says he doesn't like me, but he covers me with the umbrella while I'm arguing with him.

728
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,580
Then he gets wet from all the rain.

729
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:31,230
He does all that and expects me to believe he doesn't like me?

730
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:36,310
♫ Even now, I remember your memories ♫

731
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:40,680
♫ Your name in my memory ♫

732
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:44,120
♫ comes back to me in a smile ♫

733
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,970
Was I too harsh?

734
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:50,760
Since I was so upset,

735
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:56,940
I probably really hurt Ms. Park's feelings.

736
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:00,140
No.

737
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:04,790
I had to be firm so she'd change her mind.

738
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:09,390
♫ I want to take you out on this cozy day ♫

739
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:14,420
♫ It gets deeper at the end of the day ♫

740
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,050
♫ I think of you a lot more ♫

741
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:19,680
Ms. Park, I said don't cross the line with each other.

742
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,950
♫ All night long, in my heart that has you in it ♫

743
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:26,910
Did he hate it that much that I kissed him?

744
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:33,010
No, it was because he was surprised.

745
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:36,320
Park Dan Dan, it's true that you made a mistake.

746
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:44,400
Even if he likes you, if you kiss him suddenly, of course, he'd be surprised.

747
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,050
Why did I kiss him? Why?

748
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:51,900
♫  I'll always be by your side  ♫

749
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:55,990
Chairman.

750
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:04,670
What is it? What's going on again?

751
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:11,810
Chairman, I didn't sleep the whole night and thought about it.

752
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:20,620
Since you keep rejecting me, it hurts my pride for me to keep saying, "I like you."

753
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:25,930
So I won't do that anymore.

754
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:31,450
Okay. You made the right decision.

755
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:38,710
But of all the countless encounters I've had with you until now,

756
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:43,640
there's one thing I regret the most.

757
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:48,820
When you were 22 years old, you said if I like you, please come to Namsan,

758
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:52,140
and if I did, you said you wouldn't get engaged.

759
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:57,020
But I went all the way there then turned around.

760
00:53:57,020 --> 00:54:06,630
That day, that moment is something I regret until now.

761
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:11,560
So much so that I still dream about going to Namsan.

762
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:16,250
So as the last thing, I want to give you this opportunity.

763
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:19,900
In case you'd live with regret just like I do.

764
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:23,500
What opportunity..?

765
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:27,130
Chairman, if you have feelings for me,

766
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:31,010
please come to Namsan tonight at 8 PM.

767
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:34,120
I will wait until you come.

768
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:39,420
If you don't come,

769
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:46,360
I will cut off my feelings for you and I'll leave here in two months when my contract ends.

770
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:51,530
It's tonight 8 PM at Namsan.

771
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:07,030
Dae Beom, what's the occasion?

772
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:12,210
You wanted to meet me at this kind of place, so I'm curious.

773
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:16,160
I feel like I didn't treat you to a great meal before.

774
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:23,770
Until now, you always treated me to nice meals. But I only bought you street foods.

775
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:28,080
So today, I wanted to treat you to a nice meal.

776
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:32,510
Se Ryun, what do you like to eat? Please order everything you want.

777
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:36,530
Okay!

778
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:37,890
It's great.

779
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:40,670
Who picked this place?

780
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,520
It's very pretty here, isn't it?

781
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,300
It's nice here.

782
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,520
The ambiance here is so nice.

783
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,710
Right?

784
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:49,950
It's so pretty.

785
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:53,010
Let's order this one, too.

786
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:57,470
Why are Dae Beom and Se Ryun together?

787
00:55:57,470 --> 00:56:00,210
What's going on?

788
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:03,170
Mrs. Jang, what do you think of course A?

789
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:06,990
I have urgent business to take care of, so I need to go.

790
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:10,280
I will treat you guys to a great meal next time.

791
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,790
I am sorry, I'll get going first.

792
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:13,440
Oh no, that's too bad.

793
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,670
Did something happen?

794
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:24,600
I'm excited about the food. This place looks so nice.

795
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,880
That's definitely Se Ryun.

796
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,290
She is definitely Mrs.Wang's daughter Se Ryun.

797
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:34,640
But what is her relationship with Dae Beom? Why are they so close?

798
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:38,070
Se Ryun says that's not the case,

799
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:42,740
but that bastard who was our driver planned it out and ordered his son

800
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:46,060
to trick and lure my daughter Se Ryun.

801
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:50,030
No way.

802
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:53,450
Then that father is my Soo Chul,

803
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:57,710
and that son is our Dae Beom?

804
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:59,800
No way!

805
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:02,640
It's not possible.

806
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:07,470
We were going through rough financial times.

807
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:10,560
So when Soo Chul worked as a driver at that house,

808
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:14,780
I didn't have any place to go, so I stayed a little bit at their back house.

809
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:21,150
But Se Ryun and Dae Beom were dating already, which we didn't know.

810
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:25,950
But Se Ryun's mom... I mean, that Madam

811
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:29,190
accused us as if we approached Se Ryun on purpose

812
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:33,570
as if we planned it from the beginning and Soo Chul got work in that house.

813
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:36,600
She called us a family of parasites.

814
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:41,130
She really stepped all over our pride.

815
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:45,130
And because of that, Son-in-law Park got fired from that job as well.

816
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:47,520
My Soo Chul?

817
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:53,660
Out of my entire life, I've never witnessed such a terrible thing.

818
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:59,920
Oh my goodness, the family Madam Wang kept calling parasites

819
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:04,260
was my brother and nephew?

820
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:07,720
How could this happen?

821
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:14,630
But how do you know Se Ryun?

822
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:18,980
What? Oh...

823
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:22,130
I just know her a little bit.

824
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:32,990
Se Ryun.

825
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:40,670
What's with the flowers?

826
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:42,690
I left them at the counter.

827
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:44,990
Here, it's for you.

828
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:51,010
Flowers on top of the nice meal, I feel suspicious...

829
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:59,620
It's a farewell gift.

830
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:03,280
What?

831
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,620

Dae Beom.

833
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:10,510
Se Ryun, we already know.

834
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:15,780
We had made up our minds about each other.

835

Let's be honest with each other.

I can't go to you, and you can't come to me.

Ms. Park, do you have a pencil lead?

01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:20,500
It's in the top drawer of my desk.

But, where are you? Why haven't you come home yet?

Well... I'm at Namsan.

865
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:39,660
I have plans, so I'm waiting.

867
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:45,370
Ms. Park, it's cold. Don't just keep waiting, and call them.

01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:48,370
If they can't come, just come home.

Yes.

Where's Ms. Park?

875
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:11,720
She said she's in Namsan.

Namsan? This late?

877
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:28,140
It's past 11. Why hasn't she come home yet?

878
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:32,020
Could she still be waiting?

879
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:33,720
Yes?

880
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:36,800

Dad, there's a problem.

Ms. Park hasn't come home yet.

884
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:47,230
I talked with her earlier, around 9 o'clock,

885
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:50,670
and she said she had plans in Namsan and was waiting for someone.

886
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:56,030
But it got so late that I tried to call her, but she's not picking up.

887
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:58,180
Do you think something happened?

888
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:01,070
Is she not picking up the phone?

889
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:10,540
The person you are trying to call's phone is turned off. Please leave a message after the beep.

890
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:14,980
Dad, do you think something bad happened to her?

891
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:17,910
Jenny, don't worry. Go upstairs and get some sleep.

892
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:20,020
