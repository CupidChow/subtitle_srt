[Episode 45]

2
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,470
Going down.

3
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,920
The door is closing.

4
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,990
Ms. Park. Please get on.

5
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:58,200
Ms. Park, don't worry.

6
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,460
I'm here.

7
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,720
Chairman.

8
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,480
It's okay. It's alright.

9
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,890
Nothing will happen.

10
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,720
Chairman.

11
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:21,660
♫  When I walk this road, it makes me cry  ♫

12
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:28,450
♫ It reminds me of that person's touch ♫

13
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,640
♫ I couldn't hold her  ♫

14
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,670
I'm sorry, Ms. Park.

15
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,360
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,960
No. No. Don't be.

17
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,480
I'm the one who's sorry.

18
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,970
I trust you, Chairman.

19
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,430
I know you are not a person who'll do that.

20
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:56,240
So please don't say I should forget about you.

21
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,780
Ms. Park.

22
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,680
I know you are strong.

23
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,080
You can do it well.

24
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,450
Please forget about me and live strong.

25
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:23,290
Don't cry for someone like me.

26
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,180
I beg you, please.

27
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,910
I don't want to. No.

28
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,610
♫  But love always runs away, chased by longing  ♫

29
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:41,640
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

30
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,630
Go, Dae Beom!

31
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,420
Park Dae Beom!

32
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:55,180
Park Dae Beom! Park Dae Beom!

33
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,930
Park Dae Beom! Congratulations!

34
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,860
Thank you!

35
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,860
Bon Voyage!

36
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,840
That brat, Lee Se Ryun...

37
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:17,930
I couldn't help but come to the wedding.

38
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,480
Have a happy life.

39
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,630
But Noona, you should have held yourself back.

40
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,680
When we had all our guests.

41
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,840
How could I hold back myself at that circumstance?

42
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,790
She called you a fraudulent parasitic family.

43
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,220
And she called me the pillar of frauds.

44
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,110
Hey, I can withstand someone name calling me,

45
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,350
but not if they curse at you.

46
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,570
Sister-in-law, it's okay. Well done.

47
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,210
It didn't affect the wedding.

48
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,750
Now they did the wedding.

49
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,660
Se Ryun is on our team now, so don't worry.

50
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,700
What do you mean, she's on our team?

51
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,820
I mean, Se Ryun is ours now.

52
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,740
She's our darling daughter-in-law now.

53
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,370
I didn't know you would be this happy.

54
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:10,390
I know. She said how old Se Ryun was and was not happy about her even yesterday.

55
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:14,620
There is something mysterious about you.

56
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,380
What is it?

57
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,250
- Is there something?
- What?

58
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,890
There's nothing. Dae Beom likes her so much.

59
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,350
How could I say no when he loves her that much?

60
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,510
I would hear so much resentment if I opposed them until the end.

61
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,310
Right, Older-sister-in-law?

62
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,640
Yes, she's your daughter-in-law now.

63
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,770
Besides, if you get on the bad side of your daughter-in-law,

64
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,290
you'll never see the grandchildren nowadays.

65
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,910
So, you cannot get on their bad side no matter what.

66
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:51,360
That's right. Now that Se Ryun is our daughter-in-law,

67
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,670
her head to toe is adorable.

68
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,080
So please, be good to Se Ryun, Honey.

69
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,710
Right, please be good to her.

70
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,110
And, Lady-in-law. Please look at her in good light.

71
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,820
Of course, now that they are married, what can I do?

72
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,450
But you must be happy, Doctor.

73
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,890
When you bring your lady home someday,

74
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,600
your mother will not oppose her for sure.

75
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,710
Of course. Nowadays, if they like each other, that's all it matters.

76
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,970
Really?

77
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,410
Mom, would you approve if I like her?

78
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,140
What's this?

79
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,610
Do you have a woman?

80
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,590
Pardon?

81
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:43,200
I'm just asking.

82
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,790
Oh, my goodness.

83
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,820
Our Joon Oh doesn't have a girlfriend yet.

84
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,770
He hasn't even figured out his future yet.

85
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,330
What do you mean, a girlfriend?

86
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,200
But, I don't see Dan Dan.

87
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,670
Right, I don't see her.

88
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,600
Is she in her room?

89
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,830
Just leave her alone, imagine how she feels.

90
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,090
She came to the wedding since it was her brother's wedding.

91
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:15,000
But she had to endure all of that family member that she didn't want to see.

92
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,930
Ms. Park.

93
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:37,920
I know you are strong.

94
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,870
You can do it well.

95
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,180
Please forget about me and live strong.

96
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:52,940
Please don't cry for someone like me.

97
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,100
I beg you, please.

98
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,180
Without you, Ms. Park,

99
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,450
I'm sad,

100
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,230
and I don't even want to eat.

101
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,750
And I can't sleep.

102
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,700
Se Jong, I haven't gone far.

103
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,500
When we want to, we can see each other at any time.

104
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,520
So, Se Jong.

105
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,630
Please eat well and sleep well.

106
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,040
If you don't,

107
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,930
I will be too sad.

108
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,210
Chief Jo Ajumma.

109
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,460
Please knock before you come in.

110
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,810
I'm sorry. I will do that next time.

111
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,100
I've brought cake and milk.

112
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,180
It's your favorite, the chocolate cake.

113
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,800
I don't feel like eating now.

114
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,590
I'll eat it later.

115
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,280
Okay. Let's do that.

116
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,900
Did you wash your hands?

117
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,700
No, I didn't.

118
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,140
You have to wash your hands and brush your teeth when you come home from outside.

119
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,460
Let's go. I'll help you.

120
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,320
I don't want to!

121
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,680
Please don't bother me.

122
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:55,290
I'm sorry. I nagged you again. It's my mistake.

123
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,050
Se Jong.

124
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:04,260
I love that I can see you every day like this from now on.

125
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,820
I am so happy.

126
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:11,420
How do you feel about it, Se Jong?

127
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,190
Do you feel the same?

128
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm tired. I will rest.

129
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,770
Right, okay.

130
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,660
Have some rest.

131
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,980
Have some good rest.

132
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,160
Right.

133
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,870
Let's not be impatient.

134
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,500
It's good enough I can see Se Jong every day.

135
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,830
Okay, I like it better now.

136
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,350
What are you doing here?

137
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,540
While I've been gone, everything here has turned into a mess.

138
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:25,060
I put the ones out of trend or worn out over here, so please throw them all out.

139
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:30,580
Jo Sarah. I'm the butler in this house, not you.

140
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:35,410
But how dare you come into Chairman's room without permission and do things on your own?

141
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:40,640
Chief Kim, what do you mean, how dare I come here?

142
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,700
I'm pregnant with Chairman's baby. I'm his fiancée.

143
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,670
But me coming into his room is something for you to reprimand me?

144
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,660
Yes, I am reprimanding you.

145
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:57,740
To come into Chairman's room and touch his things without his permission when he's not here.

146
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,900
This is very inappropriate behavior. Please refrain from doing this from now on.

147
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,570
Look here, Chief Kim.

148
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:09,500
I am the Chairman's fiancée, who's pregnant with his child. How dare you talk to me like that?

149
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,650
What's going on? What happened? Why are you so loud again?

150
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:19,040
Madam, I'm so shocked I am speechless.

151
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,910
Why? Did Chief Kim say something?

152
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:29,020
I came into Chairman's room to organize and see if he needed anything.

153
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:34,370
But she said me coming into this room is inappropriate. It's ridiculous.

154
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,900
Oh, my...

155
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,230
Chief Kim. Chief Jo is someone who will be the lady of the house soon.

156
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,080
She will be the owner of this room.

157
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,810
Please let her take care of Chairman Lee's affairs from now.

158
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:53,860
I can't let her do so. I've never received such orders from the Chairman.

159
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,060
Therefore, I would like you both to leave the room.

160
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,710
And please don't come into this room without permission in the future.

161
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,620
Hey, Chief Kim!

162
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,020
I have no other choice.

163
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:13,190
Jo Sarah and the Madam entered the Chairman's room without permission.

164
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,660
The Madam insisted on being in the room. And the state of the room is...

165
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:22,580
Hey, Chief Jo, let's go out. Put that away.

166
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,140
That treacherous subject!

167
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,420
What's up with that woman, Chief Kim?

168
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:39,410
How much of a joke does she think of me for her to act like that?

169
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,670
That makes me angry.

170
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:57,810
My friend made a mistake toward the woman he's going to marry.

171
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:02,150
So to make her feel better, he decided to make a grand marriage proposal, so he took her to his vacation home.

172
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:07,970
So they could do kisses and things. But...

173
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:14,520
Instead of that, he ended up pushing the woman away.

174
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,320
He pushed her?

175
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,060
Yes, I didn't mean to.

176
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:28,180
I mean, my friend did it. And he's asking me what he should do.

177
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,360
I feel so sorry.

178
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,830
What should I do?

179
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:39,000
Are you saying it's not you but your friend?

180
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,620
Of course. I'd never do such a thing. It's my friend's story.

181
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:52,880
She would feel terrible, wouldn't she?

182
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:59,060
But why did your friend push the woman away?

183
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:04,610
I don't know why that's why I'm asking you!

184
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,790
I'm marrying her next month, and I can't even kiss her.

185
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,380
What should I do, honestly?

186
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,030
I mean, what should my friend do?

187
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,830
[Ms. Park]

188
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,660
Chairman.

189
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,940
What are you doing here, Ms. Park?

190
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,730
Were you waiting for me at this hour?

191
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,370
Yes. Because you didn't take my call.

192
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,690
Even then, how could you wait here, not knowing when I'd come home?

193
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,220
Seriously, why are you doing this?

194
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,840
You should've answered my calls then.

195
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:48,860
I had something important to tell you, that's why I waited here.

196
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,860
Ms. Park. We decided to end our relationship.

197
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,020
You told me this when you turned 22 years old.

198
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,660
That you tried to kiss Chief Jo at your vacation home,

199
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,650
but you couldn't, and instead, you pushed her away.

200
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:08,730
You told me that you couldn't understand why you couldn't do it with Chief Jo.

201
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:14,490
You only liked me even when you turned 22-year-old. That's a definite fact.

202
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:20,810
So how could Chief Jo be pregnant with your child? That makes no sense.

203
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:24,270
I believe you hundred percent.

204
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,650
So, let's not break up.

205
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,660
- Why should we break up?
- Ms. Park.

206
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:34,760
Chairman, I think Chief Jo is lying to you.

207
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,480
I don't think her baby is yours.

208
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,230
Ms. Park. What are you saying right now?

209
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:48,700
What woman in the world would lie about her baby in the womb?

210
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:56,550
Are you asking me to deny my own child? Is that what you want from me?

211
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,830
Pardon?

212
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:02,950
I don't know about anything else, but I can't deny my own child.

213
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:07,660
It's a being that will be born because of me and one that I should be responsible for.

214
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:12,210
I cannot impose such injustice on an innocent child.

215
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:16,520
So, please, do not say such a thing.

216
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,690
But still...

217
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:27,480
It couldn't be true. I believe in you.

218
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,180
Ms. Park.

219
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,670
Please do not come to see me again.

220
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:45,310
When I believe in you, why can't you trust yourself?

221
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:50,160
You wouldn't have done that with another woman while you had feelings for me.

222
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,030
You are not someone who would do that.

223
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:59,620
So, please, trust yourself.

224
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,900
Be careful, getting off.

225
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,650
- Let's go.
- It's so awesome.

226
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,570
It was great, wasn't it?

227
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,720
Let's go!

228
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:43,100
Se Ryun, please try this rice drink. I made it myself.

229
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,140
Yes, Mother-in-law.

230
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:54,750
Mother-in-law. It tastes amazing. It's not a rice drink.

231
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,850
But a work of art.

232
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,230
Really? Please have a lot.

233
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,030
Did you enjoy Hawaii?

234
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:06,640
Yes, we loved it. So much so that we didn't want to come back.

235
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,570
What you loved is not Hawaii but the fact that you were alone together.

236
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:14,480
That's right, Grandmother.

237
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:20,780
When could we go to Hawaii?

238
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:24,920
Next time, let's all go together.

239
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,960
I will take you all.

240
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,750
Really? Thank you for saying that.

241
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,390
I'm not just saying it. I'm serious.

242
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,690
Younger-sister-in-law.

243
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:42,010
Thanks to Se Ryun, we will holiday in Hawaii.

244
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:48,460
Since we've all eaten, let's give them the presents. Dae Beom, why don't you bring it?

245
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:54,450
Yes, let's do that. We brought you some gifts.

246
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,820
We've brought you gifts.

247
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,090
You shouldn't have.

248
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:04,460
This is for Grandmother. And this is for Father-in-law.

249
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:09,500
This is for Mother-in-law, and this is for Aunt-in-law.

250
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:16,040
I thought about it a lot and decided on a wallet for everyone.

251
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,940
It's Louis Vuitton!

252
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:23,350
This is the first time I've received a luxury brand gift in my whole life.

253
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,880
I will open it.

254
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:33,840
Honey, this really is a luxury brand's wallet. Why don't you open yours, too?

255
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,110
Wow, yours is stunning, too.

256
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,640
But these would've been very expensive.

257
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,470
Se Ryun, you have good taste. This is totally my style.

258
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:50,930
This is the nicest wallet I've ever had. Thank you, Sister-in-law.

259
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:54,470
Me, too. Thank you, I'll use it well.

260
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:57,390
I love it as well. Thank you!

261
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,360
Wow, I've never received any luxury gift from anyone else.

262
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,850
Thanks to Dae Beom, now I have a luxury brand's wallet.

263
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:08,780
I'm so glad you all like them.

264
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:14,640
Are you sure this is really that famous luxury brand?

265
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,750
It doesn't look much. It's not much different from a 20,000 won wallet from the market.

266
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:24,760
They are even better. Are you sure you weren't ripped off?

267
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:30,780
Mother. Please don't compare but just use it.

268
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:34,640
Okay. I will use it well since you gave it to me.

269
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,050
To express our thanks for the gifts,

270
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,560
let's give them a round of applause.

271
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,120
Thank you!

272
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,470
Our room is small like a mouse's house, isn't it?

273
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:02,550
There aren't any mice this big.

274
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:06,030
Our first room as newlyweds is so cute and pretty.

275
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,710
So cute!!

276
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,620
Do you really think like that?

277
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,420
I feel sorry for making you live in such a small room.

278
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,440
Dae Beom, what are you saying?

279
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,720
I am really happy now.

280
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,240
When will I experience something like this if not now?

281
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,160
Also, it's better if it's small.

282
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,300
I can stay closer to you like this.

283
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,270
My baby!!

284
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,150
I can't breathe!

285
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,770
- Do you like me that much?
- Yes.

286
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,460
I like you so much.

287
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,260
And I am very thankful to you.

288
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,050
I am also thankful to you.

289
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,990
Thank you for marrying me.

290
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,490
Se Ryun, you forgot-- Oh, my!

291
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,400
Mom!

292
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,890
I mean, Se Ryun left her purse, so...

293
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:15,360
Mom! This is a newlyweds room! Knock before you enter.

294
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:21,200
I'm sorry. Sorry. Continue where you left off, okay?

295
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,750
Oh my, I'm so embarrassed.

296
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,950
There's no stopping my mom, really.

297
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:34,000
By the way, are you sure we don't have to go visit your family?

298
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,280
You know how it is at my house right now.

299
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,780
I talked on the phone with my brother and said we'd see each other later.

300
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,330
By the way, we're so happy like this now,

301
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:50,210
but I felt so sorry seeing Dan Dan earlier.

302
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:54,310
But Dan Dan is a stronger person than I thought.

303
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:58,870
Yes, she's always strong. Even when she falls, she brushes it off and gets back up.

304
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:03,000
I used to get a lot of nose bleeds from getting beat up by her.

305
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,620
What? For real?

306
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,440
Se Ryun, don't start a fight with her.

307
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,880
She did a lot of sports.

308
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,000
My baby, a single punch could make you fly away.

309
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,650
Really?

310
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:18,440
- Okay. I'll be careful.
- Good idea.

311
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,860
Yes, come in.

312
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,550
Chairman,

313
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:40,480
there's something I want to discuss with you.

314
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:45,370
I have to live in this house from now on,

315
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:50,740
but my position in this house is not very clear.

316
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,320
What do you mean?

317
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,750
I don't know if Chief Kim has reported this to you,

318
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,930
but I had some problems with Chief Kim.

319
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:05,330
I just wanted to take care of you like I used to,

320
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:08,990
so I went into your room to clean up some of your clothes.

321
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,420
And I was kicked out by Chief Kim.

322
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:16,470
She won't let me even touch your stuff. This isn't right.

323
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:19,200
I'm more comfortable with Chief Kim taking care of it.

324
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,730
You don't have to worry about my business, Chief Jo.

325
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,930
Chairman.

326
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:33,090
Since you treat me like this, even Chief Kim, who works for this house, is being rude to me.

327
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,990
So Chairman,

328
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:39,460
please clarify my position.

329
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:44,720
We might not be able to get married right now,

330
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,980
but I should at least be your fiancée to have your child confidently.

331
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,770
I didn't come here just to have your child.

332
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:57,910
I don't want to be treated as such.

333
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,740
Chief Jo.

334
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,310
I never asked you to move into this house.

335
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:07,210
You moved in because you insisted.

336
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,310
Excuse me?

337
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:14,980
Didn't you say that you'd live here quietly without causing trouble for anyone else in this house?

338
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,160
That was...

339
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,910
I still don't remember anything that happened between us.

340
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:24,970
I accepted you because you said it was my child. And I think we need time.

341
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:27,650
Until I get my memories back.

342
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:30,840
- Chairman...
- Right now, you should think only of that child,

343
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,320
and I don't want you to speak about anything more than that.

344
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,750
Chairman...

345
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,360
I have some business to attend to, so I'll be out.

346
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:02,020
So? You couldn't even bring up about firing Chief Kim?

347
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:07,430
No. I'd be fired if I brought that up.

348
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,760
I'm so upset.

349
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,790
Well, I tried to get Chief Kim fired several times,

350
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:16,000
but it didn't work at all.

351
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,730
She's a treacherous snitch, but to him, she's a loyal subject.

352
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:25,240
How can he do that to me? The person who is pregnant with his child?

353
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,320
Am I less important than Chief Kim to him?

354
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,210
Chief Jo, do as Young Gook asks for now.

355
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:37,340
How could he accept you when he was with Ms. Park until just recently?

356
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:40,150
A person's mind is not that easy.

357
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,750
I'm just anxious, that's all.

358
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:46,080
I'm worried Chairman will turn his attention towards Ms. Park again.

359
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,540
I'm concerned about that, Madam.

360
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:53,600
What's there to worry about when there's a child in your stomach?

361
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,150
- Excuse me?
- I told you before.

362
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:59,470
Young Gook is crazy about children.

363
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:04,910
That's why he's pampering Se Jong with love.

364
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:11,410
Who would imagine Se Jong was adopted?

365
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,940
And it's not just someone else's child, but his.

366
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,180
And you're that child's mother.

367
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:19,650
But Young Gook giving his attention to someone else than you?

368
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:24,520
He would never do that even if the world were ending.

369
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,940
The Chairman will accept me soon, right?

370
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,700
Of course, of course.

371
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:35,210
The child in your stomach can't be beaten even if ten of Ms. Park came.

372
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:38,430
You can hold me accountable if that's not true.

373
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,440
Mother-in-law.

374
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,920
You're the best.

375
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:51,280
Now you see who I am. Let's get along well.

376
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,120
Please help me a lot.

377
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:59,280
Chief Jo, don't worry. Remember the child in your stomach.

378
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,730
What if the child is born before I win the Chairman's heart?

379
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:14,810
No. I still have a lot of time.

380
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:17,520
I still do.

381
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:24,230
I will make the Chairman mine while I live in this house, no matter what.

382
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,430
Thanks for your work, Driver Kang.

383
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,280
How have you been, Gi Ja?

384
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,840
Hey, what brings you here?

385
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,440
How can I not come here when I heard you hurt your leg?

386
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,800
I brought some Korean beef.

387
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,070
Okay. Thank you.

388
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,900
Hey, sit down.

389
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,760
Okay.

390
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:02,580
Gi Ja, let's get over the bad feelings we had, now that we're in-laws again.

391
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,820
Okay. The marriage was broken by Chairman Lee.

392
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,570
It wasn't your fault.

393
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:14,690
Of course! I loved Chief Jo with all my heart!

394
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:18,490
How's Sarah? Is she eating and doing well?

395
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,820
Hey, hey, do you think morning sickness is an illness?

396
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,410
It's something to be proud of, if anything. She's well and eats well.

397
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:27,260
How's Chairman Lee?

398
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,460
Is he mean to Sarah or anything?

399
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:35,080
Of course not. Why would he be mean when Chief Jo's pregnant with his child?

400
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,810
He was surprised at first, but you know, he likes children very much.

401
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:45,740
Because of that, I think he's trying to treat Chief Jo really well.

402
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:50,280
Really? That's good to hear.

403
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:56,160
By the way, Gi Ja, did you know that Chief Jo and Young Gook spent a night together?

404
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:01,040
Chief Jo definitely told me she failed every time.

405
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:05,740
"I think Chairman only sees me as a Noona to him."

406
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,890
That's what she said every time I asked.

407
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:13,030
But instead, they totally hit the home base in secret to us!

408
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:17,270
Gi Ja, have some Hallabong.

409
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,340
Oh my, what an unlucky sight!

410
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,270
Did she just say unlucky sight to me?

411
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:32,100
That's what I want to say! How dare you!

412
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,780
Hey!

413
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,150
- Did you get the audition?
- Yes.

414
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:41,590
See, I told you you'd get it. What role is it this time?

415
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:45,740
It's a role where I kiss a girl I like.

416
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,200
Really?

417
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,320
Then you're going to kiss someone you don't know?

418
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,080
No, I won't be really kissing her.

419
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,070
I'll be acting like I'm kissing her in front of people.

420
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:59,400
But then, I get slapped. That's my role.

421
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,600
- Really?
- Yes.

422
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,560
Mi Rim, I have to practice. Would you play my partner?

423
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:10,090
- Me? Are you telling me to slap you?
- Yes.

424
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:14,890
I have to thoroughly practice so I don't get edited out this time.

425
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:17,280
So play my partner, please.

426
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,020
Okay.

427
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,940
Then...

428
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,030
Since there's no one here, let's practice here once.

429
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,840
Here?

430
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,310
Okay, sure.

431
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,570
Okay, I'm going to start.

432
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:34,360
Okay.

433
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,600
Mi Rim, why aren't you moving? You're supposed to slap me.

434
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,780
How can I hit you?

435
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:03,250
This is acting. How can I practice if you don't act as my partner?

436
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:06,370
Okay. But don't say it hurts.

437
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:07,960
Okay.

438
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,760
I'm starting again.

439
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,760
Isn't that our Mi Rim?

440
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,840
That bastard.

441
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,280
Hey, you bastard.

442
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,660
What are you doing to Mi Rim!

443
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,250
What are you doing!?

444
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:32,730
This is my boyfriend! My boyfriend!

445
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:35,820
What? Your boyfriend?

446
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:43,150
Bong Joon Oh!

447
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:50,320
So, you're saying that you've been going out for a while?

448
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,040
Yes.

449
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,110
No wonder...

450
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:59,680
I thought it was strange when I saw you two look in each others' eyes.

451
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,450
But I kept thinking it won't be true...

452
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:06,480
You punks! You two are in-laws! What are you going to do!?

453
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,970
Uncle. We started dating without knowing that we're in-laws.

454
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:14,950
We learned later. We were both surprised when we found out.

455
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:19,480
Now that you know, you should break up.

456
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,470
Break up?

457
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,360
Hyung! How can you say that?

458
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,030
All we did was like each other.

459
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:30,180
Uncle, do we have to break up?

460
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:33,900
Can't we stay together?

461
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:38,470
What are we going to do with you two?

462
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,920
What do we do with you?

463
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:48,400
Mi Rim, Joon Oh, there will be a war if both families learn about this. What's your plan here?

464
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:54,070
We'll pretend we didn't see this today, so end it here. Okay?

465
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:58,830
I looked into it, and there's no problem legally for in-laws to marry.

466
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:03,680
Hey! When did I say I'd marry you?!

467
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,170
Mi Rim...

468
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,640
I'm just saying you're thinking too far ahead.

469
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,140
We're just dating because we like each other.

470
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,820
That's true.

471
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,400
Joon Oh and I are just trying each other out.

472
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,390
So Oppa, Uncle, turn a blind eye on what you saw today.

473
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,980
Don't tell us to break up either.

474
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:31,770
I can't break up with him at this moment, no matter what.

475
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:38,720
Hey, Dae Beom... Is this girl sitting in front of me the Mi Rim that I know?

476
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:43,840
What should we do with you, seriously?!

477
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,530
Really, what...

478
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:01,210
- Se Jong, why aren't you sleeping? Are you having trouble sleeping again?
- Yes.

479
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:07,620
Hyung, so I went to Dad to ask him to read me a book,

480
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,530
but Dad's not home.

481
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,900
I wonder if he went to drink again.

482
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:17,430
Hyung, I can't sleep without Ms. Park around.

483
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:21,130
I miss Ms. Park.

484
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,860
Se Jong, sleep in my room tonight.

485
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,270
I'll read you a book.

486
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:28,080
Okay.

487

[Se Chan]

488
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,760
Dan Dan, please stop doing that.

489
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,800
You're going to get sick.

490
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,790
You were cleaning all day long... I feel sorry just to see you.

491
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,790
No, no, let me join you.

492
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,590
No, no.

493
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:04,580
Don't worry about it. I'm doing it because I want to.

494
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:08,080
I'm done cleaning. Do you want to eat anything?

495
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,260
I'll make you whatever you want.

496
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:14,530
Dae Beom did say you were strong,

497
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:18,780
but you really do work so hard. You're amazing.

498
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,050
It's because my mood goes down if I don't do anything.

499
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:27,250
So let me know. I'll make whatever.

500
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:31,150
Then... Tteokbokki, please.

501
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,190
- Tteokbokki?
- Yes.

502
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:36,850
That's a piece of cake. I'll make it right away.

503
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,330
Let me help you.

504
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:40,120
Ms. Park, Uncle!

505
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,590
Grandma!

506
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:45,070
Is that Se Chan and Se Jong?!

507
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,480
Se Jong, Se Chan.

508
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,460
What are you two doing here?

509
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:57,260
We came because Se Jong said he missed Ms. Park.

510
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,890
Ms. Park!

511
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,010
Se Jong.

512
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,950
Yes, Se Ryun?

513
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:35,950
Oppa, Se Chan and Se Jong came here.

514
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,170
What?

515
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:42,140
Oppa, you didn't even know the kids were gone?

516
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:48,980
I just came home. I'm sorry, I'll be right there to pick them up.

517
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:53,000
I called you because I thought you would worry that the kids went missing.

518
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,820
I'll feed the kids and take them home after playing with them a little.

519
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,430
Okay.

520
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:05,880
Thank you for taking care of them, Se Ryun.

521
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,540
Don't worry.

Let's go home. It's too late. I'll take you.

00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,940
Auntie, I don't want to go home.

540
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,540
Can't we sleep here?

541
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:12,550
Se Chan, Se Jong... You have to sleep at home.

542
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:17,340
Auntie, to tell you the truth, Se Jong can't sleep.

543
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,290
He didn't sleep a wink last night.

544
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:25,170
You can kick me out if both Se Jong and I sleeping here is uncomfortable.

545
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,990
But can't you let Se Jong sleep here?

546
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:33,830
He'll be sick again if he keeps staying up.

547
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:42,810
Sure.

548
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,100
Yes, Se Ryun.

549
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:08,100
Oppa, the kids want to stay tonight.

550
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,250
I'll bring them home tomorrow.

551
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,460
That's not right. I'm about to head over to get them.

552
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:16,960
Oppa, do you know what state Se Jong is in?

553
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,550
Like last time, Se Jong didn't sleep recently.

554
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:25,530
I think his separation anxiety is back.

555
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:26,870
What?

556
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:30,400
So I'll try letting him sleep here for tonight with Ms. Park and me.

557
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,280
We can't let the symptoms get bad like last time.

558
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,900
Oppa. Do as I say.

559
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:44,350
Don't worry. I'll let them sleep here tonight and bring them home tomorrow.

560
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,700
Okay.

561
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,940
Thank you, Se Ryun.

562
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:56,010
Chairman, Se Chan and Se Jong are missing.

563
00:41:56,010 --> 00:42:00,750
The kids are with Se Ryun. They're staying there for the night.

564
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,980
Chairman, what do you mean?

565
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,940
Ms. Se Ryun's house is...

566
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,150
That's Ms. Park's house.

567
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:10,060
Why would you let the kids sleep at someone else's house?

568
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:14,520
Chief Jo, it's their aunt Se Ryun's house, not someone else's house.

569
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:19,080
It's none of your business, so don't question it.

570
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,940
He's letting my Se Jong and Se Chan sleep at that house?

571
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,870
This is all that girl's doing.

572
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:34,890
Is Ms. Park using the kids as an excuse to get the Chairman's attention?

573
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,880
No.

574
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,210
As the Madam said,

575
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:47,760
this baby will stop the Chairman from being distracted.

576
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:56,570
Se Chan. Do you want to live here?

577
00:42:56,570 --> 00:43:00,660
I really don't want to go home.

578
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,340
Why?

579
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:09,620
I don't understand why Chief Jo has to live in our house.

580
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,170
I told my dad that I understood,

581
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:17,040
but to be honest, I didn't really understand.

582
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,560
I think my dad's having a hard time too.

583
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:24,310
He keeps drinking every day and doesn't come home a lot either.

584
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:29,050
I haven't seen my dad smiling these days.

585
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:31,430
Noona also has become more sensitive,

586
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:33,590
so she goes into her room and locks the door,

587
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:36,100
and she won't come out all that much.

588
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:39,450
When I see Chief Jo walking around,

589
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:43,320
I lose my appetite, and I hate it.

590
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:49,850
Auntie, can't you let Se Jong and I live here? Please?

591
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:59,420
Oh? Uncle.

592
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:02,050
What are you doing here at this time?

593
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:03,690
Aren't you supposed to be at work?

594
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:07,330
I came here because I have something to say.

595
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:08,900
Sit there for a bit, Mom.

596
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,550
Brother-in-law, Noona, and you, too.

597
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:18,450
What is it?

598
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:22,890
I... quit my job a few days ago.

599
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:24,510
What?

600
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:28,290
You didn't even tell us...

601
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,420
Did you get fired?

602
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:34,470
Fired? No.

603
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:38,630
It was a good job, but I'm still young,

604
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:42,210
and it seemed like there was no future in the long run, so I quit.

605
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:48,460
So after some thinking, I've decided.

606
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:51,710
I'm going to try working here.

607
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:53,940
- Here?
- Yes, Brother-in-law.

608
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,870
You'll take me in, right?

609
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:58,580
This chicken restaurant is doing great.

610
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:02,640
It'll be great if it does even better, and we can get a second and third one.

611
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,760
I'll work hard.

612
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,240
Okay.

613
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,840
I think you made a good choice.

614
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:13,600
We were thinking of getting another employee too.

615
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,670
Are you sure you weren't fired?

616
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:19,740
Really... I wasn't fired.

617
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:27,000
Okay. I guess you can't be a driver for that company forever.

618
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,890
- You did it right.
- Yes, Mom.

619
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:32,700
It's better if our restaurant does well, and we get a second and third location.

620
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:37,830
Yes. Uncle, you can open the second store later on.

621
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:45,140
- Hello.
- Hyungnim, welcome.

622
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:49,010
- Hyun Bin's here too.
- Hello.

623
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:53,110
It's been a while, Mr. Attorney.

624
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:57,970
Hyun Bin just came back from a three-month backpacking trip,

625
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:00,930
and the moment he got to the Korean airport,

626
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:04,740
the first thing that came to his mind was chicken.

627
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:09,100
So, today's lunch is chicken for all of us.

628
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,360
Of course. Welcome. Please sit over here.

629
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,100
- Let's sit.
- Yes.

630
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,900
Uncle, help me with this.

631
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,180
Where did you go?

632
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:21,760
I went to Africa, Turkey, and also Mongolia.

633
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,680
That's so cool! You're the definition of youth!

634
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,270
Wait just a moment.

635
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:30,120
Mom, I bought pepper, green onions, and garlic.

636
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,060
Okay. Look over there.

637
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,780
Dan Dan.

638
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:38,430
Hyun Bin Sunbae! I heard you went on a backpacking trip. When did you come back?

639
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:42,180
Just a moment ago. It's so good to see you.

640
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:45,600
But why are you here at this time?

641
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,200
I'm helping at my dad's store starting today.

642
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,760
I see. I guess I'll be seeing more of you.

643
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,960
Oh right, I bought a souvenir for you.

644
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:03,180
Did you really buy this for me?

645
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:09,780
Hyun Bin must have thought of Dan Dan often.

646
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,250
Oh, you punk.

647
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,920
Of course, he thought of her. She's his Hoobae.

648
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,650
He said they were close in school, remember?

649
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,990
This is so pretty.

650
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:23,990
Have it with you whenever you can.

651
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:25,740
This is called the 'evil eye,'

652
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,940
so it fights off bad luck if you carry it around.

653
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,820
Really?

654
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,750
Thank you, Sunbae.

655
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:39,960
Thank you and sorry for everything.

656
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,600
You must've felt uncomfortable in that house.

657
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,380
It's okay, Oppa.

658
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:47,490
They are my nephews. You don't have to say that.

659
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:51,320
The real person to be thankful for is Ms. Park.

660
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:55,330
Accepting the kids even in these situations is very generous of her.

661
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,890
Ms. Park...

662
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:04,120
Is she okay?

663
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,270
Yes.

664
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:13,080
By the way, Oppa, I think the kids are very uncomfortable with Chief Jo.

665
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:17,220
Does Chief Jo really have to stay in this house just because she's pregnant?

666
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,360
It's not like you're married,

667
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,480
and Se Chan and Se Jong hate it.

668
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,100
You can just support her financially until she gives birth.

669
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:28,980
I really can't understand Chief Jo.

670
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,510
I'll look for a solution while she stays.

671
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:33,600
I have to do what she wants for now.

672
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:37,740
The doctor said that she needs emotional stability at this stage.

673
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:41,610
But Oppa, it's weird the more I think about it.

674
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:45,210
When you turned twenty-two, you definitely said this to me.

675
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:48,760
"Chief Jo looks just like an Ajumma and a Noona."

676
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,750
"No matter how much I try to like her, I can't."

677
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:56,110
"I don't even like her. Do I really have to go through an engagement with Chief Jo?"

678
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:58,650
You said all of that,

679
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:00,980
and the fact that she's pregnant with your kid,

680
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,770
that doesn't make sense.

681
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:07,370
Se Ryun.

682
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:13,710
Okay. It's useless to say this to you now.

683
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:19,430
Se Ryun. I'll try to explain to Se Chan and Se Jong.

684
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:22,630
But if the kids go to Ms. Park again,

685
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:25,660
calm them down and bring them home.

686
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,330
Ms. Park and I broke up because of me.

687
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:31,440
It's not right to make her suffer because of the kids.

688
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,550
Oppa, I understand you are sorry to Ms. Park,

689
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:39,390
but if you care about the kids, this isn't okay either.

690
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:43,630
Se Chan and Se Jong are having a harder time than you think.

691
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:46,230
Be aware of that.

692
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:56,020
Se Chan, Se Jong. I'm really sorry for missing your calls yesterday.

693
00:49:56,020 --> 00:50:00,290
I'll answer the phone no matter what in the future,

694
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:03,730
so don't go to your aunt's house from now on.

695
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:07,090
You understand what I'm saying, right?

696
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:12,540
Dad, I didn't go to Ms. Park's house without any thoughts.

697
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,680
Se Jong wasn't able to sleep for a while.

698
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:19,120
But you kept drinking, coming home late, and didn't even answer the phone.

699
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:23,340
You didn't even know Se Jong was like this.

700
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:26,750
But... I'm not being angry at you right now.

701
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:29,480
I know you're having a hard time too.

702
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:31,780
What?

703
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:38,020
But Dad, I thought about it, and there's no reason we can't go to Ms. Park's house.

704
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:41,380
She was our teacher before she was your girlfriend.

705
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:45,310
But why can't we see her?!

706
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:51,810
That's... I told you already.

707
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:55,200
You can't give Ms. Park a hard time.

708
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,660
Dad, talk with me for a minute.

709
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:13,030
Dad, when I learned about you secretly dating Ms. Park,

710
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:17,650
I was so surprised, and to be honest, I thought it was ridiculous.

711
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:24,740
I'm still angry when I think about how Ms. Park lied to me and dated you.

712
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:30,980
But even then, saying goodbye to Ms. Park like this hurts and makes me sad.

713
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:35,880
Even though I'm a middle school student, I'm sad to be separated from her suddenly.

714
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:40,160
And a part of me just doesn't understand this entire situation.

715
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:44,770
Se Chan and Se Jong are younger than me. How do you think they feel?

716
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:51,310
Dad... you're stopping us from seeing Ms. Park because of the problems between adults.

717
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:54,830
What are you going to do if Se Jong gets sick like he did last time?

718
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:59,670
Are you going to hospitalize Se Jong if he can't eat and can't sleep?

719
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:02,120
This isn't right.

720
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:08,360
Dad, I understand that you can't do anything about the situation.

721
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:14,100
But you should talk to Ms. Park instead of deciding things on your own.

722
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:21,690
If Ms. Park says she doesn't want to see the kids, I'll persuade Se Chan and Se Jong not to go see her.

723
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:26,390
But let them see her if she says she wants to see them.

724
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:36,300
But if you keep stopping them from seeing Ms. Park, I will go live at Ms. Park's house until Se Jong gets better.

725
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,980
Jenny...

726
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:49,420
Yes, it's me.

727
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:54,570
How's Dan Dan? Is she any better?

728
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:59,390
She's still having a hard time. She needs more time.

729
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:02,320
I'm guessing you had no time to bring it up.

730
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,500
No.

731
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,830
Give me a bit more time.

732
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:08,980
Okay.

733
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:14,880
But I've been away from my position in the US company for a long time, so...

734
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,130
I'll try to persuade Dan Dan.

735
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:23,950
Okay. Give me a call when Dan Dan gets better.

736
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:27,080
All right. I will.

737
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,490
How are you?

738
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:33,370
Me? I'm good.

739
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:36,220
Thank you for asking.

740
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,740
I'll hang up now.

741
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:56,350
Se Jong, just one bite.

742
00:53:56,350 --> 00:53:58,470
Eat just one bite.

743
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:01,470
I can't.

744
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:04,560
Just leave Se Jong alone. He can't eat.

745
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,920
Se Jong, it's okay if you can't eat.

746
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:11,720
What are you talking about? He can't eat even one spoonful.

747
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,960
Se Jong, it's not good for you if you don't eat like this.

748
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,010
Just have one bite.

749
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:27,190
Se Jong.

750
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:30,290
Why are you doing this when he said he didn't want to eat!? Why are you forcing him?

751
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:32,730
We can't let him starve.

752
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:35,820
Se Jong, come here, let's go.

753
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:47,380
What can we do? Why is Se Jong like that? Ms. Park isn't even his mother.

754
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:52,180
The separation anxiety is back. It's here again.

755
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:54,090
Really...

756
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,320
Where are you guys going?

757
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:09,330
I made some rice porridge for Se Jong to eat.

758
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:15,130
Lee Jenny, I'm asking you a question. Where are you going with Se Jong?

759
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:19,190
Why do I need to tell you that?

760
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:22,730
Mrs. Yeoju, please tell Driver Kang to get ready for us.

761
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:26,770
O-o-okay. I got it.

762
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:32,080
Oh, that girl. Jenny's so rude.

763
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:36,980
I don't know who she gets that from, but she doesn't respect adults.

764
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:42,170
Wait a moment. Are they going to Ms. Park?

765
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:50,340
You are eating so well!

766
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:53,010
Good boy, you're eating so well.

767
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:56,080
One more bite? Is it good?

768
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:59,790
Eat it with some mung bean soup. It's a bit dry by itself.

769
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:03,110
Thank you.

770
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,990
Is it that good?

771
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:10,630
I kept thinking of the bibimbap I had here last time. It's so good.

772
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:15,110
Me, too! I thought a lot of the bibimbap I ate with Ms. Park!

773
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:17,950
I thought of it a lot too.

774
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:20,550
Have you eaten bibimbap here before?

775
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:22,690
Yes!

776
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:25,610
But this porridge is so good too.

777
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:31,820
The porridge is sliding down my throat like it's skating.

778
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:38,990
The porridge is sliding down Se Jong's throat like it's skating,

779
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:42,210
and it's making me so happy, too!

780
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:45,450
Se Jong, eat slowly and eat as much as you want.

781
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:49,290
Okay. I'll eat all of this.

782
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:50,980
Good.

783
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:54,180
I'm glad everyone likes it.

784
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:57,220
Have some strawberries after you finish.

785
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:00,280
Okay, thank you.

786
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:04,670
How wonderful. You're all good at saying thank you.

787
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:07,710
Visit a lot more often from now on, okay?

788
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:10,290
Don't feel uncomfortable about it and just come over a lot, okay?

789
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:11,720
Okay.

790
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,650
Mother-in-law, are you sure?

791
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:19,440
Of course. We're all a family now.

792
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,440
Mother-in-law, thank you so much.

793
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,090
Mom, thank you.

794
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:27,870
No problem.

795
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:30,200
Keep eating.

796
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,130
Honey.

797
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:37,970
It's okay, children.

798
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:40,000
Say hello to my dad.

799
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,620
Okay.

800
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:46,890
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

801
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:49,140
What are the kids doing here?

802
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:54,110
What do you mean? They can visit their auntie, can't they?

803
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:13,520
Jenny!

804
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:19,660
I asked Driver Kang, and he told me you went to Ms. Park's house.

805
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:22,410
Why did you come home by yourself? Where's Se Jong and Se Chan?

806
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:25,000
Se Jong will be staying at my aunt's house until he becomes stable.

807
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,680
Se Chan is going to go back and forth until Se Jong's better.

808
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,800
Lee Jenny, what are you talking about? What do you mean they'll be there?

809
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,590
Ajumma, you saw it all.

810
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:35,660
You know that Se Jong is sick that he can't sleep or eat.

811
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:38,850
So he's going to stay there, so that's that.

812
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:40,390
That's nonsense.

813
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:44,090
Se Jong is very sick. All the more, he should stay home!

814
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:47,270
Jenny, let's go. Come with me, and let's bring Se Jong and Se Chan home.

815
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:51,200
Ajumma! Se Jong is sick because of you!

816
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,260
Ms. Park left because you came to our house,

817
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:57,270
and Se Jong is sick because he misses Ms. Park.

818
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:59,250
Why are you behaving like this in this situation?!

819
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:01,510
Who do you think you are?!

820
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:05,750
What? Se Jong is sick because of me?

821
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:08,140
Lee Jenny! How dare you talk to me like that?

822
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:10,450
And you keep calling me Ajumma, Ajumma!

823
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:13,140
Are you keep going to be rude to me like this?

824
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:16,480
I'm pregnant with your younger sibling! Calling me mom would be the least you could do!

825
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:21,060
How dare you act so rude!? Do you want to be scolded!?

826
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:24,240
What? Mom?

827
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,780
Who the heck is my mom? Do you think you're my mom?

828
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:31,590
Get out of our house if you're going to say stupid things like that. Get out right now!

829
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:36,470
Lee Jenny. Who do you think you are to tell me to leave?! Who do you think you are!?

830
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:40,790
Jo Sarah. What do you think you're doing to Jenny!?

831
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:42,590
Jenny, go in.

832
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:45,760
It's so freaking annoying.

833
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:56,040
Jo Sarah. I can't stand watching you scold and scream at Jenny.

834
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:00,820
I've recorded all of this, so I'll thoroughly report this to the Chairman.

835
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:02,250
What are you...

836
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:03,540
Give this to me!

837
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:05,550
What are you doing?!

838
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:07,220
I said, give it here!

839
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,830
Chief Jo! Chief Jo! What are you doing!?

840
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:10,600
Why are you doing this!?

841
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,350
- Give it to me!
- Chief Jo!

842
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:23,400
I'm going to do the voices as well, just for a moment.

843
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:28,580
"Hey, Lee Jenny! How dare you talk to me like that?"

844
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:30,620
"I'm pregnant with your younger sibling!"

845
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:33,910
"Calling me mom would be the least you could do! How dare you act so rude!?"

846
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:36,820
"Do you want to be scolded!?"

847
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:39,870
That's enough, Chief Kim. You can stop.

848
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:46,490
Chairman. When I was working for the former Chairman,

849
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:51,710
and even now as I work for you, I never said my own opinions.

850
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:57,770
But this time, I will say just one thing.

851
01:00:57,770 --> 01:01:02,450
The house has been a damn mess after Ms. Jo Sarah came in.

852
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:05,780
Please make a wise judgment.

853
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,870
Jenny.

854
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:23,090
Jenny.

855
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:27,470
Dad, I really hate Chief Jo!

856
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:30,480
I want her to get out of this house!

857
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:37,410
The child in her stomach is my younger sibling as well, and I shouldn't be acting this way if I think of you,

858
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:40,590
but it's so hard living with Chief Jo.

859
01:01:40,590 --> 01:01:43,440
Everyone's having a hard time, not just me!

860
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:49,210
Se Chan, Se Jong, and I have tried so hard to endure,

861
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:52,100
but we just can't do it anymore.

862
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:58,670
I'm really sorry for the baby in her belly,

863
01:01:58,670 --> 01:02:02,400
but if I keep living with her, I think I'm going to run away from home.

864
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:05,690
Jenny.

865
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:10,100
Dad... To be honest, I don't want to come home.

866
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:14,490
Se Chan feels the same way. What's with this situation?

867
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:19,520
Se Chan and Se Jong aren't home, and I hate home.

868
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:23,530
Dad, what's going on? This isn't right!

869
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:28,780
Jenny.

870
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:31,300
I'm sorry.

871
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:36,570
No, Dad. I'm sorry.

872
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:41,240
I'm sorry that this is all I can say.

873
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:47,000
I've tried to keep it in, but it's too hard.

874
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:55,540
Chief Jo.

875
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:58,530
You wanted to be here at my house,

876
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:02,910
so I respected your opinion and let you stay here.

877
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:08,410
But, Chief Jo, Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong... The kids are suffering.

878
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:10,990
They're getting hurt.

879
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:14,740
So Chief Jo, go back home.

880
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:18,290
I'll do everything I can for you.

881
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:21,400
Chairman. What are you talking about?

882
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:26,580
Are you telling me to leave this house?

883
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:28,340
Chief Jo.

884
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:36,880
I should've thoroughly discussed this problem with the kids before you came to this house.

885
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:41,180
So the children wouldn't get hurt when they're already so confused.

886
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:44,210
I didn't think of the kids.

887
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:47,210
So go back home, Chief Jo.

888
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:49,570
Do as I say.

889
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:54,350
No. I can't do that. I won't leave.

890
01:03:54,350 --> 01:04:01,490
I want to be next to you, the father, even just for the child's prenatal care.

891
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:06,190
Why should I have to leave when I'm pregnant with your child?

892
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:08,760
I'm telling you that I'll do the best I can for you.

893
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:12,010
No, I can't leave. I won't.

894
01:04:12,010 --> 01:04:14,250
Chief Jo.

895
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:18,930
I'm explaining and asking you to this extent. Why are you doing this?!

896
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:24,910
That child is important too, but Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong are important to me as well.

897
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:31,990
Chief Jo, are you okay?

898
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:35,710
Chief Kim! Mrs. Yeoju!

899
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:55,490
Oh, my? What's going on with Young Gook?

900
01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:59,180
Careful. Careful.

901
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:04,020
Chief Jo, what's going on? What's wrong with Young Gook?

902
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:08,750
I just got a little stressed out, so I think my stomach tightened up.

903
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:11,910
I see. Don't you need to see the doctor?

904
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:14,820
No, it's okay. I think I'll be alright.

905
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:17,590
I'm okay, so you can go.

906
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:20,830
Yes, go, go, go.

907
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:24,010
Good job. Thanks.

908
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:28,120
What is it? What?

909
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,960
He told me to leave.

910
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,580
So I got a little surprised.

911
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:36,480
Leave?

912
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,050
You should be careful.

913
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:40,180
I'm glad you don't have to see the doctor.

914
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:43,390
I thought something bad had happened.

915
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:47,170
Trying to kick me out?

916
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:49,990
I came here with determination.

917
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:54,430
I won't leave. I won't leave even if I die.

918
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:27,010
This memory...

919
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,530
What is this memory?

920
01:06:57,180 --> 01:06:59,110
Yes, Chairman.

921
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:03,040
Chief Jo, I'm sorry about earlier.

922
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:09,190
I asked Chief Kim, and she told me that you don't need to go to the doctor. Are you sure you're okay?

923
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:13,360
Yes. I'm okay.

924
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:15,640
Can you come out then?

925
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:18,030
Do you want to go eat with me?

926
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:20,780
Yes. I can go out.

927
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:22,750
Okay.

928
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:35,820
How's the steak?

929
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:40,850
It's good. It's very tasty.

930
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:43,760
I think it's a boy.

931
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:48,640
I usually don't like meat, but it's delicious.

932
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,850
Is that so?

933
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:55,940
Chairman.

934
01:07:55,940 --> 01:08:03,300
Going on a date with you like this makes me feel like we went back to when we were happy.

935
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:07,000
I feel like I'm dreaming right now.

936
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:14,140
We used to go to tasty restaurants, and the movies,

937
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:16,920
and went around together every day.

938
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,890
Did we?

939
01:08:19,890 --> 01:08:24,110
Chief Jo. Can you tell me about that time?

940
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:29,170
I'm curious about how and where I proposed to you.

941
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:33,710
I don't remember anything from then.

942
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:37,370
Your marriage proposal?

943
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:43,420
You were so romantic that day.

944
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:49,460
You suddenly asked me to go to the vacation home with you, and you cooked me a meal,

945
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:52,590
and we drank wine together,

946
01:08:52,590 --> 01:08:59,540
and with a hundred roses, you put an engagement ring on me.

947
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:06,480
And that day we...

948
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:10,660
We kissed for the first time.

949
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:30,150
On that day?

950
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:40,700
Yes. I think this child was from that day.

951
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:43,880
Is that so?

952
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,410
Are you sure?

953
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:47,790
Of course.

954
01:09:49,550 --> 01:09:53,040
Chief Jo.

955
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:56,140
Why are you lying?

956
01:09:58,030 --> 01:10:00,530
Excuse me?

957
01:10:16,190 --> 01:10:23,870
♫ Why do you run away, love. Like a shy child ♫

958
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:30,660
♫ In case I lose it, I hold it tight ♫

959
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:37,780
♫ But love always runs away, chased by longing ♫

960
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:44,440
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

961
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:52,410
♫ I have to abandon the longing and the grieves ♫

962
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:55,530
♫  What am I looking for on this road wandering ♫

963
01:10:55,530 --> 01:10:58,630
[Young Lady and Gentleman]

964
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:03,490
Chairman. I thought about it over and over again, and I don't think I can break up with you.

965
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:05,650
We love each other too much.

966
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:09,310
She's the reason I can't win the Chairman's heart.

967
01:11:09,310 --> 01:11:11,250
Did that woman go to America? Anna.

968
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:12,600
How would I know?

969
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:16,920
Of course, you shouldn't know. Promise you won't try to find out if she's dead or alive from now on.

970
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:19,070
I think we need to do some close examinations.

971
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:20,830
There's something near the pancreas.

972
01:11:20,830 --> 01:11:22,460
Isn't this Dan Dan?

973
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:25,410
Please break up with the Chairman, Ms. Park!

974
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:27,050
What do you want from me!?

975
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:30,010
All I want is to become your wife.

976
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:31,910
That won't happen even if the world comes to an end.

977
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:34,100
You'll be reading an article with this title.

978
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:38,380
"The pregnant fiancée of Lee Young Gook drowns in the Han river."

979
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:42,100
