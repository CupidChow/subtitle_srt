[Episode 10]

2
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:27,260
What are you doing here, Ms. Park?

3
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,020
Chairman!

4
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,410
Wait, Chairman!

5
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,490
Why are you acting like this all of a sudden?

6
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:46,590
Why are you here, Ms. Park? What are you doing here!

7
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,480
I am just working here.

8
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,030
That's what I'm asking. Why are you doing this kind of work?

9
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,430
Never mind. Come with me right now.

10
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,390
Where to?

11
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,770
Come back to my house. Just be with my children.

12
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,370
One moment, please.

13
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,860
Please let go of my hand.

14
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,360
I'm sorry. I was impatient.

15
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,070
Ms. Park. Let's go back to my house.

16
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,580
I am grateful to hear that.

17
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,820
But I don't think I can.

18
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:42,350
I am too embarrassed and sorry to be in front of you or the children.

19
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:47,300
Se Jong is very sick. He's only looking for you.

20
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,670
Is Se Jong sick? How?

21
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,140
When he found out you quit working for us,

22
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:58,230
he got on the subway by himself looking for you today. He could've gone in big trouble.

23
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,900
Se Jong took the subway on his own? Really?

24
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,610
He must have been shocked since you were gone today.

25
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,520
He suddenly came down with a fever, but he's only looking for you.

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,650
Jenny and Se Chan are calling for you too.

27
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,200
Ms. Park. Putting everything aside,

28
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,040
can you come with me for the sake of my children?

29
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,670
Yes, Se Jong?

30
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,840
Daddy, why aren't you coming home?

31
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,870
You promised to bring Ms. Park.

32
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,560
Why? Does she not want to come?

33
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,660
Se Jong, hold on.

34
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,830
Ms. Park. Please take the call.

35
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,830
Hello?

36
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:08,040
Ms. Park? Is that you?

37
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,520
Yes, it's me.

38
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,000
Where are you, Ms. Park?

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,510
Why aren't you coming?

40
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,030
That is, Se Jong.

41
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,640
You made a promise to me.

42
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,690
You will be my side for a long, long time.

43
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,790
Why are you breaking the promise you made to me?

44
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,490
I am going to wait until you come back.

45
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,380
I will not eat.

46
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,600
I will wait for you day after day.

47
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,090
Se Jong. I got it. I will come back now.

48
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,040
So don't cry and wait a bit, okay?

49
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,310
Chairman, let's go, quickly. Hurry!

50
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:15,180
I am sorry for not telling you the truth sooner.

51
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,710
But my father and I ran into each other at your house by coincidence.

52
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,760
We really did not have an ulterior motive.

53
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,120
Please believe us on that.

54
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,380
I know. Actually, my Noona,

55
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,760
I mean, CEO Anna, filled me on everything.

56
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,460
The reason why you had to find live-in employment like ours,

57
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:46,190
and why you couldn't tell me the truth until now, I heard that all from her.

58
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:51,070
But when Se Ryun's situation blew up in the middle of that, the misunderstanding got even worse.

59
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:56,830
I know it's a misunderstanding now, so please don't worry anymore.

60
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,520
Thank you for believing us.

61
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,780
Ms. Park.

62
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,040
Yes, Chairman.

63
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,210
The fact that Driver Park is your father,

64
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,320
can we keep it to ourselves for now?

65
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,310
There is no need to explain your private matters to everyone.

66
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:33,010
Also, since that was all taken care of, I don't want more misunderstandings to happen.

67
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:38,580
For now, let's think only about the children.

68
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,340
Yes, I understand. I will do as you say.

69
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,120
Thank you.

70
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,060
Did you leave your luggage here?

71
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,690
Yes. Let's go now. Se Jong is waiting for us.

72
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,260
Let me carry that for you.

73
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,310
It's okay. It's not heavy at all.

74
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,660
Ms. Park!

75
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,220
Se Jong, be careful.

76
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,440
Ms. Park.

77
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,710
Where did you go without telling me?

78
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,530
I hate you.

79
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,570
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,240
I did wrong.

81
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,900
Were you very sick?

82
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,670
Just a little.

83
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:00,800
But I'm okay now that you are here.

84
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,440
I think I'm all better now.

85
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,220
- Ms. Park!
- Ms. Park!

86
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,680
Jenny! Se Chan!

87
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:23,460
Aigoo, are you all filming a movie in the night?

88
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,890
Ms. Park, let's go upstairs.

89
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,680
Okay.

90
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,580
Oh, wait, my bag.

91
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,370
I will bring it up for you.

92
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,610
Dad! Thank you!

93
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,450
Sarah, didn't you say you were sleeping over at the Chairman's house with Se Jong?

94
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,060
Is Se Jong okay, now?

95
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,200
Oh, I'm so frustrated.

96
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,580
Why? Did something happen?

97
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,280
Ms. Park, that little minx, came back!

98
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,380
Didn't she quit? Why did she come back?

99
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:30,110
Se Jong cried and cried, asking his father to bring her back.

100
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,330
So, Chairman brought her back just now.

101
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,890
She's not a pot of honey!

102
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,610
How did she entice Se Jong to her side like that?

103
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,980
She hasn't even been there that long.

104
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,860
As if he's gold and jade,

105
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,610
I'm the one who raised Se Jong like that without letting anyone know.

106
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,340
Why is Se Jong behaving that way?

107
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:56,450
Why is he looking elsewhere when his birth mother is right in front of him?

108
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:01,710
That makes you wonder why people say blood is thicker than water.

109
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,710
No matter how well I treat him,

110
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:08,940
he only thinks of me as a Chief Jo Ajumma who works there.

111
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,950
I will tell Dae Ran that you want to be the Mrs. of that house.

112
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,770
We have no time for playing hard to get.

113
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,530
It's now or never.

114
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:30,070
For the sake of Se Jong, you have to become the lady of that house as soon as possible.

115
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,420
If I didn't bring her back, where was she going to stay?

116
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,340
Even if she didn't have a place to go,

117
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,670
how can a young woman do such harsh work?

118
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,190
Dan Dan, why did you come back here?

119
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,000
Rather than tutoring the children,

120
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,250
it would have been much easier and comfortable working with me.

121
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,750
What are you doing?

122
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,140
You just came out of the hospital.

123
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,950
I am okay now, Mother-in-law.

124
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,110
Still, you mustn't overdo it.

125
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,550
Let's go inside and eat breakfast.

126
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,330
I made your favorite, dried-radish-greens soybean soup.

127
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,180
Really? That sounds delicious. Let's go inside, Mother-in-law.

128
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,620
Dad, please save me!

129
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,810
- Hey! You stop right there!
- Mom! Please hear me out first.

130
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,540
Mom, why do you get angry before you hear my words until the end?

131
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,640
It's because you are speaking nonsense!

132
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,730
You are dead today. You're out of your mind.

133
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,450
Won't you stop there? You and I will die together today.

134
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,270
Get out of my way, Honey! You too, Mom.

135
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,390
Father and Grandma, please save me!

136
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,630
Why are you swinging a ladle like that early in the morning?

137
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,170
You will kick out any fortune coming in our way!

138
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,730
Why are you acting this way, Honey? What's going on?

139
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:22,450
That bastard wants to do business again! A business!

140
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,920
Business?

141
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:31,060
What? Do you want to run a food truck?

142
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,920
Will that food truck drop from the sky?

143
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,770
What money do you have to get into that?

144
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:40,290
My friend's business didn't go well, so he's handing it over to me at a cheap price!

145
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,800
Are you saying you want to bring bad luck by taking over someone else's failed business?

146
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,320
Do you want to go bankrupt again?

147
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,780
You and Geon are the reason why we are living like now.

148
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,900
Yeon Sil.

149
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,120
Even if you are my daughter,

150
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,470
I have to ask you to be clear with your words.

151
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:00,260
Compared to the money these two lost,

152
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,780
the money you lost on Treasure Island was fatal.

153
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,650
Besides that, five years ago,

154
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:12,960
who was the one that instigated this innocent Geon to start a business?

155
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,880
Wasn't that you?

156
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,080
Didn't you say you had to go into business because you couldn't make big money by earning wages?

157
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,230
You were the one who said that!

158
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,170
Whose blood runs in Dae Beom, after all?

159
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,930
Mom!

160
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,820
Mom, I will succeed for sure this time. Please believe me.

161
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,770
We are not putting in big money this time. You have nothing to worry about.

162
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,360
Even if we fail, we will end up where we started.

163
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:45,210
Also, Dae Beom and I will work really hard as if this is the last thing.

164
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:49,420
Mother, Brother-in-law, and Noona!

165
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,020
Please support us one last time!

166
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,840
Just once!

167
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,710
Go ahead and give it your best shot.

168
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:03,500
Honey.

169
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,470
Aigoo. Is this a turd or a vehicle?

170
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,350
Does it even move forward?

171
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:20,030
Of course, Uncle. How else could my friend drive it here?

172
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,950
Sure.

173
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,680
I guess as long as it moves, that's good enough.

174
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,200
Look at this.

175
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,730
Even the side mirror is saying hi to us.

176
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,020
What is this?

177
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,300
It's small, but it's my gratitude.

178
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,870
You helped me with many things recently

179
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,540
and spoke to the Chairman well.

180
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,960
Thank you very much.

181
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,440
Are you saying you are giving me a gift?

182
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,850
Yes.

183
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,670
Can I open it?

184
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,510
Of course, CEO Kim.

185
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,860
It's beautiful.

186
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,020
- I like it very much.
- Really?

187
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,740
Do you really like it?

188
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,460
I couldn't let it go after what you told me.

189
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,770
So I talked to Chairman Lee.

190
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:39,500
I'm sorry if I was out of line.

191
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,360
Not at all, CEO Kim.

192
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,330
Thanks to you, all the misunderstandings about my father and I have been cleared.

193
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:50,280
That made it possible for me to return to Chairman's house.

194
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,360
I'm glad that all the misunderstandings have been sorted out.

195
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:01,340
But, you going back to Chairman's house made me upset a bit.

196
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,920
Pardon?

197
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:09,390
I wanted you to work for me instead of going back to Chairman Lee.

198
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,960
If you ever want to work with me in the future, just let me know.

199
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,580
Chairman Lee will understand it if I say so.

200
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,560
Thank you for saying all of that.

201
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,430
But, I want to be with the children for a while.

202
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:37,110
At least, I want to stay until Se Jong grows up and starts school.

203
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:41,030
So, are you saying that Se Jong took you away from me?

204
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,210
Is that right?

205
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,780
CEO Kim, please speak to me comfortably.

206
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,500
Really? Should I?

207
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,180
Yes, of course.

208
00:15:55,180 --> 00:16:02,560
Speaking informally now makes me feel closer to you. I like it very much.

209
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,310
I got close to CEO Anna.

210
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,230
It's my honor.

211
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,780
I received a gift from my daughter.

212
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,990
And I got closer to her.

213
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,790
I can see her smiling brightly at me.

214
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,950
Is this a dream?

215
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:26,390
Right, I am grateful to have this much.

216
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,770
I am so very grateful.

217
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:52,280
Chief Jo, you have an idea why I called you here.

218
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,680
Yes. I heard about it from my mom.

219
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,580
Your mother and I finished talking about it,

220
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:05,360
but I wanted to confirm your feelings directly.

221
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,790
You have feelings for Young Gook, don't you?

222
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,580
Oh, my! You do!

223
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,370
Since when? I didn't suspect at all.

224
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:21,950
You should have told me sooner. Then I would have jumped in to help you.

225
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:26,910
Actually, my feeling like this started not long ago.

226
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,400
Oh, I see.

227
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,590
That's why I didn't know.

228
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,380
Since I'm looking after the children at home

229
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,710
and spending a lot of time with Chairman,

230
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:43,270
I began to like him without knowing.

231
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,910
Okay, then.

232
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,240
I will speak to you directly and honestly.

233
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,460
I want to make you my daughter-in-law.

234
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,710
If it's okay with you,

235
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,920
I want to do everything I can to make you my daughter-in-law.

236
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,450
Do you like that idea?

237
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,930
Yes, Madam.

238
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,390
Give me your hands to me.

239
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:12,420
From this day on, you are my daughter-in-law. Okay?

240
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,410
Thank you, Madam.

241
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:18,320
I will do even better for you from now on.

242
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,820
Okay, okay.

243
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,600
But you know the picky personality of Young Gook.

244
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,410
And the fact that he hasn't gotten over his deceased wife.

245
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,660
That's why I am very sad.

246
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,270
That's why you have to be careful and not be noticeable

247
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,600
like the drizzle that wets the clothes very slowly.

248
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,120
Otherwise, it could all be for not, overnight.

249
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,370
Yes. I know that well.

250
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:49,700
Having said that, you know Chairman Lee better than anyone, right?

251
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,180
But to have you acknowledge me like this,

252
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:57,610
I feel secure. I feel like I can do anything.

253
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,290
Thinking you will be my daughter-in-law,

254
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:03,580
I also feel reliable as if I gained troops of soldiers!

255
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,620
Let's make it work.

256
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,710
Like a fantastic team.

257
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,320
Yes, Madam.

258
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,490
And, from now on, when we are just two of us like now,

259
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,600
call me, Mother-in-law.

260
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,530
Yes.

261
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:22,900
Mother-in-law.

262
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,410
Oh, Chief Jo!

263
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,370
Mother-In-law!

264
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:30,340
Mother-in-law! Oh, Chief Jo.

265
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,760
Daughter-in-law.

266
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,690
Ms. Park, are you going out to pick up Se Jong?

267
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,650
Yes.

268
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:48,350
I'll pick up Se Jong from kindergarten starting today.

269
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:54,390
I promised I'd pick him up as I walked him to the kindergarten this morning.

270
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:59,400
Chief Jo, why don't we tell Se Jong about it and change it from tomorrow?

271
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,670
Don't worry about such things. I'll talk about it to Se Jong.

272
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,370
Se Jong won't be surprised, would he?

273
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,180
Se Jong!

274
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,180
Where's Ms. Park?

275
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,950
Did she leave again?

276
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:31,320
Is she gone again?

277
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:37,120
No, Se Jong, Ms. Park is at home. She didn't go anywhere.

278
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,120
Really?

279
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,490
Of course! I won't lie to you.

280
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:47,360
But why did you come to pick me up, Chief Jo ajumma?

281
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,770
Why? Do you not want me to come?

282
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:01,070
Se Jong, I raised you since you were a baby,

283
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:04,530
and I love you so much.

284
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,940
But Se Jong, you only like Ms. Park

285
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,650
and seem not to like me.

286
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:15,540
So I'm very sad.

287
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,870
It's not that I don't like you.

288
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:27,120
Se Jong, did I do something wrong to you?

289
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,900
Did I give you a hard time?

290
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:33,370
If I did, let me know. I'll try to fix it.

291
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,290
Really?

292
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,590
Of course! Really.

293
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:43,510
I really like you, but I could have made a mistake unknowingly.

294
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:49,820
Then... I'll tell you.

295
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:54,780
You keep forcing me to eat the carrots and broccoli I don't like,

296
00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:00,380
and you always tell me to do homework, to wash my hands, to brush my teeth, to sit up straight,

297
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:04,460
and not to play games. All you do is scold me.

298
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,870
I'm really tired of it.

299
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:12,740
I see!

300
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,640
I did it so that you can stay healthy.

301
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,250
Also, I did it so that you can grow to be an amazing person like the Chairman.

302
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,950
That's why I told you to study.

303
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,080
But, I'm really sorry I made you tired, Se Jong.

304
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,950
I'll try to fix that from now on.

305
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:33,150
Really?

306
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:41,370
So Se Jong, can you forgive me and like me?

307
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,310
Okay.

308
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:46,770
I'll think about it.

309
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,910
Thank you.

310
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,470
Then, shall we head home now?

311
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,910
Let's go!

312
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,310
Driver Kim. Stop the car, please.

313
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,340
- I will buy you everything.
- Okay!

314
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,800
I want ice cream!

315
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,720
I'll walk home with the kids from hereon, so you can go home, Driver Kim.

316
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,070
Yes, Chairman.

317
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,380
Good night.

318
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,680
I want the orange flavor!

319
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,950
Okay! I'll get you everything.

320
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,170
Nice!

321
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,840
- It'll be delicious!
- Roar!

322
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:02,010
Dad, you surprised me!

323
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,220
Why did you do that!

324
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,620
I'm sorry!

325
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,480
Where are you all going at this hour?

326
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,640
We're going to eat ice cream!

327
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,020
Ice cream? What about dinner?

328
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,220
We already ate dinner.

329
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,850
We're doing this in celebration of finishing my mid-term,

330
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:23,160
and Se Chan and Se Jong did well on their homework today,

331
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,640
so Ms. Park said she'll buy ice creams for us!

332
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,110
Is that so?

333
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:32,130
Ms. Park, then can you let me join?

334
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,490
Yes, join us.

335
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:36,520
I'll buy ice cream for you too, Chairman.

336
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,340
Thank you.

337
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,700
Then, I'm going to hold your hand as well, Dad!

338
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,330
Shall we?

339
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,840
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

340
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,300
Can you do an airplane for me?

341
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,650
One, two, three!

342
00:25:58,239 --> 00:26:00,209
Hey!

343
00:26:00,209 --> 00:26:02,269
Dae...Dae Beom!

344
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,719
Dae Beom!

345
00:26:08,989 --> 00:26:11,799
Why are you here?

346
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:25,459
What? What is it?

347
00:26:32,209 --> 00:26:34,729
So did you decide on an item to sell?

348
00:26:34,729 --> 00:26:36,219
Chicken skewers.

349
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:39,949
- What? Chicken skewers?
- Chicken skewers?

350
00:26:39,949 --> 00:26:43,839
Do you know how much work goes into making chicken skewer?

351
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:47,819
Have you guys ever made one before?

352
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:51,799
Don't worry, Mom. These days, everybody uses pre-made ones.

353
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:54,029
You can buy sauces, too!

354
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:58,259
All we need to do is take that and grill it deliciously.

355
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:02,729
Really? The world has turned better.

356
00:27:02,729 --> 00:27:05,369
Chicken skewers are very popular these days, Grandma.

357
00:27:05,369 --> 00:27:06,259
Really?

358
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:08,089
I think you've chosen the right item.

359
00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:10,529
- Right?
- Right?

360
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:16,289
But Dae Beom. Do you have to do that?

361
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:21,279
Can't you just work for a company or gain a license from now on?

362
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,729
Not a business that's like chasing rainbows.

363
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:26,929
I'm so nervous you'll ruin it to the ground again!

364
00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:29,109
Mom, we need to be adventurous to succeed!

365
00:27:29,109 --> 00:27:31,549
I swear I won't fail this time, so don't worry.

366
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:34,149
We're starting bare hand, so what's there to lose?

367
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:36,219
Hey, Park Dae Beom!

368
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:37,809
Come outside!

369
00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:40,689
You sick bastard!

370
00:27:40,689 --> 00:27:42,489
- What?
- What is that sound?

371
00:27:42,489 --> 00:27:46,779
- Who is that woman shouting in the middle of the night?
 - Hey, Park Dae Beom!

372
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:49,529
I said, come out here!

373
00:27:56,929 --> 00:28:01,239
What? Ms. Se Ryun, how did you find this place?

374
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:06,039
Oh, hello, Driver Park!

375
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:07,929
It's so nice to meet you all!

376
00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:10,449
Hey, Lee Se Ryun, how can you come here?

377
00:28:10,449 --> 00:28:12,269
You should go.

378
00:28:12,269 --> 00:28:14,749
Hey, Park Dae Beom!

379
00:28:14,749 --> 00:28:19,359
Do you think you're better than me?

380
00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:25,349
I...

381
00:28:25,349 --> 00:28:28,889
I threw out my pride

382
00:28:28,889 --> 00:28:32,599
and asked you to get back together.

383
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:36,889
But how can you dump me?

384
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:40,529
Who do you think you are to dump me, you bastard!

385
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:42,869
Hey, Se Ryun!

386
00:28:42,869 --> 00:28:44,519
Wake up!

387
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:46,809
What's happening? What's going on?

388
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:49,169
Hey, young lady, wake up!

389
00:28:49,169 --> 00:28:52,099
- Grandma, why are you slapping her so hard?
- Hey, young lady!

390
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:54,889
Why are you protecting her? You've got nothing to say!

391
00:28:54,889 --> 00:28:56,639
What's wrong with this young lady?

392
00:28:56,639 --> 00:28:58,839
I'll take care of Se Ryun, so you guys go inside first!

393
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:00,289
Wake up!

394
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:02,919
Just go inside first! I'll take care of her.

395
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:05,819
Hey, Se Ryun. Father!

396
00:29:19,379 --> 00:29:23,209
Oh, my goodness...

397
00:29:23,209 --> 00:29:27,059
What kind of situation is this? I can't believe this.

398
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:30,749
What kind of irresponsible situation is this?

399
00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:35,659
My gosh, I've never seen a woman gets so drunk to the point

400
00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:40,029
she comes to someone else's house and falls asleep!

401
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:42,039
What's the point of being a rich family's daughter?

402
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:44,589
Everyone's the same when they are drunk.

403
00:29:44,589 --> 00:29:46,129
Let's all get out of here.

404
00:29:46,129 --> 00:29:48,099
She'll get sober if she gets some sleep.

405
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:50,779
Come on, let's go out.

406
00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:52,569
My goodness.

407
00:29:52,569 --> 00:29:55,559
Dae Beom, tell me the truth. What's going on?

408
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:58,949
Why would she come to this place?

409
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:02,789
Have you been seeing her again, behind my back?

410
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:06,979
No, we broke up back then! Didn't you hear what Se Ryun said earlier?

411
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:10,399
That's true. He saw how we got ill-treated at that house.

412
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,979
So Dae Beom wouldn't get back together with her.

413
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:15,309
We've got no money, but that doesn't mean we don't have dignity!

414
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:17,589
Mother, let's get out of the room.

415
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:19,769
- Let's go.
- It's crazy.

416
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:25,979
Then, did she cling to you when you rejected her?

417
00:30:25,979 --> 00:30:28,409
I'll send her when she wakes up. Please leave the room.

418
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:33,009
So I'm saying you didn't take advantage of her,

419
00:30:33,009 --> 00:30:37,289
but this older woman seduced innocent you!

420
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:39,259
Mom, what's the point of saying that now?

421
00:30:39,259 --> 00:30:41,999
Mom, get out. Get out of the room!

422
00:30:41,999 --> 00:30:43,999
That--

423
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:48,939
Se Ryun.

424
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,919
They are all con men! A family of con men!

425
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,359
They were all living here behind our backs and conspired together,

426
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,869
to trick our sweet Se Ryun and took her money! These dirtbags!

427
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:08,749
These little parasites did that!

428
00:31:08,749 --> 00:31:10,899
What? Dirtbags?

429
00:31:10,899 --> 00:31:13,519
Parasites? Con men?

430
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:19,019
What is so better of them to say such harsh words to others?

431
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:22,109
I mean, her daughter's drunk and sleeping in our house!

432
00:31:22,109 --> 00:31:24,269
I can't let this slide.

433
00:31:24,269 --> 00:31:27,879
Mom, what are you doing?

434
00:31:27,879 --> 00:31:30,309
Don't stop me. How does this work?

435
00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:34,389
Why? What are you doing with Se Ryun's phone?

436
00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:38,799
- Stop it! What are you trying to do?
- Get away from me!

437
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:47,539
Why is Se Ryun calling me at this hour?

438
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:50,989
Yes, Se Ryun. What is it--

439
00:31:50,989 --> 00:31:52,409
Who is this?

440
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:55,869
Come to my house right now, and take your daughter.

441
00:31:55,869 --> 00:32:00,449
What? Where is my daughter? Who are you!

442
00:32:00,449 --> 00:32:04,249
What? Parasite?

443
00:32:04,249 --> 00:32:05,859
Excuse me!

444
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:08,949
Who are you! Where is my daughter?

445
00:32:08,949 --> 00:32:11,989
My son said he doesn't like your daughter,

446
00:32:11,989 --> 00:32:16,359
but your daughter's drunk and sleeping in our house!

447
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:18,739
I'll send our house address through text,

448
00:32:18,739 --> 00:32:23,669
so pick up your daughter right now. Right now!

449
00:32:26,749 --> 00:32:30,539
Oh, my! Mrs. Yeoju.

450
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:33,169
Mrs. Yeoju, Mrs. Yeoju!

451
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:35,349
- Mrs. Yeoju.
- Yes, Madam?

452
00:32:35,349 --> 00:32:40,889
Tell Driver Kang to bring the car right now, and you need to come with me, Mrs. Yeoju.

453
00:32:40,889 --> 00:32:44,009
- Hurry up and get ready!
- I'm sorry?

454
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:46,239
Okay.

455
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:48,199
What's going on?

456
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:51,529
Where is Se Ryun?

457
00:32:51,529 --> 00:32:55,169
No, it's nothing. I'll be out for a moment.

458
00:32:55,169 --> 00:32:58,539
I'll be out for a moment. I'll be back soon!

459
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:03,879
Driver Kang.

460
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:06,049
Driver Kang, is this the right address?

461
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:07,889
Yes, this is the place.

462
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:11,199
Driver Kang, stay right here.

463
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:13,729
Mrs. Yeoju, let's go.

464
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:25,349
Chairman. It's me, Driver Kang.

465
00:33:25,349 --> 00:33:27,509
Here.

466
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:35,089
Oh, my goodness.

467
00:33:35,089 --> 00:33:39,119
Lee Se Ryun? Lee Se Ryun!

468
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:44,179
What happened? I mean, why is my daughter here like this?

469
00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:47,139
Oh? Are you trying to blame the innocent person right now?

470
00:33:47,139 --> 00:33:53,659
Why? Do you think we force-fed alcohol on your precious daughter and dragged her to our place?

471
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:57,459
My son said he didn't want to be with her. He rejected her!

472
00:33:57,459 --> 00:34:01,319
But your daughter chased him all the way here and is sleeping in our house!

473
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:04,679
What kind of nonsense--

474
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:11,209
If you can't believe me, wake your daughter up and ask her yourself.

475
00:34:13,999 --> 00:34:18,279
Se Ryun? Lee Se Ryun?

476
00:34:18,279 --> 00:34:23,779
- Se Ryun?
- I heard from my husband that your daughter is 36 years old.

477
00:34:23,779 --> 00:34:29,089
How dare she chase after our son, who's in his twenties?

478
00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:31,219
Oh, my goodness.

479
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:35,249
She's not even a year or two older, but seven years older!

480
00:34:35,249 --> 00:34:38,749
My goodness! My grandson is still a baby.

481
00:34:38,749 --> 00:34:43,499
How can she try to get my baby grandson? She's a total thief!

482
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:46,509
What did you say?! A thief?

483
00:34:46,509 --> 00:34:49,259
How dare you say that!

484
00:34:49,259 --> 00:34:57,969
Listen. Do you want to become in-laws with us, the parasite family?

485
00:34:57,989 --> 00:35:01,229
We don't want to do that either.

486
00:35:01,229 --> 00:35:04,079
So, stop lingering here,

487
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,619
and drag her out. Now!

488
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:11,349
This is ridiculous. Hey, Lee Se Ryun!

489
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:15,619
Lee Se Ryun, wake up. Wake up!

490
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:19,239
I said, wake up!

491
00:35:20,979 --> 00:35:25,089
It hurts! Who the heck are you!

492
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:28,399
- Mom.
- You little girl!

493
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:32,119
What are you doing here? Get up!

494
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:34,279
Mrs. Yeoju! What are you doing!

495
00:35:34,279 --> 00:35:37,129
- Ms. Se Ryun, let's go.
- I'm not going anywhere!

496
00:35:37,129 --> 00:35:43,029
Until I hear Dae Beom's head-over-heels with me,

497
00:35:43,029 --> 00:35:47,059
I'm not going anywhere. I won't leave!

498
00:35:47,059 --> 00:35:49,969
Wait, Dae Beom. Dae Beom?

499
00:35:49,969 --> 00:35:52,709
Dae Beom, where are you?

500
00:35:52,709 --> 00:35:56,059
Dae Beom! Dae Beom!

501
00:35:56,059 --> 00:36:00,369
See, I told you so! Take her out now. I don't want to see her face!

502
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:03,089
Hey! You!

503
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:05,539
Dae Beom, where are you!

504
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:08,279
Let's talk, please!

505
00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:13,329
Come out here, now! Come out, Dae Beom!

506
00:36:13,329 --> 00:36:16,139
Oh, my goodness.

507
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:19,139
Se Ryun, you should go. Don't give your mother a hard time.

508
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:22,789
Dae Beom. I said I'm sorry!

509
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:27,059
I said I misunderstood. So, that's right.

510
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:30,639
So let's get back together, can we?

511
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:33,089
Oh, please!

512
00:36:33,089 --> 00:36:36,919
Mom. Give me and Dae Beom permission.

513
00:36:36,919 --> 00:36:40,109
Say it! Say just that, please!

514
00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:43,209
- Mom, I'll be good!
- Oh, my!

515
00:36:43,209 --> 00:36:46,469
- Please, Mom!
- How on earth can this happen?

516
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:50,769
I've never seen such a sight in my entire life.

517
00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:54,619
- Mom, please allow me once.
- You little girl!

518
00:36:54,619 --> 00:36:57,469
Come with me, you little girl!

519
00:36:57,469 --> 00:37:01,429
Oh, wait. Dae Beom!

520
00:37:01,429 --> 00:37:05,839
- Come out, you little girl!
- Dae Beom!

521
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,159
- Se Ryun!
- Oh, my!

522
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:11,429
Where do you think you're going?

523
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:14,069
If you follow her, you'll die by my hands.

524
00:37:14,069 --> 00:37:18,119
Get over here!

525
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:20,169
You're not going out.

526
00:37:21,549 --> 00:37:25,289
That feels exhilarating.

527
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:28,419
Se Ryun! Se Ryun!

528
00:37:28,419 --> 00:37:32,079
No! You bastard!

529
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,499
That's exhilarating.

530
00:37:33,499 --> 00:37:34,939
Come out.

531
00:37:34,939 --> 00:37:38,669
Mom! Let me go!

532
00:37:38,669 --> 00:37:41,299
I still have things to say with Dae Beom!

533
00:37:41,299 --> 00:37:44,189
You smell like alcohol! You're insane!

534
00:37:44,189 --> 00:37:47,459
You've gone completely crazy!

535
00:37:47,459 --> 00:37:49,919
Madam!

536
00:38:02,299 --> 00:38:04,879
What's going on right now?

537
00:38:04,879 --> 00:38:09,709
Lee Se Ryun. What are you doing!

538
00:38:09,709 --> 00:38:13,029
No, it's not what you think, Young Gook.

539
00:38:13,029 --> 00:38:16,419
That conman player took Se Ryun's heart--

540
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,139
No, Oppa.

541
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:21,339
That's not it.

542
00:38:21,339 --> 00:38:27,299
I want to get back together with Dae Beom,

543
00:38:27,299 --> 00:38:30,749
but he said he doesn't want to!

544
00:38:30,749 --> 00:38:35,549
I must have hurt Dae Beom's pride!

545
00:38:37,929 --> 00:38:40,749
As long as you and mom give permission,

546
00:38:40,749 --> 00:38:45,289
Dae Beom will return to me!

547
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:50,389
We were truly in love with each other.

548
00:38:50,389 --> 00:38:56,099
No! She's drunk right now, so she's just rambling.

549
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:58,639
You make sure Se Ryun can't leave the house.

550
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:01,249
Yes, I'll keep her with me so she can't go anywhere.

551
00:39:01,249 --> 00:39:04,429
Okay? Don't worry. Don't worry at all.

552
00:39:06,669 --> 00:39:09,219
Let go of me!

553
00:39:09,219 --> 00:39:12,859
You're really gone crazy!

554
00:39:12,859 --> 00:39:14,849
Why are you hitting me!

555
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:16,869
Get in the car! Now!

556
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:19,609
I need to see an end to this today!

557
00:39:19,609 --> 00:39:22,539
Let me go. Let me go!

558
00:39:22,539 --> 00:39:24,749
Mrs. Yeoju, Driver Kang, what are you doing! Put her into the car!

559
00:39:24,749 --> 00:39:26,199
No, I won't leave!

560
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:28,269
Se Ryun...

561
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:31,019
You little girl! Get in the car, now!

562
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:33,529
Get in the car!

563
00:39:33,529 --> 00:39:35,179
Just get in!

564
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:39,079
Push her in. Get her in!

565
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:41,899
My goodness! I can't live because of you!

566
00:39:41,899 --> 00:39:44,449
I can't live peacefully because of you!

567
00:39:55,189 --> 00:39:56,869
Do you need something, CEO?

568
00:39:56,869 --> 00:39:59,549
It's okay. I'm just here for water.

569
00:39:59,549 --> 00:40:03,309
But, where is Madam?

570
00:40:03,309 --> 00:40:05,699
I saw you go out together.

571
00:40:05,699 --> 00:40:09,469
Madam will be staying with Ms. Se Ryun for a while.

572
00:40:09,469 --> 00:40:12,429
What's going on? From what I heard in my room,

573
00:40:12,429 --> 00:40:15,739
it seems like something happened to Se Ryun.

574
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:18,919
The thing is... Don't get me started.

575
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:24,359
Ms. Se Ryun barged into Driver Park's home completely drunk.

576
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:27,429
She was sleeping there. Madam was barely able to take Se Ryun home.

577
00:40:27,429 --> 00:40:30,799
Oh, my goodness. Was she at Driver Park's home?

578
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:32,939
What is going on?

579
00:40:32,939 --> 00:40:36,409
We thought Driver Park's son was a playboy,

580
00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:38,269
but we were wrong after seeing what happened today.

581
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,799
I see.

582
00:40:39,799 --> 00:40:44,709
Yes. She was begging Driver Park's son to date her again

583
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:49,679
and telling Madam if she disapproves of their relationship, she won't go home.

584
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:51,589
It was chaotic.

585
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:53,069
At that house?

586
00:40:53,069 --> 00:40:56,129
Yes, I thought I'd die of embarrassment.

587
00:40:56,129 --> 00:40:59,819
Ms. Se Ryun will soon be 40, but it seems like she still thinks she's 20 years old.

588
00:40:59,819 --> 00:41:03,559
You can't do that to a guy who's 7 years younger than you.

589
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:06,179
When will she grow up?

590
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:09,259
So it seems like Driver Park's son didn't approach her for an ulterior motive,

591
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:12,529
but they really liked each other.

592
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:34,239
What brings you here, Chairman?

593
00:41:35,749 --> 00:41:38,139
I would like to talk to you, Driver Park.

594
00:41:38,139 --> 00:41:41,149
Could you give me some of your time?

595
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:52,249
I horribly misunderstood you and your family.

596
00:41:52,249 --> 00:41:56,359
I came to apologize for that.

597
00:41:56,359 --> 00:42:03,589
I am sincerely sorry for my rude actions and words that hurt you.

598
00:42:03,589 --> 00:42:06,919
It's okay, Chairman.

599
00:42:08,739 --> 00:42:12,069
We were at fault too.

600
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:15,129
I brought my wife to the place,

601
00:42:15,129 --> 00:42:19,869
and letting her stay without discussing it with you was my fault.

602
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:22,879
It was something that you could easily misunderstand.

603
00:42:22,879 --> 00:42:27,609
I'm sorry. I would like to apologize too.

604
00:42:30,129 --> 00:42:38,079
I think it would be best if we could quietly end what happened between your son and Se Ryun.

605
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,169
Of course.

606
00:42:40,169 --> 00:42:43,749
I understand what you're saying.

607
00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:48,579
I think they happen to meet each other and end up where they are.

608
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:51,689
But Dae Beom is not someone trying to reach outside of his bound.

609
00:42:51,689 --> 00:42:53,499
Don't worry about it.

610
00:42:53,499 --> 00:42:59,729
I am grateful for your understanding.

611
00:42:59,729 --> 00:43:05,809
I believe Ms. Park will be comfortable staying at my place now.

612
00:43:05,809 --> 00:43:07,229
Excuse me?

613
00:43:07,229 --> 00:43:12,029
I know Ms. Park is your daughter.

614
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:18,089
How did you know?

615
00:43:19,539 --> 00:43:21,169
Dan Dan has no part in this.

616
00:43:21,169 --> 00:43:23,469
She didn't know anything. I'm telling you the truth.

617
00:43:23,469 --> 00:43:26,149
I know. Don't worry.

618
00:43:26,149 --> 00:43:28,029
I heard everything.

619
00:43:28,029 --> 00:43:32,649
I'm happy and relieved that all the misunderstanding has been cleared.

620
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:36,819
Chairman.

621
00:43:36,819 --> 00:43:39,389
Thank you so much.

622
00:43:39,429 --> 00:43:44,869
For not being honest from the start,

623
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:47,389
I'm really sorry.

624
00:43:51,439 --> 00:43:54,229
Dan Dan. It's your dad.

625
00:43:54,229 --> 00:43:56,739
Could you see me right now?

626
00:43:56,739 --> 00:43:58,689
What did you say?

627
00:43:58,689 --> 00:44:00,799
CEO Anna told him?

628
00:44:01,999 --> 00:44:07,949
CEO Anna must've told Chairman in an understanding manner about my situation.

629
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:11,469
That's how I was able to work there again.

630
00:44:11,469 --> 00:44:14,119
Why didn't you tell me?

631
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:17,389
You should've told me.

632
00:44:17,389 --> 00:44:20,939
I didn't want you to worry.

633
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:24,209
But how did you know about this?

634
00:44:24,209 --> 00:44:26,189
The Chairman came in person

635
00:44:26,189 --> 00:44:28,989
and apologized for all the misunderstanding.

636
00:44:28,989 --> 00:44:30,269
He even mentioned you.

637
00:44:30,269 --> 00:44:31,479
Really?

638
00:44:31,479 --> 00:44:34,789
Did he personally apologize to you?

639
00:44:34,789 --> 00:44:36,439
Yes.

640
00:44:36,439 --> 00:44:41,969
For someone like the Chairman who has everything in his hand to come in person to apologize to me,

641
00:44:41,969 --> 00:44:44,599
I didn't know what to do.

642
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:47,359
He seems like a good person.

643
00:44:49,769 --> 00:44:55,649
I heard Ms. Se Ryun, Se Jong's aunt, was at your place.

644
00:44:57,799 --> 00:45:01,219
Did you hear about that as well?

645
00:45:01,219 --> 00:45:05,559
To be honest, I misjudged Dae Beom as well.

646
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:12,309
I thought, how could he mooch off a rich lady even if he's having a hard time.

647
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:14,629
I told you.

648
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:18,979
I didn't raise you guys like that.

649
00:45:18,979 --> 00:45:22,629
Then, did they really like each other?

650
00:45:24,009 --> 00:45:25,779
It seems so.

651
00:45:25,779 --> 00:45:28,159
So I feel bad.

652
00:45:31,919 --> 00:45:34,229
How about you stop by home one day?

653
00:45:34,229 --> 00:45:38,709
No one will say anything about you coming home since the Chairman knows.

654
00:45:38,709 --> 00:45:41,599
Okay. Maybe later.

655
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,850
I'm back from school.

656
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:47,220
Welcome home, Se Chan.

657
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,560
We're going to the vacation home today, right?

658
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:53,460
We're going to celebrate my birthday at the vacation home this time as well, right?

659
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,260
I want to have a barbecue at the vacation home.

660
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:59,110
I also want to fish with my dad.

661
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:02,170
Okay. I'll let your dad know.

662
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:04,120
I'm excited!

663
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,230
If we're going, we need to leave now, so get ready.

664
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:09,030
Okay.

665
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:12,010
Could you get things ready to go to the vacation home?

666
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:16,190
Okay. The children will be excited.

667
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,270
Mom. Please!

668
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:23,140
Unlock this door.

669
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,830
It's so suffocating that I think I'm going to die.

670
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:30,540
Just die from suffocation, then.

671
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:33,080
Mom. I need to go to the bathroom.

672
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,710
I really need to go.

673
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:36,680
I think it's going to come out!

674
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,340
You can just use the bathroom in your room. What are you trying to pull?

675
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,750
The bathroom here...

676
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:44,920
is clogged.

677
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,780
Mom. Open up! Seriously.

678
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:55,170
Mom. Hurry up and open the door!

679
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:58,370
Yes, Chief Jo?

680
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:00,210
Did you eat anything?

681
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:04,440
It's not time to eat! I just want to die.

682
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:10,420
You need to eat and gather strength at times like this, Madam.

683
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,220
Also, Se Ryun will get over it soon.

684
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:16,970
So don't worry about it too much.

685
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:21,320
It will, right? It will pass like the wind, right?

686
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:24,970
Of course.

687
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:30,460
We're going to celebrate Se Chan's birthday at the vacation home.

688
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:33,870
So why don't you join us for some fresh air?

689
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:35,980
Bring Se Ryun as well.

690
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:41,190
We can't. She's crazy about him, so she might run out to see him.

691
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:45,320
Chief Jo.

692
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:49,810
This is a good chance.

693
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:51,000
I'm sorry?

694
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,840
When you get there, leave the children to Ms. Park,

695
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:58,170
drink some wine with Young Gook,

696
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:01,120
and say, "how about we go see the stars?"

697
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:06,030
And stroll in the dark forest together and make some history.

698
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:08,180
Goodness, Madam.

699
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:10,990
The children won't even look for their dad when they're with Ms. Park.

700
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:15,530
This is such a great chance. You know what I'm saying, right?

701
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:19,040
Goodness, Madam.

702
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,850
Also, don't take Mrs. Yeoju this time.

703
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:26,570
She will only be a bother. Just take Ms. Park. Do you understand?

704
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,810
I will call Mrs. Yeoju in advance.

705
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:37,250
Mom. If you don't open this door, don't even dream about getting my company share.

706
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:39,740
I'm making myself clear right now!

707
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,030
I'm serious.

708
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:44,490
I seriously want you to be my daughter-in-law soon.

709
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:47,500
I think I have to rely on only you from now on.

710
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,450
My daughter is useless...

711
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:54,220
Sarah.

712
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:57,020
Take this with you.

713
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,600
What is this?

714
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,980
Make sure you wear this tonight.

715
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,910
Tonight? What is this?

716
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:12,620
Mom! You're out of your mind!

717
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:16,690
How can I wear this when there are children?

718
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:20,470
Just think you're crazy and walk around with this on after the children are asleep.

719
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:23,310
Then he can forget about his dead wife and look at you.

720
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:24,780
Seriously.

721
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:26,560
It's hard to stop you, Mom.

722
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:30,290
Don't say anything more and take this with you.

723
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:34,740
My goodness, Mom. Seriously.

724
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,990
- I don't know! I'll get going!
- You should wear that!

725
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:39,100
I don't know.

726
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:45,050
I hope something happens this time...

727
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:47,940
But why is my stomach keep aching?

728
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:53,440
This is strange.

729
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,170
The weather is so nice.

730
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:01,100
Welcome!

731
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,440
Hello.

732
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,720
You've all grown up a lot.

733
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,230
Hello. My name is Park Dan Dan.

734
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:09,500
This is their tutor.

735
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,080
What about the Chairman?

736
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,860
He should be here soon.

737
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,970
There he is.

738
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:31,060
Hello, Chairman.

739
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:32,920
How have you been?

740
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,020
Good.

741
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,330
Let's go fishing, Dad.

742
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:37,580
Is everything ready?

743
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:40,270
Of course. Everything is ready for fishing.

744
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,650
I'm excited!

745
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:46,410
I'll have the barbecue ready by the time you come back from fishing, so enjoy.

746
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,140
Okay. Let's go.

747
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,020
Okay.

748
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:53,020
Let's go!

749
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,460
Yes, Mom. What?

750
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:01,210
How bad is it? Okay.

751
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:04,010
Ms. Park.

752
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:07,320
My mother is in the emergency room, so I'll be back soon.

753
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,860
Okay. Don't worry about here.

754
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:11,990
I'll be back soon.

755
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:15,030
Hurry up, Ms. Park.

756
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,290
Okay.

757
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:33,070
Noona, can we go and...

758
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:34,900
Okay.

759
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:51,880
Noona. Here's a gift.

760
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,630
A gift?

761
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:55,650
What is it?

762
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,680
You're an idiot. You always fall for it.

763
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,310
You're dead today.

764
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:04,770
Lee Se Chan, come here!

765
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:07,560
Jenny! Se Chan! Be careful, or you'll fall.

766
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,190
You're dead by me today.

767
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:12,220
Come here!

768
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:18,570
You! Come here!

769
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:21,210
Ms. Park!

770
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:23,930
Stop it, Se Jong.

771
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:27,390
I'm scared of it.

772
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:28,740
Touch it!

773
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:31,250
Stop it! Stop!

774
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:32,770
Touch it.

775
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:36,710
Hold on a moment, Se Jong. Hold on.

776
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:42,090
Hey, Se Chan!

777
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:45,460
You! Come here!

778
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:49,290
Stop it, Se Jong.

779
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,680
Stop it, Se Jong. Stop.

780
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,990
Please stop it.

781
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:58,700
I'm scared.

782
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,080
Se Jong.

783
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,620
Have a taste.

784
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:05,880
I cooked it with a special grade beef.

785
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,700
The broth should be very tasty with a clean taste.

786
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,670
Let me try it.

787
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:16,570
The broth is really clean and delicious.

788
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:17,940
Right?

789
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,810
Did I get the job now?

790
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:24,750
But my son is pretty picky.

791
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:30,600
This is tasty to me, but I'm not sure about my son.

792
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:35,820
How about we give you a month?

793
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:38,640
This woman!

794
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,800
Did you just say you'll use me for a month and then fire me?

795
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:46,170
So basically, I'm a temporary.

796
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:49,580
Why? Are you not happy with it?

797
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:52,680
No. Of course not.

798
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,210
I'm grateful for even a temporary position at this age.

799
00:53:55,210 --> 00:54:00,340
I will do my best for a month.

800
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:05,990
My son must be here.

801
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:08,470
Son!

802
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:10,610
Son.

803
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:12,090
My son. My love.

804
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:13,750
My baby. You're here.

805
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,720
- How have you been?
- Good.

806
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,160
Hello, Doctor.

807
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,040
I heard a lot about you from Madam.

808
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,500
This is the new housekeeper.

809
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,690
Hello.

810
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:28,000
Come on in.

811
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,060
She made your favorite Pho.

812
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:36,110
Let's eat.

813
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:40,400
He's not that sociable, but he's tall and handsome.

814
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:43,810
Hello.
 [Security Office]

815
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:45,790
Are you sure you can work as a security guard?

816
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:47,880
I should do anything.

817
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,920
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.

818
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:54,810
This job may look easy, but there is a lot of work.

819
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:57,620
I will do my best as I learn.

820
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:14,500
I'm sorry!

821
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,750
CEO Kim.

822
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:26,890
What brings you here, Driver Park?

823
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:32,180
Starting from tomorrow, I'll be working here as a security guard. I just got out from the interview.

824
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:34,600
I see.

825
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,930
Are you going somewhere, CEO? Let me carry this for you.

826
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:39,970
It's okay. Give it to me.

827
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:43,510
- Let me hold it for you.
- It's fine...

828
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:47,370
I also have something to say to you.

829
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:49,480
To me?

830
00:55:56,430 --> 00:56:01,010
This is where I stay when I'm in Korea.

831
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:06,050
But this time, I want to spend more time with the children, so I'm only working here.

832
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:07,920
I see.

833
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:14,880
He can't recognize me when I am this close to him.

834
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:20,780
What did you want to say to me?

835
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:28,350
Dan Dan told me that thanks to you, the misunderstanding with the Chairman had been cleared.

836
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:30,450
If it weren't for you,

837
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:37,050
Dan Dan would've been in an awkward position. Thank you.

838
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:42,560
It's nothing. I just felt bad for Ms. Park's situation,

839
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:46,700
so I just told Chairman Lee as it is. That's all.

840
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:51,200
It's not easy for someone to help in a situation like that.

841
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,060
You looked kindly at Dan Dan and helped her.

842
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:58,590
I don't know how to thank you.

843
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:03,090
It's nothing. Please don't worry about it.

844
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:06,930
Thank you. Then, I'll get going.

845
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:26,920
Mom? Are you okay, Mom?

846
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:29,320
Why are you here?

847
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:33,200
Why aren't you at the vacation home?

848
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,910
What do you mean, why? Your appendix ruptured.

849
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,580
Why did my perfectly fine appendix have to rupture today?

850
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:46,660
I'm okay, so you should go now.

851
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:48,640
How can I leave you when you just had surgery?

852
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:53,240
It's not a big deal. Just go.

853
00:57:57,470 --> 00:57:59,320
I passed gas.

854
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,910
It's good now.

855
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:04,700
So go. Go right now.

856
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:10,170
Go and wear the lingerie that I gave you and drink wine with the Chairman and you know...

857
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:11,690
Did you understand?

858
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:13,230
I'm really going then.

859
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:14,980
- Hurry up and go.
- I'm really going then.

860
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:18,010
Hurry up and go.

861
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:22,890
Nurse!

862
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:26,000
My stomach...

863
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:31,630
This looks delicious!

864
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:48,880
Ms. Park, why don't you eat too? You're so busy taking care of Se Jong that you're not eating.

865
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,230
Yes. Why don't you eat as well, Chairman?

866
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:53,810
Dad, Ms. Park. Let's do cheers.

867
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:56,080
Shall we?

868
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,960
Cheers!

869
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:02,350
Cheers!

870
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,500
Ta-da!

871
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:19,040
It's cake!

872
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:32,370
One, two, three, four.

873
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:35,510

874
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:38,700

Look over here, everyone.

879
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:56,480
One, two, three.

880
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:03,970
Happy birthday, Se Chan.

881
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:09,400
The cake looks good.

882
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:13,100
Happy birthday, Lee Se Chan!

883
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,800
- Jenny...
-Damn you.

884
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,080
You're dead, Noona.

885
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:28,110
♫  A smile blooms in every step ♫

Ms. Park!

894
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,140
It's for Se Jong.

895
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:54,090
I'm always on Se Jong's side.

896
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:56,560
Here!

897
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,620
Oh, yeah?

898
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:02,010
You're all coming for me?

899
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:05,280
You better watch out.

Chairman.

905
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:33,010
Your face was the only clean one.

♫  You're the only one that I was looking for ♫

01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:39,380
You better watch out!

909

912
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:57,950
♫ You're the only one that I was looking for  ♫

913
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,150
Where's my cell phone?

914
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:33,790
That's strange. I'm sure I put it in my pocket.

915
01:02:39,610 --> 01:02:43,740
Se Jong, Stop! I'm scared.

916
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:51,600
I must have dropped it then.

917
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,670
Ms. Park, where are you going?

918
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:05,200
Why are you out here instead of sleeping?

919
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:09,040
Ah, I'm going to sleep with my brother tonight.

920
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:11,800
Really? Ah, Se Jong.

921
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:16,640
I think I left my cell phone at the fishing dock, so I'll be back soon.

922
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:19,270
Why don't you go to sleep with your brother first?

923
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:23,440
Ms. Park. Do you want me to come with you?

924
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:27,920
Mr. Se Jong. I can go on my own.

925
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:32,490
I will be right back, so you go to sleep, okay?

926
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:50,610
Is this not the place?

927
01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:54,250
I'm sure it's this way.

928
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:20,670
What's going on, Se Chan and Se Jong?

929
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:22,210
Do you want to sleep here together?

930
01:04:22,210 --> 01:04:27,410
Dad, Se Jong said Ms. Park went to find her cell phone,

931
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:29,520
but she hasn't come back still.

932
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:32,370
It's been a long while since she left.

933
01:04:32,370 --> 01:04:36,510
What are you saying? When did she leave?

934
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:40,860
A while back. A long while ago.

935
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:42,920
Really?

936
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:55,410
Where is this place?

937
01:04:55,410 --> 01:04:59,240
I must have gone the wrong way.

938
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:10,310
What's with this? Has it run out of battery?

939
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:13,880
Which way is it to the vacation house?

940
01:05:15,630 --> 01:05:18,910
What am I going to do?

941
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:34,450
Ms. Park!

942
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:39,210
Ms. Park!

943
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:42,280
Park Dan Dan!

944
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,840
Please leave a message after the beep.

945
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:49,650
What happened? Where did she go?

946
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:53,610
Did something happen to her?

947
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:55,930
Ms. Park!

948
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:45,350
Where am I?

949
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:49,960
Which way is the East, and which way is the West?

950
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:53,610
Which way is the vacation house?

951
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:11,050
Please help me! Is anyone there?

952
01:07:11,050 --> 01:07:14,590
Please save me!

953
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:18,910
Ms. Park! Ms. Park!

954
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,140
Ms. Park.

955
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:25,600
Is anyone there?

956
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:31,120
Where are you, Ms. Park!

957
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:35,460
Over here. I am over here!

958
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,220
Over here. Here!

959
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:42,090
I'm here. Over here!

960
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,880
Ms. Park, where are you?

961
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:51,780
Here, I am here!

962
01:07:53,630 --> 01:07:56,140
Ms. Park.

963
01:07:58,850 --> 01:08:01,100
Chaiman Lee!

964
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:11,910
♫ When I walk this road, it makes me cry ♫

965
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:18,710
♫ It reminds me of that person's touch ♫

966
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:26,330
♫ I couldn't hold her and just trembled my heart ♫

967
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:33,000
♫ My beautiful love ♫

968
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:40,780
♫ Why do you run away, love. Like a shy child ♫

969
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:47,490
♫ In case I lose it, I hold it tight ♫

970
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:54,570
♫ But love always runs away, chased by longing ♫

971
01:08:54,570 --> 01:09:01,330
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

972
01:09:01,330 --> 01:09:09,530
♫ I have to abandon the longing and the grieves ♫

973
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:13,220
[Young Lady and a Gentleman]

974
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:17,000
Why did you come all the way out here at night? What if something had happened?

975
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,180
We have no choice. I will carry you on my back.

976
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:21,420
Why is my heart beating so fast?

977
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:24,680
How dare she get on Chairman's back?

978
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:26,860
- Excuse me. Why are you keep following me?
- I'm sorry?

979
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:29,400
Are you trying to flirt with me?

980
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,490
Oh, my goodness, how could this happen?

981
01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:35,380
She said it is the photo of Madam's younger brother that she lost when they were young.

982
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:36,450
What are you saying?

983
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:37,560
Hello, mother.

984
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:40,730
Listen to me, old Miss. Don't think about playing around with my son again.

985
01:09:40,730 --> 01:09:44,040
You have to go to see a psychiatrist, seriously!

986
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:47,030
I think he must be hiding a woman somewhere.

987
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:50,560
How else can he ignore you when he sees you every day?

988
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:51,800
Chairman?

989
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:57,400
She came in here to get Chairman from the beginning.
