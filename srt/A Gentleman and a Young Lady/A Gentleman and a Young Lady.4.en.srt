[Episode 4]

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,940
Hi, I'm Park Dan Dan--

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:13,260
Dan...Dan Dan?

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,990
Dad?

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:22,510
Oh! Oh my, look who's here! It's really Dan Dan!

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,730
Mom?

7
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,820
What about you? Why are you here?

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,470
I got a job here as an in-home tutor.

9
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,260
Then what about you and Mom? Why are you here, Dad?

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,790
Your Dad got a job as an in-home personal driver! It hasn't been that long!

11
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,080
Oh my, what is all this?

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:52,990
Then, the Mr. Park was you, Dad?

13
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:58,340
No way... How can you do such work here, Dad?

14
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:04,830
Hey, Park Dan Dan. You should have contacted us that you got a job here! You didn't even pick up our calls.

15
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,770
Do you know how much we worried about you?

16
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,650
We were worried whether you were dead, alive, or eating any food.

17
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,000
Look how much weight your Dad lost because he was worried about you!

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,020
It's okay now that we've reunited, all fine and good.

19
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:24,080
Nothing happened, right? You're not sick, are you?

20
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,360
I kept hearing Dan Dan's voice somewhere, so I thought I imagined things.

21
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,360
But my ears weren't wrong.

22
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,100
Oh my, what a coincidence this is! Under one roof!

23
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:48,390
So what are you going to do now? What will the Chairman think once he realizes this situation?

24
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,660
Do you think it makes sense for a dad and a daughter happened to get a job at the same house?

25
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,500
Ah, now that I think about it, that's true.

26
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,680
He might take this weird and might think we planned this out.

27
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,840
Let's just explain this honestly. I'm sure he'll understand.

28
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:11,850
That's what you think. Think about this in his shoes! He might find it very suspicious.

29
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:18,940
Bringing it up might have both of you fired. You don't even have a house to go back to. Do you have a plan?

30
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:24,240
Who lost that house? Whose fault do you think this is?

31
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,740
What? How can you say that to your mom after not seeing each other in so long?

32
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,500
What are you doing?

33
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:41,410
I'll discuss this with Chief Jo, so pretend you don't know anything like right now.

34
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:47,640
Like Mom said, we can't both get fired since there's no backup plan.

35
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:57,250
Wait, but why are you here, Mom?

36
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,630
Have you been hiding here in secret?

37
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,450
No! It's not that.

38
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,910
We couldn't find a house yet, so I'm just here until we get a new place to move into.

39
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,140
What?

40
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,680
No matter what, how can you hide in someone else's house?

41
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,920
What happens to Dad if you get caught? Do you even think at all, Mom?

42
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,400
What? Look at that girl talking!

43
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,980
Hey! Who does she resemble to talk so mean?

44
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,040
Where are you going? I said I would take care of everything.

45
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,890
I can't live off your support forever. I'm Park Dae Beom.

46
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:59,090
Baby, why are you talking like that? I said I'm fine!

47
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,720
Baby, are you doing this because you can't trust me?

48
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,780
It's not that I can't trust you.

49
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,830
Your mom might come over anytime, and I can't hide in the closet every time.

50
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,260
I...I can't run around naked again.

51
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,960
Alright. I'll make sure my Mom never comes by again. Then, it's fine, right?

52
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:27,510
That doesn't fix the problem. I've realized for sure this time that you and I are different.

53
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:35,890
Se Ryun. I'll quickly get a job and return to you as a confident man. Can you wait for me until then?

54
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:42,330
Baby, you're already a proud man. So you don't need to leave.

55
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,400
I'm going to solve everything. So trust me, okay?

56
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,530
Se Ryun.

57
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:53,400
What? He's the son of Mi So Steel's Company? Really?

58
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,800
Of course!

59
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,000
Then why did he run away? What's so shameful?

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,360
It's not because he's shameful.

61
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,730
But he was embarrassed!

62
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:09,380
I mean, would you be able to greet someone in a bathrobe, Mom?

63
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,830
Well, that's right. Being naked in someone else's daughter's house is...

64
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:18,230
If it had been the past, he would have been beaten to a pulp with bats.

65
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:22,340
You should have told me earlier! I'm letting this slide because he's Mi So Steel's son!

66
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,300
If I knew, I would've been nice to him.

67
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,060
I was going to introduce him to you when the right time comes, Mom.

68
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,160
So Mom, pretend you don't know about anything for now. Okay?

69
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:41,350
I get it, I get it. But there's nothing good for dragging it out too long.

70
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,790
When are you going to introduce us?

71
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:48,390
Ah, just wait a little longer. It's a new thing.

72
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:54,010
Your brother will immediately agree as well if you tell him it's a son of Mi So Steels!

73
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:58,090
But don't say that to him yet.

74
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,790
When it becomes more certain, I'll tell him myself.

75
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:09,210
Alright. The more important a matter is, the more secretive it should be.

76
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,900
No wonder he did look like a rich boy.

77
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,650
He was running manly like a sport's player!

78
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,080
Oh, you girl.

79
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,710
I think you chose the right man this time!

80
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,900
Of course! Do you think I'll date anybody?

81
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,800
Oh, look at this girl!

82
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,250
Se Ryun. This is your favorite seasoned tofu and lotus root salad.

83
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,070
Oh, I'll eat them myself.

84
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:48,310
Oppa. Is there any good news?

85
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,010
Good news?

86
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,270
I mean, I'm asking if you made any girlfriend recently.

87
00:06:54,270 --> 00:07:00,100
Oh! Oppa. You're not planning to live alone forever, are you?

88
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,820
What do you mean by living alone? He's still very young, so he'll have someone eventually.

89
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,690
I mean, he has a very special condition.

90
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:15,850
I think it's better to find someone around him since the person will have to get along with the kids.

91
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:21,720
I like... Gook Hee Unni a lot!

92
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:28,480
She's modest, friendly, and her personality's consistent, Mom.

93
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,920
Oppa. What do you think about Gook Hee Unni?

94
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:38,690
You're right! Mrs. Jang's quite friendly, and her family's pretty good.

95
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,930
And she's a university professor, so imagine how well she'd teach the kids!

96
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:45,750
Se Ryun, how long are you going to live like this?

97
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,280
Do you intend on coming back to the company?

98
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,420
Oppa, it's only been two months since I've started my break. So please leave me alone.

99
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,020
Right. Let Se Ryun take her break for now.

100
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,510
Se Ryun has to have a relationship as well!

101
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:06,070
You better not date any random guys.

102
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:10,200
What random guys? You don't have to worry about that.

103
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,970
Our Se Ryun has a very high standard!

104
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,970
Why isn't Dan Dan contacting us?

105
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:30,430
She was so confident about looking into it herself, but she's taking so long!

106
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:36,450
Honey, why don't you call Dan Dan? We need to set a plan!

107
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:42,280
Just wait a bit longer! Dan Dan would be busy with her work, so she can't call us anytime.

108
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:47,630
I'm saying it because I'm nervous! I mean, how does such a thing happen?

109
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,760
I know.

110
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,120
Do you think the Chairman will understand this situation?

111
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,180
As I said, he wouldn't understand it.

112
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,590
Does it make any sense for a father and a daughter to end up in the same house to work without knowing?

113
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:02,900
It's like saying, "we're a suspicious family."

114
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:07,370
Right. It won't be understandable.

115
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,400
This is all because of Dan Dan.

116
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:18,000
I mean, why did she block our calls? If we'd been calling each other beforehand, this wouldn't have happened!

117
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,260
Geez.

118
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,680
Teacher. You're going to pick me up later, right?

119
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,820
You're not going somewhere far, are you?

120
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:44,190
Of course! I'll pick you up later, Se Jong. So don't worry.

121
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:52,890
Teacher. Are you going to keep the promise that you're going to stay with me for a long time?

122
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:58,900
What should I do? My Dad and I can't stay here together.

123
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,710
What? Are you serious?

124
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:09,700
The previous housekeeper hid that she was family with the driver, and they founded that out?

125
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,930
What kind of strange people are they?

126
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:19,790
So since then, they never hired people who are relatives or families to each other.

127
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,130
Then you couldn't even bring it up to Chief Jo?

128
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,990
What are you saying, Honey?

129
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:28,960
They never hire people who are family! What do you think that means?

130
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:35,390
It means once they know that you and Dan Dan are father and daughter, both of you might get fired!

131
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:38,930
Dan Dan. Then what should we do? What do you think--

132
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,750
Why are you asking?

133
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:45,520
Isn't one person staying better than both of you getting fired?

134
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,110
We can't help it. Dan Dan, you'll have to leave.

135
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,530
Mom, why are you asking me to leave?

136
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,970
I barely managed to find this job while staying over at my friends' houses.

137
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,230
I have nowhere to go if I leave!

138
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,250
Do you think we have one?

139
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,770
You might be one person, but we're two people!

140
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,470
Where should we go if your Dad has to quit?

141
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,320
Can you stay quiet?

142
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,890
Alright.

143
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:14,220
I'll leave, so--

144
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,750
Honey, what are you doing? That's not fair!

145
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,570
You're still young, so you can go anywhere! Like your friends' house!

146
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:25,810
But your Dad and I have no place to go!

147
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,320
We need a deposit to get a house right away.

148
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,640
Are you going to force your Mom and Dad to live in a tiny studio at our age?

149
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,070
So who asked you to lose our house?

150
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,520
Why did this happen to us in the first place?

151
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,760
It's because of you and Dae Beom, that bastard!

152
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,450
Fine!

153
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:46,170
I did it wrong. It's all my fault!

154
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:50,320
But if you think of me as your mother, how can you act this way?

155
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,280
Then what about you? Are you saying this because you think of me as your daughter?

156
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,470
Did you ever think of me as your daughter?

157
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,200
Oh my, look at her talking.

158
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,520
How did I raise you?

159
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,420
Did I starve you, or did I not pack you lunch?

160
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:13,340
I carried you to the hospital when you're sick, and I tied it and braided your hair every morning!

161
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,250
My goodness...

162
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,160
Why aren't you saying anything!

163
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:26,570
What did I do so wrong! Some mothers abandon their kids even after giving birth to them!

164
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,650
Can't you stop!

165
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:31,600
I can't leave.

166
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,700
So, Dad, you find a new job and leave.

167
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,520
Dan Dan--

168
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:46,490
Hey! No matter how bad of a mother I might be, how can you act this way!

169
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,240
Did you say Dae Beom, that bastard?

170
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,640
Dae Beom's your older brother! Your older brother!

171
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:06,180
What the heck is this?

172
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:10,170
What am I supposed to do then?

173
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,170
What did you just say?

174
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:17,430
Why are you pretending not to know?

175
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:22,160
She thinks we had an affair, and I kicked her birth mom out and caused her death.

176
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,220
That's why Dan Dan's treating me as her worst enemy!

177
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,310
She doesn't even know that her birth mom abandoned her.

178
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,960
You tell me. Were we an affair?

179
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,670
We promised not to talk about that!

180
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,480
We did promise.

181
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,540
But I can't handle it anymore.

182
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:51,800
Dan Dan's all grown up now. So you need to tell her the truth.

183
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:57,640
Tell her that her birth mom abandoned her and that we're not bad people! Tell her we didn't have an affair!

184
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:02,240
Are you telling me to tell Dan Dan that her real mom abandoned her?

185
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,250
- Honey...
- If you...

186
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:11,290
If you bring that up one more time, I can't live with you anymore.

187
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,320
That's the end of our relationship.

188
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:19,950
What? That's the end?

189
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:27,950
Honey... How can you say then it's over to me?

190
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:36,080
Honey! Honey!

191
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:16,270
Where have you been at this time?

192
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,650
Ah, that is...

193
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,240
I went to the convenience store nearby to buy something.

194
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,330
At this late at night, you went out left the kids alone?

195
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,800
If you're going to leave the kids alone at night,

196
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,240
let Mrs. Yeoju, Chief Jo, or me know beforehand.

197
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,550
Yes, I'll do it.

198
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,230
I'm sorry.

201

What am I suppose to do?

202
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,060
Why does everyone keep picking on me?

203
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,500
Why aren't you eating well?

204
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,430
Do you have concerns? Did you get scolded again?

205
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:39,370
Ah, no. I don't have an appetite since it's early, I think.

206
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,690
Here, bulgogi and greens. And try this nabak-kimchi.

207
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,570
It'll return your appetite.

208
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,480
Yes, thank you.

209
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,380
I'm back!

210
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,500
Oh. Mr. Park, you're already back from the fish market.

211
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,600
Why don't you leave it there and have breakfast with us?

212
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,390
No, it's okay.

213
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,690
I'll leave this here and go.

214
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:03,520
Well, I guess it'll be uncomfortable eating here with us.

215
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,660
I'll bring you some side dishes later.

216
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:11,000
No, I still have some food left. Don't worry about me.

217
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,700
Mr. Park must be hungry...

218
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,970
Let's see. Should I bring him some bulgogi before it gets cold?

219
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,180
Mrs. Yeoju! Why don't you finish your meal? I'll bring it over.

220
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,640
I'm done eating.

221
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,120
- Then will you?
- Yes.

222
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:02,140
Wow! How can she make it this perfectly and deliciously!

223
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,090
Why don't you stop standing there and come inside?

224
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:13,960
How can I go in? Someone will think it strange.

225
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,490
Dad. I'll quit this place.

226
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,950
You should just stay here.

227
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:26,460
I came here to say this.

228
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,910
Really? Honey, Dan Dan made a difficult decision.

229
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:39,060
Well, Dan Dan's smart, so you'll get a better job soon.

230
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:43,090
No, Dan Dan. I told you that I'd quit.

231
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,510
I was going to hand out a resignation letter soon.

232
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,450
So don't worry about anything and you should stay here.

233
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:52,500
Dad... I'll quit the job.

234
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:58,160
No, just do as I say. Also, it seemed like Se Jong gets along well with you.

235
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,470
You two just became close to each other, so he'll be disappointed if you leave now.

236
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,890
Then why don't we just pretend not to know each other like until now?

237
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:12,080
We just don't have to get caught. Will that be hard?

238
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,380
What's wrong with you? Does that make sense?

239
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,930
If we get found out after that, then what will they think of us?

240
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,990
They'll think we are scammers!

241
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,170
We're done with this conversation.

242
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:30,290
Then, think about this for a day or two.

243
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,930
I--

244
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,660
Are you choosing for your husband?

245
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,700
What about this one? It's a new one that just came in yesterday.

246
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,800
Yes. It looks good.

247
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,550
I'll get these two.

248
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:09,440
Husband? Oh!

249
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:17,640
I like Gook Hee Unni a lot!

250
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:23,230
She's modest, friendly, and her personality's consistent.

251
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:27,360
Oppa. What do you think about Gook Hee Unni?

252
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:33,360
Gook Hee Unni can never take my place.

253
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,260
You can't get in between of us. Never.

254
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,940
Oh my! Good, it's good!

255
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,070
Gi Ja, this is very delicious!

256
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:56,730
When you make Godeulpagi Kimchi wrong, it can be bitter and not possible to eat raw, but this is seasoned perfectly.

257
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,990
It's going to be delicious before fermenting it!

258
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,750
Really? I'm glad it's good!

259
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:08,830
It's delicious because there's care and effort put into it.

260
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:14,910
You know this Godeulpagi Kimchi needs twice of care than other kimchi, right?

261
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:18,380
It needs to be soaked in saltwater to get rid of that bitter taste.

262
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,800
Of course, of course. I know, I know.

263
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,190
Here. This is yours.

264
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,700
Thank you, Gi Ja.

265
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,320
Wait, are you leaving?

266
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,130
You need to eat this with rice right away!

267
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:37,460
Oh, I have somewhere to go but forgot about it.

268
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,120
Thank you. I'll eat it well.

269
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,770
Hey...

270
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,790
She's so annoying.

271
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,530
If I've made her this care-needing kimchi,

272
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,670
she should at least help with the clean-up!

273
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:58,360
Just because she's letting me rent this house cheaply, she thinks I'm her maid!

274
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:03,790
Damn. It's a sin to lack money, a sin!

275
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:07,960
Wait.

276
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:15,570
I heard that Chairman's house's Madam loves this Godeulpagi Kimchi!

277
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:20,500
For Sarah! I must do something, don't I?

278
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,930
I can't just stand here. Yes, oh yes.

279
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,650
Oh, my.

280
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,490
Oh, my.

281
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,860
What is this?

282
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:48,050
Those are Godeulpagi kimchi and pickled garlic that I made.

283
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:53,000
Oh. We're overflowing with Godeulpagi kimchi today.

284
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,410
What do you mean by overflowing with Godeulpagi kimchi?

285
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,850
Mrs. Jang also brought a container full over for Madam earlier.

286
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,290
Mrs. Jang... Who?

287
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:06,540
Oh, seriously. Oh.

288
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,460
Who are you..?

289
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,600
She's Chief Jo's mother.

290
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,050
Hello. I apologize for the late greetings.

291
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:17,300
She brought some Godeulpagi kimchi for you, knowing you like those, Madam.

292
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:23,030
Oh! Mrs. Jang brought some too!

293
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:28,000
Gi Ja! I brought that already.

294
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,470
Why did you bring some as well? They're heavy!

295
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,990
Oh, you said you two are friends!

296
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:37,230
Oh, thank you so much. I'll eat those well.

297
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:40,560
Mrs. Yeoju. Since Chief Jo's mother is here,

298
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,560
give her some tea so that Chief Jo can say hello.

299
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,930
Yes, ma'am.

300
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:49,530
Mrs. Jang, you should come by more often.

301
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:53,630
Next time, please bring Professor Jang with you.

302
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:58,940
Why don't we all go to a nice place for dinner sometime with Young Gook?

303
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,360
A meal?

304
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,570
Then, I'll look into places.

305
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:07,430
Okay!

306
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,060
Please, head inside.

307
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:12,870
Alright, I won't go out far. Have a safe trip back home!

308
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,660
Then.

309
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:18,070
I'll see you later!

310
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,890
Gi Ja, I'll get going.

311
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,770
Oh! How did I get caught here?

312
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:47,250
Wait! Jang Mi Sook!

313
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:51,850
You... You stop right there.

314
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:54,470
Are you heading back already?

315
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:58,240
Weren't you here to see Sarah?

316
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,070
Then get in the car. I'll drive you home.

317
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:06,300
The reason why you asked me to make Godeulpagi kimchi

318
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,970
was to bring it to this house?

319
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,500
What about it?

320
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,150
How can you do this to me?

321
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:21,250
You know how hard I made that kimchi. How can you bring it here?

322
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,680
You gave it to me! Then I can do whatever I want with it!

323
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:29,130
Why are you so mad about that?

324
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,530
It's because of Gook Hee.

325
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:35,190
I think I have to step in for Gook Hee and Young Gook.

326
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:38,700
That's what I'm saying!

327
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:44,720
It's not for any other thing, but why are you giving my kimchi for that reason? Why!

328
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,360
If I knew it was for that,

329
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,190
I would have never made you that Godeulpagi kimchi! Never!

330
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:54,460
Hey! Hey, Lee Gi Ja, why are you acting like this?

331
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,440
Why?

332
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,070
Do you really don't know?

333
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:05,200
Do you really don't know why I'm acting like this?

334
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,020
Our Sarah was just about to get on well with Chairman Lee Young Gook.

335
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,260
Why do you keep interfering?

336
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:17,270
Why do you keep blocking my Sarah's future? Why?

337
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:26,030
Oh my, does Sarah has feelings for Young Gook? Is that why you're acting like this?

338
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,300
Yes.

339
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:36,600
So tell Gook Hee to stop interfering between Sarah and Chairman Lee. Did you get it?

340
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:41,880
Hey, Lee Gi Ja. Have you ever told me about Sarah and Young Gook?

341
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,640
I told you everything, all this time!

342
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,270
You know more than anyone that I had been trying to make Gook Hee and Young Gook be together!

343
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:53,780
And you were planning behind my back, pretending not to know anything?

344
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,960
Wow. You're a really scary person.

345
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,810
How can you stab someone in the back like this?

346
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:07,350
I don't think I can see your face anymore.

347
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:10,440
Oh, it's annoying!

348
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,830
What's she saying?

349
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:28,520
Is she asking me to move out?

350
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,390
Oh, my gosh.

351
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:34,130
Oh, fine. Fine. I'll move out.

352
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:40,190
Do you think I've nowhere else to go other than your house?

353
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,030
Mom, what brings you here?

354
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,610
Sarah.

355
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,780
Mom, what is it?

356
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:04,470
Sarah!

357
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:07,280
Sarah!

358
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:16,090
Mom, what is it?

359
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:19,790
Sarah...

360
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:23,560
Sarah and Young Gook?

361
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,520
I doubted about them...

362
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,310
Doubting eats a person up, you know? There can't be a worse betrayal than this.

363
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:34,700
I told her everything from one to ten, one-hundred-percent!

364
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:41,790
But Gi Ja only told me fifty, no, I don't think she told me thirty percent of what's going on!

365
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:45,440
I don't know what else she's planning.

366
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,730
She's such a sly woman!

367
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:56,000
Did Gi Ja Unni really say Sarah and Young Gook are finally getting together?

368
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,300
Yes! What are you going to do now?

369
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:06,470
Are you going to run away abroad if Sarah takes Young Gook?

370
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:11,220
Life is a one-time chance. Either way, you should make a decision.

371
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,750
Or just give up on him completely!

372
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:23,349
Se Jong!

373
00:29:23,349 --> 00:29:25,589
Teacher!

374
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:32,639
Teacher.

375
00:29:34,209 --> 00:29:38,299
[Resignation Letter]

376
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:40,289
Mr. Park.

377
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:46,449
Mr. Park, are you quitting? Why?

378
00:29:46,449 --> 00:29:50,919
I'm sorry, Madam. I've got some personal issues.

379
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:55,099
A personal issue? What is it? Tell me!

380
00:29:56,919 --> 00:29:58,819
That's...

381
00:29:58,819 --> 00:30:03,379
I mean, you only worked here for a month! How can you leave?

382
00:30:03,379 --> 00:30:06,419
What is it? Is your pay too low?

383
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:11,589
I'll tell Chairman Lee to raise your pay, so just stay, Mr. Park!

384
00:30:11,589 --> 00:30:16,039
No, Madam. I'm sorry.

385
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:17,889
My goodness!

386
00:30:17,889 --> 00:30:22,619
You're making me speechless. I even said I'll raise your wage.

387
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:26,459
I understand. I'll report to the Chairman.

388
00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:29,449
I'm really sorry.

389
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:39,419
He didn't tell you the reason why he's resigning?

390
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:46,019
No. He said it's just a personal matter.

391
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:49,499
I didn't think Mr. Park would be such a person.

392
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:52,479
Fine. Since we need time to look into new candidates,

393
00:30:52,479 --> 00:30:56,239
tell him to stay until we hire a new driver.

394
00:30:56,239 --> 00:30:59,729
Yes, I'll do that.

395
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:08,589
What is it? Do you have something else to talk about with me?

396
00:31:08,589 --> 00:31:13,239
What should we do for your wife's 2nd anniversary of her death?

397
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:20,519
She told us to make the rites simpler with just the tea set from the 2nd anniversary.

398
00:31:22,169 --> 00:31:28,009
Just prepare it like last year.

399
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:31,979
Yes, I get it.

400
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:04,629
Dad. We said, let's think about it a couple more days.

401
00:32:04,629 --> 00:32:09,249
What more is there to think over? It's better to resolve the situation early as possible.

402
00:32:09,249 --> 00:32:11,269
Dan Dan, you don't have to worry about me.

403
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:14,759
How do I not worry? You've got nowhere to go.

404
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:17,339
You really don't need to worry.

405
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:19,869
Why do you think I've got nowhere to go? I do have a place.

406
00:32:19,869 --> 00:32:26,079
As a dad, I can't see you wandering around with your luggage.

407
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:32,119
Anyway, I turned in my resignation, so you should stay, okay?

408
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:34,609
Okay.

409
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:41,729
Then I'll send you some money until you find a job.

410
00:32:41,729 --> 00:32:43,849
I'm sorry, Dad.

411
00:32:43,849 --> 00:32:46,479
Why are you saying that nonsense again?

412
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:50,199
I'm not suffering that much!

413
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:55,009
I agreed to stay here until they hire a new driver,

414
00:32:55,009 --> 00:32:58,589
so I have time to get a new place to move into.

415
00:32:58,589 --> 00:33:01,729
So don't worry.

416
00:33:03,569 --> 00:33:07,619
Anyway, let's be careful until I leave.

417
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:14,129
Also, you should work hard! Be nice to the kids so that the Chairman likes you.

418
00:33:14,129 --> 00:33:15,749
I will.

419
00:33:15,749 --> 00:33:19,329
Head back in now before someone sees us.

420
00:33:32,649 --> 00:33:35,329
Jenny!

421
00:33:37,389 --> 00:33:39,609
Lee Jenny!

422
00:33:39,609 --> 00:33:41,669
Dad, I'll head in.

423
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:44,579
Let's talk more later.

424
00:33:48,699 --> 00:33:52,889
It's not easy to look after kids...

425
00:33:56,299 --> 00:34:00,439
What? Why're you coming into someone else's room without permission? Who said you can?

426
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:04,199
What are you doing? What do you think you're doing!

427
00:34:05,889 --> 00:34:08,939
Lee Jenny. What's this bruise?

428
00:34:08,939 --> 00:34:11,269
What's going on? Tell me now.

429
00:34:11,269 --> 00:34:14,029
It's none of your business. Get out of my room!

430
00:34:14,029 --> 00:34:15,949
Who did this to you!

431
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:17,969
Tell me the truth.

432
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:22,349
If you don't tell me right now, I have no choice but to report to the Chairman.

433
00:34:22,349 --> 00:34:25,239
No, don't tell him!

434
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:29,219
So tell me! Now!

435
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:33,209
Why are you doing this to me?

436
00:35:53,349 --> 00:36:00,579
Hey. Are you the brats who're bullying our Jenny around?

437
00:36:00,579 --> 00:36:04,319
You kids. Come here.

438
00:36:06,189 --> 00:36:09,869
Who do you think you are to tell us what to do?

439
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:13,839
Me? I'm Jenny's older sister.

440
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,429
Lee Jenny. You're so annoying.

441
00:36:17,429 --> 00:36:21,519
If you act like this, your tax will rise.

442
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:25,049
Oh, tax?

443
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:31,829
You guys better give back the money that you took away from Jenny when I'm talking nicely.

444
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:39,039
And if you formally apologize to our Jenny,

445
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:41,539
I'll let you guys go quietly.

446
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:43,589
Yeah, right.

447
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:45,859
Who do you think you are to decide that?

448
00:36:45,859 --> 00:36:48,569
Do you want to die--!

449
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:54,229
Hey!

450
00:36:54,229 --> 00:36:56,249
Let me go!

451
00:36:56,249 --> 00:37:00,399
Sure! I'll let you go.

452
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:03,959
Hey, are you crazy?

453
00:37:16,439 --> 00:37:18,639
Hurry up!

454
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:47,569
You girls.

455
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:54,169
If you touch Jenny one more time, it's not going to end here.

456
00:37:54,169 --> 00:37:57,769
Apologize to Jenny right now.

457
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,969
You don't want to go home?

458
00:38:03,969 --> 00:38:08,519
Sorry, Jenny. We won't do it again.

459
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,329
Don't forget, you guys.

460
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:15,639
I've got Jenny's back.

461
00:38:17,289 --> 00:38:20,619
Jenny. Let's go.

462
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:41,189
Life is a one-time chance. Either way, you should make a decision.

463
00:38:41,189 --> 00:38:44,239
Or just give up on him completely!

464
00:38:55,829 --> 00:38:59,559
Oh, Lawyer Koh.

465
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:02,789
What? Young Gook?

466
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:07,939
- Lawyer Koh!
- Gook Hee, I'm sorry.

467
00:39:07,939 --> 00:39:13,139
- Something happened at my in-laws'. Can you stay next to Young Gook for me?
- Sure.

468
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:17,869
Young Gook's turned to alcohol again since it's Young Ae's rites coming around.

469
00:39:17,869 --> 00:39:21,309
Alright. I'll take care of him, don't worry.

470
00:39:21,309 --> 00:39:27,399
What are we going to do with him? He should put himself together for his kids, at least.

471
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:29,139
I'll go. Take care of him.

472
00:39:29,139 --> 00:39:32,039
Okay, bye.

473
00:39:32,109 --> 00:39:44,209
♫ Tonight, I'll send you the firefly from that day  ♫

474
00:39:44,209 --> 00:39:48,039
♫  to somewhere near your window  ♫

475
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:54,159
Young Gook, how long are you going to be like this?

476
00:39:54,169 --> 00:40:01,899
Think about how sad Young Ae would be, looking down on you from heaven.

477
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:07,119
From heaven...

478
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,839
Will she be really looking at me?

479
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:20,399
Gook Hee.

480
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:25,069
What happens to a person when they die?

481
00:40:28,029 --> 00:40:38,669
Do they... go to another planet, maybe?

482
00:40:41,169 --> 00:40:45,499
You probably know since you're a professor.

483
00:41:08,469 --> 00:41:15,719
Why don't you date a new person?

484
00:41:15,759 --> 00:41:20,589
They say you forget a person through another person.

485
00:41:20,589 --> 00:41:24,449
The kids need a mom, too.

486
00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:33,109
If you're going to say something boring like that, drink.

487
00:41:36,729 --> 00:41:39,769
Young Gook.

488
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:51,079
I...I like you.

489
00:41:54,369 --> 00:42:02,749
If you want me to, I can stay next to you.

490
00:42:02,749 --> 00:42:06,659
What are you saying?

491
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:10,089
Gook Hee.

492
00:42:10,089 --> 00:42:14,059
We're friends.

493
00:42:14,059 --> 00:42:21,079
Am I not...a woman to you?

494
00:42:26,139 --> 00:42:29,759
To me, you're...

495
00:42:29,789 --> 00:42:33,129
a very good friend.

496
00:42:33,129 --> 00:42:38,209
In the past, and even now.

497
00:42:38,209 --> 00:42:41,819
And in the future, too.

498
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:48,309
Right.

499
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:53,899
Alright.

500
00:42:53,899 --> 00:42:58,079
Let's just drink.

501
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:28,159
Even though I carried that heavy kimchi for her, the Madam didn't even look at me.

502
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:34,109
Because I don't have money, or a prestigious family, even my friend looks down on me.

503
00:43:34,109 --> 00:43:36,979
I don't know about anyone else,

504
00:43:36,979 --> 00:43:43,229
but you can never lose Chairman Lee to Gook Hee. Never!

505
00:43:47,939 --> 00:43:52,259
Auntie. One more bottle of soju, please.

506
00:43:52,259 --> 00:43:54,519
Alright!

507
00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:58,479
I'm coming, I'm coming!

508
00:43:58,479 --> 00:44:03,129
But why are you drinking so much today?

509
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:13,099
Auntie. Did you ever have a crush on someone?

510
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:15,649
Why would you do that?

511
00:44:15,649 --> 00:44:17,949
It's ugly.

512
00:44:17,949 --> 00:44:24,379
Tell a dog to bury that, okay?

513
00:44:26,609 --> 00:44:30,359
I know, right?

514
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:38,489
I don't know why I'm doing such a disgusting thing.

515
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:47,379
Don't get off.

516
00:44:47,379 --> 00:44:50,959
I told you not to.

517
00:44:50,959 --> 00:44:55,979
Gook Hee. Thanks for today.

518
00:44:55,979 --> 00:45:01,959
You're a really good friend.

519
00:45:01,969 --> 00:45:08,899
Hey. You've said that so many times today.

520
00:45:08,899 --> 00:45:12,929
Get home safely.

521
00:45:12,929 --> 00:45:18,779
Alright. Let's hang out soon, my friend.

522
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:38,939
Unni.

523
00:45:43,009 --> 00:45:45,189
Sarah.

524
00:45:45,189 --> 00:45:49,109
Unni. Seriously.

525
00:45:49,109 --> 00:45:51,759
You are going too far.

526
00:45:51,759 --> 00:45:55,729
What? What about it?

527
00:45:55,729 --> 00:45:59,699
I told you not to call our Chairman out at night.

528
00:45:59,699 --> 00:46:03,649
I even went to your office to ask that.

529
00:46:03,649 --> 00:46:06,759
Do you think I'm funny?

530
00:46:08,889 --> 00:46:10,749
That's ridiculous.

531
00:46:10,749 --> 00:46:14,929
Hey. Let me say that back to you. Do you think I'm funny?

532
00:46:14,929 --> 00:46:19,379
I definitely told you, acting like this is an overreaction!

533
00:46:19,379 --> 00:46:24,609
What kind of uneducated behavior is this? You're peeking at me and blocking my way!

534
00:46:24,609 --> 00:46:29,289
Ah, that's right.

535
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:32,229
I heard that you have feelings for Young Gook.

536
00:46:32,229 --> 00:46:37,449
Is that why you're acting like this? Because you like Young Gook?

537
00:46:37,449 --> 00:46:40,119
Yes, Unni.

538
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:43,689
I like Chairman.

539
00:46:43,689 --> 00:46:50,779
So, stop interfering in between the Chairman and me!

540
00:46:50,779 --> 00:46:58,069
Stop seeing the Chairman alone at night and getting drinks!

541
00:46:58,069 --> 00:47:01,129
Don't do that.

542
00:47:03,149 --> 00:47:06,979
Jo Sarah.

543
00:47:06,979 --> 00:47:09,949
You need to wake up.

544
00:47:09,949 --> 00:47:14,249
Young Gook is not interested in anyone.

545
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:17,459
He hasn't got over Young Ae yet.

546
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:23,239
Do you think Young Gook will even blink your way, by doing all this?

547
00:47:23,239 --> 00:47:24,859
No, no.

548
00:47:24,859 --> 00:47:29,699
So you better wake up now.

549
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:32,149
Alright?

550
00:47:33,569 --> 00:47:36,679
When did I ask you to concern about that?

551
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:42,289
Unni, you should stop lingering around the Chairman with the excuse of being his friend!

552
00:47:42,289 --> 00:47:44,979
Where are you grabbing it!

553
00:47:44,979 --> 00:47:47,229
Let go of me! Let go!

554
00:47:47,229 --> 00:47:51,649
Let go of me!

555
00:47:51,709 --> 00:47:55,819
Hey, stop it!

556
00:47:55,819 --> 00:47:58,389
Let go of each other!

557
00:47:58,389 --> 00:48:01,769
- What are you doing!
- Hey!

558
00:48:01,769 --> 00:48:07,119
Oh, my goodness! I never had my hair got pulled like this in my entire life!

559
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,959
Oh, this is ridiculous!

560
00:48:09,959 --> 00:48:12,529
How dare she!

561
00:48:12,529 --> 00:48:19,369
Gook Hee, you still walked away quite fine.

562
00:48:19,459 --> 00:48:24,899
Why are you crying? Is this something to cry over?

563
00:48:24,899 --> 00:48:26,539
Unni...

564
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:29,839
Unni, I...

565
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:34,089
It's...it's over between me and Young Gook.

566
00:48:34,089 --> 00:48:36,839
What...

567
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:39,249
What? What are you saying?

568
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:45,619
I did as you said. I saw him earlier,

569
00:48:45,619 --> 00:48:47,269
and I told him how I felt.

570
00:48:47,269 --> 00:48:48,979
What?

571
00:48:48,979 --> 00:48:52,919
But...

572
00:48:52,919 --> 00:48:57,569
- Did he say no?
- He did...

573
00:48:57,569 --> 00:49:00,119
Young Gook...

574
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:06,649
Young Gook only thinks of me as a friend!

575
00:49:06,649 --> 00:49:09,139
Unni...

576
00:49:10,969 --> 00:49:13,349
Oh, my goodness!

577
00:49:13,349 --> 00:49:18,509
How can he kick away a fortune that rolled in?

578
00:49:18,509 --> 00:49:20,529
Oh, what a fool...

579
00:49:20,529 --> 00:49:22,369
Oh, that cold man!

580
00:49:22,369 --> 00:49:25,179
He even has three kids!

581
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:28,059
Forget about him!

582
00:49:28,059 --> 00:49:31,809
Right? He's a stupid bastard, right?

583
00:49:31,809 --> 00:49:37,809
So, forget about that stupid bastard completely. Okay?

584
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:41,089
Don't ever think back on him. Got it?

585
00:49:41,089 --> 00:49:44,899
I get it...

586
00:49:47,969 --> 00:49:50,699
- Why are you crying?
- Unni...

587
00:49:50,699 --> 00:49:52,949
Oh, my gosh. Oh.

588
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:54,789
Don't cry!

589
00:49:54,789 --> 00:49:56,559
Don't cry. Don't cry.

590
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,839
Stop crying.

591
00:49:58,839 --> 00:50:02,019
I'm just so upset!

592
00:50:02,019 --> 00:50:03,769
Stop crying.

593
00:50:03,769 --> 00:50:05,669
- Oh, what am I going to do?
- Oh, Gook Hee, don't cry.

594
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,719
Don't cry, Gook Hee.

595
00:50:07,719 --> 00:50:09,559
Are you sure?

596
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:12,919
I just heard it myself!

597
00:50:12,919 --> 00:50:16,539
Hey, Chairman Lee Young Gook rejected Gook Hee!

598
00:50:16,539 --> 00:50:20,179
Isn't that good news?

599
00:50:20,179 --> 00:50:23,069
What? Is it a bad thing?

600
00:50:23,069 --> 00:50:27,969
Mom. Gook Hee Unni is not the problem.

601
00:50:27,969 --> 00:50:29,119
Why?

602
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:34,819
I think the Chairman can't get over his deceased wife!

603
00:50:34,819 --> 00:50:38,499
Still, she's a dead person!

604
00:50:38,499 --> 00:50:44,629
A dead person can never beat a living person!

605
00:50:44,629 --> 00:50:46,619
You've won! You've won!

606
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:49,249
That's right!

607
00:51:02,619 --> 00:51:05,979
Darling.

608
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:09,689
When I die,

609
00:51:09,689 --> 00:51:15,019
just miss me for a year.

610
00:51:15,019 --> 00:51:20,249
Then forget about everything,

611
00:51:20,249 --> 00:51:29,839
and I want you to live confidently and happily like before.

612
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:33,979
Also, meet a new person.

613
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:41,689
- Young Ae.
- That way,

614
00:51:41,689 --> 00:51:46,939
I think I can die without worries.

615
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:51,979
Promise me.

616
00:51:51,979 --> 00:51:58,879
I promise.

617
00:51:58,879 --> 00:52:06,529
♫ Why do you run away, love, like a shy child  ♫

618
00:52:06,529 --> 00:52:08,509
♫ In case I lose it ♫

619
00:52:08,509 --> 00:52:12,369
Young Ae.

620
00:52:12,369 --> 00:52:15,609
Honey.

621
00:52:15,609 --> 00:52:21,439
Jenny, Se Chan,

622
00:52:21,479 --> 00:52:30,139
and Se Jong's mom.

623
00:52:30,139 --> 00:52:33,889
Goodbye.

624
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:41,159
Don't worry about us.

625
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:50,499
♫  Why am I here for what  ♫

626
00:52:53,799 --> 00:52:56,829
Mr. Park, hurry up and get ready! I'm going to be late!

627
00:52:56,829 --> 00:53:00,199
Yes, ma'am.

628
00:53:00,199 --> 00:53:03,009
Madam. Are you going somewhere?

629
00:53:03,009 --> 00:53:05,929
I was invited to a fashion show. I can't miss it.

630
00:53:05,929 --> 00:53:09,819
Mrs. Yeoju, please do your best today. If you need help, call people. Okay?

631
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,249
Yes, I will.

632
00:53:11,249 --> 00:53:15,319
- Oh, Ms. Park, help Mrs. Yeoju today.
- Oh, okay.

633
00:53:15,319 --> 00:53:18,829
I'll be back.

634
00:53:18,849 --> 00:53:25,109
This is so unfair. How can she go out with Mr. Park on such a busy day?

635
00:53:25,109 --> 00:53:27,039
What's the occasion?

636
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:31,229
Today's the second anniversary of the Chairman's wife's death.

637
00:53:31,229 --> 00:53:33,089
A memorial service day?

638
00:53:33,089 --> 00:53:38,849
We'll set the memorial service for this house today when we're not even a family!

639
00:53:47,579 --> 00:53:51,699
If she had been alive, she'd have turned 39 this year.

640
00:53:51,699 --> 00:53:56,829
She passed away at the young age of 37.

641
00:53:59,619 --> 00:54:04,229
It's unfortunate for the kids, but the Chairman must have had a hard time too.

642
00:54:04,229 --> 00:54:09,919
Of course! They were a very loving couple, married in love at first sight.

643
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:11,939
Is that so.

644
00:54:11,939 --> 00:54:15,439
On the Chairman's first day at the company after getting discharged from the military,

645
00:54:15,439 --> 00:54:20,209
he saw his wife, who was a new employee at the company, and fell in love at first sight!

646
00:54:20,209 --> 00:54:22,919
That's so romantic.

647
00:54:22,919 --> 00:54:26,579
But his wife was almost an orphan since her single mother passed away early.

648
00:54:26,579 --> 00:54:29,259
If the Chairman had been Madam's real son, she wouldn't have stood a chance.

649
00:54:29,259 --> 00:54:32,509
But since he wasn't her biological son, she allowed it, so they managed to get married.

650
00:54:32,509 --> 00:54:36,529
Also, the wife was like an older sister to Chief Jo.

651
00:54:36,529 --> 00:54:40,129
Mrs. Yeoju!

652
00:54:40,129 --> 00:54:42,379
Why are you saying such unnecessary things?

653
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:45,289
How can you not know what to say and not to say?

654
00:54:45,289 --> 00:54:48,269
Why can't I say that?

655
00:54:48,269 --> 00:54:54,349
Ms. Park is a family now. She needs to know these to take better care of the kids as well.

656
00:54:54,349 --> 00:54:56,979
Besides, am I a child?

657
00:54:56,979 --> 00:55:00,649
Why are you nagging at me on everything?

658
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:10,869
Seriously, I need to do some exorcism. I really don't like her!

659
00:55:23,139 --> 00:55:27,259
What's going on? Where are all of my mom's belongings?

660
00:55:27,259 --> 00:55:30,309
Mrs. Yeoju! Mrs. Yeoju!

661
00:55:30,309 --> 00:55:32,319
What's going on? What is it, Jenny?

662
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:35,169
Mrs. Yeoju. Who took away my mom's photos?

663
00:55:35,169 --> 00:55:37,369
Ah, that's...I did put it away...

664
00:55:37,369 --> 00:55:41,929
Why did you put my mom's photos away? Who said you could do that!

665
00:55:41,929 --> 00:55:43,969
I didn't do it because I wanted to!

666
00:55:43,969 --> 00:55:48,059
Your Dad, the Chairman, told me to put it away. That's why.

667
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:50,749
What? Is that true?

668
00:55:50,749 --> 00:55:54,489
Lee Jenny. Why are you acting like this?

669
00:55:54,489 --> 00:55:56,639
Why are you yelling at Mrs. Yeoju like that?

670
00:55:56,639 --> 00:56:01,949
Dad, did you ask her to put my mom's photos away? Really?

671
00:56:01,969 --> 00:56:06,829
Yes. It's been two years now, and I want your mother to rest in peace--

672
00:56:06,829 --> 00:56:08,549
How can you do this to me?

673
00:56:08,549 --> 00:56:11,939
Who do you think you are to put my mom's belongings away? Why!

674
00:56:11,939 --> 00:56:14,769
It only has been two years!

675
00:56:14,769 --> 00:56:17,169
Dad, do you have a woman? Is that why?

676
00:56:17,169 --> 00:56:19,009
Lee Jenny!

677
00:56:19,009 --> 00:56:20,769
What kind of rude way of talking is this!

678
00:56:20,769 --> 00:56:23,839
My mom isn't dead! She's not!

679
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,219
Oh, Jenny! Why are you acting like this?

680
00:56:26,219 --> 00:56:29,949
It's your mom's memorial day, and she'll flee in fright because of the sounds you're making!

681
00:56:29,949 --> 00:56:34,329
I'll never forgive you, Dad.

682
00:56:34,339 --> 00:56:36,109
My goodness!

683
00:56:36,109 --> 00:56:38,949
Dad, what is this?

684
00:56:38,949 --> 00:56:43,429
How can you do this to us!

685
00:56:43,429 --> 00:56:47,059
Mom... Mom....

686
00:56:47,059 --> 00:56:51,629
I hate you, Dad!

687
00:56:51,649 --> 00:56:55,669
I hate you, Dad..!

688
00:57:00,849 --> 00:57:06,609
What's all this on anniversary of her death?

689
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:22,399
I feel too bad for them.

690
00:58:22,399 --> 00:58:27,369
Those young children are like that because they want to smell their mom at least!

691
00:58:27,369 --> 00:58:30,579
I think I need to make Chairman Lee marry someone new soon.

692
00:58:30,579 --> 00:58:34,769
They say you forget about a person through another person. Won't it get better if they have a new mom?

693
00:58:34,769 --> 00:58:37,869
If a good person comes along, it might be.

694
00:58:37,869 --> 00:58:41,539
But will the Chairman be able to forget his deceased wife?

695
00:58:41,539 --> 00:58:44,169
Why not? It's bound to happen.

696
00:58:44,169 --> 00:58:48,479
I mean, what's the point of living this good world clinging onto a dead person?

697
00:58:48,479 --> 00:58:51,329
Madam, should I bring you a glass of green tea?

698
00:58:51,329 --> 00:58:55,149
Oh, yes. My stomach is grumbling because I ate a lot of fried things without thinking.

699
00:58:55,149 --> 00:58:57,209
Oh, I can't live without you, Chief Jo.

700
00:58:57,209 --> 00:59:00,759
Thank you, Chief Jo.

701
00:59:00,759 --> 00:59:04,789
Oh, is it a fish jeon?

702
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:13,279
Mrs. Yeoju, there's not enough salt in this! It's bland!

703
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:15,879
The seasoning has to be right.

704
00:59:15,879 --> 00:59:19,509
You can't just throw the seasoning in randomly!

705
00:59:22,139 --> 00:59:24,509
Oh, now I feel better.

706
00:59:24,509 --> 00:59:26,639
Drink it slowly.

707
00:59:27,849 --> 00:59:29,759
Aren't you getting any dishes?

708
00:59:29,759 --> 00:59:32,019
I want to eat some beef jeon.

709
00:59:32,019 --> 00:59:37,229
Oh, this woman. You're asking too much!

710
00:59:37,259 --> 00:59:40,949
You said the owner of this house, the Chairman, is young, right?

711
00:59:40,949 --> 00:59:45,009
I wonder who'll be the new lady of the house.

712
00:59:45,009 --> 00:59:47,179
Whoever she is, she must be happy.

713
00:59:47,179 --> 00:59:51,389
He's got money and fame, so he can probably marry a young woman who never got married before!

714
00:59:51,389 --> 00:59:53,519
Marry a young woman who never got married before?

715
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:55,139
He has three kids.

716
00:59:55,139 --> 00:59:57,539
So what? He's got money.

717
00:59:57,539 --> 01:00:00,079
No matter how much money he has!

718
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:05,019
If it were you, would you send your daughter off to a marriage with a man with three kids?

719
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:09,159
Don't say such a thing to other people. People will think you're crazy.

720
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:17,319
Mom, I'm here.

721
01:00:17,319 --> 01:00:19,189
What is it? What happened?

722
01:00:19,189 --> 01:00:21,639
Why are you so late?

723
01:00:21,639 --> 01:00:24,399
But what's going on in the house?

724
01:00:24,399 --> 01:00:27,709
It's like a funeral home. Why is it so empty?

725
01:00:27,709 --> 01:00:30,319
Oh, don't even mention it.

726
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:35,869
Jenny threw a tantrum because her mom's belongings were gone!

727
01:00:35,869 --> 01:00:38,399
Did they take away the sister-in-law's photos?

728
01:00:38,399 --> 01:00:42,419
Yes! I didn't know either, but apparently, your brother told people to move them.

729
01:00:42,419 --> 01:00:45,329
I mean, it's been two years! It's time to move them.

730
01:00:45,329 --> 01:00:49,779
But Jenny yelled at her dad, asking whether he got a new woman!

731
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:55,209
Or why he would move the pictures! She was screaming so scarily!

732
01:00:55,209 --> 01:00:57,709
- Jenny did that?
- Yes!

733
01:00:57,709 --> 01:01:02,019
Oh, really! I can't live in this house anymore because it's so noisy.

734
01:01:02,019 --> 01:01:05,109
Mom, are you going to move out as well?

735
01:01:05,109 --> 01:01:08,539
Who said anything about moving out? Do you think I'm mad? Why would I?

736
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:13,809
Until you get married and receive the company's share, I won't move out of this house!

737
01:01:13,809 --> 01:01:16,599
By the way, when are you going to introduce me to the Mi So Steels' son?

738
01:01:16,599 --> 01:01:18,559
I'm dying of curiosity!

739
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:20,339
Just wait a bit longer.

740
01:01:20,339 --> 01:01:22,739
It's not good to rush.

741
01:01:22,739 --> 01:01:25,979
Oh, you sly little thing! Alright!

742
01:01:25,979 --> 01:01:28,759
Jenny's disappeared! I can't find Jenny!

743
01:01:28,759 --> 01:01:32,149
What? What's she saying?

744
01:01:33,879 --> 01:01:36,749
Jenny's missing?

745
01:01:36,749 --> 01:01:41,769
I was taking care of Se Jong in his room, but I couldn't find her on the second floor.

746
01:01:41,769 --> 01:01:45,269
Did anyone see Jenny leaving the house?

747
01:01:45,269 --> 01:01:51,879
I was preparing ceremonial food with Mrs. Yeoju, so we were in the kitchen.

748
01:01:51,879 --> 01:01:54,559
Jenny left her phone on her desk.

749
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,089
What?

750
01:01:56,089 --> 01:01:59,279
I'll go out and look around for her.

751
01:01:59,279 --> 01:02:04,579
I'll go out as well, so if Jenny comes home, call me.

752
01:02:04,579 --> 01:02:07,469
What is happening?

753
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:12,899
Jenny?

754
01:02:17,689 --> 01:02:20,539
Jenny?

755
01:02:24,619 --> 01:02:26,449
Jenny!

756
01:02:26,449 --> 01:02:29,479
Jenny!

757
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:32,949
Lee Jenny!

758
01:02:32,979 --> 01:02:34,829
Jenny!

759
01:02:34,829 --> 01:02:38,439
Jenny! Jenny!

760
01:02:38,439 --> 01:02:41,229
Jenny!

761
01:02:41,259 --> 01:02:45,069
Lee Jenny!

762
01:02:45,069 --> 01:02:46,979
Jenny!

763
01:02:46,979 --> 01:02:49,419
Jenny!

764
01:02:50,999 --> 01:02:55,159
Ms. Park, you haven't found Jenny yet, have you?

765
01:02:55,159 --> 01:02:57,709
Where did you look around?

766
01:02:57,709 --> 01:03:01,439
I went to the coin karaoke by the main street,

767
01:03:01,439 --> 01:03:06,939
the Internet cafe, the shopping center, and the fast-food restaurants, but she wasn't there.

768
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:10,429
Where did she go?

769
01:03:10,449 --> 01:03:16,019
Chairman. Do you know Jenny's best friend's phone number?

770
01:03:16,019 --> 01:03:18,529
No.

771
01:03:18,529 --> 01:03:21,869
I don't know.

772
01:03:21,899 --> 01:03:24,889
Not even one?

773
01:03:24,889 --> 01:03:29,699
Then, what about the places that Jenny goes often?

774
01:03:29,699 --> 01:03:34,349
I don't know that as well...

775
01:03:34,349 --> 01:03:39,789
Then, what do you know about Jenny?

776
01:03:39,789 --> 01:03:42,309
Do you even care about Jenny?

777
01:03:42,309 --> 01:03:47,219
Are you her dad, Chairman?

778
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:52,559
Chairman! Kids have their own pains and their own emotions!

779
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:57,749
You might be an adult, but the kids have lost their mother!

780
01:03:57,749 --> 01:04:00,549
But how could you act as you wish, Chairman?

781
01:04:00,549 --> 01:04:05,559
Are children something to be reported on for you? Are reports all you need?

782
01:04:05,589 --> 01:04:08,909
Do you know how much of a hard time the kids are going through these days?

783
01:04:08,909 --> 01:04:13,309
Do you know Se Jong cries every night because he misses his mother?

784
01:04:13,309 --> 01:04:18,869
Do you know how Jenny's doing? Do you know how many bruises Jenny has on her body?

785
01:04:20,809 --> 01:04:23,809
Bruises?

786
01:04:23,809 --> 01:04:27,779
What are you talking about it?

787
01:04:27,779 --> 01:04:33,339
Ms, Park, tell me the truth.

788
01:04:33,339 --> 01:04:35,859
That is...

789
01:04:37,709 --> 01:04:40,659
I can't tell you more.

790
01:04:40,659 --> 01:04:44,339
I promised Jenny not to tell you.

791
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:48,929
I feel bad for the kids..!

792
01:04:48,929 --> 01:04:54,389
Ms. Park! I said, tell me the truth!

793
01:04:57,589 --> 01:05:02,239
That's...Jenny...

794
01:05:04,139 --> 01:05:07,429
Jenny!

795
01:05:07,429 --> 01:05:09,709
Jenny.

796
01:05:09,709 --> 01:05:12,209
Lee Jenny.

797
01:05:12,209 --> 01:05:15,079
Jenny. Stop right there!

798
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:17,939
- Jenny!
- Talk with me!

799
01:05:19,729 --> 01:05:23,809
- Jenny!
- I don't like you, Dad. Let go of me!

800
01:05:30,989 --> 01:05:38,349
What... What are these?

801
01:05:38,349 --> 01:05:42,889
Who did this to you?

802
01:05:42,889 --> 01:05:46,499
Tell me!

803
01:05:49,809 --> 01:05:54,919
Dad... I've been beaten by my classmates.

804
01:05:54,919 --> 01:05:58,179
I was bullied!

805
01:05:58,179 --> 01:06:04,119
When my uniform was dirty with mud and my skirt was torn,

806
01:06:04,119 --> 01:06:07,839
nobody in this house noticed until now.

807
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:10,019
But...

808
01:06:10,019 --> 01:06:15,239
Ms. Park was the only one who noticed and saved me!

809
01:06:17,219 --> 01:06:23,209
But... Why didn't you tell me?

810
01:06:23,209 --> 01:06:26,569
Dad...

811
01:06:36,769 --> 01:06:40,179
I'm sorry.

812
01:06:40,209 --> 01:06:46,379
I didn't understand your feelings,

813
01:06:46,379 --> 01:06:51,579
and I didn't know what a hard time you were going through.

814
01:06:51,619 --> 01:06:54,229
Jenny.

815
01:06:54,229 --> 01:07:05,489
I moved your mother's stuff so that she can rest in peace in heaven and not worry about us.

816
01:07:05,489 --> 01:07:10,479
I'm sorry that I didn't say this to you first.

817
01:07:10,479 --> 01:07:13,969
Dad...

818
01:07:47,439 --> 01:07:50,149
Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong.

819
01:07:50,149 --> 01:08:00,139
Let's tell Mom not to worry about us and tell her to rest in peace.

820
01:09:00,929 --> 01:09:03,489
Mom...

821
01:09:11,659 --> 01:09:15,669
Then...what do you know about Jenny?

822
01:09:15,669 --> 01:09:18,209
Do you even care about Jenny?

823
01:09:18,209 --> 01:09:22,379
Are you her dad, Chairman?

824
01:09:22,379 --> 01:09:27,429
Are children something to be reported on for you? Are reports all you need?

825
01:09:28,929 --> 01:09:33,189
Park Dan Dan. What have you done?

826
01:09:33,189 --> 01:09:37,049
Did I lose my mind?

827
01:09:37,049 --> 01:09:41,789
Who am I to say such things to the Chairman?

828
01:09:41,789 --> 01:09:44,619
Oh. I'm so screwed.

829
01:09:44,619 --> 01:09:48,749
What am I going to do now?

830
01:10:13,559 --> 01:10:16,639
Ms. Park.

831
01:10:16,639 --> 01:10:19,519
Let's talk.

832
01:10:19,539 --> 01:10:21,989
With me?

833
01:10:21,999 --> 01:10:27,819
♫  Woo, it's a happy day like a dream, yeah  ♫

834
01:10:34,779 --> 01:10:41,659
♫  A smile blooms in every step  ♫

835
01:10:41,659 --> 01:10:48,539
♫ It's a shiny day because of you ♫

836
01:10:48,539 --> 01:10:55,519
♫  Strangely, I'm drawn to you  ♫

837
01:10:55,519 --> 01:11:03,159
♫ Nobody will understand me, you're the one that I was looking for ♫

838
01:11:03,159 --> 01:11:06,049
[Young Lady and Gentleman]

839
01:11:06,049 --> 01:11:09,609
Dad, you always do whatever you want. You never listen to me.

840
01:11:09,609 --> 01:11:11,689
- Dad, you're a boomer dictator!
- What?

841
01:11:11,689 --> 01:11:15,889
- Ms. Park! What are you doing here with Se Jong?
- I hate you, Dad!

842
01:11:15,909 --> 01:11:17,599
I need your help, Ms. Park.

843
01:11:17,599 --> 01:11:19,089
Me? How can I?

844
01:11:19,089 --> 01:11:22,119
Ms. Park, you're still young and can't understand your duties.

845
01:11:22,119 --> 01:11:25,129
From now on, report everything about the children to me as well.

846
01:11:25,129 --> 01:11:27,989
- Honey!
- Is this your house? Why are you coming whenever?

847
01:11:27,989 --> 01:11:29,419
It smells like ramen, doesn't it?

848
01:11:29,419 --> 01:11:30,849
No way!

849
01:11:30,849 --> 01:11:31,879
Is there someone in there?

850
01:11:31,879 --> 01:11:34,379
Our building's unit 101 is on the market?

851
01:11:34,379 --> 01:11:36,679
Where are you planning to get a house in Seoul without any money?

852
01:11:36,679 --> 01:11:40,079
Stop bragging because you got some money!

853
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:41,279
You mean woman...

854
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:42,599
Hi! How have you been?

855
01:11:42,599 --> 01:11:44,959
Jo Sarah. Sarah, open the door.

856
01:11:44,959 --> 01:11:46,789
Se Jong is adopted?

857
01:11:46,789 --> 01:11:50,349
Mrs. Yeoju! Are you out of your mind?
