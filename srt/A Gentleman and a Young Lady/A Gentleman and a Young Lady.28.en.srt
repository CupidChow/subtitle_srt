[Episode 28]

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,730
Seeing the ocean sitting here like this,

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,950
I realized what a fool I was.

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,350
For what did I live struggling so much?

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,460
This is all there was.

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:27,700
One step forward, and everything could end.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:38,610
Why did I cause such pain and suffering?

8
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,830
Am I getting punished for that?

9
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,790
The ocean wind is cold.

10
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:53,220
Let's go. I will take you home.

11
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:03,860
♫ It's hard to find even if I look around ♫

12
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,530
I am so scared.

13
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:14,040
What if I don't wake up from the surgery?

14
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,240
I still have things left to do.

15
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,740
I don't want to die. I want to live.

16
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,930
I have something to do still while living.

17
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,690
CEO Anna.

18
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:53,410
I'll be by your side.

19
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,250
I will be next to you.

20
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,870
I'll be here.

21
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,230
So don't become weak.

22
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:08,260
It's okay. You can do it.

23
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,640
You can do it.

24
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,220
Nothing will happen.

25
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,820
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,830
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,290
I'm so sorry.

28
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,100
I'm sorry...

29
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:37,610
♫ Please be my strength ♫

30
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:48,630
♫ The hidden road of mine ♫

31
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:57,870
♫ The hidden road of mine ♫

32
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,160
What's going on?

33
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,940
Has Soo Chul still not come home yet?

34
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,450
Wait.

35
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,360
It's 5 AM.

36
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,790
Did something happen?

37
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,900
- Honey!
- Yes.

38
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:22,070
Where were you until now?

39
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:27,310
You said you were going to the hospital to visit a patient. Have you been there until now?

40
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,160
Yes.

41
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,510
Does that person not have any family?

42
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:37,050
Why do you have to stay overnight at the hospital?

43
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,480
She doesn't have any family.

44
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,150
Right, today you and Dae Beom will have to look after the store.

45
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,660
I have to go when she takes surgery to help with her hospitalization process.

46
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,560
What? Are you going there to do the hospitalization process?

47
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,740
Who on earth is this person that you care so much about them?

48
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,680
When I was in tough times, that person did me many favors.

49
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,690
It's because I want to help her.

50
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:07,790
Today, I'll just do the hospitalization process and come right back, so you don't have to worry.

51
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,010
I mean, does that person not have anyone but you?

52
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,920
Imagine how hard it would be to have a major surgery by yourself.

53
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,330
If it were you, and you were all alone,

54
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:22,850
how scared would you be to have cancer surgery by yourself?

55
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,380
Does that person have cancer?

56
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:31,290
Yes. That's why at least I want to be there to help out.

57
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,260
But they can just hire a caretaker.

58
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,440
How many favors did you receive to do all that?

59
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,750
Aigoo, you're too compassionate.

60
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,680
You're too soft-hearted, and that's a problem.

61
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,630
Chief Jo, I thought about it all night.

62
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:02,110
The situation between you and me, and the fact that I have no recollection of it now, leaves me very confused.

63
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,330
That being said,

64
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:08,750
I would like it if we went back to dealing with one another as we used to.

65
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:13,210
So, what you're saying is that you'd like to treat me, not as your fiancée,

66
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,160
but as a butler who works here?

67
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,830
For the time being, I think that would be best.

68
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,870
Sarah, come eat breakfast.

69
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,770
I'm not hungry. Eat by yourself.

70
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,340
Why are you going back into bed while getting ready to go to work?

71
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,680
I'm not going to work and just rest today.

72
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,170
Just quit that house at this time.

73
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:46,350
I get that you're holding on to him because of Se Jong,

74
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,930
but this can never work.

75
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,920
No matter how much you glue a broken bowl together, you can't even use it as a dog bowl.

76
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,730
I'll take care of it myself.

77
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,360
What? You take care of it yourself?

78
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,810
Hey, what if the Chairman's memory after his accident when he was 22 comes back?

79
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,100
Ultimately, it's over anyway.

80
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,740
Inevitably that bomb is going to blow, so why are you holding onto that bomb?

81
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,890
If that bomb goes off, you're dead, you brat.

82
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,600
If I die, so what? Life leads to death anyway!

83
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,800
You brat. Is that something you should say in front of your mother?

84
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,590
If you can't let go of Se Jong,

85
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,770
then let's bring him here.

86
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,890
I'll pay the lawsuit fees.

87
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,870
What money do you have?

88
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,640
Get out. I want to rest in peace today.

89
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,780
Se Jong, today, let's go with Dad and Ms. Park

90
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,880
to watch a movie all together. How does that sound?

91
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,320
Sure, I like it!

92
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,670
Last time when we met at the bookstore

93
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,710
and ate pizza and walked while holding hands was good, right?

94
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,480
Yes. It was a very happy moment!

95
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,350
Then let's do a good job today, too, okay?

96
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,660
- Yes!
- Fighting!

97
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,450
It's so cold. Why is it so freezing today?

98
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,010
When are Dae Beom and everyone else coming?

99
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,490
It's so cold today.

100
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,810
Grandmother, Mother!

101
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,910
Why did you come so early?

102
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:26,440
Se Ryun, it's so cold. How long have you been waiting?

103
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,770
Not that long.

104
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:32,470
Since I'm going to work, I wanted to come early to clean.

105
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,900
What do you mean you didn't wait that long? You're all frozen.

106
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,770
What a desperate love story.

107
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,970
You might as well just shoot a movie.

108
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,130
Mom, what are you doing? Go unlock the door.

109
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,950
My Se Ryun is about to freeze to death.

110
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,250
Alright.

111
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,600
Let's go.

112
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,560
- Se Ryun first.
- My goodness!

113
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,490
My goodness! Mom!

114
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,420
I thought the line, "it's no use raising a son," was other people's story.

115
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,800
Did you see him pushing me like this?

116
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,820
It's not like he's someone else's child, but how could Dae Beom treat me like this?

117
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,480
Do you think it's different with daughters?

118
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,910
Look at me. Look at what you've put me through.

119
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,340
You were always thinking about Soo Chul. Is he the only person that exists?

120
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,260
You didn't even care if your mother was alive or not.

121
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,300
But Mom, does she think she's at a fashion show or something?

122
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,940
She's coming to work at a chicken place, and what's with her clothes?

123
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,560
It's so cold, but her legs are completely exposed.

124
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,820
Oh, look who's talking.

125
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,650
When you were her age, you wore skirts even shorter than that.

126
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,120
Everyone could see your butt.

127
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,840
Why are you here?

128
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,220
Weren't you going to the hospital today?

129
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,060
I just wanted to help with the food prep and go.

130
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,930
Really?

131
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,170
Aigoo.

132
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,530
Honey, I'll be back.

133
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,100
Go help with the hospitalization process and come back.

134
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,940
Mother-in-law, I'll be right back.

135
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,640
See you later!

136
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:10,030
I don't understand why he's helping that person so much.

137
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,760
It's someone who has no family.

138
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,200
It's good karma for him, and it'll return as blessings.

139
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,430
We can handle everything on our own over here, so don't bring it up anymore.

140
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,520
I'm not saying anything.

141
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,970
Look, Ms. Se Ryun! Mop over there, every nook and cranny.

142
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,260
Yes, Mother!

143
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,810
Oh, my! Are you okay? Did you hurt anywhere?

144
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,840
Yes, I am okay, but...

145
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,560
My goodness! What are we going to do with all this?

146
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,290
Well, since you're not hurt, that's a relief,

147
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:54,440
but what a loss! We just washed and sanitized all these.

148
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,740
What bad luck right before opening up the restaurant for the day!

149
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,610
Why weren't you more careful?

150
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,570
I told you to clean the floor, not to break the cups!

151
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,890
What should we do about these cups?

152
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,550
I am sorry.

153
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,010
I'll go buy better cups than these.

154
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:15,310
Buying cups isn't the issue.

155
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,200
What did we say?

156
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,850
This type of work isn't for everybody.

157
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,830
That's why Dae Beom's dad and I tried to stop you.

158
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,990
You can't even work, so why are you trying to help?

159
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,860
I don't think this will work out. Just hurry up and go.

160
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,120
Don't interrupt our business.

161
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,480
We're going to have customers any minute, and we can't put out paper cups. What do we do?

162
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,690
I am sorry.

163
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,180
Why? What's going on?

164
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,480
What do you mean by that? Look at all this!

165
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,260
Look at the mess your Se Ryun made.

166
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,500
My goodness...

167
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,290
Oh, why did I do that? I'm crazy, crazy, seriously.

168
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,250
Se Ryun.

169
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,130
Dae Beom, what should I do?

170
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,520
I made a mess.

171
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,200
Your grandmother and mother seem very angry.

172
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,030
Se Ryun, don't come here again. You do not belong here.

173
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,690
Why are you saying that, too?

174
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,920
Se Ryun,

175
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,500
this job looks easy to you, but actually, it's not easy.

176
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,990
No. I'm going to do whatever it takes

177
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,410
to be accepted by Grandmother and Mother.

178
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,830
Hey, Lee Se Ryun!!

179
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,570
- Why?
- You really love me so much, don't you?

180
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,620
I do.

181
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,370
That's why I'm doing this. Why else?

182
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,250
Come here.

183
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,790
Why are you so adorable?

184
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:59,690
You're my forever Beautiful Bambi Baby.

185
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,860
Got it?

186
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,290
Beautiful Bambi Baby...

187
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,380
It's a good time. I'm jealous.

188
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:16,400
If I were 20 years, no, 10 years younger--

189
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,650
Hey, you punk.

190
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:23,760
Why are you peeking at other people dating?

191
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,430
It's creepy, you punk.

192
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:28,300
Let go of this! It hurts!

193
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,700
- When did you get over here while straining jokbal, you punk?
- Ow, Hyung!

194
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,250
Se Jong, did you want to see this movie that bad?

195
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,200
Yes.

196
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,360
Then I'll go get the tickets.

197
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,000
Ms. Park, wait just a minute.

198
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,940
Why? Do you want to watch a different movie?

199
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,780
That's not it... Hyung will come here.

200
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,980
Se Chan is coming?

201
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,720
Dad! Hyung!

202
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,850
Se Jong, were you waiting long?

203
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:05,270
No, I only waited a little bit.

204
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,330
Ms. Park, you're here as well.

205
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,140
Ah, yes.

206
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,960
Se Jong said that he wanted to watch a movie.

207
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,580
Dad, Se Jong told me he wanted to see this movie,

208
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:20,210
so I got Se Jong's, mine, Ms. Park's, and your tickets.

209
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,820
Did you?

210
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,470
Then Dad, let's get popcorn and drinks.

211
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,910
Okay, let's do that.

212
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,920
Se Jong, let's go.

213
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,830
It looks like here.

214
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,240
I'm going to go sit first!

215
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,730
Then I'm going to sit next to Se Jong!

216
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:02,750
♫ Even now, I remember your memories ♫

217
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:09,760
♫  Your name in my memory comes back to me in a smile,  ♫

218
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,700
♫ and comes back to me in pain sometimes  ♫

219
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:22,910
♫  If I get to see you once again  ♫

220
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:27,380
♫  You, the one I put in my heart  ♫

221
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:35,910
♫ I want to take you out on this cozy day ♫

222
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:40,890
♫ It gets deeper at the end of the day ♫

223
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:45,860
♫ I think of you a lot more ♫

224
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:51,050
♫ All night long, in my heart that has you in it,  ♫

225
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:55,090
♫ I want to call your name ♫

226
00:14:55,090 --> 00:15:02,720
♫ Our time that was filled with excitements ♫

227
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,480
♫ The memory that's shining like you ♫

228
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,020
♫ The world seems to have stopped for a moment  ♫

229
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:18,100
♫ I'll always be by your side ♫

230
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,440
I said I was too sick to come to work.

231
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,400
Then Chairman should know, too.

232
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,850
But how can he not even send a text to see if I'm okay?

233
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:36,170
How can he do this to me?

234
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,800
If I'm going to be ignored like this,

235
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,970
should I just quit like what my mom says?

236
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:51,880
Se Jong.

237
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,590
Chief Jo Ajumma?

238
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,560
No way, how can I live without Se Jong?

239
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:07,410
That's right. I can't just crumble like this. At least, for Se Jong, I can't.

240
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,450
- That was fun, huh?
- I told you.

241
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:35,080
- Let's get inside.
- Dad, did you enjoy it, too?

242
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,020
- I thought it was great!
- Me, too!

243
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,450
I'm his fiancée,

244
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:47,320
but why is he going around with a different woman with the kids?

245
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,690
Driver Park.

246
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,220
Driver Park.

247
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:32,160
CEO, everything will be all right.

248
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,720
Don't worry about a thing. All you have to do is get some deep sleep and wake up.

249
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,120
I'll be here waiting until your surgery is over.

250
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,060
So don't worry about a thing.

251
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,280
I'm so sorry.

252
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,850
I'm so sorry...

253
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:56,920
CEO, why do you keep saying that?

254
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,110
This whole time,

255
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,610
I've been very grateful.

256
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:07,840
CEO, words like that,

257
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,330
say them when you come out from the surgery.

258
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,760
CEO...

259
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:22,420
I'll be here.

260
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,150
Okay.

261
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,370
[Operating Room]

262
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,370
Oh, what's up with you, Jenny?

263
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:15,220
You used to eat breakfast like a little bird,

264
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,930
and now you're eating this well?

265
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:21,000
I did jump rope in the garden for my morning workout, so I have so much appetite.

266
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,310
Oh, that's the reason!

267
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:26,140
If it weren't winter, I'd like to work out as well.

268
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,460
I don't like winter. It's too cold.

269
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:38,530
Chairman Lee, don't you think Chief Jo should eat with us from now?

270
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,500
I mean, she is your fiancée.

271
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:47,370
For the time being, Chief Jo and I are going back to the way things were before.

272
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:50,420
Like before?

273
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:02,280
Now Se Jong's eating vegetables well. Eat a lot.

274
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,560
Yes, Dad.

275
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,410
What a cold-hearted bastard.

276
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,940
Just because he doesn't remember getting engaged,

277
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,980
is he drawing a line to Chief Jo?

278
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,120
What should I do with this?

279
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,650
Does he have to say that he'll treat me as a butler like before, not as his fiancée,

280
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:34,430
in front of other people and the kids?

281
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:44,920
That's right. No matter what anyone says,

282
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,090
I'm the Chairman's fiancée.

283
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,830
I'm his fiancée.

284
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,200
I'm the fiancée.

285
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:05,180
An article? What kind of article is it?

286
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,410
It's about your engagement, Chairman.

287
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,900
Excuse me?

288
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,460
Who released this article?

289
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,110
Was it from the Public Relations Department?

290
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,630
No, it was not.

291
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:34,860
The Public Relations Department knows the best that your engagement was an unofficial matter.

292
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,580
But still, I checked to see if it was released by mistake,

293
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,980
and they said they never released an article.

294
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:45,600
Secretary Yoon, please contact the PR department now

295
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,920
and find out who released this article.

296
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,170
Yes, sir.

297
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,720
An article about the engagement?

298
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,600
Yes! Look here. My friend sent this to me.

299
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,560
Oh my. There's even a picture of the engagement.

300
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,290
But they covered Chief Jo's face.

301
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:18,220
Mrs. Yeoju, make me some tea. I want an aromatic herbal tea.

302
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,100
Madam, Madam, you came just in time.

303
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,030
Look at this. The Chairman and Chief Jo's engagement article came out.

304
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:27,090
An engagement article?

305
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,180
Oh, my! It's true!

But do they know about this?

307

Chief Jo! Chief Jo!

308
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,700
Yes, Madam, what is it?

309
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,220
Look, Chief Jo. Your engagement came out as an article. Did you see this?

310
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,810
Oh, really?

311
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:51,600
Look at it! But why did they blur out our Chief Jo's pretty face?

312
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,500
Anyway, congratulations again, Chief Jo, ma'am.

313
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,490
Thank you very much.

314
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:01,940
Did Young Gook release this?

315
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,090
Yes, I wonder.

was the woman you engaged, Chief Jo Sarah.

00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:56,840
- Are you certain?
- Yes, it is certain.

321
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,570
Okay. You may leave.

322
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:18,310
Honestly, I was so surprised this morning because of Young Gook.

323
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,830
How hard is it to include someone in a meal?

324
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,120
How can he say like that in front of the kids and Mrs. Yeoju?

325
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,460
He's such a cold-hearted jerk, a rude bastard.

326
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,420
You don't know how much I was cursing him in my head.

327
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,860
You must be so upset, aren't you?

328
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,680
Yes.

329
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,370
I guess he felt bad about how he treated you

330
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:41,440
since he released that engagement article.

331
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,310
Anyway, it's a good thing. When it comes to responsibility, no one has more than Young Gook.

332
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,390
Him telling the world: "I got engaged"

333
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:52,450
means that the wedding is definitely on. There's no chance of him backing out now.

334
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:56,120
Actually, I released that article.

335
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,650
I called the newspaper.

336
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,840
What?

337
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,390
Chief Jo, did you do this on your own without telling Young Gook?

338
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,680
Yes.

339
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:14,210
But you know Young Gook's temper, but how could you make such a huge mistake?

340
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:17,390
I don't want to just sit and take everything.

341
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:21,530
If it were you, could you stay silent?

342
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:24,780
Chief Jo, the Chairman is here, and he's looking for you.

343
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:28,630
But he looks very upset.

344
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,670
Does he?

345
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,600
Oh, my.

346
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:38,260
Excuse me, Madam.

347
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:48,990
Oh, my god. That little dummy made another huge mistake.

348
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,380
Knowing Young Gook's temper, he'll never let that slide.

349
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,000
Oh, what a dummy.

350
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,130
Chief Jo is a dummy.

351
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:06,120
Today's engagement article... Is it true that you released it?

352
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:13,050
Yes. I asked them to release it.

353
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:18,190
Chief Jo, I asked you to put this off until I regain my memory.

354
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:22,520
I said, when my memory returns, let's discuss this again.

355
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,550
But how could you release such an article first?

356
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:29,840
Without even consulting me. What the hell were you thinking?

357
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,530
If I had asked you, would you have given me permission?

358
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,500
What?

359
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:43,260
I had no choice. I had no choice but to release that article!

360
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,370
Chief Jo.

361
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:49,030
Chairman, I am your fiancée.

362
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:54,560
I'm your fiancée who only trusted your love and promised to live my life forever with you.

363
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,780
But now you don't want me to be your fiancée,

364
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:00,960
and you just want me to be someone who works for you, so what am I supposed to do?

365
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,910
Just because you don't remember,

366
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:06,510
does that mean that our engagement goes away?

367
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:10,240
Our love, our memories, do all those go away as well?

368
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,770
Just because I work here,

369
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:18,770
am I a toy you can play with and then throw away?

370
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,390
You're too harsh.

371
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:24,170
Chairman, you're being very harsh to me!

372
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,910
Oh, this is trouble!

373
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,470
Oh, I don't know anymore!

374
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:51,790
Wait, what is going on?

375
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:07,420
[An* Kim is in surgery.]
[The guardian should wait in the waiting room.]

376
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,050
They said it would be done in four hours.

377
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:15,350
Why is this surgery taking so long?

378
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:18,810
It's already past five hours.

379
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:22,400
Why haven't they finished yet?

380
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:28,150
I hope nothing bad happened.

381
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:42,280
[An* Kim's surgery is now complete, and the patient is now in the Recovery Room.]
[The guardian should come to the entrance of the Recovery Room.]

382
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,320
How is the patient, Anna Kim? Has her surgery gone well?

383
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,200
Are you her guardian?

384
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,900
Yes, I'm her guardian.

385
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,700
The surgery went well, and she is currently in recovery.

386
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,850
The results will be explained later by her doctor.

387
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:07,590
She's in the recovery room resting, so you can go in to see her.

388
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:10,750
Thank you very much.

389
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,050
CEO, it's me.

390
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:56,450
It's me, Driver Park.

391
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:59,110
Are you regaining consciousness?

392
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,570
Can you see me?

393
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:06,470
Soo Chul.

394
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,920
Yes.

395
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:12,060
It's me, Park Soo Chul.

396
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,100
I'm right here, CEO.

397
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:22,470
You really did stay here.

398
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:26,440
I told you I'd be here.

399
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,930
I told you nothing would go wrong.

400
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:35,800
They said the surgery went well.

401
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:38,900
CEO,

402
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,870
you don't have to worry about anything anymore.

403
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:22,110
Listening to what you said earlier, I see there's something I did wrong.

404
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:29,580
I only thought of my situation without regarding yours.

405
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:32,780
I'm sorry, Chief Jo.

406
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,290
Chairman.

407
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,460
I get it.

408
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:45,440
I'll also acknowledge...

409
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,720
our engagement.

410
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:55,170
Chairman, please...

411
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:58,990
Please regain your memory back soon.

412
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:02,620
You loved me so much,

413
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,160
but every time you treated me like a stranger now,

414
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,200
I felt like I could die.

415
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,760
Ms. Park. Ms. Park, while you went to your class,

416
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,500
there was a big incident.

417
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,160
Why? What happened?

418
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,310
That engagement article.

419
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:40,370
Chief Jo sent it to the media without the Chairman's knowledge.

420
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:44,160
He got angry with her for not talking to him in advance.

421
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,310
- He's not the one who did it?
- No.

422
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:51,400
It sounded like he wanted to cancel the engagement.

423
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,620
She figured that out and published their engagement.

424
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,910
Really?

425
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:03,040
Yes. Chief Jo was like when Chairman was a 22-year-old, he wanted to get engaged to her,

426
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,420
but why is he flipping it now and cried out loudly.

427
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,770
- Chief Jo did that?
- Yes.

428
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:10,870
Chairman then said, okay.

429
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:14,070
That he would acknowledge the engagement.

430
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:17,320
It looks like he doesn't even like Chief Jo.

431
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,770
But he is forcefully dragged into the engagement.

432
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,550
But isn't it strange?

433
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:31,320
Didn't she say they were in a relationship before? That's why they got engaged.

434
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:35,340
But now that his memory is back, why is he acting like that?

435
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,710
Were they not in a relationship?

436
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:53,580
Oh my, that renowned Jinsa Group second son had feelings for my Se Ryun?

437
00:33:53,580 --> 00:34:00,830
Yes. In fact, while he was studying in the US saw your daughter a couple of times.

438
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:04,050
The madam of Jinsa Group found out about it

439
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:08,180
and went to the US and stopped him from dating her.

440
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,930
Why?

441
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:14,230
It's because...

442
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:18,200
Was it because of me?

443
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,190
Because I'm the mistress?

444
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:30,140
It's ridiculous!

445
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,150
It's hot.

446
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:37,470
So why are you telling me this now? Are you trying to make me angry?

447
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:41,570
That's not it. I sent them information about your daughter without knowing anything,

448
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:47,600
but their second son still has feelings for your daughter and hasn't gotten over her.

449
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:54,310
So they said if your daughter approves, they want them to arrange to see each other.

450
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:58,820
They ignored her because she's the mistress daughter. Why did they change their mind?

451
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:04,410
Didn't you hear about their son's broken marriage a few months ago?

452
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,450
Was he married?

453
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:08,690
Is he a divorcé?

454
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,640
They got into a fight during a honeymoon and broke up.

455
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,490
They never registered their marriage.

456
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:18,670
That's similar to what happened to us.

457
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:24,160
But their son often talks about how his mother stopped him from dating Se Ryun before

458
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,580
and resented his mother for that.

459
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:31,340
So the parents are regretting now that they should've not stopped him.

460
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:35,090
And, they are very sorry.

461
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:41,360
If Se Ryun is willing, they would like their son to see her.

462
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:45,260
Really? Did they really say that?

463
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,540
Yes.

464
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:52,560
But are you okay with him with that shortcoming?

465
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,970
Why is that a flaw? Se Ryun is fallen into this crazy gigolo right now.

466
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:02,250
Compared to that gigolo, he sounds a thousand times better.

467
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:06,720
So I told them about your daughter, honestly.

468
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,650
That she is caught by this weird family and tricked by them.

469
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:15,510
I thought it was only right to tell them about that.

470
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:21,010
Just in case it turns into a big problem if they find out about it later.

471
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:24,810
That was not wrong of me, was it?

472
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:29,530
Of course, not. You did it right. They should know about it.

473
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:32,960
But even though you told them all that,

474
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,270
they are still interested in meeting her?

475
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:39,470
Yes. If it's okay with Se Ryun,

476
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:42,800
they want to meet her immediately.

477
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,040
Oh my, how did that happen?

478
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,620
Oh my, what kind of fortune is this?

479
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,590
If it works out this time,

480
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:54,080
I will never forget your good work.

481
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,510
Oh, my. How could this be?

482
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:59,830
My goodness, you don't have to say that.

483
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:04,240
But will her daughter Se Ryun

484
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,860
agree to meet him when she's blind by love?

485
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:16,070
We have to persuade her somehow and make it work this time.

486
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,980
Oh, my.

487
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,750
That looks like my Joon Oh.

488
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,600
What's he doing here at this hour?

489
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,550
Joon Oh! Hey!

490
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,560
Joon Oh.

491
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,220
- Yes, Mom.
- Where are you now?

492
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,540
Me?

493
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:48,010
Where would I be? I'm at school, of course.

494
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,760
School?

495
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,980
Hey, Bong Joon Oh. You are not at school.

496
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,470
Why are you lying?

497
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:59,290
I'm looking at you right now. Why are you lying to me!

498
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,940
What?

499
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:10,150
Mom.

500
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,940
What? Did you take time off from school?

501
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,480
A leave of absence?

502
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,960
How could you do that without discussing it with me at all?

503
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:30,780
Also, you should've told me if you took time off from school.

504
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:35,700
Why didn't you tell me? Why did you lie to me?

505
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,030
It's because you would be shocked like this.

506
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:45,180
Also, I told you before that I want to take some time off, and what did you say?

507
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:51,490
You told me to endure that medical school is difficult for everyone.

508
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:54,190
Even so, how can you lie to me?

509
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,770
I'm sorry for lying.

510
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,110
But, Mom. I don't think I'm suited for medical school.

511
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:07,040
So I wanted to find out what I wanted to do before telling you.

512
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,200
I wasn't trying to lie and deceive you on purpose.

513
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:15,800
You should have told me and consulted with me first.

514
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,600
It really hurts me.

515
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,370
After your father passed away when we were young,

516
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:27,980
I only had you in my life.

517
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:31,470
How could you do that without saying a word to me?

518
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:34,420
Are you living alone?

519
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,580
Are you an orphan?

520
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:41,090
What am I to you?

521
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:43,370
Mom, I'm sorry.

522
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:46,580
Making you a great doctor

523
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:52,730
and setting up a nice hospital for you was my purpose and dream.

524
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:57,880
How could you disappoint me overnight?

525
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,070
When you got accepted to medical school,

526
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:04,830
I felt like I owned the world.

527
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:08,660
I was so happy and proud.

528
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:26,790
Joon Oh. Since you've taken a leave of absence,

529
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:30,970
just take a break for a year and go back to school.

530
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,540
Okay, Joon Oh?

531
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:37,140
Mom. I can't.

532
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:42,840
Every time I do an anatomy practice, I get sick. I throw up and can't eat for days.

533
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,390
I even fainted once.

534
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:46,510
What?

535
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:50,400
I feel nauseous just being near the anatomy practice room.

536
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,740
The important thing is I have no fun doing it.

537
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:58,050
How can I spend my life doing something that I don't feel compatible with?

538
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:01,110
Who studies because it's fun?

539
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:05,190
Even if it's not suitable, you adjust and work on it.

540
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:08,860
Also, it guarantees your future.

541
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:13,440
And it gives you social respect. That's why you should do it.

542
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,420
Why would you quit something that guarantees a bright future?

543
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:25,020
Mom. I've lived my life you've wanted until now.

544
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,320
I've never gone against your wish.

545
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:33,640
When you told me to come 1st, I studied hard to get there. I got into medical school even though I didn't want to!

546
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,220
I've lived the way you wanted until now!

547
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:43,610
So from now, I want to live the way I want to.

548
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:50,770
So please, Mom. Trust your son.

549
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:55,030
And just watch me.

550
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,910
I beg you, Mom.

551
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:07,520
Oh, my goodness...

552
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,520
Is that really my son?

553
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,440
How could he do that to me?

554
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,660
How? How?

555
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:31,090
That makes no sense, Sister-in-law.

556
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:35,630
Why would he quit medical school when other people want to get in there so bad?

557
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:41,830
He didn't quit it yet, but just took a leave of absence.

558
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:44,450
It's probably for a short time.

559
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:48,580
Everyone gets sidetracked once.

560
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:53,180
He will probably return once he's had a break.

561
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,310
Right?

562
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:58,210
Of course, he will.

563
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:06,410
Did Soo Chul and Dae Beom not come home?

564
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:08,430
Is the restaurant not closed yet?

565
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:11,540
Dae Beom will come home once he's finished at the restaurant.

566
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:15,080
Someone who helped Soo Chul had to go in for surgery,

567
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,650
and they had no one to take care of, so he's helping them.

568
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:20,530
But he hasn't come home yet.

569
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:23,580
Is that so?

570
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:27,270
How much and what help did he receive?

571
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:29,780
I know.

572
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:32,150
I am home.

573
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,720
Mi Rim, you are home.

574
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,730
Yes, Grandma.

575
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:37,550
Hello.

576
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:41,490
It's good that you are here. What are you doing these days?

577
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:43,260
Do you still go to the beauty academy?

578
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,380
Yes.

579
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:50,840
Would you be interested in working in my store?

580
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,140
Our part-time staff is quitting.

581
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:58,560
I will pay you more than in other places.

582
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:01,790
Yes, I'll take it.

583
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:06,470
But I have to take time off three times a week for the academy.

584
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:09,630
Of course, you can take time off for that.

585
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:12,150
When can you start?

586
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:15,260
I can quit the convenience store job in two weeks.

587
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:19,010
Then, I will make it work until then.

588
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:24,020
Can you start working in two weeks from now?

589
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:28,060
Yes, thank you!

590
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,560
Thank you.

591
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,250
Thank you.

592
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:43,050
Welcome!

593
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:45,170
Can we have one more soju here?

594
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:58,300
Ajussi, you look cute and nice like a teddy bear.

595
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:05,580
Be careful.

596
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:12,810
It's the teddy bear Ajussi! When did you get here?

597
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:27,150
Can I have a bowl of noodles and soju?

598
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:29,200
Okay.

599
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:43,550
That's refreshing.

600
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:49,750
What more is there in life? Have a drink like this and forget it all.

601
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:55,240
It looks like the Chairman wanted to cancel the engagement with Chief Jo.

602
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:59,730
Chief Jo was like when Chairman was a 22-year-old, he wanted to get engaged to her,

603
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:02,460
but why is he flipping it now and cried out loudly.

604
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:09,500
It looks like he doesn't even like Chief Jo. But he is forcefully dragged into the engagement.

605
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,750
But isn't it strange?

606
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:15,600
Didn't she say they were in a relationship before?

607
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,630
That's why they got engaged.

608
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:21,530
But now that his memory is back, why is he acting like that?

609
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:23,990
Were they not in a relationship?

610
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:35,460
Chairman did not get engaged to Chief Jo because he liked her.

611
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,730
I know that better than anyone.

612
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:45,830
The one who made him suffer like that is me.

613
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:50,200
Should I reveal everything now?

614
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,670
That the one the Chairman liked was me.

615
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:56,920
Go see Chief Jo

616
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:01,920
and say, "you are lying."

617
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,560
Like that.

618
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,210
Park Dan Dan.

619
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:16,610
But Chairman isn't saying anything. How can I say something?

620
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,120
Just have some drink.

621
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:27,170
And then forget it all.

622
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:34,070
In three months, you just leave without looking back.

623
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,750
It's cold.

624
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,860
Cheers!

625
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:57,670
Why does it taste so sweet?

626
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:00,620
Is it a low alcohol beer?

627
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:20,790
♫  When I walk this road, it makes me cry  ♫

628
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:24,070
Ms. Park looked a lot drunk.

629
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:30,730
♫ It reminds me of that person's touch  ♫

630
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:38,360
♫ I couldn't hold her and just trembled my heart  ♫

631
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:45,080
♫ My beautiful love ♫

632
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:52,710
♫ It seems like love is bitter  ♫

633
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:59,570
♫ The more I try to grasp it, the further it gets  ♫

634
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:02,810
It's all because of you.

635
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:08,610
Park Dan Dan, you're an idiot.

636
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:11,180
Let's just forget about it.

637
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:15,200
I should've left when the Chairman said so.

638
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,640
I can't even forget about him.

639
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,840
I'm such an idiot.

640
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:28,790
I'm an idiot. Park Dan Dan, you're an idiot.

641
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:35,360
♫ But love always runs away, chased by longing  ♫

642
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,930
I can't even forget about Chairman.

643
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:42,700
♫  It would be nice to take a break  ♫

644
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:52,740
Se Jong, try this oyster pancake.

645
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:56,850
I can use chopsticks very well.

646
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:59,070
You too, Se Chan.

647
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:00,910
Please stop doing this.

648
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:04,980
Please give me the right to choose the side dish I wish to eat.

649
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:10,970
Me, too. I don't like someone passing food with chopsticks they were using it.

650
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:13,650
Okay, I'm sorry.

651
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:19,370
Se Chan is so witty.

652
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:23,640
He said he wants the right to choose the side dish he wants?

653
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:29,400
You must be popular in school, Se Chan.

654
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,960
Yes, I think so, too.

655
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,980
I'm sure.

656
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:41,340
Go ahead and eat what you want.

657
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:56,240
I'm here.

658
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,970
Hello, Boss.

659
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:02,390
Maybe it's because you've had lots of part-time job experiences.

660
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:04,520
You are really meticulous.

661
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:11,110
It looks clean outside and brighter inside.

662
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:16,110
I feel relieved having you work here.

663
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:17,420
Thank you.

664
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:19,470
Please leave that down for a minute.

665
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:22,150
Okay.

666
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:27,700
Miss In-law.

667
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,320
Try this on.

668
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,870
What is it?

669
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:36,920
It's an accessory I used to wear when I was young. You should try it on.

670
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:40,860
It looks like gold.

671
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:44,710
Yes, it is. It's not pure, but an 18k gold necklace.

672
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:50,180
I want to thank you for doing such a great job.

673
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:52,470
You don't need to give me something like this.

674
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:54,520
I'm giving it to you because I appreciate you.

675
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,600
Please wear it. It's my appreciation.

676
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,110
Thank you.

677
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:03,000
I have to go out because I have a plan. You'll be okay by yourself, right?

678
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,880
- Of course.
- Work hard.

679
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,040
- I will be back.
- Have a nice day.

680
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,330
- Bye!
- Yes!

681
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,650
It's pretty.

682
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:31,150
It smells good. It smells nutty.

683
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:32,770
It's a pine nut porridge.

684
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:35,370
It will be so good.

685
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:44,040
What am I going to do now, Soo Chul?

686
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,600
What about it?

687
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:49,960
Now I'm looking forward to the porridge you make every day.

688
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:53,530
All of it tasted good.

689
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:56,900
I don't think I can eat any other porridge now besides yours.

690
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,090
What do I do now?

691
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:00,160
My goodness, CEO.

692
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,700
You made me nervous because I thought something had happened.

693
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,530
I will have to learn how to make porridge from you.

694
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:10,050
So I can make it for myself when I am alone.

695
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:15,160
You can't be here all the time when you are busy.

696
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:19,290
Yes, I will tell you later.

697
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:21,300
It's all done. Please sit down.

698
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,870
Yes.

699
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:30,200
Maybe because I walk with you every day, I'm digesting well.

700
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:35,590
And I feel like I'm gaining muscles in my legs. Walking is the best exercise.

701
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:40,740
Thanks to you, I've gained a good habit.

702
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,980
It's nothing.

703
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:48,150
You should walk outside often even if I'm not around.

704
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:52,530
Yes. I will.

705
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:57,330
Here.

706
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:09,770
You shouldn't get a cold.

707
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:13,230
You have to keep your neck warm.

708
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:15,860
Thank you.

709
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:23,290
It's a bit colder than yesterday.

710
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:25,010
It's so warm.

711
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:30,020
Because it has your warmth, it feels warmer.

712
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:36,950
♫ The road wrapped in the mist  ♫

713
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:44,700
♫ It's about to catch it, getting farther away ♫

714
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:51,250
♫ The road like a rainbow  ♫

715
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:58,510
♫ Where is it waiting for me?  ♫

716
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:02,630
♫  It's hard to find even if I look around  ♫

717
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:05,100
I almost fell.

718
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:12,650
If it weren't for you, I might have had another visit to the hospital with a sprained ankle.

719
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:19,050
Thank you, Soo Chul.

720
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:21,020
Let's go.

721
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:27,500
Yes, let's go.

722
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:31,820
I'll make Soo Chul my man, no matter what it takes.

723
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:35,720
Like before.

724
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:45,960
Have a nice date!

725
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,840
Yes.

726
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:22,320
Chairman, it's beautiful here. The steak tastes great too.

727
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:27,220
Is it? I'm glad you like it.

728
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:36,000
But the chicken you grilled at the vacation home was way more delicious.

729
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,140
Did I do that?

730
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:44,900
Yes. You and I were there alone.

731
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:49,050
You cooked the delicious chicken at night.

732
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:53,440
It deliciously melted in the mouth.

733
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:58,440
Is that right?

734
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,880
Yes.

735
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:07,480
Eating steak and wine right now reminded me of that time.

736
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:15,580
We roasted sweet potatoes in the bonfire. It was very romantic.

737
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:19,600
Don't you remember?

738
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:24,170
No, I don't.

739
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:31,570
We took a selfie while walking in the park.

740
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:33,210
Do you want to see it?

741
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:34,800
Here.

742
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:47,370
You look a bit different from now, don't you?

743
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:51,430
You really were like a 22-year-old.

744
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:55,320
You were cute and sweet.

745
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:03,660
I see.

746
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:31,480
Thank you, Chairman.

747
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:34,850
It was really fun tonight.

748
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:40,660
You're welcome. I'm glad it was fun.

749
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:00,840
Chairman.

750
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,850
Are you alright?

751
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:15,230
Who's this? Isn't it you, Ms. Park?

752
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:19,310
Yes, it's me. Ms. Park.

753
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:25,770
Chairman, have you been drinking?

754
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:30,600
Yes. I had some drinks.

755
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:38,580
I have some very difficult and depressing issues, so I drank.

756
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:42,030
It's because of you.

757
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:43,530
Because of me?

758
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:50,350
Yes, because of you, Ms. Park.

759
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:58,340
What did I do? Was there something I did wrong?

760
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:12,050
In my heart... you're the only one filling it to the brim.

761
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:17,300
I don't know why I made the mistake of getting engaged to another woman.

762
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:23,330
I want to know the reason so bad, but because I don't know,

763
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:26,070
I'm incredibly frustrated.

764
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:30,160
I want to open my head.

765
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:34,240
If I did, would I be able to know?

766
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:38,690
I can't forgive myself.

767
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:43,880
Why did I do such a stupid thing when I lost my memory?

768
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:51,220
You should have stopped me, Ms. Park.

769
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:53,430
This is all your fault.

770
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:59,290
You should have told me that we liked each other and stopped me.

771
01:01:59,290 --> 01:02:06,350
Because of that, I got so upset with you,

772
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:10,960
that's why I drank.

773
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,800
Chairman...

774
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:23,400
I...

775
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:27,320
I really don't know what to do.

776
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:33,950
Should I just be the bad guy?

777
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:37,340
Should I just...

778
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:45,870
Should I just love you?

779
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:54,920
Ms. Park, will you be responsible for me?

780
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:57,620
Chairman...

781
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:31,200
I don't know how the day went by so fast.

782
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,640
It went by like a breeze.

783
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:37,980
Today was also a very fun day.

784
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:41,250
Since you had such a fun time, I'm relieved.

785
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:44,860
You said that I need to spend more time having fun.

786
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:50,040
Yes. That's how you can recover quicker and not relapse.

787
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:54,760
There's porridge in the fridge so just heat that up in the morning for breakfast.

788
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:58,950
I'll come back tomorrow after work.

789
01:03:58,950 --> 01:04:00,920
Okay.

790
01:04:02,230 --> 01:04:06,410
Then, get some rest. I'll get going.

791
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:21,540
Can you stay the night with me?

792
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:24,750
Stay with me.

793
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:42,780
♫  You're inside of fantasy that I can't reach  ♫

794
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:50,100
♫  Show you to me  ♫

795
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:57,230
♫  Even if I get a little bit closer, you go farther  ♫

796
01:04:57,230 --> 01:05:02,670
♫  My love, my dream  ♫

797
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:04,570
Soo Chul?

798
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:11,860
♫  Don't say I'm making myself to fit you  ♫

799
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:19,000
♫  I'm inviting you to me  ♫

800
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:24,190
♫  The mysterious way you are is love to me  ♫

801
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:29,150
CEO, always take good care of your body and be healthy.

802
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:33,040
Thank you for everything until now.

803
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:37,240
"Thank you for everything until now?"

804
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:40,960
♫  The mysterious way you are is love to me  ♫

805
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:46,000
♫  You in the time that's stopping little by little  ♫

806
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,100
♫  Like a light in the darkness,  ♫

807
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:51,040
♫ My love ♫

808
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:53,710
You should've stopped me, Ms. Park.

809
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:58,310
You should have told me that we liked each other and stopped me.

810
01:05:58,310 --> 01:06:01,820
I really...

811
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:06,840
don't know what to do.

812
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:13,440
Should I just be the bad guy?

813
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:20,300
Should I just...

814
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:24,290
Should I just love you?

815
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,830
What have I done?

816
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:12,240
Yes, who is it?

817
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:24,490
Ms. Park, what brought you here this early?

818
01:07:24,490 --> 01:07:31,260
Chairman, I thought a lot about what you said to me last night.

819
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:34,540
What did I talk about last night?

820
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:36,340
Excuse me?

821
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:41,710
I drank a lot last night. I must have made a mistake to you, Ms. Park.

822
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:45,250
Since it was all drunk talk, don't worry about it.

823
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:46,960
I have a morning meeting.

824
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:50,000
Then, have a good day today as well.

825
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:59,960
He doesn't remember anything he said to me last night?

826
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:02,490
That it was a mistake?

827
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:21,330
I apologize for contacting you again when I know you're busy.

828
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:25,910
I have something very important to discuss with you.

829
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:28,690
What is it?

830
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:35,670
I don't want to beat around the bush, so I'll be upfront.

831
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:42,720
Soo Chul, stay by my side.

832
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:50,440
Being with you brought me so much strength and joy.

833
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:58,680
Now, to me, you are an incredibly important person.

834
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:03,740
- CEO...
- Soo Chul.

835
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:09,280
Come with me to America. With Ms. Park.

836
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:16,980
♫ Why do you run away, love? Like a shy child ♫

837
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:23,630
♫ In case I lose it
, I hold it tight ♫

838
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:30,840
♫ But love always runs away, chased by longing ♫

839
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:37,520
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

840
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:45,640
♫ I have to abandon the longing and the grieves ♫

841
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:51,620
♫ What am I looking for on this road wandering ♫

842
01:09:51,620 --> 01:10:01,200
♫ Why am I here for what ♫

843
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:06,760
♫ Why do you run away, love
?
Like a shy child ♫

844
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,840
[Young Lady and Gentleman]

845
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:16,010
- I scouted Ms. Park to come with me, but I wondered if Park Soo Chul could also come with us.
- Pardon?

846
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:19,780
Chairman, it's me. There's something important I need to tell you.

847
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:21,470
Do you still not remember?

848
01:10:21,470 --> 01:10:23,480
- I don't remember.
- Then I'll tell you everything.

849
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,180
I'm going to have some courage.

850
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:26,890
- Chairman!
- Ah, you startled me!

851
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:31,310
Listen to what Chief Jo says. In no time, she's going to become your mother.

852
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:33,270
Seriously, you're pissing me off.

853
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:36,100
I thought it might be awkward for you, so I asked to meet you outside.

854
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,660
You're just a mere live-in tutor--

855
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:38,900
You need to watch your words.

856
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:41,820
Hey, I'm not done talking!

857
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:43,200
Did you get money from my sister?

858
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,340
I had no other choice than to take that money!

859
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:47,680
- What?
- You should go to America and bring us more money!

860
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:51,580
You also have feelings for me, don't you?
