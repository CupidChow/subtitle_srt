00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,640
[Episode 29]

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,060
Soo Chul, come with me to the US.

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,480
Along with Ms. Park.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,630
CEO...

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:22,600
Suddenly, what are you saying?

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,920
What do you mean by going to the US together?

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,760
Now, it's hard for me to think of a life without you.

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,350
Because you have saved me again.

9
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:39,310
So please stay by my side from now on as well.

10
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,620
Let's go to the US together.

11
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:51,250
I think you are saying this because of what happened yesterday.

12
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:57,360
Honestly, I have feelings for you.

13
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,330
But it's unthinkable.

14
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:08,090
I started having feelings for you, even though I knew I shouldn't be.

15
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:13,810
What happened yesterday is probably because of my feelings for you.

16
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,320
But my feelings towards you are gratefulness and respect.

17
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,730
Those are first, and that's all.

18
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,260
I really have made a huge mistake.

19
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,630
I am sorry.

20
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,480
I want to end it here.

21
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,500
No. It was not a mistake.

22
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,180
We had liked each other.

23
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,370
I don't want to end it like this.

24
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:49,850
I really like you, Soo Chul.

25
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,460
CEO. I cannot go with you to the US.

26
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:05,220
I am the head of a household. I have a family I have to protect.

27
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:12,870
So I'm blaming myself for why I had such feelings towards you.

28
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:22,730
I think you were too lonely, so you fell for a guy like me for a second.

29
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:28,720
But CEO, you have to be strong.

30
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,450
I am really sorry.

31
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,760
I will get going first.

32
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,550
Hello?

33
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,320
Chairman, it's me.

34
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,030
Yes, Ms. Park. What's the matter?

35
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,600
It's lunchtime now, right?

36
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,920
If you have time, can you come out for a cup of tea...

37
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,880
I have something to tell you.

38
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,820
I'm sorry, Ms. Park. I have a lot of work that's behind schedule.

39
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,720
So I'm in a meeting that I can't get out of it.

40
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,410
I need to hang up now. Let's talk later.

41
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:48,580
I just came out for a short break during the meeting, so I really don't have that much time.

42
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:54,510
But since you're here, tell me what you wanted to say to me.

43
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,730
Chairman, what you told me last night,

44
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:03,480
do you still not remember it?

45
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,460
I don't remember it. What did I even say..?

46
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,490
Then, since I remember it,

47
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:14,620
I will tell you everything you told me last night.

48
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,400
No. What's the point of talking about things I cannot even remember?

49
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,870
Also, it's manners not to talk about what one spoke about while drunk.

50
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,640
Last night, you...

51
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,110
You told me that you still like me.

52
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,280
And that you are having a hard time because I'm the only one in your heart.

53
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:43,190
Also, you said to me that you regret getting engaged.

54
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:47,270
Did I say such things?

55
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,230
Yes.

56
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,420
I said some ridiculous things while drunk.

57
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,530
I am sorry for confusing you.

58
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,430
I hope you forget everything that I said yesterday.

59
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,690
No, Chairman.

60
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,730
Although you were drunk yesterday,

61
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,980
I think you were being sincere.

62
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,720
That's why I want to gather some courage.

63
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,160
What courage?

64
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:25,010
Actually, I am to be blamed for all the happenings.

65
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:29,540
When you became twenty-two years old, you told me you liked me.

66
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,170
And you said that if I accept, you will cancel the engagement.

67
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,950
So as the last chance, you asked me to come to Namsan.

68
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:42,540
If I came to Namsan, you wouldn't get engaged.

69
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,370
- Did I say such a thing?
- Yes.

70
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,350
But I didn't go.

71
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,250
I thought you were a two-timer before you had lost your memory.

72
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,770
I didn't want the engagement to break because of me.

73
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:06,070
So, that day, I went all the way there

74
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,910
but turned around and came back.

75
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,970
When I think of that day now, I regret it a lot.

76
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,920
But now, I know for sure that you are not a two-timer.

77
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:23,840
If you are sure of your feelings, I want to muster up courage now.

78
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:39,710
Ms. Park. You know well

79
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:44,040
that I'm not in the position to talk about this with you.

80
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:49,840
After getting drunk, I acted inappropriately.

81
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,680
I am really sorry, Ms. Park.

82
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,310
I hope you forget everything that I had said yesterday.

83
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,680
I have a meeting, so I need to go back.

84
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,340
Go back home safely.

85
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:40,300
Se Chan. Se Jong will learn it if you do it in front of him.

86
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,730
You should eat everything.

87
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,740
Yes, you should listen to Chief Jo well.

88
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:52,900
She will become your mom soon. You should get along well.

89
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:58,830
Chief Jo, it's so nice that you're sitting with us. It makes the table feel full.

90
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,870
Isn't that right, Jenny?

91
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:09,970
You should say, "Excuse me first." in this situation.

92
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,130
Your grandmother is still eating.

93
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,590
It's really pissing me off.

94
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:22,060
Jenny, how can you say such things to your elders?

95
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,780
It's okay, Madam.

96
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,390
It's okay, Jenny. You can go upstairs.

97
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,680
My goodness.

98
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,040
Seriously, we need to fix Jenny's rudeness.

99
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,430
She doesn't respect the elders!

100
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,940
Oh my!

101
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,710
What is it? What sound was that?

102
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:10,120
Oh, my! Chief Jo!

103
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,530
Chief Jo, what's wrong?

104
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,560
What is all this?

105
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,700
I slipped because of these banana peels.

106
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,360
That's what I'm asking! Why are the banana peels spread out here?

107
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,810
I know.

108
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:28,330
I am sure Se Chan did all this.

109
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:32,150
I doubt it! Probably it fell while kids were playing with it.

110
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,790
No, no. Se Chan must have done this on purpose. That punk!

111
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:41,170
No, Madam. I will take care of this matter on my own.

112
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:45,220
My goodness.

113
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,830
Do the kids hate Chief Jo becoming their mom that much?

114
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:52,090
What should we do with this?

115
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,920
But, Hyung...

116
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:05,000
Looking at Chief Jo falling earlier

117
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,660
made me feel scared.

118
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,620
Actually, I felt the same way.

119
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,780
From now on, let's not do such things.

120
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,690
Yes, let's not do it, Hyung.

121
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,400
Lee Se Chan.

122
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,970
You put those banana peels, didn't you?

123
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,270
You did it, right?

124
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,820
You follow me.

125
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,700
What should I do..?

126
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,800
Lee Se Chan, why are you like this to me? What's the reason?

127
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,270
Do you hate me that much?

128
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:07,190
Did you wish for me to die after slipping by banana peels?

129
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:15,430
No. I just wanted you to leave this house after hating it.

130
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,780
That's why I did it.

131
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,090
But how can you do such things? With the young Se Jong?

132
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,730
This is a crime.

133
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,770
Should I report you to the police? Do you want to go to prison?

134
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:30,260
No...

135
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,920
If you do things like this, even if you don't go to prison, you will go to hell.

136
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,510
The ghosts and the goblin will catch you!

137
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,440
Hyung!

138
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,130
Don't do this to my brother.

139
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,930
We did wrong.

140
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:52,080
It's alright, Se Jong.

141
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,640
Why are you here, Se Jong?

142
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,100
Se Chan, stay here and reflect on what you did wrong.

143
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,880
- Se Jong, you come here.
- I'm going to stay here as well!

144
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:07,490
It'll be scary for him to stay here by himself.

145
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:14,440
Sure. You stay here, too.

146
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:29,220
Hyung! I'm scared.

147
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,770
What if a goblin shows up?

148
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:38,650
This place is so scary!

149
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,760
Chief Jo, please save us.

150
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,440
Please save us, Chief Jo! We are very, very scared.

151
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,420
Please save us! We did wrong!

152
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:55,050
We made a mistake.

153
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:59,740
We did wrong!

154
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,040
Did you really do it wrong?

155
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,300
Did you really reflect on what you did?

156
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,140
Yes. We were wrong.

157
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,070
We will not do so again.

158
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:32,780
I will really scold you if you do this again. Okay?

159
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:36,800
- Yes.
- Yes.

160
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,180
It's so good.

161
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,490
Se Ryun.

162
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,320
Drink this and eat slowly. You'll get indigestion.

163
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,010
Let me eat one more.

164
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,950
- Is it good?
- Yes!

165
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,830
I feel alive now.

166
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:10,520
At lunchtime, customers flooded in suddenly,

167
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,060
so I couldn't eat lunch properly.

168
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,770
I was very hungry.

169
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,020
Se Ryun.

170
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,520
When you're struggling so much and can't even eat well, but do you still like me?

171
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,420
Is it not hard on you?

172
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,500
No, it's not hard. Not at all. No!

173
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,920
How many times will you ask this?

174
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,670
I am sad seeing you work hard like this.

175
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,670
Am I the only one working hard?

176
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,550
You are working hard too.

177
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:43,240
But, you don't find it hard, because I am next to you, right?

178
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,930
I also feel the same way. It's fun.

179
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:58,230
Baby, why are you looking at me like that?

180
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:05,750
You guys! What are you doing holding those drumsticks?

181
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,390
Se Ryun... you...

182
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,610
- why are you getting chicken all over your face?
- Oh, really?

183
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,210
- Such a klutz. Be careful.
- The chicken...

184
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,180
- It got on my face.
- Yes, you surprised me.

185
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,380
It's hard to see as well.

186
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,750
Oh, my... What did I see just now?

187
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,020
Aigoo... It's so delicious.

188
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,740
Here are this month's living expenses.

189
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,990
Thank you.

190
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:38,490
I don't know if it's okay for me to keep receiving this.

191
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:42,620
I will keep helping you until your store settles.

192
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,040
Help build up Soo Chul and Dae Beom's pride.

193
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,040
Get them a lot of good food as well.

194
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:53,110
Also, don't let Soo Chul and Dae Beom's wallets go empty.

195
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,720
Men find pride when their wallets are thick with cash.

196
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,270
That's how the shop will also flourish.

197
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,580
Yes, Sister-in-law.

198
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,330
I guess no rain leaking in your house since it's not raining these days.

199
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:09,800
Right. But we'll have to move somehow next Spring.

200
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,440
I'm worried.

201
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,030
They'll be demolishing the house because of redevelopment.

202
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:19,180
I don't know where we can move to.

203
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,930
Oh, is that so?

204
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:24,320
If it's a year later, my friend will be moving out.

205
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,320
Try to hang in there until then.

206
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,620
Okay, Sister-in-law.

207
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,910
I hope they'll push back the redevelopment until my friend moves out.

208
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,300
I hope so too.

209
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,340
Excuse me for a second.

210
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,030
Yes, Mom?

211
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,860
Why?

212
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,750
Oh, all right. I'll be going soon.

213
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,650
Okay.

214
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,770
Hurry up and get going. It seems like they're busy.

215
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,000
I think I'll have to because of the restaurant.

216
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,260
- Yes, get going quickly.
- All right, Sister-in-law.

217
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,260
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

218
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,910
- Thank you!
- I won't see you out.

219
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,750
- Okay!
- Goodbye.

220
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,960
Mother-in-law, an unmarried brother-in-law, and a niece, too.

221
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:17,230
How many people is my Soo Chul taking care of?

222
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:23,860
Also, how could she take the cash I give without declining once?

223
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,090
No, no.

224
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:28,460
She gave birth to our family's eldest son, Dae Beom.

225
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,790
Nothing is a waste for me.

226
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,660
Did someone come by, Mom?

227
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,270
Mom...

228
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:48,500
Can you cook me one ramen?

229
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,810
Do you have a conscience?

230
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:54,520
How can you ask me to make you ramen?

231
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,690
Make it yourself!

232
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,050
I don't even want to look at you.

233
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,450
I love you, Mom.

234
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:21,990
I already saved up over 10 million won with three months worth of allowance Sister-in-law gave me.

235
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,940
I'm going to use it when my Dae Beom gets married.

236
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:30,260
Shall we eat some beef today?

237
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,030
I don't know this number. I wonder who it is.

238
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,010
Hello?

239
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,320
What did you want to say to me to call me out like this...

240
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,960
I'm going to ask you for a difficult favor.

241
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,420
A favor? To me?

242
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,370
I actually run a clothing business in the US.

243
00:18:54,370 --> 00:19:00,010
The reason I came to Korea this time was to launch a product with FT Group.

244
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,410
Oh, I see.

245
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:06,470
The project is wrapping up now, so I'll be returning to the States in three months.

246
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:13,690
When the time comes, Ms. Park, Park Dan Dan, has agreed to go with me.

247
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,510
Pardon? Dan Dan?

248
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,410
Dan Dan didn't mention anything like that to me.

249
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:23,480
I guess she didn't tell you yet because there's still some time.

250
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,870
I scouted Ms. Park to go together with me,

251
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,350
but also Driver Park...

252
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,940
I was hoping Mr. Park Soo Chul could come together too.

253
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,480
Pardon?

254
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,600
My husband too?

255
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,780
Yes...

256
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,510
When he worked at my building,

257
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,750
I received a lot of help from Driver Park for various things.

258
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,430
I saw that he was good at his job and was hardworking too.

259
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:55,710
So I offered to scout Driver Park too.

260
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,920
Oh, I see.

261
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,020
But to live in the US, it'll probably cost a lot of money for living.

262
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,590
I don't know how much the salary will be,

263
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,540
but he can only go if it's worth moving there.

264
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,420
We'll provide accommodations and vehicles.

265
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,080
I'm thinking of a minimum of 100,000 dollars for his yearly salary.

266
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,550
A minimum of 100,000 dollars?

267
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,460
About how much does that convert to in Korean won?

268
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,940
With the current exchange rate,

269
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,650
it'll approximately be more than 110 million won.

270
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,310
What? 110 million won?

271
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,940
Did your dad go deliver to somewhere far?

272
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,640
He should be here now... Oh, there he is!

273
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,490
Honey, honey! Come sit here for a bit.

274
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,080
W-what is it?

275
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,600
I just met up with CEO Anna Kim.

276
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,900
What, you met who? Did she come here?

277
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,640
No, that's not it. CEO Anna Kim called the restaurant

278
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,910
and asked my mom for my number, so we met up.

279
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,140
Anyway, that's not important.

280
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:17,640
I heard CEO Anna Kim offered to recruit you, but you rejected.

281
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,970
Why would you reject that? It's a great opportunity.

282
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,730
She said she'll give you over 100,000 dollars a year.

283
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:25,620
We just opened this store. How can I go?

284
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:31,630
Why would you worry about that? We have Dae Beom, me, and my mom here.

285
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:34,010
Listen...

286
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:38,190
She's saying she'll provide you with a car and a house.

287
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,830
Honey. Do you know how much 100,000 dollars is?

288
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,410
It's 115 million won! 115 million won!

289
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,920
Father, if it's because you're worried about here, don't be.

290
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,610
I really think it's a great opportunity too.

291
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:55,100
Honey, listen...

292
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,600
Just go to the US and endure it for five years.

293
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,170
That way, we can buy a house

294
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,300
and get the chance to live decently.

295
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,940
Also, let us experience the US through you.

296
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:10,190
Stop it. I'm not going to the US, so don't talk about that anymore.

297
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,440
Honey!

298
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,960
What's wrong with him, Mom?

299
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,660
Does it make sense that he's not going because of this store?

300
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:23,780
That's what I'm saying. His salary would be 100,000 dollars.

301
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,690
Grandmother and Mother! I bought us Hotteok!

302
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,480
It's ridiculous!

303
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,200
Se Ryun... Come here.

304
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,840
- Did something happen?
- He can't do this, Mom.

305
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,690
No, it's nothing. Did you buy Hotteok?

306
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,360
You're eating again.

307
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,560
This is really delicious.

308
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,690
Are you going to eat it every day?

309
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:48,820
You know why I'm here, right?

310
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,310
Did I upset you a lot?

311
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:05,340
CEO... seriously, why are you doing this?

312
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:12,100
I clearly rejected it, but why did you meet up with my wife and say that to her?

313
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:20,260
No matter how much I think about it...

314
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,200
I don't think I can live without you.

315
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:30,540
I have no intentions of breaking up your family.

316
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:35,130
Can't you just be by my side?

317
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,980
CEO...

318
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:41,340
Like what you said,

319
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,490
I think I've gotten a lot weaker.

320
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,690
Even though I got the surgery and recovered,

321
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:53,960
without your help, I feel lost by myself.

322
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,130
All the time in the US, I was very lonely by myself.

323
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:07,080
I had no family and no one to rely on. I lived by myself like that for a long time.

324
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,230
After meeting you, Soo Chul,

325
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:12,700
I was really happy.

326
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:21,350
In my entire life, it's my first time having someone like you, Soo Chul.

327
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,380
Soo Chul, you also...

328
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:32,200
You also like me, don't you?

329
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,390
Come with me.

330
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:40,300
CEO.

331
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,150
Why are you like this to a guy like me?

332
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:47,450
As you know, I'm just a nobody with nothing.

333
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,340
No.

334
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:57,850
You gave me the courage to live, Soo Chul.

335
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,750
You're someone very special to me.

336
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,280
CEO...

337
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:14,540
I clearly told you already.

338
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:17,670
I can't go with you.

339
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:22,450
I'll get going now.

340
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:28,480
Also, please don't contact my wife ever again.

341
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,910
[Dak-galbi in the Mountain]

342
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:52,260
You asked to have dinner, but all we're doing is drinking.

343
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:57,240
Let's drink up a little today.

344
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,900
Just tell me if something is bothering you.

345
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,650
What is it?

346
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,690
Jung Woo.

347
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:15,290
I think...

348
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,210
everything's gone wrong for me.

349
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:22,430
It's because of your engagement, right?

350
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,620
At first, even though I couldn't remember,

351
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:35,650
I tried to make it work with Chief Jo since it was something I did.

352
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:40,630
Now, I have zero feelings for Chief Jo,

353
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:44,340
but at the very least, I used to like her,

354
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,650
which is probably why I got engaged.

355
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:54,430
I tried to come to terms with that.

356
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,710
You're amazing, Lee Young Gook.

357
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:01,600
How could you do that when you can't even remember?

358
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:08,290
But more and more,

359
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:11,310
I keep thinking this isn't right.

360
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:15,970
I don't think I can let this carry on to marriage.

361
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:22,400
However, it's not like I can call off the engagement because I want to.

362
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,880
Jung Woo.

363
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,680
No, Lawyer Koh.

364
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,790
What would you do?

365
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,710
Young Gook...

366
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,820
Who would bet their fate on something they can't even remember?

367
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,720
It's simple for me.

368
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,970
If I were you,

369
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,700
I think I would follow how my heart feels currently.

370
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,070
What you can't remember is something not there.

371
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:55,300
Your current feelings, that's the truth.

372
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:05,420
Are you saying my current feelings are the truth?

373
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:10,720
Also, Young Gook. I don't know if this will help you,

374
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,810
but how you looked on the day of your engagement, you didn't look happy.

375
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,220
If you want to call off the engagement now, do it.

376
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,870
There will definitely be people who will call you irresponsible for sure.

377
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:27,580
But... even when people get married because they were madly in love and had a kid,

378
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,110
some of them still get divorced.

379
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:35,510
What's the big deal about calling off an engagement when both of you are unhappy?

380
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:45,560
Let's drink.

381
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,120
Chairman.

382
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,660
Did you drink again?

383
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:43,130
Yes. I drank a little.

384
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:52,020
But I won't lie like yesterday about not remembering since I was drunk.

385
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,190
Chairman.

386
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:59,420
I got engaged with another woman,

387
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:04,190
and I said something irresponsible to you. I was so embarrassed by myself.

388
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:07,720
That's why I lied that I didn't remember what I said.

389
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:14,100
You are already having a hard time, and I made it more difficult.

390
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,860
I am really sorry.

391
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:24,640
Thank you for saying honestly.

392
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,450
But I understand you.

393
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,850
Because I know why you did that.

394
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:35,580
Chairman, I said I'll wait.

395
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,660
Do you remember that I said that to you?

396
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:44,430
Until you can call me proudly your girlfriend,

397
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:48,010
I said I'd wait.

398
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:55,270
- Ms. Park.
- So...

399
00:30:55,270 --> 00:31:00,060
I can wait for the current situation as well.

400
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:05,920
I know your feeling now, so I'll be waiting.

401
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:24,100
Hyung, please wake up.

402
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,740
Hyung...

403
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,210
Se Jong, what's wrong?

404
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:32,640
Hyung...

405
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,690
I wet my bed.

406
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,590
What?

407
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:44,160
I dreamed about hell, goblins, and ghosts.

408
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:50,550
I was so scared, so I wet my bed.

409
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:55,000
I'm scared.

410
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,690
I'm scared.

411
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:01,950
It's okay. It's okay, Se Jong.

412
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,810
Stop crying.

413
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,050
It's okay.

414
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,650
Se Chan.

415
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,580
Se Jong. What are you doing awake?

416
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:31,210
It's nothing. You can go to bed.

417
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:33,470
What is with the blanket?

418
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:37,190
This blanket is dirty, so I'm going to change it.

419
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:42,390
- Is that so? Let me do it.
- No.

420
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,100
- Se Jong.
- Ms. Park.

421
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:54,390
I wet my bed.

422
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,670
Se Jong, it's okay.

423
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:05,800
You must have had a scary dream.

424
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,240
He had a dream about hell, goblins, and ghosts.

425
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,110
He said he was scared.

426
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:19,730
Se Jong, what's wrong with you?

427
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,800
Ms. Park, what happened?

428
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,820
My Se Jong, did you have a terrible nightmare?

429
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,260
Yes.

430
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:49,310
The goblin came out, so I tried to run away,

431
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:57,050
but then a ghost appeared and grabbed me and dragged me to hell.

432
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:02,180
You must have been really scared.

433
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:06,920
Dad... I'm already seven years old.

434
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,210
I'm sorry for wetting my bed.

435
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:15,040
It's fine. I wet my bed until I was in the first grade.

436
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,540
- Really?
- Yes.

437
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,670
How about you, Ms. Park?

438
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:25,480
Well, I...

439
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:31,010
Until I was in the third grade.

440
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:37,400
So I also got caught by my dad while trying to change my blankets secretly.

441
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:49,060
Se Jong, are you really going to be okay without sleeping with me?

442
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,680
Yes, I am okay now.

443
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,580
I have no issues.

444
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,510
Then, Se Jong, you can close your eyes.

445
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:02,710
I'll be here until you fall asleep.

446
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,860
You should go to sleep too, Ms. Park. Thank you.

447
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:28,640
Yes. Good night.

448
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,520
Se Chan, why are you coming out?

449
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,690
Were you still awake?

450
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:48,270
I can't fall asleep because I feel so wronged and upset.

451
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,300
Se Chan, what's wrong?

452
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:56,280
The reason why Se Jong wet his bed earlier is all because of Chief Jo.

453
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,090
What are you saying?

454
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:04,100
Se Jong and I put banana peels down in front of Chief Jo's room,

455
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,830
and when she came out of her room, she stepped on the peels,

456
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:12,060
slipped on them, and fell.

457
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,690
- Really?
- Yes.

458
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:19,410
But Chief Jo took Se Jong and me down to the basement storage room

459
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:23,330
and said if we do something bad like this, we'll fall into hellfire.

460
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:28,040
That ghosts and goblins will take us away.

461
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,960
After that, she turned off the lights and closed the door,

462
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,410
then tried to lock us in.

463
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:37,720
What did you say? Is it true?

464
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,190
Yes.

465
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:43,300
No matter what happened, how could she lock the kids in the basement storage?

466
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,710
And how can she say something like that to kids?

467
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:49,020
Chief Jo really took it too far.

468
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,520
Ms. Park.

469
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,280
Have you no manners for your superior? How dare you call me out like this?

470
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,550
I thought talking at home might put you in an uncomfortable situation,

471
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:07,440
so I asked you to meet outside.

472
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,350
What uncomfortable situation would I be in? Tell me, I'm curious.

473
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:16,530
Chief Jo. Even if you almost got hurt because of the banana peels that Se Chan laid down,

474
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:19,440
how could you lock the kids in the basement storage?

475
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,330
Se Chan and Se Jong are young kids.

476
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:25,410
Of course, I'm not saying that Se Chan and Se Jong were right.

477
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:31,430
But no matter the case, you shouldn't make them feel fear by locking them in the basement and telling them a scary story.

478
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:36,460
Please don't do that to kids from now on.

479
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:41,550
What? What did I hear just now?

480
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:46,310
Ms. Park. What are you trying to do with me right now?

481
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:50,730
Treating the kids that way is clearly child abuse.

482
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:53,400
"Child abuse?"

483
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:58,510
How dare you talk to me that way when you're a mere private tutor?

484
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:03,390
I went to the hospital because of Se Chan yesterday. I let him off easy because I didn't get hurt.

485
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,910
Is this something to just let go of?

486
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:07,840
Then you should have sternly told him what's right or wrong.

487
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:12,180
Did you really have to take them down to the basement storage, turn the lights off, and lock the kids?

488
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:17,610
Se Jong was so shocked he even wet his bed.

489
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:24,090
If you really loved the kids, I don't think it would've been possible for you to punish them like that.

490
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:29,320
Please don't discipline them that way anymore in the future.

491
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:38,790
Hey! How could you be so sure if I love the kids or not for you to say something so rude to me?

492
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:41,550
Don't speak like that to me, Chief Jo.

493
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:44,870
You're forcing me to speak this way!

494
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:49,330
I think you don't understand the situation.

495
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:53,730
I am the one who will become their mother in the future.

496
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:57,580
Why does it matter to you when I discipline my kids as their mother?

497
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:01,220
Whether I abuse them or lock them up in the basement storage is my way of discipline.

498
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,290
So don't arrogantly cross the line, did you understand?

499
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:06,430
Chief Jo.

500
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:11,660
Please,

501
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,030
Please, I ask you.

502
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:17,360
Please treat the children with love.

503
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,000
Then, excuse me first.

504
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,020
Where do you think you're going after riling me up?

505
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:25,450
Hey! I'm not done talking!

506
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,160
Let go!

507
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,560
I won't. I'll teach you a lesson today.

508
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,290
Don't ever lay your hands on me again.

509
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:46,360
Even if you become the madam of the house,

510
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,670
you don't have the right to pull my hair.

511
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:51,290
Do you understand?

512
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,910
I'm not going to stop anymore.

513
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:10,570
I don't feel bad towards Chief Jo anymore.

514
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,760
My chairman...

515
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,920
The kids... I'll never leave them with someone like her.

516
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,260
I'm not going to hide my feelings anymore.

517
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:22,280
Also, I'm going to stay with the kids.

518
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:32,070
- Ms. Park? What going on?
- Chairman.

519
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:38,050
♫ When I walk this road, it makes me cry  ♫

520
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,600
Ms. Park...

521
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:44,150
Chairman... I don't want to wait for you anymore.

522
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,720
I'm just going to like you.

523
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,320
If I have to pay the price for liking you,

524
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,320
I'll pay whatever price I have to.

525
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,720
My feelings for you,

526
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,490
nobody can stop it now.

527
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:59,330
Even you can't stop it, Chairman!

528
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:02,910
♫ Why do you run away, love ♫

529
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:07,090
♫ Like a shy child ♫

530
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:10,680
♫ In case I lose it ♫

531
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,950
♫ I hold it tight ♫

532
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:17,300
♫ But love always runs away ♫

533
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,710
♫ chased by longing ♫

534
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:24,420
♫ It would be nice ♫

535
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,680
♫ to take a break ♫

536
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:33,260
♫ It would be nice ♫

537
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:37,970
♫ to take a break ♫

538
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:48,750
- Here. Drink some warm tea.
- Oh, okay.

539
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,390
Thanks for your hard work cleaning.

540
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:54,620
- Have some cookies too.
- Yes.

541
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,980
Let's see.

542
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,170
Oh, my gosh! Your hands are frozen!

543
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:01,750
Oh, goodness.

544
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,990
Here. Put this hand cream on.

545
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,740
Thank you.

546
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,060
Did you hand wash the rags?

547
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,300
Next time, wear rubber gloves when you do it.

548
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,780
Your hands will get rough.

549
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,950
It's okay.

550
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,710
By the way...

551
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,040
Since when did you start living with your grandma and uncle

552
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,350
at my Soo Chul's place?

553
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,940
Oh, when I was in eighth grade.

554
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:39,910
Grandma was unable to find a job after getting older,

555
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:42,770
so Step-Uncle at that time... Oh, no.

556
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:46,780
Uncle graciously offered to let us live with him.

557
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:50,220
What do you mean, "Step-Uncle?"

558
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:54,730
Are you talking about my Soo Chul?

559
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,770
Pardon?

560
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,070
I heard this is your second marriage.

561
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:06,270
Also, Dae Beom is not Soo Chul's biological son.

562
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:08,490
Pardon?

563
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:10,570
How did you know that...

564
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:14,220
Why did you never tell me that you got remarried to Soo Chul with Dae Beom?

565
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:18,090
I've been calling Dae Beom, the eldest son of this household all this time.

566
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:21,720
How could you have never said a single word?

567
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,680
Then after deceiving me like this,

568
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,830
how could you continue to take my money like that?

569
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:30,640
What do you mean by I deceived you?

570
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,140
I just didn't tell you.

571
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,680
I didn't ask for the allowance either.

572
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,260
- You just gave it to me.
- Oh, my gosh.

573
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,510
You're making me speechless.

574
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:46,900
I'll say this since we're on the topic.

575
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,650
Are you that unhappy about the little money you gave us?

576
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:55,000
After losing Soo Chul, you must've kept all the money his parents left behind!

577
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,340
Oh, my, my! Younger-sister-in-law!

578
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:02,140
So I thought you were giving it conscientiously.

579
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,980
Younger-sister-in-law!

580
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:08,280
Are you saying that I took all of my parents' inheritance?

581
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,380
You're saying that's why you diligently took the money I gave you?

582
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,660
Look here, Younger-sister-in-law.

583
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:17,500
How could you say something like that?

584
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:22,900
All of my family's money was earned and left behind by my husband.

585
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,620
My parents!

586
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,810
I took care of them. I did!

587
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:31,920
But how... how could you say something like that to me?

588
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,250
What's all this about?

589
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:37,560
Did you take money from my sister?

590
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:57,660
I'm sorry, Noona.

591
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,500
Why did you give her money?

592
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:05,470
I... didn't want you to struggle.

593
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:09,320
I gave it because of you.

594
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:13,530
I never thought she'd think of it that way.

595
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:17,060
Noona... I'm fine.

596
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:20,170
I'll tell you if I'm struggling.

597
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:23,840
So don't give stuff like that from now on.

598
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:28,750
But Soo Chul.

599
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:32,230
The fact that you got remarried,

600
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,950
that Dae Beom wasn't your biological son,

601
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:37,940
why didn't you tell me that?

602
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,630
Noona...

603
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:46,440
Why is that important?

604
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,590
Dae Beom is my child too.

605
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:52,660
Why is that not important?

606
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:56,410
I don't know if you're too nice or stupid.

607
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:58,960
Why do you live like this?

608
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,870
You're breaking your back to fend for your wife's family by yourself.

609
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:05,330
Forget about it.

610
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:10,850
I don't want to talk anymore.

611
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:14,520
I'm seriously so upset.

612
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:29,800
Honey.

613
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:35,060
How could you take money from my sister without me knowing?

614
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:40,380
How dare you talk about our parents' inheritance?

615
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,970
My sister got the chicken restaurant for us too. Do you even have a conscience?

616
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:46,100
She seemed well off,

617
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:49,260
so I thought she inherited your parents' money.

618
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,880
That's why I spoke that way without thinking...

619
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,970
But is that something to get this upset?

620
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:56,080
People can make mistakes.

621
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,340
Also, she gave money for us to use. How can I not take it?

622
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:02,080
You should have told me, at least!

623
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,820
If I had told you, you would've just gotten mad like this and not let me take it.

624
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:10,830
Shouldn't we take that money and use it since we have none?

625
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:12,090
What?

626
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:16,430
I took the money because we need it so badly!

627
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:18,050
Don't you even feel bad towards me?

628
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:19,920
You're letting me live in a slum like this.

629
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,090
Why are you making such a big deal over me taking that money?

630
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:25,440
What did you say?

631
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,430
You're the head of our household.

632
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:30,460
Until when are you going to let us live in a house where rain leaks in?

633
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:33,800
If you go to the US and suck it up for just five years,

634
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:37,370
then we'll be able to buy a small house. But why won't you go?

635
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:39,850
What's the reason you're not going?

636
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:42,030
Go to the US and give us money! Money!!

637
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:46,090
Then I wouldn't have to say something like this to Older-sister-in-law!

638
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:51,740
How could you...

639
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,990
Do you think I want to live taking money from others?

640
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:56,500

Did you not eat, Chairman?

Well, I got caught up with work.

767

But I'm fine. People skip meals on purpose to lose weight.

- Are you really not cold?
- No.

I'm not cold at all because I'm with you.

It is.

775
00:57:04,411 --> 00:57:08,321
That's because you're eating it with me.

- Sure.
- Oh?

It hasn't been long since her surgery.

805
01:00:05,721 --> 01:00:10,901
How could you let her skip meals and not take her medicine like this?

806
01:00:10,901 --> 01:00:14,191
If this carries on, it might get worse.

807
01:00:14,191 --> 01:00:16,821
Can her condition get worse?

808
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:19,441
I think the patient's will has weakened a lot.

809
01:00:19,441 --> 01:00:23,521
The role of the guardian is very important.

810
01:00:42,531 --> 01:00:45,511
It's broccoli porridge. Please have some.

811
01:00:45,511 --> 01:00:49,271
You need to eat well to gain energy.

812
01:00:49,271 --> 01:00:53,901
I don't have any appetite.

813
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:58,171
Please go, Driver Park.

814
01:00:58,171 --> 01:01:01,181
CEO, if you don't eat like this, you might get more sick.

815
01:01:01,181 --> 01:01:04,141
Please have some bite.

816
01:01:05,981 --> 01:01:10,131
I said I'd do it on my own.

817
01:01:10,161 --> 01:01:14,461
So please go.

818
01:01:14,461 --> 01:01:19,471
Whatever happens to me, it's none of your business anyway.

819
01:01:22,481 --> 01:01:24,751
Okay!

820
01:01:27,901 --> 01:01:35,221
I'll be by your side.

821
01:01:35,221 --> 01:01:39,771
I'll stay by your side.

822
01:01:39,771 --> 01:01:42,211
I'll also go to America with you.

823
01:01:42,211 --> 01:01:45,571
So, please eat.

824
01:01:48,011 --> 01:01:52,921
I'll be by your side.

825
01:01:52,921 --> 01:01:56,221
Let's go together.

826
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:33,781
Have some tea, Ms. Park.

827
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:39,251
Did something good happen, CEO? Your face has completely brightened up.

828
01:02:39,251 --> 01:02:41,221
Is that so?

829
01:02:41,221 --> 01:02:44,821
Maybe it's because I've been eating and sleeping well.

830
01:02:44,821 --> 01:02:47,811
Ms. Park, I have good news.

831
01:02:47,811 --> 01:02:49,181
Did you hear about it?

832
01:02:49,181 --> 01:02:50,421
What is it?

833
01:02:50,421 --> 01:02:52,851
Haven't you heard it from your dad yet?

834
01:02:52,851 --> 01:02:53,901
Pardon?

835
01:02:53,901 --> 01:02:57,751
I think Driver Park still hasn't told you yet.

836
01:02:57,751 --> 01:03:04,031
When we go to America, your dad will come along with us.

837
01:03:04,031 --> 01:03:06,911
Is it true? Is my dad coming, too?

838
01:03:06,911 --> 01:03:11,411
It'll be better for you to adjust to the US if you have your dad with you.

839
01:03:11,411 --> 01:03:16,491
I also needed more trustful people, so I scouted him.

840
01:03:16,491 --> 01:03:20,411
I've received a lot of help from Driver Park.

841
01:03:20,411 --> 01:03:24,691
It will be great if we go all together.

842
01:03:24,691 --> 01:03:27,301
Yes...

843
01:03:30,321 --> 01:03:34,201
But, CEO.

844
01:03:34,201 --> 01:03:38,971
I need to say something unfortunate.

845
01:03:38,971 --> 01:03:45,361
I think I can't go to the US with you.

846
01:03:45,361 --> 01:03:48,201
Ms. Park.

847
01:03:48,201 --> 01:03:53,591
You already say you'll come with me. But why are you saying you can't go?

848
01:03:58,661 --> 01:04:03,531
If I were you, I think I would follow how my heart feels currently.

849
01:04:03,531 --> 01:04:06,901
What you can't remember is something not there.

850
01:04:06,901 --> 01:04:10,511
Your current feelings, that's the truth.

851
01:04:22,561 --> 01:04:25,701
Ms. Park, it's me.

852
01:04:25,701 --> 01:04:27,651
Yes, Chairman.

853
01:04:27,651 --> 01:04:35,141
Ms. Park, do you want to eat pork cutlets with me for lunch today?

854
01:04:36,771 --> 01:04:39,971
Yes, yes! I would love to!

855
01:04:39,971 --> 01:04:45,431
Ms. Park, do you like pork cutlets that much?

856
01:05:02,711 --> 01:05:04,481
Yes.

857
01:05:07,151 --> 01:05:09,831
Noona!

858
01:05:09,831 --> 01:05:12,281
What brings you here unannounced?

859
01:05:12,281 --> 01:05:17,631
I have something important to talk about. Do you have a moment?

860
01:05:17,641 --> 01:05:20,421
Yes. Why don't you have a seat?

861
01:05:27,521 --> 01:05:35,071
Young Gook, I told you that I scouted Ms. Park, so she'll come with me to America.

862
01:05:35,071 --> 01:05:37,541
What are you saying?

863
01:05:37,541 --> 01:05:41,071
Ms. Park and you are going to America?

864
01:05:41,071 --> 01:05:44,241
Yes. When I go back to the US in three months,

865
01:05:44,241 --> 01:05:48,691
Ms. Park agreed to come with me and work together.

866
01:05:48,691 --> 01:05:52,291
I think you have heard about it from Ms. Park, too.

867
01:05:52,291 --> 01:05:58,221
That's why you carved out time for Ms. Park to go take English lessons too.

868
01:05:58,221 --> 01:06:00,551
Did I?

869
01:06:00,551 --> 01:06:04,231
No, I didn't know about this at all.

870
01:06:04,231 --> 01:06:08,561
Right, you don't remember that time.

871
01:06:08,561 --> 01:06:12,841
Anyway, Ms. Park was going to come with me to the US,

872
01:06:12,841 --> 01:06:15,231
but she changed her mind and can't go anymore.

873
01:06:15,231 --> 01:06:19,661
She said it's because she's worried about your kids.

874
01:06:19,661 --> 01:06:22,871
What? Did Ms. Park say so?

875
01:06:22,871 --> 01:06:26,601
Yes. That's why I came here.

876
01:06:26,601 --> 01:06:30,631
You can easily find another tutor for the kids,

877
01:06:30,631 --> 01:06:33,971
but Ms. Park is only 27 years old now.

878
01:06:33,971 --> 01:06:36,691
She's a young lady who has her entire life ahead of her.

879
01:06:36,691 --> 01:06:39,571
She's a young lady who has a lot ahead of her.

880
01:06:39,571 --> 01:06:42,641
Young Gook, I'm sorry to you,

881
01:06:42,641 --> 01:06:48,701
but can you persuade Ms. Park to go to the US?

882
01:06:51,461 --> 01:06:54,151
Noona...

883
01:06:54,151 --> 01:06:59,911
You care a lot for Ms. Park too. She's hardworking, talented, and kind.

884
01:06:59,911 --> 01:07:07,301
That's why I want to give her a great and new opportunity.

885
01:07:07,301 --> 01:07:14,511
Don't you think it's right for her to come with me to the US if you think about her future?

886
01:07:28,521 --> 01:07:31,711
Ms. Park is only 27 years old now.

887
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:34,271
She's a young lady who has her entire life ahead of her.

888
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:37,241
She's a young lady who has a lot ahead of her.

889
01:07:37,241 --> 01:07:40,341
Young Gook, I'm sorry to you,

890
01:07:40,341 --> 01:07:46,161
but can you persuade Ms. Park to go to the US?

891
01:08:02,851 --> 01:08:05,291
Chairman!

892
01:08:09,931 --> 01:08:16,471
We're supposed to go eat pork cutlets, but why did you ask me to meet you here?

893
01:08:16,471 --> 01:08:22,481
I don't think I can eat pork cutlets with you, Ms. Park.

894
01:08:22,491 --> 01:08:24,581
Pardon?

895
01:08:26,871 --> 01:08:30,241
I've finally sorted out my feelings.

896
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:34,851
Chairman...

897
01:08:34,851 --> 01:08:40,861
Ms. Park... I don't like you.

898
01:08:40,861 --> 01:08:46,231
To be more exact, I won't like you.

899
01:08:46,231 --> 01:08:53,381
So you should go to the US with CEO Anna Kim.

900
01:08:53,381 --> 01:08:55,921
Chairman?

901
01:08:55,921 --> 01:08:59,961
You should find your life now

902
01:08:59,961 --> 01:09:03,471
and fly away freely towards the world.

903
01:09:03,471 --> 01:09:09,531
That's what I want from you.

[Young Lady and Gentleman]

914
01:10:12,751 --> 01:10:15,471
Do you really want me to go to the US?

915
01:10:15,471 --> 01:10:17,711
Yes, I want you to go. Just for five years.

916
01:10:17,711 --> 01:10:19,621
Will you really be okay without me?

917
01:10:19,621 --> 01:10:22,741
Soo Chul! You look like a completely different person. You look amazing.

918
01:10:22,741 --> 01:10:24,511
Chairman! I'm not going to the US.

919
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:26,221
- Why are you telling me that?
- What?

920
01:10:26,221 --> 01:10:28,571
Don't cross the line from now on, Ms. Park.

921
01:10:28,571 --> 01:10:32,011
This is infidelity. Would you like me to blast you on social media as the mistress?

922
01:10:32,011 --> 01:10:33,851
Is that what you want?

923
01:10:33,851 --> 01:10:34,781
I'm sorry!

924
01:10:34,781 --> 01:10:36,301
- I'll pay for everything.
- Are you here to date?

925
01:10:36,301 --> 01:10:38,481
- I'll try harder.
- I told you not to!

926
01:10:38,481 --> 01:10:40,311
People can make mistakes while working. Why are you scolding her?

927
01:10:40,311 --> 01:10:42,581
Se Ryun would be furious if I told her to go on a blind date.

928
01:10:42,581 --> 01:10:44,271
Are you... Lee Se Ryun? You are, right?

I can't believe we ran into each other here.
