00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,990
Hello! Nice to meet you!

2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,290
I'm Park Dan Dan!

3
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,620
Ajussi!

4
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:33,590
Young lady, why are you at my house?

5
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,440
What? My house?

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,320
Wait. Then is the owner of this house is him?

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,370
What happened?

8
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,720
I'm asking you.

9
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,030
How did you come here?

10
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,150
Did you...come looking for me on purpose?

11
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,340
No! It's not like that!

12
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,130
The reason why I came here...

13
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,170
I'm here on Professor Jang Gook Hee's recommendation

14
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,100
for an interview...

15
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:13,790
As an in-home private...tutor?

16
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:19,490
Are you Professor Jang's student?

17
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,670
Excuse me, but who are you?

18
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,670
Here's my resume.

19
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,210
[Episode 3]

20
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,140
Have a nice day.

21
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,980
It seems like you've been drinking today too.

22
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,300
I'm sorry?

23
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,270
Since you hurt your knee.

24
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,230
Even if you're going to drink in the days, be careful.

25
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,710
Don't trouble other people.

26
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,130
I didn't drink today.

27
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,730
And I'm not the kind of person who drinks in the morning with nothing to do.

28
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,680
- That day, I had a reason--!
- Ah, alright.

29
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,300
You can go.

30
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,440
I apologize once again for what happened last time.

31
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,560
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,720
Have a nice day.

33
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,110
Oh, it's the Noona from before!

34
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,130
- Hi.
- Oh!

35
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:27,710
Were you rushing before because of our interview?

36
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,360
Yes.

37
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,180
You're here for the interview, right? Please head in.

38
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,430
Thank you!

39
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,870
How's your injury?

40
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,930
The bleeding seems to have stopped.

41
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,490
I think you need to put medicine on.

42
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,540
Ah, it's fine. It's not a big injury.

43
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,770
Thank you so much for before.

44
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,930
You're welcome. It wasn't a big deal.

45
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:04,650
I'm glad that this kid didn't get hurt.

46
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,530
Can you tell me your account number?

47
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,520
You've hurt your knee and ruined your clothes.

48
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,940
I'll send you reimbursement for your clothes and medicine.

49
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,390
Ah, it's okay. I'm really fine.

50
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,510
I can wash my clothes.

51
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,620
Then, have a nice day.

52
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,510
I'll get going.

53
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:33,730
That lady got hurt because of our Se Jong? Did something happen?

54
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,890
Oh, my gosh!

55
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,090
My goodness, if it weren't for that lady,

56
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:58,260
our Se Jong would have been in big trouble!

57
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:02,030
My heart's still trembling from the shock just then.

58
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,880
Oh, we should be so grateful to her.

59
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,970
But wait. Why's she running away when she did such a good deed?

60
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,760
Did she make a mistake while having the interview inside?

61
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,960
Maybe?

62
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,620
Oh, how could a lady's laughter be so sharp?

63
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,110
Young Gook must be out of his mind at a young lady's charm in such a long while.

64
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,270
I'll be waiting for good news!

65
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,020
Have a nice day!

66
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,080
Was it fun?

67
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,150
I could hear your laughter all the way here.

68
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,600
Yes. The Chairman was so gentle,

69
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,800
and so witty.

70
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,400
But is the Chairman really a father of three children?

71
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,840
Lawyer Koh said he's a father of three children.

72
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,090
Oh my, but seriously.

73
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,640
He's like a bachelor who never even got married!

74
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,110
You worked hard today! We'll get back to you soon.

75
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,800
Have a nice day! I'll see you again!

76
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,850
Have a safe trip back home!

77
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,100
Chief Jo!

78
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,470
Did you see her?

79
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,210
Everything she's wearing is from luxury brands.

80
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,900
I mean, why would a girl wearing luxury brand clothes come for an interview here?

81
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,750
She is very suspicious. Even the way she smiles with her eyes.

82
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,750
She's not okay. Alright?

83
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,360
I want the first candidate. Number one, okay?

84
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,860
[Resume: Tutor, Jessica Lee]

85
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,840
This is the last month's expenses details for our house maintenance.

86
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,440
Last month, we had a pond construction, replaced the grass,

87
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,770
and changed the lights, so the expenses are over budget.

88
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,700
Alright.

89
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,250
Chairman.

90
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,720
How were the in-home tutor interviews?

91
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,580
Have you made your decision?

92
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:09,660
Jessica Lee has a great resume since she studied abroad and worked at an English kindergarten.

93
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,790
But I think we'll have to look around more.

94
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,240
What about the teacher who came in first?

95
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:23,000
I think she doesn't suit our family.

96
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:31,840
Why, Chief Jo? Do you have something else to say?

97
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,730
I hope you hire that teacher.

98
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:42,550
Is she someone you know personally, Chief Jo?

99
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,000
It's not that...

100
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,220
Chairman, I'm sorry.

101
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,050
Actually, around the kindergarten,

102
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:59,310
Se Jong almost got hit by a car while he was trying to catch a ball.

103
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,780
Se Jong almost got into a car accident?

104
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,130
Yes.

105
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,780
But that teacher, who took the interview earlier,

106
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,270
she thankful threw herself and saved Se Jong.

107
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:14,770
That's how she hurt her knees.

108
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:18,750
Is that...true?

109
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,820
Yes. Thanks to that teacher

110
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,390
that Se Jong didn't get hurt at all and is perfectly fine.

111
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,830
It seems like you've been drinking today too.

112
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,090
I'm sorry?

113
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,460
Since you hurt your knee.

114
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,860
I didn't drink today.

115
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:47,700
And I'm not the kind of person who drinks in the morning with nothing to do.

116
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:56,220
Chairman. I know qualifications and careers are important.

117
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:04,050
But, I think a person like her is the one for Se Jong, Se Chan, and Jenny.

118
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:10,750
It's rare to find someone to take risks for children.

119
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,360
[Resume: Park Dan Dan]

120
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,130
Is Park Dan Dan really your student?

121
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,910
Of course. What are you saying?

122
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:31,730
Nothing. I just wanted to double-check since it's an in-home private tutor.

123
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:36,220
Dan Dan is responsible and loyal.

124
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,970
Her grades were also excellent her entire university years.

125
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,270
While her skills are great too, her personality is really good.

126
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,520
You really don't have to worry.

127
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,630
I'll guarantee for her!

128
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,970
Is that so?

129
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,820
Where should I go now?

130
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,180
I can't spend more days in the sauna.

131
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,170
But what do I tell my Professor?

132
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:21,370
She did recommend me out of concern...

133
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:27,550
If she finds out I caused an accident because I got drunk in broad daylight, she'll be so disappointed.

134
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:32,440
Why did I go to the mountain that day!

135
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,320
Whose number is this?

136
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,100
Hello?

137
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,780
Is this Ms. Park Dan Dan's phone?

138
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,640
Yes, it is. But who are you?

139
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,310
I'm Chief Jo. We just met before.

140
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:01,380
We decided to hire you as our in-home private tutor.

141
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:09,050
What? Me? Really? Have I really passed?

142
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:12,810
Thank you! Thank you!

143
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:17,210
Hey, are you sure this is all you got?

144
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:21,930
You said your family's rich. But this is it?

145
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,230
What is this, huh?

146
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,060
I have a limited allowance.

147
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,020
My family is wealthy, but that doesn't mean I am.

148
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:36,850
Wow. Are you showing off that your family's rich right now?

149
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:46,550
Hey. Since you said that your family's rich, bring a hundred thousand won by tomorrow.

150
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:51,640
You can't be the only one living well. You got to share it with others.

151
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:58,600
Eating everything alone will burst your stomach open. Got it?

152
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:03,390
Hey, who do you think you're glaring at? Drop your eyes!

153
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,290
Are you crazy?

154
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,920
You better be bringing a hundred thousand won by this time tomorrow. You know what happens otherwise, right?

155
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,750
Hey. Let's go.

156
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:44,290
I heard that you saved our Se Jong. Thank you so much.

157
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,880
Ah, it's nothing.

158
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,040
Anyone else would have done the same if they were there at that moment.

159
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,720
It wasn't a big deal.

160
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,190
I heard you hurt your knees while saving Se Jong...

161
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,890
I'm sorry for misunderstanding that too.

162
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,880
Is your leg okay?

163
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,770
Yes! I'm fine.

164
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:17,860
I already put on some ointment and a bandage, so it should be better by tomorrow. I'm totally fine.

165
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:22,390
I'm glad to hear that you didn't get hurt badly.

166
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,660
By the way...

167
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,850
I thought I obviously failed the interview.

168
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:35,330
Last time, what I did to you in the mountain, Ajussi--

169
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:42,520
I'm sorry. Chairman, I did make a mistake to you then, so...

170
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,220
But why did you hire me?

171
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,080
It's because Professor Jang recommended you.

172
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,470
Also, our Chief Jo recommended you very strongly.

173
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,510
And I am very thankful to you for saving our Se Jong.

174
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:07,370
I did see your tutoring experience on your resume as well.

175
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:13,850
Please take good care of my children.

176
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:21,540
Thank you! I'll do my best! I'll work hard!

177
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:35,490
Is this going to be my room?

178
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:41,830
Yes. These are the furniture the previous in-home tutor used, but we didn't switch them out since they're still clean.

179
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:45,810
If you find anything uncomfortable or something you need, let me know anytime.

180
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:49,140
No, no. It's fine! It's perfect.

181
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,110
I think there's everything I need!

182
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:59,070
Jenny and Se Chan go to after-school tutoring for their major subjects and have separate tutors visiting.

183
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:05,400
So for Jenny and Se Chan, all you need to do is check their progress on each subject and homework.

184
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:09,200
Especially for Se Chan, please check the materials he needs to bring for school.

185
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,790
Okay.

186
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:16,490
So your main work will be taking care of the youngest, Se Jong.

187
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,720
Se Jong's still young, so please do take good care of him.

188
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,610
Of course!

189
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,870
I'll tell you the details of your work from today throughout the day.

190
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,110
Let's talk about it more throughout the time.

191
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:31,520
Yes. I'll learn it fast.

192
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,130
I first thought she was the children's mother!

193
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,870
Is the Madam really their grandmother?

194
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:42,060
She doesn't have a single wrinkle and is very pretty and young! I was so surprised!

195
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,860
She takes good care of herself.

196
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,470
Oh...yes.

197
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:51,700
Mrs. Yeoju! Could you ask Mr. Park to come over? I want to introduce him to Ms. Park.

198
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:57,110
Mr. Park went to the fish market. Madam wants to eat steamed scallops.

199
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:02,170
Now that I think about it, you've got the same last name, Park!

200
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,450
I'll introduce Mr. Park to you next time.

201
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,540
Okay!

202
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:12,820
Here are the kids! Jenny, Se Chan, say hello. It's your new teacher, Miss. Park Dan Dan.

203
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,710
Hello, everyone! Nice to meet you.

204
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,150
Hello!

205
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:22,940
But why is the teacher so tacky this time?

206
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:28,320
Ah, really? I'll try to take more care.

207
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,010
I'm going upstairs.

208
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:39,680
Teacher, you need to understand. My Noona these days, she's a viper, viper, biting everyone!

209
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,890
Lee Se Chan!

210
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:45,500
What? It's true! I'm going upstairs too!

211
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:55,650
Ms. Park. Jenny and Se Chan are going through their puberty. You can understand them, right?

212
00:16:55,650 --> 00:17:01,620
Of course. I've taught children in a tutoring place before, so I know it well. Don't worry.

213
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,730
Right. Think about the pay! What's free in this world?

214
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:09,030
I won't have a problem even if there are ten kids like them.

215
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:17,500
Ah, but where's the mother of the children? Did she go out?

216
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,070
Oh. You must have come here not knowing.

217
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:25,920
The children's mother passed away two years ago.

218
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,430
That's why we were looking for an in-home tutor.

219
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:32,790
What? Did she pass away?

220
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:41,320
Who does she think she is to kick away that great husband material? Do you think that makes sense?

221
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,480
Gook Hee. I think Sarah has a boyfriend.

222
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,620
Sarah, is she...doing that because of Young Gook?

223
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:57,610
What qualities does she have? All she has is her pretty face and body.

224
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:03,830
Is her family good, does she have money, or is she young? Or does she have a professional job, like a doctor or lawyer?

225
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,970
It doesn't make any sense.

226
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,010
Unni.

227
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:14,930
Aigo, I know. What does it matter to me whether Sarah marries or not?

228
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:20,980
I mean, I have something to concern. My family's rotten car is a bigger problem!

229
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:25,600
Rotten...rotten car?

230
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,100
Are you talking about me?

231
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,130
Sit, Gook Hee.

232
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:37,710
Gook Hee. When you and Young Gook were sitting side-by-side last time,

233
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:41,940
you two looked perfect together. You two suited each other so well.

234
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:48,060
Unni. If you're going to talk about weird things again, get out. I have so much to do.

235
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:54,530
Is your work more important? What if another girl takes Young Gook away again while you sit back like this?

236
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:57,860
Then where are you going to go to study abroad again?

237
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,490
What?

238
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:05,050
You thought I didn't know? The reason why you went to study abroad back then was because of Young Gook!

239
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:10,680
You were shocked because Young Gook got married! You were hurt!

240
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:16,380
No! Oh, my. Unni, what are you talking about it?

241
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,150
You shouldn't make the same mistake twice.

242
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:23,940
Do you think Young Gook's going to live by himself like that from now on?

243
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,770
- So--
- Unni. Get out. Get out of my room.

244
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:35,260
- Oh, get out. I have so much work to do!
- Hey!

245
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:46,600
Did Unni know about my feelings?

246
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,840
Se Jong.

247
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,010
Why didn't you do your Hanja homework?

248
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:03,070
Hanja...is too hard.

249
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:08,860
I don't want to do it. Can I not do it?

250
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,800
Se Jong. If you don't do it because you don't want to,

251
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,190
you're going to be someone who gives up in difficult times.

252
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,830
Se Jong, you don't want to become such a person, do you?

253
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,060
No.

254
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,830
Right?

255
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,560
Se Jong is Dad's son,

256
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,070
so you need to become a smart kid who can do anything, like your Dad.

257
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:37,170
That's how you can lead a huge company and lots of people later like your Dad.

258
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:40,010
Let's do it.

259
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:49,220
English, Math, Korean, and Hanja. Please check these four daily study papers every day.

260
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,490
Since they might get a bad habit of pushing things back if they do it once,

261
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,340
so you should check every day. Alright?

262
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,220
Yes. I get it.

263
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,160
But, Chief Jo.

264
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:10,390
Se Jong has kindergarten classes, but he also has English, piano, and home-study materials.

265
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:13,420
Isn't that too much for him to study?

266
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,470
Se Jong's still young...

267
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:22,550
You'll come to understand the longer you're in this house,

268
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:26,710
but Se Jong's an extraordinary kid.

269
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:33,060
He needs to study at least this much. It's not a lot.

270
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,930
Okay.

271
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:39,120
Ah, right. Se Jong had severe eczema when he was little.

272
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,090
Please make sure to put Se Jong's special lotion on after he showers,

273
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:46,400
brush his teeth, and read him a bedtime storybook before he sleeps.

274
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,510
I'll pick a storybook for you every day.

275
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,740
Yes, Chief.

276
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,180
I'm back!

277
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,400
Oh, welcome back.

278
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,380
Mrs. Yeoju.

279
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,540
Yes? What is it?

280
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:06,910
I have something to do. Do you mind if I step out for a moment?

281
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,340
Where's Chief Jo?

282
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,800
You can go outside! Madam's not going anywhere,

283
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,690
and you should take a break, Mr. Park.

284
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,260
I'll tell Chief Jo.

285
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:21,620
- Thank you.
- Oh, it's nothing!

286
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:28,720
He seems like such an educated man, very polite.

287
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,680
Does he have a wife? Oh, what am I thinking?

288
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,560
How's the dinner preparations coming along?

289
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,710
Oh, when I cook the scallops, it's done.

290
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:42,740
Oh, right. Mr. Park had something to do outside, so I told him he could. It's okay, right?

291
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,360
Yes.

292
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:49,580
Oh, look at me. I forgot to introduce Mr. Park to you, Ms. Park.

293
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,400
Well, today's not the only day. You'll see him later.

294
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,800
Right.

295
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,420
Aren't you getting off?

296
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,390
Do you think I want to do this?

297
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,610
You know it's not okay to stay in that house without permission.

298
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:18,640
I'll come to get you as soon as I get a house.

299
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:25,920
The realtor said there's a place which seems to meet our conditions, so please wait just until then.

300
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,780
Take this fruit basket with you, too!

301
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:36,300
Tell Hee Sook I'm grateful and sorry. I'll call you later.

302
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:41,400
Why do you want to have a call? Don't even call me!

303
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,060
Dan Dan?

304
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:13,550
Dan Dan? Dan Dan?

305
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,240
What's wrong with you?

306
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,500
Oh, I'm sorry!

307
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,990
What the heck?

308
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:34,340
Do you think I didn't know that you guys had an affair and chased my birth mom away, and that's why she died?

309
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,390
Did you hate my birth mom that much?

310
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,750
Why didn't you abandon me, then, if you hated my mom so much?

311
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,850
It must have been hard for you to take care of me against your will!

312
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,610
Fine! I'll go out now!

313
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,080
Fine, get out! Get out! Now!

314
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,120
Father! Father, why are you saying that? Don't do that!

315
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,780
The customer is unavailable. Please leave a message after the tone.

316
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:19,800
Dan Dan... Where are you?

317
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,700
Are you doing okay?

318
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:31,400
♫ When I walk this road, it makes me cry  ♫

319
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:38,310
♫ It reminds me of that person's touch ♫

320
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,380
♫ I couldn't hold her ♫

321
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:47,390
♫ and just trembled my heart ♫

322
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:51,890
Do all elites raise their kids this way?

323
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:58,120
Se Jong's only seven, and he's using a room on his own.

324
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,480
Won't he be scared of the dark?

325
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:07,310
♫ In case I lose it, I hold it tight ♫

326
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:14,230
♫ But love always runs away, chased by longing ♫

327
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,690
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

328
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:25,400
[Dad, I've got a job at a good place, and I'm doing well, so don't worry.]

329
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:37,340
- D-Did they hire a new in-home tutor?
- Yes.

330
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:43,620
Hey, you barely fired the previous one because she was flirty to Chairman Lee!

331
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,610
Won't this one make you worry again?

332
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,660
It's a countryside girl this time.

333
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:51,380
She's young and naive.

334
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,850
Is that so?

335
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,640
I think we chose well this time.

336
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,950
Besides, do you think I'll stand if she flirts with him?

337
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,210
It seems like a man should be wealthy and handsome!

338
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:09,260
Ladies are drooling everywhere, despite that he has three kids.

339
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:13,100
Oh, it seems like it's going to rain. My back is aching.

340
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,890
Ah, my goodness, you brat.

341
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:18,960
Ah, it hurts!

342
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,140
Oh, well.

343
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,700
What sound is that?

344
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,600
Is it a stray cat sound?

345
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,960
What is that sound?

346
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,530
Is there a ghost in this house? My goodness!

347
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,510
Se Jong!

348
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:48,940
Se Jong. Why are you crying alone here, at night?

349
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:53,430
Teacher...

350
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:56,850
It's okay. It's alright.

351
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,970
Se Jong. Did you have a bad dream?

352
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:07,180
It's alright now.

353
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:11,350
Teacher's here. You'll be fine.

354
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,860
Let's go to your room with me.

355
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:24,810
No! I don't want to sleep alone in my room tonight.

356
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:29,110
Alright. Then, should we go to my room?

357
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,830
Yes!

358
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:48,330
Teacher. I'm sorry for waking you up and make you tired.

359
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,980
Mr. Se Jong.

360
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:57,170
You don't have to say sorry to me.

361
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,930
Teacher.

362
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:03,440
Can I ask you a favor?

363
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,730
What is it? Tell me.

364
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:11,390
Would you please keep it a secret that I cried?

365
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:18,230
If Hyung knows, he'll call me a crybaby and tease me.

366
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,710
I'm not a baby.

367
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,230
Alright.

368
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:26,900
I won't tell anyone.

369
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,530
- Promise?
- Promise!

370
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:39,100
I was scared of the thunder.

371
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,590
That's why I cried a little bit.

372
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:47,210
It's not because I missed my mom.

373
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:54,620
I see.

374
00:30:54,620 --> 00:31:03,030
I used to cry a lot because I missed my mom.

375
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:06,260
Se Jong, you're very brave.

376
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:09,950
Teacher, you don't have a mom either?

377
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:13,240
Did she die?

378
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,350
Yes.

379
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,320
It's okay!

380
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:25,190
Your mom is in heaven and protecting you.

381
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:06,340
What's going on?

382
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:09,360
Where is Se Jong?

383
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:18,370
Se Chan. Lee Se Chan. Wake up.

384
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,730
What's going on?

385
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,500
Where is Se Jong? Did you see Se Jong?

386
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,870
Se Jong?

387
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:32,830
He's not here either. Jenny. Jenny!

388
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:36,600
Lee Jenny! Lee Jenny! Wake up!

389
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,100
You're so annoying. Why don't you even let me sleep?

390
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:44,590
What are you doing in my room this late? Why the hell are you doing this?

391
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:51,190
You have no right to barge into my room just because you're my Dad! Get out! Get out!

392
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:56,650
Jenny, Se Jong is missing. I came in here to look for him. Did you see Se Jong?

393
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:59,200
Why would you look for Se Jong in here?

394
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,630
Oh, my! What's going on?

395
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:07,020
Why are you yelling in the middle of the night, Jenny? I'm already trembling because of the thunder and lightning.

396
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,370
Have you seen Se Jong? I can't find Se Jong.

397
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,600
You can't find Se Jong? He's not in his room?

398
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,710
No, I looked everywhere upstairs. I can't find him.

399
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:19,400
You have to check the first floor too. Are you sure he's not in the kitchen eating something?

400
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,060
He's not in the kitchen. I just came from there.

401
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:29,740
What's going on? Where would that kid go in the middle of the night?

402
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,580
Did he--!

403
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,460
What is it, Madam?

404
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:39,630
What if Se Jong is sleepwalking

405
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:42,610
and wandering outside in the rain?

406
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:46,240
Ma'am, how can you say something scary like that?

407
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,300
Se Jong has never done that before.

408
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,970
Grandmother, seriously, what's wrong with you?

409
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:54,530
I'm just worried too.

410
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:59,570
Can you go to Ms. Park's room, Mrs. Yeoju? That's the only room I didn't check.

411
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,030
Yes, Chairman.

412
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:05,860
That's right. Why isn't Ms. Park here when there is this commotion going on?

413
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,510
Hey, let's go.

414
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:19,710
Oh, thank goodness, he's here. Se Jong is here!

415
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:22,000
Mrs. Yeoju!

416
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,050
Oh, my! Why is Se Jong here?

417
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:29,610
Ms. Park, what's going on here?

418
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:32,080
Why is Se Jong here?

419
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:37,610
It's because... Se Jong said he was scared and wanted to sleep here with me.

420
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:42,400
Then you should have told me or brought him to my room!

421
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,400
Seriously, it's so annoying.

422
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:54,820
What's with all this? I guess I won't be sleeping tonight.

423
00:34:54,820 --> 00:35:00,960
Ms. Park, the whole house was looking for him because he was missing. You didn't know?

424
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,530
No. I must have been deep asleep.

425
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:10,770
Ms. Park! What are you going to do if you sleep so deeply like that when you live in someone else's house?

426
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:21,580
Honey.

427
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,920
Honey!

428
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:34,430
Am I dreaming?

429
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:37,010
Honey.

430
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,920
Honey!

431
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,720
What is that?

432
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:51,860
Honey. Dan Dan's mother!

433
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,550
What the hell happened?

434
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:59,600
Why are you coming out now? Why?

435
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:06,210
I've been calling for you all this time!

436
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:28,970
Hee Sook and her ex-husband reconcile,

437
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:35,810
and they are living together with their children. How can I stay there?

438
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:42,360
Then you should have called me. Why did you get soaked in the rain like this and not take a taxi?

439
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:46,290
I did take a taxi here.

440
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:53,720
But my phone's battery died, so I couldn't see the address you gave me.

441
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,410
We went around the road so many times,

442
00:36:56,410 --> 00:37:03,200
the taxi driver got mad and left, so I ended up like this.

443
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:06,890
Do you know how scared I was?

444
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:11,980
The thunder is roaring, and the rain is pouring.

445
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:18,710
I understand. Drink the honey water. It's hot, so drink slowly.

446
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,460
I told you I didn't want to go! I told you!

447
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:29,860
Okay. It's all my fault. So drink up.

448
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,650
I'm so cold.

449
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:48,620
You have to eat porridge at least to take medicine. It's not good to take medicine on an empty stomach.

450
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:52,490
Here. Have a bite, at least.

451
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:03,040
It's pollack roe and Jangjorim.
 [T/N: Jangjorim is soy sauce braised beef.]

452
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:16,700
How can the pollack roe be so bouncy, not salty, and has a clean taste?

453
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:22,890
This isn't the pollack roe we ate. This must be a high-end pollack roe.

454
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:31,360
The Jangjorim is also so good. It's melting in my mouth.

455
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,650
Honey, this must be the best grade Korean beef.

456
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:40,860
How could they make Jangjorim with such good quality meat?

457
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,850
Eat slowly.

458
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:50,170
This porridge is so delicious.

459
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,590
What porridge taste this sweet?

460
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:58,470
Are you sure you're really sick?

461
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,080
I'm really sick. I have such a high fever.

462
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,470
Feel my forehead.

463
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:12,000
You do have a fever.

464
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,010
See? I have a fever.

465
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:21,530
I'm really sick. Oh, my head...

466
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:24,620
You'll get better after you eat the porridge and medicine.

467
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:28,190
For the time being, why don't you stay in a studio until I find a place?

468
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:31,880
There's a studio available. I'll drop you off later if I can.

469
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,360
I don't want to. I want to stay here.

470
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,130
Seriously! What if we get caught?

471
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:39,920
So what if we get caught? All that's going to happen is you get fired.

472
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:46,530
Also, I'm your wife. Is it such a horrible crime to stay here with you?

473
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:57,190
Okay. I'll bring it up with the Chairman when the situation seems fit since you're only staying for some time.

474
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:00,450
So be careful until then.

475
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:06,140
Okay. Of course, I will.

476
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:12,760
Honey. I suddenly feel much better.

477
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,030
But my head still hurts a little.

478
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:26,630
Let Se Jong sleep a little longer.

479
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,880
Yes.

480
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,770
What about Jenny and Se Chan?

481
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:33,910
Jenny went to school and Se Chan is still here.

482
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:38,370
Did Jenny go to school without eating breakfast?

483
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,420
Yes.

484
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,580
Have a good day, Chairman.

485
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,040
- I'm going to school.
- Have a good day at school.

486
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,210
Have a good day.

487
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:13,820
Ms. Park, let's have a talk.

488
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,990
Yes...

489
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:22,080
No matter how scared Se Jong was or cried,

490
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,620
you shouldn't have brought him to sleep with you in your room.

491
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:28,200
I was careless.

492
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,280
You should have at least contacted me.

493
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:38,610
From now on, whether it's late-night or not, call me if anything happens with Se Jong.

494
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:40,420
Yes.

495
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,350
The child was scared and crying in the middle of the night.

496
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:45,230
She probably couldn't think of calling you.

497
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:49,350
Ms. Park was also trying to be helpful. That's enough.

498
00:41:52,280 --> 00:42:00,330
Mrs. Yeoju, change all the children's bedsheets to the new ones that I bought today.

499
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:04,450
Sure!

500
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:07,460
I think I got on their bad side, Mrs. Yeoju.

501
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,510
What do I do?

502
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:13,430
What happened is happen. It's no big deal.

503
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:18,540
But if that happens again, at least let me know.

504
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:22,020
Yes, I will.

505
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,960
I feel bad for the children.

506
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,410
He must've had no one to rely on after his mother passed,

507
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:30,050
seeing that he wanted to stay with you, who is a new person here.

508
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,270
Since Se Jong is still young,

509
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:38,390
it would be good if he sleeps with Madam, his grandmother.

510
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,540
You still haven't noticed?

511
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:44,240
She has no interest in the children.

512
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,500
Of course. You've only been here for one day.

513
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:52,440
Madam isn't the children's biological grandmother.

514
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,770
What?

515
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:59,310
She's not the Chairman's biological mother.

516
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:07,060
She is the late Chairman's mistress. She is a mistress.

517
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,880
Mistress?

518
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,610
Oh, my goodness.

519
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:16,980
It turned out so natural.

520
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:20,940
I heard that hospital's Director's nickname was a human sewing machine.

521
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:24,170
Indeed, he is.

522
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:29,070
Oh, this bad man.

523
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:31,720
Eat my chewed up gum.

524
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,330
Seriously.

525
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,960
[My treasure, Se Ryun]

526
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:48,570
The caller you are trying to reach is not available. Please leave a message after the tone.

527
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:50,580
My goodness!

528
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,810
Why is she not picking up my phone all the time? What's wrong with her?

529
00:43:53,810 --> 00:44:00,520
She should get married to receive even a tiny amount of the company's share!

530
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:02,780
I have to do something.

531
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,990
She has to get married this year.

532
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:09,160
Ahjumma! Mrs. Yeoju!

533
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,770
Baby, this is a refreshing tangerine juice.

534
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:24,990
I just made it.

535
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:27,480
- Really?
- Yes.

536
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:34,340
- It's refreshing and tangy!
- Right?

537
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:37,280
Oh, wait.

538
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:41,440
Excuse me, client.

539
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,890
I will put on lotion for you.

540
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,530
- It's a complimentary service.
- Okay.

541
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:52,330
I'll put the lotion on every corner of you.

542
00:44:52,330 --> 00:45:00,020
It's because you are my precious baby. Oh, my goodness!

543
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,430
What are you doing? What are you going to do to me?

544
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:07,670
No! I really didn't do that on purpose.

545
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:08,980
I mean it.

546
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:11,130
Okay. You lewd lady.

547
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:15,290
Here. Do whatever you want!

548
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:20,040
You must be crazy!

549
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,770
Hurry up and put on your clothes! Hurry!

550
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:25,920
Do you want me to take off more?

551
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:28,440
What is that sound?

552
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,930
I think it's my mom!

553
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:34,240
Baby, hide for now!

554
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,510
Hey! Lee Se Ryun!

555
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:39,210
- Hide? Where?
 - Did you change the passcode again?

556
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:40,810
Room! Go!

557
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:42,010
Just go!

558
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:45,410
Lee Se Ryun! Open the door!

559
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,850
Here! Go inside here!

560
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:52,680
Baby, I'm really sorry. Just wait for a little bit, okay?

561
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,440
Hey, Lee Se Ryun!

562
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,200
Hey! Seriously!

563
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,390
- Open the door! 
- Okay, Mom!

564
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:08,610
Please put that anywhere in the kitchen.

565
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:11,170
Yes, ma'am.

566
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:13,470
This is my daughter.

567
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,620
This is the new driver, Mr. Park.

568
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,250
Hello, nice to meet you.

569
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:20,700
Hello.

570
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:24,500
Please take care of my family.

571
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,750
Thank you, please wait in the car.

572
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,570
Yes, ma'am.

573
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:32,390
Huh? That sounds like my father.

574
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:38,290
Why would he be here? I probably heard it wrong.

575
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:47,590
Why did you change your passcode?

576
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:50,180
If you weren't here, I would've come here for nothing.

577
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,180
What's the new passcode? Tell me.

578
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:53,680
I don't want to tell you.

579
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,720
I told you not to come here without telling me.

580
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:01,580
If you don't like that, then answer your phone. Why aren't you answering your phone?

581
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,930
It's not that I didn't answer on purpose.

582
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:07,250
I had it on silent, so I didn't know.

583
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:12,770
I heard that other daughters go shopping with their mom holding hands,

584
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:14,940
or go on trips and stuff like that.

585
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,340
They go to delicious restaurants together, too.

586
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:20,050
Do you not think about your mother? How can you be so thoughtless?

587
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:22,180
You're the only one I trust.

588
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:24,510
You're saying that again.

589
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:26,580
When are you going to get married?

590
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:30,580
You have to get married so you can receive the shares your Father left for you.

591
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:35,540
I can't stand living by getting money from your brother!

592
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:41,340
I can't marry anyone because of those shares.

593
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:43,310
Also, Mom.

594
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:45,670
Why do you care about my shares?

595
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,900
Lee Se Ryun!

596
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,900
How can you say that to me?

597
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:53,800
You know how I raised you!

598
00:47:53,800 --> 00:48:00,890
I... at my young age of twenty, fell for your Father, that old man.

599
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,100
I lived all my life being called mistress.

600
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:08,480
I never lived life properly!

601
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,280
But that old man didn't leave anything for me. That bad guy!

602
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,760
I can't forgive him even when I'm dead!

603
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:22,860
How can you say that out of all people? How can you?

604
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:25,720
Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

605
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:29,730
Later, you can have all my shares.

606
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:32,440
I'm sorry.

607
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:36,130
I... I...

608
00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:38,580
What is this?

609
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,870
Oh, my goodness, isn't this a man's underwear?

610
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:42,010
Hey!

611
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:44,020
It's nothing! It's a towel...

612
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,890
What do you mean it's nothing! Give it to me!

613
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,060
Hey! Look at this.

614
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,590
I'm right. This is a man's underwear!

615
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:53,320
Why is this here?!

616
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,330
Wait a minute. This bad guy, this weird guy!

617
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:59,660
- Where is this jerk? Come out, you punk!
- Mom, there's nobody!

618
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:02,600
There's definitely someone! Hey, you!

619
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,440
- Hey, let me go!
- Mom! Dae Beom!

620
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,370
Run away! Now!

621
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:10,050
You!

622
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:13,240
You bastard! Catch that thief!

623
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,260
You bastard!

624
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,580
Isn't that our Dae Beom?

625
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:28,890
Catch him! Catch him!

626
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:33,490
Catch him! Catch that guy!

627
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:37,510
Mr. Park, did you see a crazy bastard in a bathrobe just now?

628
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:39,670
Yes. He went that way.

629
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:43,560
Then you should've caught him! Hurry! Hurry up and catch him!

630
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,580
- Catch him! I said, catch him!
- Yes, ma'am!

631
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:49,420
That crazy bastard!

632
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:53,460
Hurry. Catch him! Catch him quickly!

633
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,960
Catch that guy!

634
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,770
That guy! That crazy bastard! That guy! Catch him!

635
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,930
So... So...

636
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:10,780
So... Is he not here?

637
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:13,060
No. I don't see him.

638
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:18,140
That thief! That rat! Goodness.

639
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:22,120
What is going on, Madam? Should I call the police?

640
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,800
Don't call the police!

641
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:30,030
Also, what happened today, don't tell anyone at home. Did you get it?

642
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:32,490
Okay. I understand.

643
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:34,700
That thief. I won't leave him alone!

644
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:39,860
Did you meet him while dancing in the club?

645
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,320
Yes.

646
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:45,460
You're crazy! You must have lost your mind!

647
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:51,570
How can you bring someone you met at a club to your place?

648
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:54,470
What are you going to do now?

649
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:57,050
What do you mean?

650
00:50:57,050 --> 00:51:01,260
My Dae Beom is a good person, Mom.

651
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:05,930
What do you mean good? You met him in a club! He's not going to be a decent person!

652
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:10,860
My Dae Beom is a sincere person, Mom.

653
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:14,290
I can tell by his eyes.

654
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:18,100
His eyes? You must be kidding. You're crazy!

655
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:21,830
Are you starring in a movie called "Innocent Steps?" How old do you think you are!

656
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:24,790
You better break up with him right now! Right now!

657
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:28,230
If your brother finds out about this, you're not the only one who's dead!

658
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:34,190
I'm dead too! Me too!

659
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:37,270
Seriously!

660
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:40,430
[Fantom]

661
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:45,590
Why are you doing this to me?

662
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:49,160
You have no right to barge into my room just because you're my Dad!

663
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:52,020
Get out of my room!

664
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:09,800
Yes, Secretary Yoon?

665
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,640
The Chairman wants to see me?

666
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:24,030
Why does the Chairman want to see me outside of the house?

667
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:28,830
Did he notice my feelings for him?

668
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,030
The lipstick color is too intense.

669
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:48,030
How long has it been since you work at my house, Chief Jo?

670
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:51,460
It's been five years.

671
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:56,630
It's been that long yet I failed to set up a time like this.

672
00:52:56,630 --> 00:53:00,740
I'm sorry. I'm thankful to you for many reasons,

673
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:03,540
yet I'm showing my gratitude now.

674
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:09,620
It's okay. I know you're a busy person.

675
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:16,210
Please take this.

676
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,070
What is this?

677
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:23,650
It's a bonus.

678
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:25,290
Bonus?

679
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:27,860
You even took on the role of a live-in tutor for more than a month.

680
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:31,180
You have worked hard, Chief Jo.

681
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:33,330
Your work hours got longer as well.

682
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:35,740
No, I'm really fine. You don't have to do this--

683
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:41,010
Please accept it, Chief Jo. I'll feel better if you take it as well.

684
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:43,550
Then...

685
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:47,980
I'll thankfully accept it.

686
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:52,610
I was thinking about sending you on a two-week vacation,

687
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:57,240
but I think it'll be better for you to go when Ms. Park gets adjust more.

688
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:03,200
I want you to help Ms. Park to adjust quickly.

689
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:08,140
Yes, Chairman. Don't worry about it.

690
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:14,780
Now that I think about it, I was able to work comfortably, all thanks to you.

691
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:17,580
I'm very grateful to you.

692
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:19,510
It's nothing.

693
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:24,740
When your wife passed away, she asked me to take good care of you and your children,

694
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:31,360
and I promised her not to worry.

695
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:37,450
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought her up.

696
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:40,710
Please, have some food.

697
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:46,180
Okay, Chairman.

698
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:03,460
Is the food okay?

699
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:07,160
Yes. It's delicious.

700
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:19,150
Since you got me delicious food, I would like to buy a tea, Chairman.

701
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:21,850
Let's have tea next time.

702
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:24,640
Ah, okay.

703
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:33,570
Really? Did you really have dinner just two of you with Chairman Lee Young Gook?

704
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:35,120
Yes!

705
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,630
I went out after receiving a call from the secretary,

706
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:42,170
and the Chairman was there alone. The restaurant was a fancy one too.

707
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:47,710
That's how you find out a person's feelings. Did he really take you to a fancy place?

708
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:52,870
Yes! He said, let's have tea as well, next time.

709
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:56,480
Isn't that a date request? It is, right?

710
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:01,790
I told you so, Mom. The Chairman does have some interest in me.

711
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:05,590
It's because it's only been two years since his wife passed,

712
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:08,410
so he's being careful and holding back.

713
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:12,170
That's true. There are also people looking out too.

714
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:16,770
So, I purposely brought up his wife,

715
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:19,080
and he was very calm.

716
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,720
Really?

717
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,680
That's a relief.

718
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:26,080
It's about time for him to forget about his dead wife.

719
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:29,840
So just trust me and don't do anything, Mom.

720
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,710
I'll make you rich.

721
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:42,020
I was worried that you were chasing an unattainable dream and becomes abandoned.

722
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:46,220
Also, the Chairman can't ignore his wife's will.

723
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:51,430
She left him and the children in my care when she passed away. What do you think that means?

724
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:56,560
It means you are the one to become his next wife.

725
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:59,990
- That's right.
- Hey! You should've recorded it.

726
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:05,590
At that time, the Chairman was next to me too. So don't worry about anything, Mom.

727
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:16,320
Are you well, my son?

728
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:21,190
When will you be done with that difficult medical study?

729
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:24,380
I was sleeping, Mom.

730
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:28,750
Okay. I'm sorry, Joon Oh. Let's hang up.

731
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,960
Wait a minute.

732
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,800
I have to open a hospital for him when he graduates from medical school.

733
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,750
And I have to get rid of the junk car.

734
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:50,680
So I have to set her up with Young Gook, no matter what. It's good for everybody.

735
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:55,270
Hold on... Hold on...

736
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:58,630
I have to do something.

737
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:06,690
I heard their Madam likes godeulpaegi kimchi.
[T/N: Godeulpaegi is a plant with a purple stack and yellow flower. The root and leaves are used to make kimchi.]

738
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:10,380
I'm sorry.

739
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:14,120
It's just that Sarah rejected such an eligible bachelor,

740
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:18,590
so I was upset and...

741
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:21,430
I'm sorry.

742
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:24,120
No. I'm the one who's sorry.

743
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:27,050
I failed to teach my daughter her place.

744
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:28,390
Hey.

745
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:32,640
I'm sorry. People should live according to their status.

746
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:37,910
Hey. Why are you twisting the words?

747
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:40,620
I'm saying that I'm sorry.

748
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:43,520
What? What?

749
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,560
What do you want to say?

750
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:48,600
The thing is.... Gi Ja...

751
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:55,030
Can you make me a bucket of godeulpaegi kimchi?

752
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:59,230
Why do you want that all of a sudden?

753
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:03,120
I just suddenly have a craving for it.

754
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:08,700
She's treating me like a maid since I'm living in her place cheaply!

755
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:14,880
Scallion kimchi, Godeulpaegi kimchi, fresh kimchi. Her orders never end!

756
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:21,500
Sure! It's been a while, but I'll make it.

757
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:24,630
Really? Gi Ja!

758
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:29,310
I only have you, Gi Ja.

759
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:34,310
Then peel some of these.

760
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:38,060
The caller you are trying to reach is off...

761
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:41,770
What's going on? Jenny's not even picking up her phone.

762
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:44,770
Do I have to call Chief Jo?

763
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:49,100
Ms. Park.

764
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,990
Is something wrong?

765
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:54,770
The thing is...

766
00:59:54,770 --> 01:00:00,490
Chairman, the truth is Jenny hasn't come home yet.

767
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:03,660
What? What about the other children?

768
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:07,630
Se Jong is sleeping, and Se Chan is washing up after finishing his homework.

769
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:10,490
But Jenny isn't home and not picking her phone up.

770
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:13,040
Is she not picking up her phone?

771
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:18,080
Her last schedule is the English academy.

772
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,830
I called the academy,

773
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:24,870
and they said that it had been over two hours since the class ended.

774
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:27,360
Over two hours?

775
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:30,310
But why haven't you reported this to me until now?

776
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:37,050
I thought she'd come home soon if I waited. But I must have thought wrong.

777
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:40,900
Ms. Park, how can you do your job like this?

778
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:45,610
I'll look for Jenny outside, so call me if she comes home in the meantime.

779
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:48,280
Okay.

780
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:02,850
Lee Jenny. Do you know what time it is?

781
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:08,270
It's been over two hours since your academy was over. What have you been doing all this time?

782
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:10,530
I'm tired.

783
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:14,410
Tell me where you have been until now!

784
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:16,190
I don't want to.

785
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:21,270
What? What did you say?

786
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:26,520
Why? You don't report to me who you're with nor where you're going.

787
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:29,440
I'm your Dad!

788
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:33,690
Why are you acting like this when you don't even care about me?

789
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:40,230
Also, what if you're my Dad? I don't want to talk with you. I'm tired!

790
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:58,000
Everyone, please rest now.

791
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:02,950
I feel bad for our Chairman.

792
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:16,600
What is it?

793
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,590
Jenny. Do you have something going on?

794
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:26,160
I saw dirt on your uniform earlier.

795
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,840
Did you trip over?

796
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:32,070
Can you close the door and leave? Stop bothering me.

797
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:39,690
Okay, I will.

798
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:55,240
What should I do?

799
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:58,050
Will I get fired?

800
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:01,720
I can't get fired.

801
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:07,750
I promised Se Jong to be with him for a long time.

802
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,460
Come on, Teacher!

803
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:23,770
Alright, hold on a second!

804
01:03:23,770 --> 01:03:26,400
Let's go together!

805
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:32,070
Come and find me!

806
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:40,640
Do you think I can't find you?

807
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:45,730
Where did Se Jong go?

808
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:48,620
We're going to be late for kindergarten.

809
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:51,630
The teacher said she'd be waiting for Se Jong.

810
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:55,320
She said there would be delicious snacks today.

811
01:03:55,320 --> 01:04:00,190
Oh, what should I do if I can't find Se Jong? What a shame!

812
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:03,090
Ta-da!

813
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:06,010
Oh, my goodness! Where were you hiding?

814
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:08,210
Let's go to kindergarten, hurry!

815
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:10,840
Alright. Let's go.

816
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:13,860
Oh, Se Jong, you should walk slowly! You'll trip!

817
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:16,770
Walk slowly!

818
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:25,300
What? Did I just dream about Dan Dan?

819
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:29,310
I'm sure I heard Dan Dan just now.

820
01:04:29,310 --> 01:04:31,810
Honey! Dear.

821
01:04:31,810 --> 01:04:36,110
Didn't you hear Dan Dan's voice just now?

822
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:37,760
What are you talking about?

823
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,940
Why would you hear Dan Dan here?

824
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:42,990
Oh, that's strange. I'm sure that was Dan Dan's voice.

825
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:45,530
I fell asleep just now,

826
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:50,100
but I heard Dan Dan saying, "let's go together," and her laughter.

827
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:52,670
You must have dreamt it.

828
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:58,850
Honey, I think I'm even dreaming about her since I'm very worried about Dan Dan.

829
01:04:58,850 --> 01:05:04,110
Honey, she's going to be okay, right?

830
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:08,480
Dan Dan will do well anywhere. Don't worry.

831
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:17,630
Who is it?

832
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:21,630
Mr. Park! It's me, Mrs. Yeoju.

833
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:25,380
Ah, yes! Hold on a moment, please.

834
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:29,700
I made some short-rib stew this morning, and it turned out so well.

835
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:33,040
So I wanted to share it with you, Mr. Park.

836
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,550
Ah, yes. Thank you!

837
01:05:35,550 --> 01:05:37,260
If you need some more, please let me know.

838
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:39,020
I'll bring you some more.

839
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:42,940
Ah. No, no! This is more than enough!

840
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:50,290
Can I have a cup of coffee here?

841
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:54,730
What are those two doing?

842
01:05:54,760 --> 01:06:01,370
I have a bit of time right now.

843
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:04,980
Right now, I have something urgent to check at the bank.

844
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:07,790
I was going to hurry there and come back before the Madam called for me.

845
01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:12,420
Can we have coffee next time?

846
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:15,040
Is that so?

847
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,470
Well, that's a shame.

848
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:20,920
- Let's have coffee together next time.
- Sure.

849
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:24,290
Thank you for the food.

850
01:06:30,510 --> 01:06:32,670
Honey.

851
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:36,620
Did that woman just flirt with you?

852
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:38,350
Lower your voice!

853
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:41,770
What kind of crazy foxy woman is she?

854
01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:45,930
What? "Can I have a cup of coffee here?" Is she crazy?

855
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:48,040
I said you should lower your voice!

856
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,840
Wait.

857
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:54,370
Have you been telling me to leave because of that woman?

858
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:59,260
You were planning to drink coffee with that woman, so you wanted me out?

859
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:00,570
You--!

860
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:02,760
I'm telling you this for sure,

861
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:08,770
but I'm never going to leave this place on my own! Did you understand me?

862
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:18,620
Why don't you open the short-rib stew pot?

863
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:21,030
Here. Here.

864
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:30,740
Why aren't you going in?

865
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:35,090
Teacher. You're going to pick me up later, right?

866
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:37,280
You're not going somewhere far, are you?

867
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:40,710
Of course! I'll pick you up later, Se Jong.

868
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:43,650
So don't worry.

869
01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:52,220
Teacher. Are you going to keep the promise that you're going to stay with me for a long time?

870
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:56,740
Of course. We made a pinky promise.

871
01:07:56,740 --> 01:08:03,730
I'll stay next to Se Jong for a very, very long time!

872
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:22,410
Right. I need to work harder for Se Jong, who believes in me.

873
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:26,540
Let's try harder, Park Dan Dan!

874
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:31,030
Oh, Ms. Park! Can you bring this fresh kimchi to Mr. Park?

875
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:34,390
Say hi to him while you're there. You haven't seen him yet, have you?

876
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:36,970
Yes. I will.

877
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:49,660
That crazy fox must have come back.

878
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:52,130
- Go!
- Okay.

879
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:58,770
You better reject her. Tell her you can't drink coffee together because you have a wife.

880
01:08:58,770 --> 01:09:00,760
I said, get inside!

881
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:03,710
- Alright!
- Get inside!

882
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:08,970
Who is it?

883
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:12,380
I'm here to deliver something from Mrs. Yeoju.

884
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:18,700
Isn't that Dan Dan's voice?

885
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:21,660
I said, go inside!

886
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:29,050
Alright. Just a moment!

887
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:36,350
Hello, I'm Park Dan Dan--

888
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:42,710
D-Dan Dan?

889
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:44,580
Dad?

890
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:49,500
Oh! Oh my, look who's here!

891
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,200
It's really Dan Dan!

892
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,500
Mom?

893
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:11,640
♫ A smile runs to me in every step ♫

894
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:18,220
♫ It's a shiny day because of you ♫

895
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:25,450
♫ Strangely, I'm drawn to you ♫

896
01:10:25,450 --> 01:10:28,290
♫ Nobody will understand me ♫

897
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:34,230
♫ You're the one that I was looking for ♫

898
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:37,400
[Young Lady and Gentleman]

899
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,610
What are you doing, hiding in someone else's house?

900
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:41,550
Mom, do you ever think before doing something?

901
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:44,670
It's better for one person to survive rather than both getting fired.

902
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:47,970
I can't leave. So you leave, Dad.

903
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:50,600
I can't live off of you forever. I'm Park Dae Beom.

904
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,310
Baby, are you doing this because you can't trust me?

905
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:54,440
Is he the Mi So Steel company's son? Really?

906
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:57,320
I think I'll have to step in for our Gook Hee and Young Gook.

907
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:00,550
So why did you give them the kimchi I made? Why!

908
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:05,140
Unni, stop lingering around the Chairman with the excuse of being his friend!

909
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:07,750
Who do you think you are to get rid of my Mom's stuff, Dad!

910
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:09,460
Do you have a new woman? Is that why?

911
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:12,490
Chairman! Children have their pains and their own emotions!

912
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:15,210
- Lee Jenny. Tell me the truth.
- Don't tell my dad!

913
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:18,260
Ms. Park! I said, you should tell me!
