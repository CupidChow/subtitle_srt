00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,890
It's all thanks to you, Chief Jo.

167
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:23,310
You're the one who recommended Ms. Park so strongly.

168
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:27,120
Oh, it was nothing...

169
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,230
Ms. Park does seem like working hard.

170
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,380
How have you been?

171
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,760
Welcome! Welcome back, Noona.

172
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,670
Yes. Why were you standing out here? As if I'm a guest.

173
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:58,680
The Chairman has been waiting for you for a very long time.

174
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,140
With this excited face.

175
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,190
Oh, really?

176
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,830
I'm happy to see you again as well. Welcome, CEO.

177
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,190
Thank you, Chief Jo.

178
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,410
- Let's head in, Noona.
- Alright.

179
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,470
Mr. Park!

180
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,560
Would you please carry the CEO's luggage?

181
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,210
Of course, Chief Jo.

182
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,930
It's Auntie Anna!

183
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:31,980
Hi! How were you? Jenny, Se Chan, Se Jong?

184
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,540
Who is she?

185
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,070
Ah, she's our teacher!

186
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,730
Hello! Nice to meet you. I'm Park--

187
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:45,370
Oh, you're here alone again?

188
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,310
How have you been?

189
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,590
You don't have a boyfriend yet?

190
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,260
Aren't you lonely wandering around alone?

191
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,570
Noona, let's go inside. You must be hungry.

192
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,310
Yes, let's head in.

193
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,930
Let's go.

194
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:02,400
Let's go, children!

195
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:12,130
Mr. Park, I'll take these.

196
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,440
No, it's okay. I can carry these alone.

197
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,210
I'll take this, at least.

198
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,270
This is unbelievable.

199
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:38,210
How can I see Soo Chul Oppa here?

200
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:45,710
By the way, how did he end up working as a driver here?

201
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,790
Had he been living like that this whole time,

202
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:53,910
giving up the art he loves?

203
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,200
Then, what about Dan Dan?

204
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,050
Our Dan Dan...

205
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,380
- Noona.
- Yes.

206
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,010
It's chamomile tea.

207
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,340
Thanks.

208
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:18,110
How is your stomach? You didn't eat much. Is it still uncomfortable?

209
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,470
I heard from Mr. Park.

210
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,420
Oh, I'm fine now. Mr. Park visited the pharmacy on our way here,

211
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,720
and I took some medicine immediately. So I think I'm better.

212
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,690
Ah, he did?

213
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,630
That's fortunate.

214
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,110
He was very friendly.

215
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:40,060
But your previous driver wasn't him.

216
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,650
Right. We hired him recently...

217
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,790
But he's planning to leave the moment I hire a new driver.

218
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,270
Why?

219
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:52,050
I don't know. He's quiet and loyal.

220
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,680
We all liked him,

221
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,020
but he seemed like he had a reason to leave.

222
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,610
Noona. You must have liked Mr. Park's driving.

223
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,360
What? Yeah, yeah.

224
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,700
Then why don't you go around with Mr. Park for now?

225
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,850
I'll tell Mr. Park about it.

226
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:13,100
No! Don't do it.

227
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,820
Then Madam will be uncomfortable.

228
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,730
By the way, are you ready for the launch?

229
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,680
Of course! It's the launching I was hung on for so long.

230
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,950
Anna K, the global brand!

231
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:31,250
I prepared the best to live up to its name, so you should look forward to it.

232
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,250
You must be full-on ready for this, to talk so confidently.

233
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,450
Wow, what a workaholic!

234
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:40,940
You smile at the moment I talk about work, Ji Young Noona.

235
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,930
Young Gook.

236
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:47,690
I asked you not to call me by that name.

237
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,760
I must have liked the times I called you Ji Young Noona.

238
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,410
It pops out without thinking.

239
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:11,300
Come on, Dad.

240
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,740
- Mom.
- Yes?

241
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,910
Are we going to eat Jjajangmyeon today?

242
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:20,630
Yes, today's Dad's payday, so we're going to eat Dan Dan's favorite Jjajangmyeon!

243
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,500
Oh, I'm so excited!

244
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,520
I want Jjambong. Can we have sweet and sour fried pork too, Dad?

245
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,850
Yeah? Let's eat sweet and sour fried pork too!

246
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,020
Yay!

247
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,750
- Let's go!
- Let's get Dan Dan!

248
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,400
Let's get Dan Dan!

249
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:13,560
What right do I have to think of Oppa and Dan Dan?

250
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:20,080
Our relationship ended a long time ago.

251
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,460
I can't do this.

252
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:28,070
I'll ride the car again that Soo Chul Oppa drives if I stay here.

253
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,190
Right. I should leave this house.

254
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:51,300
CEO, where are you going so late at night?

255
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,370
I think it'll be better for me to be in my own hotel.

256
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,050
Oh, wait a moment.

257
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,190
I'll call Mr. Park over.

258
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:03,330
No. I don't like bothering people at night because of me, so please don't.

259
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:07,390
Then what about telling the Chairman, at least?

260
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,600
No, it's very late. I believe he's sleeping.

261
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,960
I'll call Chairman Lee Young Gook tomorrow, so don't worry.

262
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,680
Then, let me call the taxi at least.

263
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,890
Alright. I'll leave it to you, then.

264
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,990
I'll bring your luggage outside.

265
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,040
No. No, it's okay, I'll do it.

266
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,060
It's okay, I'll--

267
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,430
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

268
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,960
It's okay.

269
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,710
I guess I didn't lock it properly.

270
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,770
It's alright. I'll do it.

271
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,140
Yes...

272
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,460
Thank you so much.

273
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,980
It's okay!

274
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,580
It's a tip because I'm grateful.

275
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,950
Just think of it as my gratitude, and take it.

276
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,310
A tip?

277
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,020
But, I'm really okay.

278
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,940
I'm really, really okay.

279
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:26,400
I'll call Chairman Lee Young Gook later. Have a good night.

280
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,940
Thank you!

281
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,200
What's this sound at this hour?

282
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,730
Maybe I heard wrong.

283
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,920
Is it... a burglar?

284
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,630
Who are you!

285
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:24,290
Oh, no!

286
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,810
Ms. Park?

287
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:30,180
Yes, it's me. Park Dan Dan.

288
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,830
What are you doing, Ms. Park?

289
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:35,150
Why were you out at this hour?

290
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:39,990
The thing is, Chairman... The truth is...

291
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:43,360
CEO Anna Kim said she was going to her hotel,

292
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,940
so I called a taxi and sent her off.

293
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:51,090
What? Anna Noona left?

294
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,260
Why are you telling me this now?

295
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,070
She said it was late at night,

296
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,120
so she didn't want Mr. Park to drive her,

297
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,420
and also told me not to wake you up.

298
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,270
Oh, but still...

299
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:06,300
You should've woken me up.

300
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,450
I'm sorry.

301
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:11,620
All right. I know better than anyone how stubborn she can be,

302
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,630
so I'm sure you couldn't do anything about it.

303
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,690
Anyway, go on up and get some rest.

304
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:21,210
Okay. You too, Chairman.

305
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,600
Chairman.

306
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:31,330
Should I put that frying pan back for you?

307
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:35,700
It's all right. I'll put it back.

308
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:50,840
Noona. Was my home that uncomfortable?

309
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,290
But still, how could you just sneak out like that? You should've woken me up, at least.

310
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,750
I didn't want to wake you up when you had been working all day. It's not a big deal.

311
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:01,440
I'm probably going to be sleeping until late because I'm still jet-lagged,

312
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,220
and I'm not comfortable with the idea of bothering anyone at home.

313
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,090
You should've at least had Mr. Park drive you.

314
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,600
I'm not a kid. Don't worry.

315
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,360
We're going to see each other often from now. Stop worrying so much.

316
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,210
Why don't you go back to bed?

317
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:22,840
All right, Noona. Get some rest.

318
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,250
Who are you!

319
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,190
Oh, no!

320
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:45,650
I almost could've really hit her.

321
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:50,050
But why did I grab a frying pan of all things?

322
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:02,340
The Chairman has a cute side to him too.

323
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,850
We're here to check out the house.

324
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,480
Oh, man...

325
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,250
What am I going to do?

326
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,090
I couldn't even find a place yet... What do I do?

327
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,830
Hey, hey! Lee Gi Ja! They're here to see the house!

328
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:21,440
But, hey! Why aren't you opening the door for them?

329
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,150
Is it because you don't want to show them the house?

330
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:28,320
What are you saying? I was just about to open the door!

331
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,720
Come in.

332
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,790
She's so annoying.

333
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,840
- Come on in, please!
- Welcome, welcome.

334
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,660
Ma'am, here they are.

335
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:53,940
Which one of you will be living here..?

336
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,140
Us, three brothers, will be living here together.

337
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,600
All... three of you?

338
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,790
You punk. Do you want to die?

339
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,630
It's the four of us, including Happy!

340
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:06,170
Why did you say 'three?'

341
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:15,010
The house is nice and spacious!

342
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:17,160
The four of us will be living together.

343
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,910
Oh, okay...

344
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:26,440
Were you startled?

345
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,550
Nice shot!

346
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:39,780
You're so good! Your form is great too!

347
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,030
You're amazing!

348
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,850
Oh, I wasn't that good.

349
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,110
- Go ahead, Mrs. Wang.
- Me?

350
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:51,550
I feel so pressured now!

351
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,590
Oh, my! I'll be using this tee.

352
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:06,600
Oh, dear!

353
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:11,870
I'm just a cheery golfer!

354
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,240
You did a good job.

355
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,970
Excuse me.

356
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:18,770
I got a call from my son. Excuse me while I take this.

357
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:21,410
Son?

358
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,780
Yes, dear.

359
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:27,120
What? Did you arrive already?

360
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,790
Yes, I'm almost done too.

361
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:34,420
I'll see you at the clubhouse.

362
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,200
- Is your son here?
- Yes.

363
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,590
I won't have to bother you to drive me back home.

364
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:43,540
- My son came to pick me up with his girlfriend.
- Wow!

365
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,990
Oh, that's good!

366
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,670
All right then, should we move on?

367
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,940
Oh, my...

368
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,330
Her son came with his girlfriend?

369
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:54,180
Then Se Ryun is here too?

370
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:58,890
Oh my! We're in for a fantastic show today, then.

371
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:02,960
I'm so excited!

372
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,110
Where are you, Se Ryun?

373
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:10,810
But I already know where you are, Se Ryun.

374
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,970
Oh, my gosh. I feel like my heart's about to explode.

375
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:31,330
Everyone's going to be so shocked when they find out I'm Se Ryun's mom.

376
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,030
This is my son, and this is his girlfriend.

377
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,840
Oh, nice to meet you!

378
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,210
You two make a great couple!

379
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:45,110
Definitely. Such a handsome couple.

380
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,480
What's going on here?

381
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,450
Where's Se Ryun?

382
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:52,820
Where... where's our Se Ryun?

383
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,450
What's wrong with you, Mrs. Wang?

384
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:57,110
Mrs. Koh.

385
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,640
Is he really your son?

386
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,960
Of course, he's my son.

387
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,630
- Do you happen to have another son?
- Oh, my.

388
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,930
What are you saying, Mrs. Wang?

389
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:12,370
She only has one son... He's an only child.

390
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:16,590
What? What did you do to Se Ryun?

391
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:20,710
You cheater! How dare you come here with another girl!

392
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:24,600
What are you doing? What's wrong with her, Mom? Who is she?

393
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,030
You...!

394
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,650
How dare you touch him! Have you gone mad?

395
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,660
What's wrong with you, Mrs. Wang?

396
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:36,850
You! Didn't you meet Se Ryun at Central Park Club?

397
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,460
Did you break up with her? Did you dump her, you bastard?!

398
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,700
Baby, I never did that. I don't even know who Se Ryun is!

399
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,540
What? You don't know who she is?!

400
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:49,820
You scumbag!

401
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:53,910
Oh, my goodness!

402
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,800
Have you really gone mad?

403
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,840
What? Cheater?

404
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:02,640
Club? Are you on a mission to ruin someone else's son's life?

405
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,110
How dare you blabber lies like that?

406
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:12,440
How vulgar. Just because you live like that, you think everyone else does too?

407
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,750
What! What's wrong with me! What!

408
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:19,430
You're just a lowly mistress.

409
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:22,800
You think we're the same just because we let you hang out with us a couple of times? You should know your place.

410
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,580
Mrs. Koh. That's why I told you I didn't want to hang out with this woman.

411
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:32,270
I never want you to even mention her in front of me from now on.

412
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:58,530
What? I'm just a lowly mistress?

413
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:03,680
I'm not going to let this slide!

414
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,810
Mr. Park, why are you so slow!

415
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:08,580
I said, speed up!

416
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,550
Y-Yes, ma'am.

417
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:16,870
Wait. Then who is that bastard?

418
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:20,490
What? Did you lie to me?

419
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:24,850
Yes. Because I thought you wouldn't allow it.

420
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:27,940
No matter how much you wanted him, how can you make up such a lie?!

421
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,460
I became an idiot because of you!

422
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,230
So why did you go around talking about it?

423
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,490
You--!

424
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:42,050
Okay, fine. That's already happened. Then who is he?

425
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,200
Whose family's son is it?

426
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,380
Mom. Does it matter which family's son he is?

427
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,320
Then what's important!

428
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,110
Mom, I love him.

429
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:59,160
He's so nice, innocent, and someone who only loves me.

430
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,910
Isn't that enough?

431
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:05,310
You've lost your mind! Something's off!

432
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:08,180
You! Did you get yourself entangled with some weirdo?

433
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,170
Oh, my gosh. Entangled?

434
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,900
Do you think my Dae Beom is a snake? A viper?

435
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,190
Why would I get entangled?

436
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,040
Oh, his name is Dae Beom, is it?

437
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,760
What's his last name? His age?

438
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,870
I'm not telling you!

439
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,370
Oh, stop meddling with me, seriously!

440
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:26,990
I mean, think of my age! Why are you still trying to decide for me?

441
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:30,260
What? This girl's really gone weird!

442
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,040
- Give me your phone.
- What? No, no!

443
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,250
No!

444
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,510
Mom, I'm going to bite you!

445
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,420
You--!

446
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,940
You! You-!

447
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,860
Come back here!

448
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:43,010
So his name is Dae Beom...?

449
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,860
What is his last name?

450
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:50,150
I don't know his last name nor age! I only know his name.

451
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:53,870
Then do you know his phone number? We just need his phone number.

452
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:57,460
Would I have come all the way here if I knew his phone number?

453
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:02,290
Look. If you follow my daughter around, you can catch that guy.

454
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:07,610
I don't need anything else. I just need to know whose family's son he is.

455
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:10,820
As soon as possible, please.

456
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:30,320
Driver Kim. Stop the car for a moment.

457
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,240
What do you think about this color?

458
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,670
It suits you well.

459
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,070
Alright.

460
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,380
Lee Jenny.

461
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:44,540
Dad?

462
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,110
Hello.

463
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,530
Are you Heo Won Seo?

464
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:57,080
Yes, I'm Heo Won Seo. Do you know me?

465
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:02,500
Dad. How do you know Won Seo?

466
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:07,160
Have you been keeping tabs on me?

467
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,680
Is that important right now?

468
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:15,220
Lee Jenny. Why are your lips so red?

469
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,600
And why are your eyes so dark?

470
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,810
Are you wearing makeup?

471
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:24,650
Jenny. I need to go to the tutoring. I'll go first.

472
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:27,640
Okay. See you tomorrow.

473
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,430
Dad, what's wrong with you?

474
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:41,910
What's wrong with you talking to a boy on the streets?

475
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:45,610
Wow. What did you just say?

476
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:51,910
Lee Jenny. Aren't you going to the tutoring?

477
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:56,950
Do you think I feel like going to the tutoring right now? After you embarrassed me in front of my friend?

478
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:59,340
I told you not to talk like that.

479
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,660
And Won Seo is not just a friend, is he?

480
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,480
He's your boyfriend, isn't he?

481
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,510
Dad, you're seriously hopeless.

482
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:11,560
What? Hopeless?

483
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,820
Get back here!

484
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,270
No way!

485
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:38,260
Ms. Park, you heard all that, right?

486
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:41,270
Yes. I've heard it all from Jenny.

487
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,140
What should I do about Jenny?

488
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:47,990
She's already wearing makeup, putting on lipstick on the street with a boy.

489
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:51,900
Does it make sense for her to have a boyfriend at that age?

490
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:57,750
Chairman, did you talk to Jenny like you're talking to me right now?

491
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:01,570
Why? Is something wrong?

492
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:04,650
Chairman, Won Seo is just a friend.

493
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:10,560
It's alright for friends to get along. But if you interfere, their relationship's only going to get worse.

494
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,760
What? Ms. Park, whose side are you on?

495
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:20,240
We need to think about fixing Jenny's wrong, why are you siding with her?

496
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,120
I'm not taking anybody's sides.

497
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,080
I'm telling you the facts as it is.

498
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:31,930
Chairman. Jenny was lonely up until now because of all the trouble she had with her friends.

499
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:36,740
She finally got a friend, and she's barely getting brighter,

500
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:40,900
but you scolded her too rashly, Chairman.

501
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,550
Do you think I did this without knowing that? But her friend's a boy!

502
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:50,580
She was putting on makeup on the streets, and they were sticking close to each other. Do you think they're just friends?

503
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,220
I can't stand for this.

504
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:57,070
I'll have to meet up with Heo Won Seo again.

505
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,810
Ms. Park, why are you laughing?

506
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:04,580
Do I seem funny to you?

507
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:09,030
You made me recall my dad.

508
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:13,700
When I was in middle school, I was eating a hotdog with a classmate who's a boy,

509
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:19,700
and my Dad saw me, and he got angry just like you.

510
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,690
I think all dads are like this.

511
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:27,420
It's not that. The two seriously looked strange!

512
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:33,610
The expression Won Seo made as he looked at Jenny was something serious!

513
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:37,390
You said she met Won Seo at her English tutoring class, right?

514
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:41,870
Change that English tutoring place to somewhere else by tomorrow.

515
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:47,210
Chairman, you're seriously hopeless, just like Jenny said.

516
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:50,130
Wh...what?

517
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:53,010
I don't think I can help you, Chairman.

518
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:57,580
No matter how much I explain, you don't listen to me.

519
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:02,620
I think you'll have to solve this problem on your own, Chairman.

520
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,740
Fine. I'll solve this on my own.

521
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:10,600
I won't change my opinion on this, not this time!

522
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:23,610
Lee Jenny, open the door. We need to talk.

523
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,880
Who are you, Ajussi?

524
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,140
I have nothing to say to an Ajussi who keeps tabs on me!

525
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,730
Hopeless Ajussi.

526
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:45,920
Ms. Park. Did you hear that?

527
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,350
Jenny called me an Ajussi.

528
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:54,350
What kind of... It's ridiculous.

529
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:08,230
Does pride feed me?

530
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:14,780
Contract? What contract?

531
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:18,310
Oh, ma'am. What contract do you think I'm talking about?

532
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:23,180
The people who looked at the house this morning want to sign the lease. What time should we do it?

533
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:27,580
What? The people who visited this morning?

534
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:32,520
Yes! You're going to sign the contract, right?

535
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:41,290
Nice to meet you!

536
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:45,340
No, wait, stop! Stop! Hold on.

537
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:48,710
What? Why?

538
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:52,880
I...I'm wondering whether I should raise the rent.

539
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,680
I'll think about it and call you back. Hold on for now!

540
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:05,440
Oh, I'll be alone in this house!

541
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,490
Those thugs..? Oh, just thinking about them makes me scared!

542
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,850
Joon Oh rarely visits this house as well.

543
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:21,310
Why does this house feel so empty today?

544
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:25,400
I can't do anything without Gi Ja...

545
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:28,630
Oh, I must have made a mistake asking her to move out.

546
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:33,230
Why did our relationship become like this?

547
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,350
Mi Sook.

548
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:44,330
What brought you here?

549
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,460
What...what are these?

550
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:00,020
These are Short-rib stew, scallion kimchi, and Japchae.

551
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,750
These are your favorites.

552
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:07,660
I...I just made the rice too. It's warm.

553
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,540
What...what?

554
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:16,670
Are you giving these to me as a farewell gift..?

555
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:21,880
Mi Sook. I'm sorry.

556
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:25,060
What?

557
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:32,420
I also found out recently that Sarah has feelings for Chairman Lee.

558
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:37,600
I...I wasn't trying to hide it from you on purpose, you know?

559
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,660
Still, Sarah's a young woman who never got married before.

560
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:45,800
I was so upset that she loves a man who has three kids!

561
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,690
I was so shocked, so I didn't tell you.

562
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:55,710
But, what am I supposed to do when Sarah keeps telling me she loves Chairman Lee so much?

563
00:40:55,710 --> 00:41:00,960
That's why I went to that house with the kimchi the other day.

564
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:06,120
Because I don't have much, I can't do much.

565
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,960
So I was trying to help Sarah out, at least in my own way.

566
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,790
I wasn't trying to stab you in the back.

567
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:19,030
But how can you say you're going to move out?

568
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:22,340
You told me to leave first!

569
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,860
I said that in the heat of the moment! I just said it because I was angry.

570
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:30,060
We have been friends for more than 40 years! Do you not know me still?

571
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,370
You even advertised the house at the real estate's, without telling me!

572
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:36,930
Do you know how upset I was?

573
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:39,120
Mi Sook...

574
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:43,850
I...I honestly have nowhere to go.

575
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:48,260
Hey, can you let me live here for a bit longer?

576
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,730
Why do you say a bit longer?

577
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:54,090
Just live here forever!

578
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:58,170
Where else are you going to live in this expensive Seoul City?

579
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:00,070
Thank you.

580
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:03,980
Thank you, Mi Sook.

581
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:06,390
I'll be nicer to you from now on.

582
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:09,000
I really only have you, Mi Sook!

583
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:12,570
Hey! I can't breathe!

584
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:15,290
Alright, I get it, I can't breathe!

585
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:19,200
You are an idiot! Don't be like that.

586
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:31,660
Why are there so many kinds of lipsticks?

587
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,830
Chairman. You can take your time choosing one.

588
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:39,090
Something you won't be offended by, seeing Jenny wearing it.

589
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,560
This one.

590
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,170
Chairman. Are you joking?

591
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:57,500
Didn't you just say you want to make up with Jenny?

592
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,320
Do you think she'll forgive you with this one?

593
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:05,660
A transparent one is going too far! You need to choose one with color.

594
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:10,170
Then choose something like the one you're wearing, Ms. Park.

595
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,950
I think that color's tolerable.

596
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:16,470
The one I have on my lips?

597
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:28,270
I bought this a long time ago...

598
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:31,520
Will it still be around?

599
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:06,680
Teacher, you planned this with Dad, didn't you?

600
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:11,410
Is that why you asked me to go out to eat pizza together?

601
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:13,650
What are you doing?

602
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:16,950
Jenny. Hear me out first.

603
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:20,790
Your dad wants to make up with you.

604
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:27,990
Your dad's trying hard, so can't you hear him out at least?

605
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:48,130
Teacher. Can you ask Dad whether he really wants to make up with me?

606
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:52,520
Chairman. You're here to make up with Jenny, right?

607
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:56,830
Tell her I'm here with such intentions, Ms. Park.

608
00:44:56,830 --> 00:45:00,780
Teacher. Tell Dad I can't believe him yet.

609
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:06,730
Ask him how he's going to prove he wants to make up with me.

610
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:08,960
Chairman, you heard her, right?

611
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,450
How are you going to prove it?

612
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:23,960
Tell her this is the evidence.

613
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:38,670
No way. Did Dad buy this for me?

614
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:43,220
Are you finally talking to me?

615
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:46,120
Tell me, now. Did you really buy it?

616
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,780
Yes. I bought that.

617
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:52,940
Just promise me you'll wear these light shades, which aren't so obvious.

618
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:55,860
Wear something light-colored that suits you as a student.

619
00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:00,170
Dad, you've made another mistake again! Why are you saying "that suits you as a student?"

620
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:04,810
I don't like hearing that. You sound like an old man.

621
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:06,560
Alright, alright.

622
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:12,290
I'll be more careful from now on. Are you going to forgive me now?

623
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:19,340
Okay. I'll accept your apology.

624
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,720
But Jenny.

625
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:26,350
Can you make a boyfriend a bit later?

626
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:31,380
Honestly, I'm a bit jealous.

627
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:36,020
Dad, Won Seo isn't my boyfriend. He's just a friend.

628
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:39,300
Really? Are you honest with me?

629
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,430
Don't date any guys yet, okay?

630
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:46,280
Alright, I get it! Can't you trust your own daughter?

631
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:50,220
Of course, I trust my daughter! Shall we eat pizza now?

632
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,830
Yes!

633
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:11,090
♪ I'm waiting for someone ♪

634
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:14,780
♪ who won't come... ♪

635
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:24,100
What? Isn't that Chairman Lee?

636
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:33,400
She's Chairman Lee's eldest daughter.

637
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:39,580
But who's that woman?

638
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:45,300
These guys...

639
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,640
This is so strange...

640
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:55,320
Oh, Sarah, come sit here!

641
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,190
What is it, Mom?

642
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:59,570
Who is this girl?

643
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:02,550
Do you know her?

644
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:05,910
What is this? What photo is this?

645
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:09,090
I'm asking who this woman is!

646
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:13,730
She's Ms. Park, the new live-in tutor that I told you about before.

647
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:16,920
Oh, the young country girl?

648
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,870
But why is that tutor eating pizza with Chairman Lee outside of the house?

649
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:28,530
Like a family! Look, the three of them are having fun!

650
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:32,080
Oh, something's happened with Jenny recently.

651
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:35,600
They must have gathered because of that. It seems like it.

652
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:39,820
No, no, this isn't something you should gloss over.

653
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:45,260
Hey, these two were gazing at each other and smiling while eating pizza!

654
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:47,140
The Chairman and Ms. Park?

655
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:52,750
No matter how professional the cause is, think about how offended I was even to take a picture!

656
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:56,240
Mom! What are you imagining?

657
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,900
Do you know how big the age difference between the Chairman and Ms. Park is?

658
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,830
That's impossible!

659
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:06,770
So please, Mom! Stop imagining things.

660
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:09,630
I'm going into my room.

661
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:15,670
Did I overreact?

662
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:21,790
Well, they are not enemies. They can laugh while eating pizza.

663
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:33,210
Why didn't Ms. Park report that to me?

664
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:04,350
How long has it been! How many years has this been!

665
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:08,360
It's been so long since I last breathed in Korean air.

666
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,660
Oh, it's so sweet.

667
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:12,730
It's not just sweet. It's sweet like honey!

668
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:15,020
Mother.

669
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:18,310
What do you think? Is it sweet?

670
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:20,700
- Oh, my gosh!
- Oh, come on.

671
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,910
That hurts!

672
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:25,640
Hang on.

673
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,910
Seeing that this hurts, it's definitely not a dream.

674
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:31,010
We're back in the Republic of Korea, our home, right?

675
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:33,530
What did you eat? It smells rotten.

676
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:36,450
- You drive me crazy!
- Why are you mad at me?

677
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:39,960
But, Grandma and Uncle. Where do we go now?

678
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,250
Where else? We should go to Noona and Soo Chul Hyung's house.

679
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:45,820
Then should I call Aunt or Dan Dan Unni?

680
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:48,830
Wait! Don't call them.

681
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:50,650
Let's surprise them.

682
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:55,980
Hey, Geon... I don't think I can go see your sister.

683
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:59,070
How can we see them so shamelessly?

684
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:01,190
That's why we have to go.

685
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:04,960
We at least have to go now and beg them for forgiveness.

686
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,150
Also, we are not going empty-handed.

687
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:15,610
That's true. They'll forgive us since we didn't come empty-handed, right?

688
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:18,060
Mother. You just stand behind me.

689
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:20,700
I'll take care of everything.

690
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,630
Why are you worried when you have Cha Geon here?

691
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:26,560
Alright! Let's hurry up and go, and surprise them!

692
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,620
Let's go!

693
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:31,470
- Let's go!
- Yes, let's surprise them.

694
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:33,320
What... did you say?

695
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,210
What happened?

696
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:38,270
The son and mom who lived here

697
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:42,340
invested in something shady, something called "Treasure ship."

698
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:45,540
So they blew all their deposit and got kicked out onto the streets,

699
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:48,550
and all the family members were separated.

700
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:52,200
What? Are they kicked out onto the streets?

701
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,240
- Grandma!
- Mom!

702
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,670
Oh, my goodness. What in the world?

703
00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:00,360
I thought your sister was doing well.

704
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:03,430
Geon, forget the surprise.

705
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:07,820
- Just call your sister now.
- Okay, I will.

706
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:11,950
Oh, my... What should we do?

707
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:15,890
You've got good land?

708
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:19,240
That's funny. Why would you sell your good land?

709
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:22,630
Listen. I have absolutely no money,

710
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:25,500
so don't call me!

711
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,990
This is driving me crazy. I can't go anywhere.

712
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:31,620
I'm bored.

713
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:35,000
Look at my belly.

714
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,130
This isn't good.

715
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:42,230
One, two, three, four.

716
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:43,420
One, two, three, four.

717
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:44,670
One, two, three, four!

718
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:47,700
One, two, three, four. Two, two, three, four.

719
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:51,520
One, two, one, two.

720
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,380
Oh, my stomach.

721
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:56,700
Why is she calling again? It's annoying.

722
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:59,880
Hello? I'm not buying your land!

723
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,650
- Noona!
- Oh?

724
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:08,800
Noona? I told you, I have no money!

725
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:13,260
What are you saying? It's me, Geon! Cha Geon!

726
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:17,050
What? Geon?

727
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:21,700
Geon! Where are you right now?

728
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:24,330
Geon...

729
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:30,440
Please sit. I came to have some tea with you.

730
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,420
Okay...

731
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:34,520
Here.

732
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:45,340
I realized we didn't even have a cup of tea together since you came here.

733
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:48,530
Oh, I see.

734
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:51,860
Thank you for working so hard and doing a good job.

735
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:55,750
The Chairman is also very satisfied we picked you.

736
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:57,510
Really?

737
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:00,110
Thank you for your kind words.

738
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:07,940
It's all thanks to you for helping me out. I'll work harder from now.

739
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:15,480
But... did something happen between Jenny and the Chairman outside of the house?

740
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:20,610
The Chairman wanted to make up with Jenny, so I set it up for them to meet outside.

741
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:23,060
At the pizza place.

742
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:25,150
Oh... I see.

743
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:28,880
Then were you there too?

744
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,350
Yes, because Jenny asked me to be there too.

745
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:37,800
Good job. You took the role of the mediator.

746
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,180
Thankfully the Chairman and Jenny made up.

747
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:47,010
Oh, I was going to report it to you but you had already gone home.

748
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:52,250
If something like that happens in the future after I go home, at least text me, please.

749
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:55,550
Okay, I'll do that.

750
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:02,900
My Noona lives in this palace-like mansion?

751
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,780
What happened?

752
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:07,880
Didn't they say that Noona got scammed and everyone had to live separately?

753
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:12,660
Wait. Is this the right place?

754
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:19,860
Yes. This is the right place.

755
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:23,550
Then that woman told us nonsense.

756
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:27,900
Soo Chul and Yeon Sil aren't dumb to get scammed like that.

757
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,420
Hey, hurry up and ring the bell.

758
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:32,920
Ah, okay.

759
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:36,750
Who is it?

760
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,220
Oh, I'm...

761
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,920
Hey, Geon! Geon!

762
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,010
Noona!

763
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:44,460
Don't do that! Don't ring the bell!

764
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,340
What? Is it the wrong place?

765
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:48,170
This is not your place?

766
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:50,500
I'm sorry, I came to the wrong place.

767
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,950
I'm sorry.

768
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:56,310
It's Yeon Sil!

769
00:55:56,310 --> 00:56:00,400
- Yeon Sil!
- Mom!

770
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,230
Where have you been all this time, Mom?

771
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:11,980
Why didn't you contact me!

772
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:15,220
I missed you so much, and I was so worried about you.

773
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:19,750
- Yeon Sil...!
- Mom...

774
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:22,830
- Noona!
- Auntie!

775
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:32,240
You fool... You should've properly looked into that "Treasure ship" or whatever before you invested.

776
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:37,010
Now all the family members are separated. What is this!

777
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:39,390
Stop talking about that now, Mom.

778
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:43,950
It'll only stress you out to cry over spilled milk.

779
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:46,140
This is all because of me.

780
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:50,420
If only I hadn't lost my brother-in-law's house five years ago...

781
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:53,560
Then you and Dae Beom wouldn't have invested in that "Treasure ship."

782
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:59,030
This happened because you were trying to get his house back.

783
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:04,370
Now my smart brother-in-law is working as a driver for someone,

784
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:07,210
and my sister is hiding here!

785
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:09,640
I... I don't deserve to live!

786
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:13,490
No, no. It's all because of me.

787
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:19,780
You all wouldn't be living like this if I had money.

788
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:25,460
I'm sorry that you met an incompetent parent like me.

789
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:31,400
Gosh, Mother. I'm the one who should be blamed, not you.

790
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,390
You didn't do anything wrong!

791
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:38,790
All right. I won't scold you, so just stop.

792
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:43,800
What's the point of crying about the past?

793
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:48,240
But what about Dae Beom and Dan Dan?

794
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,980
Dae Beom is doing great.

795
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:53,940
Don't worry about him.

796
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:56,920
What about Dan Dan Unni?

797
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:01,590
Dan Dan... She's close by.

798
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:03,280
Very close by.

799
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,050
Close by? Where?

800
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,590
Then tell her to come here!

801
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:11,070
Yes, Mi Rim's here too, so tell her to come.

802
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,970
Where is she?

803
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:16,510
Here. In the main house.

804
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:20,100
In the main house here?

805
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:23,080
This house's main house?

806
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:29,900
Then did Dan Dan marry into this rich family?

807
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:34,940
What are you saying? That's not it.

808
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:41,000
It's a headache to explain. We're just living like strangers right now.

809
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,260
The father can't call his daughter, his daughter, and the daughter can't call her father, father.

810
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:47,680
What in the world are you saying?

811
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,100
Is Dan Dan Hong Gil Dong or something?

812
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:52,730
What are you saying?

813
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:55,410
What is she saying?

814
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:13,230
My goodness.

815
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:16,310
This is so upsetting.

816
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,790
He looks like he's from a wealthy family.

817
00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:28,630
I wonder if he's from a better family than Mi So Steels.

818
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:32,810
There's no way Se Ryun would date anyone.

819
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:38,000
Will I get in trouble again while I'm digging his back?

820
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,510
Yes, it's me. You can't get caught, no matter what.

821
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:48,150
Be careful.

822
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:52,350
I just need to find out who his parents are, okay?

823
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:55,760
I ate too much.

824
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,290
I quit going on a diet after meeting you.

825
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:02,900
What if I end up with a fat belly?

826
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:05,790
I think you'll be even cuter with a fat belly.

827
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:09,420
Don't go on a diet. Just eat whatever you want to eat.

828
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:10,700
Really?

829
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:13,230
Of course! I'm being honest.

830
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:16,350
Then let's go eat tiramisu and coffee too!

831
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:20,440
There's a really delicious place over there!

832
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,860
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

833
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:25,620
- What is it?
- Hold on.

834
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:30,160
- It's my mom.
- Oh, okay.

835
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:32,910
Hi, Mom.

836
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:37,270
What? Uncle, Grandma, and Mi Rim?

837
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:40,680
Okay, I'll be there soon.

838
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,850
What is it?

839
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:47,970
My uncle, grandmother, and cousin came to Korea. It's been five years, so I have to go see them.

840
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:49,920
Alright. You should go.

841
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,530
- I'll see you later, Se Ryun.
- Okay.

842
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:55,320
Wait, wait!

843
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:01,190
Treat them to a delicious meal today.

844
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,770
Something fancy.

845
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:06,220
Se Ryun...

846
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,600
Yes, Honey. What is it?

847
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:45,250
What?

848
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:48,140
What are you talking about?

849
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:50,480
Who's there?

850
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:55,670
Son-in-law Park, it's been so long.

851
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:59,470
Our Son-in-law Park, you've been through so much.

852
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:01,590
Brother-in-law...

853
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:05,170
Mother-in-law, Younger-brother-in-law, Mi Rim...

854
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:08,220
Honey, I know they shouldn't come to this place,

855
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:10,170
but she wanted to see you first.

856
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:14,030
She has something to tell you.

857
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:16,380
Yes.

858
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:27,400
Noona, Brother-in-law.

859
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,600
Take this.

860
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,210
What is it?

861
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:36,320
It's not much. It's 50 million won.

862
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:39,430
What? 50 million won?

863
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:42,400
Please take this for now.

864
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:51,740
It's really 50 million won!

865
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:55,430
Yes. As soon as we got off the plane,

866
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:59,810
we went to the bank and had checks made fresh off the press.

867
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:04,680
It's nowhere near as much as the house you lost because of Geon,

868
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:10,330
but it's money we earned working day and night in Vietnam for the past five years.

869
01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:12,780
Son-in-law Park, Yeon Sil.

870
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:17,400
We felt so bad that we couldn't get a good night's sleep ever since.

871
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,200
We're really sorry.

872
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:23,730
I couldn't see your face before,

873
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:27,140
so I told Geon we should run away.

874
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:29,590
I'm sorry.

875
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:33,050
I'm sorry.

876
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:38,380
Noona, Older-brother-in-law, I'm sorry.

877
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:44,180
I'm going to work really hard

878
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:49,620
and buy your house back.

879
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:52,130
Geon, Geon...

880
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:55,820
Noona... I'm sorry.

881
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:59,570
Son-in-law Park, Yeon Sil...

882
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:01,960
Mom...

883
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:16,260
- Please speed up a bit.
- Yes, sir.

884
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:35,160
What... is this?

885
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:40,770
This house looks so familiar.

886
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:43,740
Isn't this the back gate of our house?

887
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:52,260
What was the address again? It's in Hannam-Dong..?

888
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:56,320
40, 48, 49,

889
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,880
Can you say that again?

890
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:05,280
Are you sure?

891
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,460
Okay.

892
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:20,590
Oh, my... Oh, my!

893
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,630
Oh, my goodness! Does it make any sense?

894
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:24,350
Mrs. Yeoju! Check this out.

895
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:26,120
- What's wrong?
- Take a look at this.

896
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:29,580
This, right here... It's our house, isn't it?

897
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:31,800
Yes, right. It's our back gate right here.

898
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,780
But, who is he?

899
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:35,600
Oh, my goodness. What happened?

900
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:39,970
Why would this guy come into our house?

901
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:43,150
Madam, what is it?

902
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:47,240
That must be him. That backhouse was suspicious.

903
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:50,380
I thought there was a ghost back there.

904
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:51,650
A ghost?

905
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:54,110
Wha... what does that mean?

906
01:05:54,110 --> 01:05:58,290
When Mr. Park was out driving for you, and nobody's supposed to be there,

907
01:05:58,290 --> 01:06:04,060
it smelled of ramen smell, and some woman seemed to have appeared and disappeared.

908
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:07,970
Let's go check it out. Let's go right now.

909
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:10,890
Madam, why don't you stay here? We'll go check it out.

910
01:06:10,890 --> 01:06:12,610
No! No.

911
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:17,780
I'm going to go and check it out with my own eyes.

912
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:19,820
Let's go.

913
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,460
I said I'll treat you to something delicious outside.

914
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:26,580
Let's stop eating this and go outside.

915
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:29,460
Yes, Mom. He's going to buy Korean barbecue outside,

916
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:33,070
so let's stop eating and go outside.

917
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:36,710
Is food outside going to be any better than this?

918
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:41,110
It's not like today is Lunar New Year, but why do you have so many different kinds of seasoned vegetables?

919
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:43,600
Mother, we must have good luck with food.

920
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:47,810
You've been craving the seasoned vegetables so badly.

921
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:52,470
Yes, this taste is out of this world.

922
01:06:55,020 --> 01:07:02,500
He did enter through our back gate on the photo that you sent me, right?

923
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:05,060
Is he still in there?

924
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:07,290
Alright.

925
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:10,690
Okay. Let's go and see.

926
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:21,320
I think something's happening.

927
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:24,290
It seems to be.

928
01:07:24,330 --> 01:07:27,500
How can the driver's quarter be this nice?

929
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:29,860
It has everything you need.

930
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:33,830
If you just stay here like until now, then you can save on rent.

931
01:07:33,830 --> 01:07:38,320
Exactly... If we move out, it will be a big loss.

932
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:41,670
If it weren't for someone, I wouldn't have to move out.

933
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:45,970
True. This place is perfect for mom and dad.

934
01:07:47,570 --> 01:07:49,520
Goodness gracious, what is this?

935
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:52,860
What's this? What are all these people doing in somebody else's house?

936
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:55,560
Were you all hiding and living here?

937
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:58,920
No, Ma'am. Please calm down. I'll explain everything.

938
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,790
We were just getting ready to leave.

939
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:04,430
So, please don't say harsh words to my father.

940
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:07,120
Grandma, Mom, Uncle, let's go.

941
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:09,850
What? Father?

942
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:14,300
Then, are you Driver Park's son?

943
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:17,670
Yes, I am.

944
01:08:17,670 --> 01:08:21,880
This scammer dirtbag! Hey!

945
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:24,950
You punk!

946
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:27,140
Mother! It's dangerous!

947
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:29,810
- You come here!
- How dare you grab his head!

948
01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:32,860
Mom, mom!

949
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:35,460
Stop it!

950
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:40,330
How dare you grab my son!

951
01:08:40,330 --> 01:08:42,330
What is going on here!

952
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:44,010
Stop it right now!

953
01:08:44,010 --> 01:08:47,280
Why is he screaming?

954
01:08:54,420 --> 01:09:01,180
♫ A smile blooms in every step ♫

955
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:05,880
♫  It's a shiny day because of you  ♫

956
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,160
♫  it's sunshine day ♫

957
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:14,990
♫  Strangely, I'm drawn to you  ♫

958
01:09:14,990 --> 01:09:22,740
♫  Nobody will understand me. You're the only one that I was looking for  ♫

959
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:25,670
[Young Lady and Gentleman]

960
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:28,980
Mr. Park had bad intentions from the beginning!

961
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:30,960
He was trying to seduce Se Ryun!

962
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,190
Is Se Ryun, the daughter of this house?

963
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:35,830
You were another gold digger.

964
01:09:35,830 --> 01:09:38,050
How long are you going to live like this?

965
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:42,260
Dad, our teacher cried a lot last night.

966
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:43,400
Ms. Park did?

967
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:46,590
I heard you need money. How much do you need?

968
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:49,690
How can you tell the Chairman such petty things?

969
01:09:49,690 --> 01:09:52,800
Even so, I can't stay here anymore.

970
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:56,550
Her name is Park Dan Dan. Is there anything else you know?

971
01:09:56,550 --> 01:10:00,490
Is she Dan Dan? My daughter, Dan Dan...
