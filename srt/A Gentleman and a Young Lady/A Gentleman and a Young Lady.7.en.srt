00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,980
Oh, my gosh. What is all this!
[Episode 7]

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,650
What are all these people doing in somebody else's house?

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,010
Were you living here secretly?

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,440
No, Ma'am. Please calm down. I'll explain everything.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,240
We were all just about to leave.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,870
So, please don't say harsh words to my father.

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,590
Grandma, Mom, Uncle, let's go.

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,740
What?! Father?

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,800
Then, are you Driver Park's son?

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,390
Yes, I am.

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,000
This scammer dirtbag!

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,000
- Come here, you!
- That woman!

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,500
Oh, Mother, Mother!

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,910
How dare you grab his head!

15
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,540
Mom... Mom!

16
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,720
Grandma! Uncle! Save me!

17
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,680
Let him go!

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,870
- Let my son go!
- What is going on here!

19
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,970
Stop this right now!

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,500
She ripped all my hair out.

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,850
What is going on?

22
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,520
What is it?

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,610
Young Gook! Chairman Lee!

24
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,300
Driver Park and these people are all con men!

25
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,100
A family of con men!

26
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,550
What? "A family of Con men?"

27
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:26,410
Yes! They were all living here behind our backs and conspired together,

28
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:30,790
to trick our sweet Se Ryun and took her money! These dirtbags!

29
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,530
These little parasites did that!

30
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,180
What did you say? Did somebody trick Se Ryun?

31
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,710
Yes!

32
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,940
Driver Park. Explain yourself, please.

33
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,570
That's not true, Chairman!

34
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,770
I think Madam has a big misunderstanding.

35
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,520
What misunderstanding? You are such a thick-faced con man!

36
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,920
Driver Park came into our house to scam us from the beginning!

37
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,270
They all plotted together to seduce our Se Ryun.

38
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,880
Our Se Ryun fell head over heels for that little player over there!

39
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,240
Excuse me? What are you talking about it?

40
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,900
Why would Dae Beom hit on Ms. Se Ryun...

41
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,180
Wait, Dae Beom... Did you..?

42
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,490
Father... Is this Se Ryun's family?

43
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:20,050
Oh, my goodness! Look at that shameless thing, pretending not to know!

44
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,450
Hey! The clothes and belt you have on,

45
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,500
and this watch. These are all luxury brands!

46
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,750
You tricked Se Ryun into buying you these, didn't you? Am I wrong?

47
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,870
I didn't trick her. Se Ryun bought these for me as a gift.

48
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,880
What gift? You, con man!

49
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,940
You girly-looking player!

50
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,330
Oh, gosh...

51
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,530
- Oh, Noona!
- Yeon Sil.

52
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,180
Dae Beom... Is everything that she said true?

53
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,190
Did you really go playing around with women and conning them?

54
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,620
Did you do that?

55
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,530
No, Mom! It's true that I'm dating Se Ryun, but I never did anything like that!

56
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,990
Se Ryun and I are in love.

57
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,680
What?

58
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,960
You're in love?

59
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,670
How dare you say that with your dirty little mouth!

60
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,820
You bastard!

61
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,310
Oppa!

62
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,670
Don't get in there, Mom!

63
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,660
My son said it's not true!

64
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,850
Why do you keep calling him a dirtbag?

65
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,680
So shameless!

66
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,570
How can he be so shameless?

67
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,750
Oh, my gosh.... Oh, my gosh...

68
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,120
Chief Jo!

69
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,020
Call the police.

70
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,370
Yes, sir.

71
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,410
You can't, Chief Jo!

72
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,020
You can't call the cops.

73
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,650
Never! You can never do that!

74
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,010
Okay...

75
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,810
I'm truly sorry.

76
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,360
It's true that my wife and I were living there,

77
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,790
without telling you all this time.

78
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,480
We had nowhere to go,

79
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,990
and since I was going to quit soon so that we stayed, but it's been going on until now.

80
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:15,030
My mother-in-law, brother-in-law, and my niece,

81
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,780
were abroad for five years,

82
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:22,290
and they wanted to see me. I think that's why my wife called them in for a bit.

83
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,730
But this happened, unfortunately...

84
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,870
I'm truly sorry for not asking for permission.

85
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,710
But the relationship between my son and Ms. Se Ryun is really a misunderstanding.

86
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,460
I didn't find out until today.

87
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,330
Driver Park! Are you still denying it?

88
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,650
You plotted with your son to approach Se Ryun!

89
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,680
That's really not true!

90
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,630
I asked my son again,

91
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,990
but he said he didn't approach her intentionally!

92
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,290
What?! Relationship?

93
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:56,030
Why would someone like my Se Ryun meet a guy like your son? That's nonsense!

94
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,890
How dare you try to weasel your way out of this after plotting everything with your son?

95
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:04,070
Madam! I may be poor,

96
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:09,360
but I didn't raise my son not to have any values, and I didn't live that way either.

97
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,020
So please, don't think of us that way.

98
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,570
Wow... Your shamelessness is on another level. You're the worst!

99
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,630
I don't want to hear this anymore.

100
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,880
Just sign here.

101
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,590
Now get out of this house. Now!

102
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,490
Just as you signed here,

103
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:50,280
if you leak anything about what happened in this household and Se Ryun and disgrace us,

104
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,010
I'll send you and your son to prison together. Do you understand?

105
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,990
Now get out immediately! Immediately!

106
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,550
You better consider yourself to be super lucky.

107
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,610
If it weren't for my Se Ryun, you all would've gone behind bars!

108
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,960
Those dirtbags. Mrs. Yeoju!

109
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,460
- Mrs. Yeoju!
- Yes, Madam.

110
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,250
When those guys leave,

111
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,170
I want you to salt the entire house to ward off any bad luck, all right?

112
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,690
Yes, Madam.

113
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,390
I told you to call a taxi since it's raining.

114
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,450
It'll take 20 minutes to arrive then.

115
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:50,230
- 20 minutes?
- Yes.

116
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,300
I hate it. I don't want to stay another minute here.

117
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,960
Let's walk down and ride the bus even if we get wet, Mom.

118
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,500
Sure... What in the world happened?

119
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,900
Let me carry your bag, Grandma.

120
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,720
I can carry it by myself. Why don't you help your mom?

121
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,610
Give me your bag, Mom. I'll carry it.

122
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,670
Get away from me. Starting from today, you're no longer my son.

123
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,950
Don't be like that, Mom...

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Was this the jackpot you were talking about it?

125
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,330
No matter how poor you are.

126
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,320
I didn't expect you to rule the world,

127
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:25,740
but how can a man mooch off from a woman and con her for money?

128
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,840
I really want to die.

129
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,380
No! I told you that's not true! Se Ryun and I are in love.

130
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,880
- Why don't you trust me?
- Hush!

131
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,530
Grandma, you trust me, right?

132
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,390
You are my grandson, but it's a waste of your looks!

133
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:44,570
- Come on, quickly!
- Wait for me!

134
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,070
Nephew... I'm disappointed.

135
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,640
You can't call yourself a man.

136
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,680
Carry this, you little punk.

137
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,460
Mom!

138
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,890
How can you not trust me as well, Uncle? I would never do that!

139
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,640
It's really not true!

140
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,160
Is that Dan Dan?

141
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,280
My daughter, Dan Dan?

142
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:29,050
That's how Dan Dan has been living?

143
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,800
How could this be...?

144
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:39,400
Mom. What are you talking about it?

145
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,330
What are you trying to do at this night with dragging Chief Jo too?

146
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:47,030
What did you say? That my Dae Beom is a con man?

147
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,210
Yes. A con man! A player!

148
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,520
That punk approached you intentionally.

149
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,990
He knew you were Young Gook's little sister.

150
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,950
He was targeting the company's share!

151
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:03,730
Gosh... Mom. Did you really think that I'll break up with Dae Beom if you say this nonsense?

152
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,450
Take my mom and leave, please.

153
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:10,300
Do you even know who Dae Beom's dad is?

154
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,480
Who is it? Just who is it?

155
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,200
Driver Park!

156
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,160
Our family driver is that punk's dad, you fool!

157
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,210
- What?
- Aigoo...

158
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,600
Are you finally getting it now? You're so clueless.

159
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,570
That punk plotted with his dad,

160
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,790
and got with you intentionally.

161
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,710
He knew all about our family.

162
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,990
That doesn't make any sense...

163
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,570
Is that true? Really?

164
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,590
Yes... Everything she's saying is true.

165
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,640
Listen. Those family members

166
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,350
were all secretly living in our back house the whole time.

167
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:53,140
His mom, grandma, uncle, and his cousin too! Like cockroaches!

168
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:59,040
Do you think I'm the only one who saw that? Your brother, Chief Jo, and Mrs. Yeoju...

169
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:05,120
The more I think about it, the more it makes me speechless.

170
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,160
That can't be true...

171
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,680
It's true...

172
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,040
I was barely able to stop your brother from calling the cops.

173
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,290
What if we called the police and this had come out in newspapers,

174
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:21,250
and all sorts of rumors went around about you getting conned by a player?

175
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:25,480
You wouldn't be able to live in Korea anymore.

176
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,800
This can't be true...

177
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,900
Quickly pack your bags. We don't know what might happen to you if you're alone here.

178
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:36,330
- Just grab a couple of Se Ryun's clothes and underwear, Chief Jo.
- Yes, Madam.

179
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,910
It gives me goosebumps!

180
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,850
I never thought I'd live to see something like this.

181
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,610
Come on.

182
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:58,170
Se Ryun! Lee Se Ryun!

183
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,510
Se Ryun! Lee Se Ryun!

184
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,280
How dare you conning player come here?

185
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,200
You shameless punk! How dare you come here, you leech?

186
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,640
Do you still have more to suck out? Get lost before I call the cops!

187
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,250
Mom... Just a minute.

188
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,440
What are you thinking, Se Ryun?

189
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,530
Don't worry. I just need a minute.

190
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,680
Listen to me, Se Ryun. I'll explain everything.

191
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,910
- What happened is--
- Let me just ask you one thing.

192
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:35,590
Is Driver Park really your father?

193
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,510
Is that true?

194
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:43,150
Yes. He's my dad, but it's not what you think--

195
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,990
You bastard!

196
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,220
You also...

197
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,730
approached me for my money.

198
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,520
Don't appear in front of me ever again.

199
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,660
Se Ryun...

200
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,020
Are you crying?

201
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,930
Why are you crying for a punk like that? It's a waste of tears.

202
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,990
It's upsetting me...

203
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,370
Chief Jo.

204
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,660
Yes, Madam?

205
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,960
Nobody should hear about this. You know what I mean, right?

206
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,390
Yes, don't worry about it.

207
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,820
I know you'll take care of it well,

208
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,300
but you have to keep Mrs. Yeoju and Ms. Park's mouths tightly shut.

209
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,570
This should be kept in the house, understand?

210
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:11,030
Yes, Madam.

211
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:16,040
It's so upsetting!

212
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:26,710
Please watch your words so that nobody outside of this household hears about what happened today.

213
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,890
It's a special order from the Chairman and Madam.

214
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:36,360
Of course, don't worry. I'm so shocked that my heart is still racing.

215
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:43,530
How did all family live in the back house in secret? So shameless!

216
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:47,740
How can Driver Park plot with his son and have him approach Ms. Se Ryun?

217
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,250
Oh, it gives me goosebumps.

218
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:54,260
I didn't think Driver Park would be like that. But you really can't judge a book by its cover.

219
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,520
Driver Park? Don't call him like that. He's just a con man.

220
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:04,900
You're right! He's a con man. Just like Madam said, they're a family of con men.

221
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:10,550
Anyway, please watch your words.

222
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:22,230
You should be careful of who you date too. There are a lot of men who con women like Driver Park's son these days.

223
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:26,600
My gosh, I can't believe this happened.

224
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,240
- Mom! Mom!
- Yes?

225
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,830
Hey, try this. I just steamed it.

226
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:45,550
Now's not the time to eat sweet potatoes. Something big happened today!

227
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,840
Something big happened? What happened?

228
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,930
Guess what happened, Mom... Oh...

229
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:58,630
No, I can't tell you. If a rumor starts because I told you, I'll get fired.

230
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,480
Hey! Do you want to see me die of curiosity?

231
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,180
You got me all curious!

232
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:11,150
I won't tell anyone, so tell me.

233
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:15,700
- What happened was...
- Yes?

234
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:21,500
What? A player? Really?

235
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,520
Who? How? How much money did she lose?

236
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:30,110
But... that's not all.

237
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,020
What? There's more?

238
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,020
Oh, man...

239
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:38,790
That player was the driver's son.

240
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:44,440
Oh, my! Then did they plot it together?

241
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,760
- They sure were! But that's still not all of it!
- What?

242
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,600
There's more?

243
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,040
Apparently, where the driver lives,

244
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,660
they found all of his family members living there secretly!

245
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,880
His wife, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, and his niece too! All together!

246
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,980
Oh, my goodness! What a bunch of dirtbags!

247
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,900
Right? Isn't that crazy?

248
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,560
[Maeyang Park]

249
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:19,580
Your dad will be back soon... Wait, just a little bit...

250
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:26,250
You've gotten so pretty, Dan Dan! You could be an actress!

251
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,460
Isn't that right, Mother?

252
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,370
Dan Dan was always pretty.

253
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,650
Of course!

254
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,130
Mom.

255
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,660
How many times did I tell you that you can't stay in that house?

256
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:47,000
But how could you also drag Grandma, Uncle, and Mi Rim there? Are you out of your mind?

257
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,480
The people from that household called Dad a con man. A parasite!

258
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,760
Why should my dad be called a con man or parasite because of you?

259
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:02,040
Then do you want me to see your Grandma, Uncle, and my niece on the streets after five years of not seeing them?

260
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,890
Is it such a huge crime for us to see briefly in that house?

261
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,930
Did we steal something or what?

262
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:13,330
After everything that happened to us there, do you have to be so harsh to us too?

263
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:17,740
So are you telling me you did the right thing?

264
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:23,990
What's my dad to you, Mom? How could you not think of him even a little bit?

265
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:29,950
Don't you know what my dad went through because of you? I'm really sick of you being like this!

266
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:34,280
Dan Dan. How could you speak like that to your mom?

267
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:40,120
Did anyone say she did the right thing? Yes, she was wrong, but was it so terrible?

268
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,980
How can people be so cold-hearted?

269
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,300
I think it's those people who are strange, not us.

270
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:55,910
They looked down on us and treated us like con men just because they have some money.

271
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,750
Did the Chairman and Madam do that for no reason?

272
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:04,620
No matter how poor we grew up, how could Dae Beom do something so lowly?

273
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:09,290
I heard that he seduced a woman seven years older than himself and conned her!

274
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:15,180
That's why they did that. Why did my dad have to be labeled as a con man? Why!

275
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:21,330
Wait, hold on... How old? Was she seven years older than him? That crazy punk!

276
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,420
He's crazy...

277
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,540
Dae Beom probably had no other choice.

278
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:32,560
Mom. Dae Beom said that's not true. So, stop it!

279
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:39,090
Seriously... Why are you doing all this to my dad?

280
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,960
After losing the house that my dad worked all his life to buy five years ago,

281
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,600
you fled in the middle of the night. Now you show up five years later...

282
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:57,230
How could you all do this? Do you even feel bad at all towards my dad?

283
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,620
Hey, Park Dan Dan. No matter the situation,

284
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,710
how could you be so rude in front of your grandma?

285
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:08,220
Also, you keep saying, "my dad, my dad." Is my husband yours?

286
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,510
Noona. Mother.... Stop it.

287
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:16,280
Dan Dan is saying all this because she's upset.

288
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:24,050
If only we didn't eat Bibimbap in that house, this wouldn't have happened.

289
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,880
I'm sorry, Dan Dan. Please forgive us.

290
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,960
That's right, Aunt and Grandma. It's all our fault.

291
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,890
So don't be like that to Dan Dan Unni.

292
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:44,190
I'm sorry, Unni... We really didn't expect this to happen.

293
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,760
Hey...

294
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,720
Unni!

295
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,310
Oh, gosh. Son-in-law Park isn't like that,

296
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:58,450
but why does she have such a temper?

297
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,540
It's so upsetting...

298
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:09,530
Also, no matter how desperate Dae Beom was for money,

299
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:12,420
how could he seduce a girl seven years older--

300
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:18,030
Oh, come on! He said it's not true. Why do you keep talking about it?!

301
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:21,970
What's the world come to? The world is coming to an end.

302
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,760
Stop it, please.

303
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,000
- This is so embarrassing.
- I told you it's not true!

304
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,030
Dan Dan!

305
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,440
What are you doing, Dad?

306
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,720
What's all this?

307
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,240
When did you get here?

308
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,850
Your grandmother hasn't been back in five years.

309
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,700
So I got some Bossam and Jokbal.

310
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,510
I'm glad you came. Come on in, and let's eat together.

311
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,490
Are you stupid, Dad?

312
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,640
Did you forget what happened to you today because of those people?

313
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,400
You were labeled as a con man and called by all sorts of names...

314
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,740
And still, you want to do this?

315
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,330
Until when are you going to live like this?

316
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,410

What do you mean by "those people?"

We are all family.

That's right.

320
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,760
You love mom so much.

321
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,170
That's why you're doing this, right?

322
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:22,300
I almost forgot...

323
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,930
You do whatever you want, Dad.

324
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:30,410
I'm really not going to care anymore from now.

You must be shocked a lot because of us.

329
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:55,380
I was going to quit that job anyway.

330
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,400
Let's think of it that way.

331
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,340
I'm fine.

332
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:04,360
So don't worry about us, Dan Dan.

333
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,710
Don't stress and just focus on your job.

What will I say to them when I quit?

342
00:22:53,820 --> 00:23:01,080
You're going to keep your promise about staying by my side for a long time, right?

343
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,570
Of course. We pinky promised.

00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:11,540
I'll stay by your side for a long, long time, Se Jong.

Ms. Park is crying...

350
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:46,980
I think she's sad about something.

351
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:22,150
I'm sorry, Dan Dan.

352
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:28,380
I shouldn't have left you back then...

I have to take Dan Dan back now.

00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,350
I can't let her live like that.

Se Ryun! Lee Se Ryun!

358
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,270
- Se Ryun!
- What's wrong, Madam?

359
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,850
Did you see Se Ryun, Mrs. Yeoju?

360
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,400
Ms. Se Ryun?

361
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,790
I thought she was sleeping with you. I didn't see her.

362
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,400
What's going on?

363
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,430
What should we do? Se Ryun is disappeared.

364
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:30,640
Oh! Hold on. Hold on a second.

365
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,210
Hey! Lee Se Ryun! Where did you go?

366
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,660
You gave me a heart attack when I woke up to find you not there!

367
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,410
Oh, I'm on my way home.

368
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,550
I'm in a taxi.

369
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:48,390
- What? You're on your way home?
 - Yes.

370
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:52,460
I think it's better for me to go home and rest by myself.

371
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,540
Could you hand me the phone?

372
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:59,300
Se Ryun. You better get it together now.

373
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:03,370
You better not be seeing that ridiculous punk again.

374
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:07,660
Oppa... I'm hanging up.

375
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,680
Hello?

376
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,030
Hello!

377
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:16,210
What is it? Did you lose connection?

378
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,600
Young Gook... Don't worry too much.

379
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,380
She won't see him again unless she goes crazy.

380
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:30,210
You know she's not that thoughtless.

381
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:34,810
Really? Is that why she dated someone like him?

382
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:38,540
Tell her to just stay home quietly for a while.

383
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,900
Oh, my head...

384
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,620
This is driving me crazy.

385
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,870
Mrs. Yeoju, can you make me a glass of honey water?

386
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:49,440
Make it cold and put some ice in it.

387
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,630
Yes, Madam.

388
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,010
Where do I go and solve this anger?

389
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:59,980
Just thinking about how my precious daughter got played, even tearing him to pieces won't make me feel better!

390
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,740
Oh, my head.

391
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:07,750
Those punks... Should I put them behind bars now?

392
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,120
Oh gosh, my head...

393
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,880
Yes, maybe I'll do that...

394
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,790
Se Ryun!

395
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,700
Wait a minute, Se Ryun.

396
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,210
What is it? Do you have something to say to me?

397
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:25,330
I'll break up with you if you want to.

398
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:31,090
But regardless, I still want to clear up the misunderstanding.

399
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,070
"Misunderstanding?"

400
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,970
What misunderstanding?

401
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,130
You and I...

402
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,380
We met coincidentally at the club.

403
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,430
I didn't even know who you were, let alone which family you came from.

404
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,790
I just liked you.

405
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:46,530
Wasn't it the same for you too?

406
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:52,360
I really had no idea that my father was your family's driver.

407
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,910
I really didn't know.

408
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,250
Even until the very end...

409
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,560
Are you lying to me until the end?

410
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,050
It's not a lie, Se Ryun! Think about it.

411
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:06,120
Us, you and I...

412
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,500
Do you think I'm lying to you?

413
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:20,580
Guys like you, they're all the same.

414
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:24,020
Even if it's the bottom of your life,

415
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:28,780
it's not right to play around with someone's feelings!

416
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:34,880
You! Don't live like that, you piece of trash!

417
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,590
What..?

418
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,950
"Trash?"

419
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:42,960
Hold it right there, Lee Se Ryun!

420
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,220
Don't even call my name!

421
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,230
Hey!

422
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:03,120
What are you doing on the streets?

423
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,150
The stuff you bought me...

424
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:08,850
I thought these were a gift of love.

425
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,540
I don't need it anymore as well.

426
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,880
Hey, Lee Se Ryun.

427
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,500
I hope you have a happy life.

428
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,650
Hey! Hey!!

429
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:19,350
You bastard!

430
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:22,470
At least wear your shoes!

431
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:26,070
Wear your shoes!!

432
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:31,500
What do I do...

433
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:39,720
It's me, Eun Ji.

434
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,620
I have some stuff going on at home...

435
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:49,360
Could you maybe lend me some money? I'll pay you back within four months.

436
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:55,410
Right... I know you're struggling too...

437
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:58,740
Don't be sorry. I'm sorry.

438
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:02,160
Let's talk again soon.

439
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,660
Ms. Park seemed worried lately.

440
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,320
What should I do?

441
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,550
I guess it was all because of money.

442
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:21,970
Dad... I have something to tell you.

443
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:24,950
Is that so?

444
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:29,470
What is it you want to tell me?

445
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:34,400
What's making my little Se Jong so serious? Is something bothering you?

446
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,970
Tell me. I'll take care of whatever it is.

447
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:42,100
- Really?
- Of course.

448
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,980
Dad, last night...

449
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:50,870
Ms. Park cried a lot.

450
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,140
- Ms. Park did?
- Yes.

451
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:58,700
Dad, I'm so worried.

452
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,280
I'm worried Ms. Park will leave us.

453
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,620
What?

454
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,810
Dad, please help.

455
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:11,800
Please hold back Ms. Park, so she can't leave.

456
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,970
If Ms. Park says she's having a hard time because of us,

457
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:19,810
tell her we'll really, really be better kids from now on.

458
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:23,850
Please tell her nicely, Dad.

459
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:27,610
You'll do that for me, right, Dad?

460
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:33,220
Okay, I will. I'll talk to her.

461
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:37,970
Thank you, Dad. I trust you.

462
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:48,520
Ms. Park cried?

463
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,030
I wonder if she's going through something.

464
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,210
Ajumeoni, is Chief Jo in yet?

465
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,740
Not yet.

466
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,680
Chief Jo said she's going to stop by the bank, so she'll be a bit late today.

467
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,460
Can I help you?

468
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:08,390
No, it's okay. Please let her know I would like to speak to her when she comes.

469
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,620
Yes, sir.

470
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:18,430
By the way, has Ms. Park been having trouble because of the kids?

471
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,850
Ms. Park? Because of the kids?

472
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,740
Not at all.

473
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,940
Se Jong said Ms. Park looks like she's having a hard time.

474
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,190
I don't know if it's because of the kids,

475
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:32,870
but Ms. Park seems to be struggling because of money.

476
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,480
Money?

477
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,510
Yes. I learned about this accidentally.

478
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:41,100
Ms. Park's family seems to be struggling financially.

479
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,070
She called around to borrow some money.

480
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,290
Ah, I see.

481
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,310
Did you want to see me?

482
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:55,320
Ms. Park, is something bothering you?

483
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,520
Excuse me?

484
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,480
If you need help, please let me know without hesitation.

485
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,180
No, thank you. I'm fine.

486
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:08,090
Ms. Park, I heard you need money.

487
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:11,570
How much do you need?

488
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:14,070
Chairman...

489
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,620
Don't be surprised.

490
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:21,660
I'm saying I'll pay you in advance, not lend you however much money.

491
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,080
An advance payment?

492
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:29,650
It's an advance payment for taking care of my kids, so don't worry about it.

493
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:32,290
Chairman...

494
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:40,550
You have to be comfortable for Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong to be comfortable. Don't you think so?

495
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:43,080
Chairman...

496
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,800
Ms. Park, what were you doing in the Chairman's study?

497
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,370
It was...

498
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:04,970
Chief Jo, come to my study.

499
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,040
Yes?

500
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,750
Did you want to see me?

501
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:22,030
Chief Jo, add a three months advance payment to Ms. Park's bank account.

502
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:25,130
Advance payment for Ms. Park?

503
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,400
Yes.

504
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:32,990
But Chairman, it's only been a month since she started working here.

505
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:35,520
How could you allow three months of advance?

506
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,410
I'm going to work. Take care of that right now, please.

507
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:53,060
Did Ms. Park ask for an advance payment directly to the Chairman?

508
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,080
[Deposit: ₩ 9,000,000, Lee Young Gook]
[Balance: ₩ 11,299, 535]

509
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,280
He really gave me an advance payment.

510
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:07,060
Did you confirm the deposit?

511
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,840
I sent the advance payment.

512
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,840
Yes. I just did.

513
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:16,320
Sign this.

514
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,110
What is this?

515
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:21,360
It's a confirmation document stating that you got a three months advance payment.

516
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,350
My position requires me to make sure of this.

517
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:27,080
Ah, I see.

518
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,130
Ms. Park.

519
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,630
Yes?

520
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:43,650
I gave you an advance payment because the Chairman told me to,

521
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:48,880
but I'm very disappointed with your attitude.

522
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:51,470
Chief... What are you talking about it?

523
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,110
I told you before,

524
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:56,570
if you have a problem, tell me first.

525
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:00,050
I understand, there are difficult times, and you may need an advance payment.

526
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:04,170
But, how can you bring such minimal issues directly to the Chairman?

527
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:08,790
It's only been a month since you started working here.

528
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:11,400
I'm so sorry.

529
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,060
I thought highly of you...

530
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:20,030
I hope we don't have to have this kind of conversation again in the future.

531
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:35,890
You screamed as if you'd never see us again, but why are you here?

532
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,520
This.

533
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:43,390
What's this envelope?

534
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:47,090
What is that?

535
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:51,020
This is the best I can do for now.

536
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:58,520
These are checks!

537
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,970
How did you get so much money?

538
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,080
I got an advance payment.

539
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,020
Find a monthly rent or something. This will be enough for the deposit.

540
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,280
Oh, Dan Dan...

541
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:14,150
Thank you so much. I'm about to cry...

542
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:20,040
Ah, it was worth it for you to raise Dan Dan.

543
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,980
I'm giving it to you because I'm worried that my dad might suffer.

544
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,740
Also, you should earn money too.

545
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,890
Stop trying to live off of the money that my dad brings home.

546
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:32,430
You have more family members now.

547
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:36,170
I was going to do so without you telling me that.

548
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:39,180
I'm going to head out now.

549
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:45,470
Mom, you saw how she spoke to me, right?

550
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:48,820
I start liking her and then instantly lose all my love for her.

551
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:51,440
What? "Because I'm worried that my dad might suffer?"

552
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,810
Mom, she only cares about her dad.

553
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:58,420
This is so unfair, Mom!

554
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,490
It doesn't matter how she speaks to you.

555
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:02,400
She brought you all this money.

556
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,080
If she thought of you as a stranger, she wouldn't bring money like this.

557
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,800
Check how much is in there.

558
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,500
Okay.

559
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:15,040
Oh! One, two, three...

560
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,700
One million won checks...

561
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,350
Ten of them. It's ten million won.

562
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,960
Ten million won?

563
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,150
Did they give her that much in advance?

564
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:29,780
They are trusting Dan Dan at that house, isn't she?

565
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:32,780
Didn't you say she only started working there for a month?

566
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:37,770
Mom, if Soo Chul knows, he won't like it.

567
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:40,290
You don't need to tell him!

568
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:44,620
You raised her, so it's okay to let something like this slide.

569
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,920
Do you think so?

570
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:51,010
- Oh, my goodness!
- What's wrong?

571
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:54,160
It's him. Soo Chul! What should I do?

572
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,580
What do you mean by that?

573
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,480
You're such a scaredy-cat.

574
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,000
You wouldn't make a good thief.

575
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:09,740
Hi, honey, it's me.

576
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:13,680
- What? You got us a house?
- What?

577
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,460
- House.
- What?

578
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,250
Did he get a place?

579
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,920
- Oh, Honey!
- This is it!

580
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,290
Oh, you're here! Hello, mother-in-law.

581
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:25,590
You are really something!

582
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:29,380
How were you able to find a house so quickly?

583
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,630
How did this happen, honey?

584
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:34,420
How'd you find us a place and moved our stuff so quickly?

585
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,530
This area is going under redevelopment, so there's a lot of empty houses.

586
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:40,610
So I signed a contract right away and called the moving company for our stuff.

587
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,210
Why don't you go inside, mother-in-law?

588
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:44,640
The house may seem a little old,

589
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,530
but it'll serve us well!

590
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:50,900
- Oh, my! Look at that yard!
- Nice!

591
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,650
- The courtyard is so spacious!
- You're right!

592
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:01,750
Wow, now that we've decorated everything, it finally feels like a home.

593
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:09,930
The first house that Soo Chul and I moved into was an old house just like this.

594
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:14,240
Honey, sweetie. Doesn't this remind you of the old days?

595
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,830
I don't know how long we'll be able to stay here.

596
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:19,740
The contract states that we'll have to leave as soon as they start redeveloping this place.

597
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:22,300
We have to do our best to save up for a deposit in the meantime, okay?

598
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,860
All right. Let's do our best.

599
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:29,190
I'll work really hard and help you buy a house.

600
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:33,370
It's fine. You need to worry about yourself first.

601
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:37,220
What are you saying? I need to pay back my debt to you...

602
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,810
I'm going to look for a job too!

603
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,700
I'm going to look for one too.

604
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,820
Mom. Who'd be willing to hire you?

605
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:50,700
What's wrong with me? I'm still healthy and strong!

606
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:54,110
I, Geon, and Dae Beom will do our best to make money.

607
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:56,260
So mother-in-law, you just stay home.

608
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,900
Honey, you stay home and take care of your mother and the home.

609
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:02,360
Yes. Oh, right! Dan Dan--

610
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,770
Dan Dan? What about her?

611
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:11,280
Huh? Oh... Since Dan Dan doesn't know we moved...

612
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,220
I thought we should let her know.

613
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,640
We'll let her know.

614
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:20,590
Did you tell Mi Rim that we moved?

615
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:23,870
She left to look for a part-time job.

616
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:27,490
She didn't pick up her phone, so I left her a text.

617
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:34,230
Brother-in-law, I'm getting hungry. What do you think about having a pork belly barbecue party to celebrate our move?

618
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:39,000
Oh! I love that idea! I love it!

619
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:44,450
What? You found a house, and you already moved in?

620
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:46,980
Why didn't you tell me then?

621
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,280
Didn't you see the text I sent you?

622
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,970
Did you send me a text?

623
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,830
You did...

624
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:58,590
Where are you right now?

625
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,430
I'm in front of the motel that we stayed.

626
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:04,830
Oh, really? Brother-in-law is nearby, and I'll ask him to go pick you up.

627
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:06,840
Wait there.

628
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,370
Okay, Uncle.

629
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,760
You scared me!

630
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,270
I'm sorry I scared you. I just need a minute.

631
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:22,030
Who are you?

632
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:25,920
You look similar to who I'm looking for.

633
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,210
Are you 27 years old, by any chance?

634
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:30,430
What?

635
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:34,180
I'm not. I'm 26 years old.

636
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,910
26 years old?

637
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,960
Not 27 years old?

638
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,280
No, I'm not.

639
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,500
I'm 26 years old. I was born in 1996.

640
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,770
You were born in 1996?

641
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,350
Then, can I ask your name?

642
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:54,400
Why are you asking?

643
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,240
Why are you asking me something like this?

644
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,600
Mi Rim!

645
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,010
Uncle!

646
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,940
Mi Rim?

647
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:22,330
If she called Soo Chul Oppa "uncle," then it's not her... Her age is different too.

648
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:24,880
Then what about my Dan Dan?

649
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,320
Where's my Dan Dan?

650
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,110
What in the world happened to my Dan Dan?

651
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:36,500
Have as much as you want, mother-in-law!

652
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:40,350
Grandma! The house is so much nicer than I thought!

653
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:42,460
The neighborhood is quiet too.

654
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:47,230
This area is undergoing redevelopment, so a lot of the residents moved out.

655
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:52,090
- Hey, Mi Rim. Were you able to find a part-time job?
- Yes!

656
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:56,550
It's a cafe. They told me they'd give me an extra ₩1000 than the minimum wage, so I took the offer immediately!

657
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:00,810
Mi Rim is the best! She got a job before anyone else!

658
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:02,540
- Eat a lot!
- Okay!

659
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:06,590
By the way, what happened to Dae Beom?

660
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,710
Mom...

661
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:12,980
You're making me lose my appetite. Don't talk about Dae Beom in front of me from now on.

662
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:16,250
I no longer consider him my son.

663
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:19,340
Right, even if I were you, I can't forgive him.

664
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:23,220
- How can a man do something so degrading...
 - Mom!

665
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:26,080
Mom!

666
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:30,200
If Dae Beom says it's not true, then it's not! Why won't you believe him?

667
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,750
My Dae Beom isn't someone to do something like that!

668
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:35,710
Come on!

669
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:38,730
Anyway! Let's forget about everything that happened until yesterday.

670
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:41,570
Let's all off to a new start from now!

671
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:44,390
- Everyone, pick up your glasses in front of you!
- Yes!

672
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:48,790
Let's all cheers to a fresh start!

673
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:54,040
- Aunt...
- Come on, Noona! Let's do cheers for once.

674
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,120
Three, two, one!

675
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,690
Cheers!

676
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:01,170
Oh, it's good!

677
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:03,960
Look at her! I knew she'd like it the most.

678
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,450
- Let me pour you a glass, mother-in-law.
- Sure!

679
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:07,710
The meat is delicious!

680
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:12,130
- Pour it to the rim!
- What about me, honey?

681
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:18,110
Okay, okay. This one's for Dan Dan's mom. Say "ah."

682
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:23,510
- Where's my Dan Dan? Why is she the only one not there?
- One for Mi Rim too!

683
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:29,900
Did something happen to Dan Dan?

684
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:35,040
Her name is Park Dan Dan, and she was born on June 30th, 1995, right?

685
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,870
Is there anything else you know about her besides this?

686
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:41,740
No... I didn't register her birth myself.

687
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:45,470
So I don't know her resident registration number.

688
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:50,040
Since we have Park Soo Chul's registration number, it shouldn't be too difficult.

689
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,750
We'll do our best to find her.

690
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,360
Thank you.

691
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:59,380
Please help me find her. Please.

692
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:02,250
- You all saw Ms. Park crying yesterday, right?
- Yes.

693
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:06,650
I think she cried because of us.

694
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:09,830
So we have to make her feel better.

695
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:14,700
Each one of you should give me an idea of how we can make her feel better.

696
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,960
Noona! Let's buy Ms. Park a teddy bear.

697
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:24,050
Da Seul from my class immediately stops crying when we give her a doll.

698
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:28,060
Se Jong... Ms. Park isn't seven years old.

699
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:30,640
Okay! I thought of an idea!

700
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,100
What is it?

701
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,880
Co-ka!

702
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:38,360
- Co-ka..?
- Co-ka? What's that?

703
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,410
Coin karaoke!
 [T/N: It's a karaoke operated with coins.]

704
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:42,650
Karaoke is good for refreshing your mind...

705
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:46,260
Noona! Daebak! I thought of something even better.

706
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,860
Amusement Park! What about an amusement park?

707
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:51,910
Wow!

708
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:53,890
- Amusement park sounds good.
- Doesn't it?

709
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:55,120
Yes, it's good.

710
00:46:55,120 --> 00:47:00,770
Let's go! Let's go!

711
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:03,950
Let's go!

712
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:12,290
Lee Jenny, Lee Se Chan, Lee Se Jong. Where are you all going?

713
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:15,330
Daddy! We're going to ride the subway!

714
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:17,590
- Hey, Lee Se Jong!
- Lee Se Jong!

715
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:21,170
What? Subway?

716
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:25,750
Where are you going on the subway?

717
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:31,680
Se Jong. Are you not going to tell me where you're going?

718
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:36,300
It's a secret.

719
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:41,240
Tell me where you're going.

720
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:49,520
Lee Jenny. Are you really not going to tell me?

721
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,170
We're going to the amusement park.

722
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:57,380
What? Amusement park?

723
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:00,810
Just you guys?

724
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:03,540
Does Ms. Park and Chief Jo know about this too?

725
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:07,980
- Why didn't anyone report it to me then?
- Dad!

726
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,840
This is a surprise.

727
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,110
What?

728
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:18,070
Ms. Park has been a little down recently. So we planned this to make her feel better.

729
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:22,230
It'll cheer her up if we go and have a blast at the amusement park!

730
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:26,340
So we put our allowances together and prepared this to surprise her.

731
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:31,550
So don't tell Chief Jo or Ms. Park, okay, Dad?

732
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:33,990
Ms. Park is waiting for us.

733
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:36,740
- We'll see you later.
- Bye-bye!

734
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:39,420
Hold on!

735
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:42,030
What is it?

736
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:44,340
The amusement park is far from here.

737
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:47,050
I'll be your driver today.

738
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:48,250
Everyone, get in the car.

739
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:51,290
No, thanks. It's no fun if you're there.

740
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:54,030
You'll interfere in every little thing,

741
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:57,500
so we won't be able to have fun comfortably or eat whatever we want.

742
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,350
All right, all right.

743
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:01,370
I won't be a Kkondae today.

744
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:05,280
Let me just drive you there.

745
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:10,760
Se Jong is still too young.

746
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:14,830
It'll be hard for you guys to ride the subway.

747
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:27,470
Why did Jenny ask to meet me here?

748
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:32,070
Are the kids from last time bullying her again?

749
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:40,580
Ms. Park!

750
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:44,560
Ms. Park, get in the car.

751
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,820
Chairman, why did you come here?

752
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:53,560
Teacher! Get on!

753
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,840
Se Jong!

754
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,750
Yes! Come on!

755
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:00,410
Teacher. Just get in the car first.

756
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:08,540
Chairman. Where are we going?

757
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:13,520
I can't tell you.

758
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,700
What?

759
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,880
Jenny. Where are we going?

760
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,590
You'll know when we get there!

761
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,480
Se Jong!

762
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,360
Driver, hurry, hurry!

763
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,690
Yes, sir!

764
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:37,980
Let's go!

765
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,750
Let's go!

766
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:45,760
This is fun! Let's go!

767
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,699
Go, go, let's go!

768
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:56,570
I need to make Se Ryun marry someone before rumors spread about this incident!

769
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:58,740
Oh, this is not the time for me to be sitting around.

770
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:01,630
I need to step in.

771
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:03,250
Let's see...

772
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:05,560
Let's see, let's see...
[Mrs. Go]

773
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,820
Mrs. Go..?

774
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:11,550
Oh, no.

775
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:13,360
Mrs. Hong...

776
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,390
Mrs. Ma...

777
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:17,120
Oh, no!

778
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:20,660
These women would've been gossiping about the golf club incident,

779
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:25,920
talking bad behind my back!

780
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,030
Today? Of course, I have time.

781
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:32,820
I'll go visit you later.

782
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:35,000
You'll come here?

783
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,500
Ah, yes. Yes, I'll see you later.

784
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,560
Who were you talking to?

785
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,860
Hey, Gi Ja.

786
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:49,210
Mrs. Wang said she'll come over to my house for tea!

787
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:51,360
Mrs. Wang? All the way here?

788
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:56,430
Yes! I said I'd go over, but she insisted on coming here!

789
00:51:56,430 --> 00:52:02,130
My cleaning lady said she can't come for a while, but the house needs cleaning.

790
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:04,920
What should I bring out for her when she comes?

791
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,100
I'll make some old pumpkin soup.

792
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,000
I'll clean up the house, too!

793
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,660
Old pumpkin soup?

794
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:14,090
Are you really going to make that for me?

795
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:17,800
Oh, Gi Ja! I seriously can't live without you!

796
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,550
Please help us, then.

797
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:24,270
Help? What help?

798
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:29,480
Help me get closer to the Madam. Lay the bridge for us.

799
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,160
For Sarah and Chairman Lee Young Gook to get together,

800
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,460
it's better for me to be friends with the Madam!

801
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:37,740
Can you, Mi Sook?

802
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:39,530
Alright.

803
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:44,570
Since Sarah likes Chairman Lee so much, let's try our best.

804
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:46,050
I'll help you.

805
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:48,680
Mi Sook. Thank you.

806
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,650
Thank you so much.

807
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:52,100
Are you that happy?

808
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:56,910
Hey, if everything goes well, I'll never forget this debt.

809
00:52:56,910 --> 00:53:02,930
Well, although you guys do lack a lot compared to that family,

810
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:08,140
Sarah's a single who never got married, and she's pretty and talented.

811
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:09,410
It's worth trying.

812
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:12,180
Since he's a single father with three kids.

813
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:14,800
- Right?
- Yes!

814
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,730
It's not that impossible.

815
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:20,090
Thank you. Thank you, Mi Sook.

816
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:24,290
But you...you can't say anything about the story I told you

817
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:28,050
about that family's daughter, okay? Sarah will get fired!

818
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:32,520
Alright! Am I a child or something?

819
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:36,550
Now that Mi Sook's going to help,

820
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:40,550
I need to get closer to Madam

821
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:45,890
so that I can easily go in and out of that house

822
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:49,630
to see Se Jong whenever I want!

823
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:52,040
Pumpkin soup, please come out delicious.

824
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,520
Become delicious, be delicious!

825
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,100
Are you looking for your daughter's husband material?

826
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:02,370
Yes, Mrs. Jang. Please set up somebody for her.

827
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:07,590
I want my daughter to marry someone before this year passes! Before she gets a year older.

828
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:11,090
Ah...yes.

829
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:17,040
Wait. Won't the man's side of the family slap me for introducing a lady who got conned by a player?

830
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,200
If anything's ominous, avoiding is the best strategy.

831
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,780
Oh, how can I?

832
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:28,280
How could I dare try to set up a guy for the daughter of FT Group?

833
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,740
Why not?

834
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:34,220
Is it because I'm the mistress?

835
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:38,370
Is it because Se Ryun is a mistress's daughter?

836
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:42,200
Mrs. Jang, you knew all this, right?

837
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,550
Oh, no. It's not that!

838
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:47,360
Mrs. Wang, what are you saying?

839
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:52,490
Fine. I'll be honest with you today.

840
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:59,910
Mrs. Jang, I'm being honest because it's you.

841
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:08,930
My husband left behind a portion of the company's share for Se Ryun in his will,

842
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:13,660
but that share is only available if she marries.

843
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:19,220
When my daughter gets married, all the company shares we couldn't even see before

844
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:22,550
will be all hers on that day.

845
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:25,720
Is that true?

846
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,600
Yes.

847
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:34,430
I mean, I'm not doing this just to receive that share.

848
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:36,580
She's a bit late for marriage.

849
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:40,320
And thinking about her life, she does need to get married.

850
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:43,390
Oh, yes. It is rather late.

851
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:47,860
I've seen a lot of people who turned over 40 and became unable to marry.

852
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:51,650
Oh, Mrs. Jang.

853
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:53,430
As long as you get my daughter married,

854
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:59,230
I'll compensate you more than enough!

855
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:02,270
O-Okay, I understand it.

856
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:05,380
I'll try my best.

857
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:07,600
Thank you, Mrs. Jang!

858
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,000
Mi Sook, are you home?

859
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,790
That surprised me.

860
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:13,000
You had a guest.

861
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,520
- Hello.
- Ah, yes.

862
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:22,460
Mrs. Wang, you've met my friend before, haven't you? She's Chief Jo's mother.

863
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:25,640
Oh, yes. I think I have met her.

864
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,340
But how did you come from the balcony..?

865
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:30,830
It's a secret of my house,

866
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:34,110
but our balconies are connected. We're neighbors.

867
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:38,620
And since we're friends, we're quite casual with each other.

868
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:42,410
Oh, you two have such a fun life.

869
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:47,110
But...what is this?

870
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:50,230
What is this? It smells so sweet!

871
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:53,080
Oh, this... It's old pumpkin soup.

872
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:58,140
It's another level from regular sweet pumpkin soup.

873
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:00,500
Try it, please.

874
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:07,720
Oh, yes. It's old pumpkin soup.

875
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:11,880
It smells really nice.

876
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,140
Is it good?

877
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:23,510
Good! Oh, good.

878
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:38,390
But that Mrs. Wang... Why do I feel like I've seen her somewhere?

879
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:41,470
Where did I see her?

880
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:53,410
Wait, Chief Jo's mom, Mrs. Jang's friend... I feel like I saw her somewhere.

881
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:57,060
I definitely saw her somewhere.

882
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:59,810
This is an amusement park.

883
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:00,950
Why are we here?

884
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:03,460
You looked so down recently,

885
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:06,880
so we put together our allowance and prepared this as a surprise!

886
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,510
Amusement park!

887
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:15,930
Did you guys really prepare this for me with your allowance?

888
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:19,160
Yes!

889
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,020
Jenny...

890
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:24,950
Se Chan... Se Jong...

891
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:30,040
Teacher. You'll take our gift, right?

892
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:34,170
Teacher. Let's hurry up and head in!

893
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:38,860
Jenny, Se Chan, Se Jong, thank you so much.

894
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,250
Thank you very much.

895
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,650
Then, let's have fun!

896
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:44,730
Go, go!

897
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:46,860
Let's go!

898
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:50,940
Dad, thanks for driving us here. Have a safe drive back home. We'll head back on our own.

899
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:53,050
- Bye.
- Bye bye!

900
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:55,010
Bye!

901
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:57,390
Chairman, why don't you come with us?

902
00:58:57,390 --> 00:59:03,450
No, the children prepared this for you. They won't have fun if I join.

903
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:06,740
Why not? This is your chance to get closer to the kids.

904
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:12,960
Right? Since there are three kids, it'll be hard for you to manage them on your own as well.

905
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:16,650
Then...I should go with you all.

906
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:18,700
Jenny, Se Chan, Se Jong.

907
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:22,060
Since I came all the way here, I will pay for everything.

908
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:24,290
You're coming too, Dad?

909
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:26,840
Wow, that's exciting!

910
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:29,920
Se Jong. I'll buy you a lot of delicious food!

911
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,930
Okay! Let's go!

912
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:34,970
Let's go!

913
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,590
Why don't you put one on too, Dad?

914
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:46,810
I'm okay.

915
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:48,910
Just quickly put it on.

916
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:52,890
You can go home now if you're going to ruin the mood.

917
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:55,200
Just put it on, Chairman.

918
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:59,540
Everyone wears it here.

919
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:24,520
Your ears grew, Dad!

920
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,060
Dad's ears!

921
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:45,220
Awesome! That looks super fun!

922
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:47,710
Let's ride that quickly!

923
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:51,060
Two of you are going to ride this?

924
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:54,890
Se Chan and Se Jong are too young, so Ms. Park and I will go--

925
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:56,240
You can't.

926
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:01,360
What if you get into an accident or have a heart attack from riding something like this?

927
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:05,160
Don't you agree, Ms. Park?

928
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,530
There's a carousel over there!

929
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:09,470
Why don't we ride that?

930
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:12,040
I knew you were going to be like this, Dad.

931
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:18,180
We really don't get along. Seriously, if you're going to be like this, just go home.

932
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:25,750
They say if you come here and do not get on this ride, then you didn't come to the amusement park.

933
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:28,840
So, are you saying you're going to ride it?

934
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:32,520
Yes!

935
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:38,430
Fine. Then ride it with me.

936
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,630
- Jenny!
- Ms. Park, isn't it fun?

937
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:48,830
Yes, it's fun!

938
01:01:53,290 --> 01:02:00,140
♫ A smile blooms in every step ♫

939
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:04,810
♫ It's a shiny day because of you ♫

940
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:06,950
♫ it's sunshine day ♫

941
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:13,990
♫ Strangely, I'm drawn to you ♫

942
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:20,290
♫ Nobody will understand me. You're the only one that I was looking for ♫

943
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:24,140
Se Jong!

944
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:26,520
- Se Chan and Se Jong!
- Daddy!

945
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,620
- Daddy!
- Ms. Park!

946
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:31,590
What should we ride next?

947
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:33,830
There's got to be something more thrilling than this.

948
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:39,630
No, no... What about the Twister?

949
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:43,210
What's that one? That looks super exciting too!

950
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:47,360
Let's go ride that with me, Se Jong!

951
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:54,940
We came here to cheer you up, but my dad's the most excited.

952
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:58,490
Good thing that we brought him too.

953
01:02:58,490 --> 01:03:01,760
♫ You're mysterious like deep ocean ♫

954
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:05,080
