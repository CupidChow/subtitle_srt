1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,680
Ms. Park!
[Episode 11]

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,910
Hello? Is anyone there!

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,560
Where are you, Ms. Park!

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,980
Over here! I'm over here!

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,910
Over here! Here!

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,480
Ms. Park, where are you?

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,080
Over here! I am over here!

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,400
Ms. Park.

9
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,520
Chairman!

10
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,660
Ms. Park, it's okay now.

11
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,740
I'm here, so everything's fine now.

12
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,900
Chairman, there was a ghost over there!

13
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,150
There's a ghost!

14
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,690
A ghost?

15
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,600
Ms. Park, get yourself together.

16
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,640
It's not a ghost.

17
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,720
That's a balloon in the shape of a person.

18
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,050
What?

19
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,100
It was definitely a female ghost wearing a white gown!

20
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,300
You don't need to be so scared if it's a female ghost since you're both females.

21
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,150
I really thought it was a ghost!

22
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:44,630
Why would anyone tie that to a tree? It'll scare other people!

23
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:49,830
Well, it might have flown here by the wind.

24
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,900
But Ms. Park, why did you come all the way out here at night?

25
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,950
Do you know how dangerous here is?

26
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,790
There's not a single street light here. How can you fearlessly come here alone?

27
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,340
What if something had happened to you?

28
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,670
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,560
I thought I'd find my phone right away.

30
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,590
But this suddenly went out of battery,

31
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:16,280
and it was dark, so I got lost.

32
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,260
Anyway, I'm glad you're okay.

33
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,000
Let's go.

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,720
Wait!

35
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,200
I still need to find my phone.

36
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,590
Where is this phone ringing from?

37
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:44,610
Chairman, I think it's slightly to the left, not that way.

38
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,560
No it's--

39
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,560
Ms. Park. I said just stay right there.

40
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,480
What's the big deal if you can't find your phone tonight?

41
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,730
We can just find it tomorrow when it's bright.

42
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,230
Are you happy now?

43
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,630
I finally found it!

44
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,740
Did you want to find this that badly?

45
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,420
Yes!

46
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:28,100
You can't live without a phone these days.

47
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,300
If you lost your phone,

48
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,500
you would've come out and looked for it like me in dawn or night.

49
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,590
We found it, so let's go now.

50
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,830
Ms. Park, what's wrong?

51
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,010
Does it hurt a lot?

52
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,530
No, it's nothing.

53
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,790
I think I sprained it a little, but it's fine.

54
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,370
Let me see.

55
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,040
Your ankle is swollen.

56
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,850
I think you sprained it badly.

57
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,380
It's okay! I can still walk.

58
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,250
I think we don't have a choice.

59
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,630
Get on my back.

60
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,050
No! It's okay.

61
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,290
How can I get on your back, Chairman?

62
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,280
I'm really okay.

63
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,360
Just get on my back.

64
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,600
Are you going to spend all night here?

65
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,650
But I'm really okay...

66
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,460
We can walk faster this way.

67
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:06,310
And you might hurt really badly if you try to walk with your sprained ankle.

68
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:13,750
Hold onto my neck. If you stay stiff, it's harder for me.

69
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,810
Chairman. I'm really sorry.

70
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:39,250
If I knew this would happen, I would've gone out to look for my phone in the morning.

71
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,820
I didn't think things through.

72
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,210
Chairman, aren't I heavy?

73
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:51,880
I've gained some weight these days, so I was going to go on a diet.

74
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,410
But you know how delicious Mrs. Yeoju's food is.

75
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:58,630
So, it wasn't easy to go on a diet.

76
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,770
It's fine as long as you know you're heavy.

77
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,170
I'm sorry?

78
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,760
Please let me get off now, Chairman.

79
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,910
I was joking.

80
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:16,070
You're tiny, so you're light as a feather.

81
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,660
Are you sure?

82
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,970
Of course, that's why I can piggyback you.

83
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,180
Chairman! Look at the sky!

84
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,910
The sparkling stars look like they will splashdown.

85
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:44,850
You're right. We can see so many stars tonight.

86
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:50,400
This is the first time for me to see this many stars.

87
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,030
It's so amazing.

88
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,880
It's absolutely gorgeous.

89
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,720
Just to find that stupid cell phone!

90
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,160
Where did she go searching for it late at night,

91
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,320
making Chairman go out looking for her?

92
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,040
I really don't like Ms. Park.

93
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,830
Is she thinking or not?

94
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:23,270
Chairman, please let me get down now.

95
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,600
I will take you to the front over there since we are almost there.

96
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,240
If Se Jong sees me like this, he will make fun of me.

97
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,470
Okay, I get it. Be careful of your step.

98
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:48,730
Chairman, thank you very much, and I'm sorry.

99
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,260
Go on in.

100
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,220
What's going on?

101
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,970
Why did the Chairman carry Ms. Park on his back?

102
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,600
Chief Jo.

103
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,040
Chief Jo, you're back.

104
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,810
Yes, I was just about to go looking for you two.

105
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:16,250
You've taken a long time looking for the cell phone,

106
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,540
so I was getting worried about you.

107
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,220
Ms. Park was injured, so it took some time to come back.

108
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,710
Did you get injured a lot?

109
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,010
I just got hurt a little bit.

110
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,840
I'm sorry for making you worry.

111
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,310
You look like you got severely hurt. Please hold my hands.

112
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,780
- Thank you.
- Let's walk slowly.

113
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:10,120
Did Chief Jo see Chairman Lee carrying me on his back?

114
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,180
Did she really sprain her ankle?

115
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,150
Could she be lying?

116
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,540
I'm sorry. I had to secure the bandage.

117
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,070
Right. It's okay.

118
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,270
You must have sprained it really badly.

119
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,720
Anyway, I've done all the first aid.

120
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,390
Thank you, Chief Jo.

121
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:45,560
But how did you end up twisting your ankle like this?

122
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,440
I went out to find my phone,

123
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,500
but I lost my way into the woods.

124
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,930
On top of that, my flashlight went out, so it got completely dark.

125
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,970
And something like a wild animal passed by me.

126
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:04,610
So I got scared and started running, but fell.

127
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,540
You could've got into big trouble!

128
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,910
But if you sprained this much,

129
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:15,150
it must have been really hard for you to walk.

130
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,290
Well...

131
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:23,360
Actually, Chairman carried me on his back.

132
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,030
What?

133
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,600
Chairman Lee carried you on his back?

134
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:33,890
Yes. I really tried to walk even though it hurt.

135
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:37,580
But it just ended up that way.

136
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:45,170
Chief Jo, please don't tell this to anyone.

137
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:49,250
It's too embarrassing.

138
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,570
But Ms. Park, you could have asked, Mr. Kim.

139
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:03,610
Or you could've gone out to look for it tomorrow morning.

140
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,860
But what is all this fuss at night? How can you make Chairman go out to look for you?

141
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,310
Also, everyone here knows Chairman Lee.

142
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:16,040
What would they think if they saw you two?

143
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,230
I am sorry.

144
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,290
Get some rest.

145
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,650
Even if she was injured

146
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,840
and maybe young and naive,

147
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:58,950
but how dare she think of getting on the Chairman's back?

148
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,220
Is she stupid?

149
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:06,450
Idiot! How could she be so ignorant?

150
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:13,360
Maybe she's a vixen hiding her tails?

151
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,980
Sarah, is it going well?

152
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,050
Make sure to drink some wine and wear that lingerie!

153
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:27,270
Mom, seriously...

154
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,240
He said it was okay,

155
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,250
but I must have been heavy.

156
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,880
What if Chairman gets sick because of me?

157
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,280
We can walk faster this way.

158
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,950
And you might hurt really badly if you try to walk with your sprained ankle.

159
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:13,350
But why is my heart beating so fast?

160
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,370
Right, it can be beating fast

161
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:22,700
after something like today happened.

162
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,600
How can I face Chairman Lee now?

163
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,970
Park Dan Dan, you really are crazy!

164
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,400
Chairman Lee.

165
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,180
You weren't able to drink any wine together or even flirt with him.

166
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,550
Did you really go all the way there and do nothing?

167
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:41,220
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

168
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,800
When a beautiful woman like you is there,

169
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,140
how can he ignore you when you were together at the vacation house?

170
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,980
How can he be so insensible?

171
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,060
It's because the children were there.

172
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,080
How can you do something when the children are there?

173
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,250
In the past, when people used to live in a single room crowded with children,

174
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,360
they still had more babies.

175
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,100
Just because there are children, why can't you?

176
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,520
Mom!

177
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,980
If it weren't for Se Jong, I want to tell you to stop it right now.

178
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,670
I would try my best to stop you.

179
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,880
My goodness.

180
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,180
Sarah.

181
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,900
Maybe Chairman Lee already has a woman.

182
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,380
Mom, I have to go to work.

183
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,060
I really think he has a woman in secret.

184
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:35,280
Otherwise, it's impossible for him not to notice you when he sees you every day.

185
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,430
He should have already eaten you up a long time ago.

186
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:43,630
Mom, am I a chicken you raise at home? Eat me up?

187
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:47,910
Don't think what I'm saying is silly, and watch him closely.

188
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,110
Unless you want to be a dog who loses the chicken she was chasing.

189
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,120
Mom, please say something that makes sense.

190
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,800
If the Chairman has a woman, why would he hide her? It's not like his wife is alive.

191
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,370
Get out of my way. I'm late.

192
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,410
What is it then?

193
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,460
Is the ghost of his dead wife

194
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,040
keeping them apart?

195
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,670
Why is there no progress?

196
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:20,270
I'm going to be crazy because of my mom.

197
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:23,880
Does Chairman Lee really have a woman?

198
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,250
Chairman, please let me get down now.

199
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,810
I will take you to the front over there since we are almost there.

200
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,020
Could it be Ms. Park?

201
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:41,200
No, no. Not that young country bumpkin unless he's gone mad.

202
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,030
The Chairman doesn't have a woman.

203
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,640
I know him.

204
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,510
It's because he hasn't gotten over Young Ae unni yet.

205
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:55,090
Will he notice me when we pass the third anniversary of his wife's passing?

206
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:02,360
Se Jong, see you later.

207
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,400
Ms. Park, are you okay?

208
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
CEO Anna.

209
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,220
I heard you sprained your ankle. Why did you walk all the way here?

210
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,710
Have you seen the doctor?

211
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,660
No, not yet.

212
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,550
But it's gotten much better.

213
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,260
- If time passes, it will heal.
- No, you shouldn't do that!

214
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,680
If you leave it untreated, it can become a chronic condition.

215
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,820
Let me take you to the hospital now.

216
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,750
Are you alright?

217
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:41,450
I can go on my own.

218
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:46,370
Did you come here because of me?

219
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:50,380
Not, exactly.

220
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:55,620
I just heard about your injury from Mrs. Yeoju.

221
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:00,010
I am not busy this morning, so I can take you to the hospital.

222
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:04,050
And, I want to hear about Se Chan's birthday party at the vacation house.

223
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,580
So I thought we could do that over some morning coffee.

224
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,430
Let's go.

225
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,550
Okay.

226
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,630
Be careful.

227
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,910
- Good morning, CEO Anna.
- Yes, good morning, Chief Jo.

228
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,370
Be careful, careful, Ms. Park.

229
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,620
I'm really okay.

230
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:39,300
I'm glad you are here. Can you help Ms. Park into the house?

231
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,000
Pardon?

232
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,740
Ah, yes.

233
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,660
- Be careful.
- I'm really okay now.

234
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,190
Since I've had a shot and all.

235
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,860
It doesn't hurt to be careful. Listen to me.

236
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,610
These are your medicine.

237
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,270
Don't forget to take them at the right time.

238
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,120
Thank you.

239
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
Chief Jo, please take good care of her.

240
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,170
- Yes, have a good day.
- Thank you.

241
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,710
Have a nice day.

242
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:25,160
- Ms. Park, did you whine about being in pain to CEO Anna?
- No, I didn't.

243
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,290
You do not have a terminal disease.

244
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:31,350
- Why is CEO Anna overreacting like that?
- I'm sorry?

245
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,930
I have a lot to do, so I will go ahead of you. Take your time.

246
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,550
Yes.

247
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,830
Am I Ms. Park's underling or something?

248

It's one more thing after another.

The day we had this photo taken,

304
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,880
I lost my little brother.

305
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,710
What?

306
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:55,620
How did that happen?

307
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,190
Do you remember those fumigation trucks back in the days?

308
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,530
The truck that fumed out white fumigation smoke

309
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,870
and went around the town.

310
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,040
Of course, I know that.

311
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,210
Whenever those trucks appeared, all the children followed them.

312
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,940
Yes, that's right.

313
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,290
My mother asked me to look after my brother carefully.

314
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:22,580
But I got too excited about that fumigation truck that day.

315
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,070
I was following the truck,

316
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:29,040
and I lost my little brother in the middle of it.

317
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,580
Oh, no!

318
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:38,120
I can't believe I'm telling you this.

319
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:43,290
Are you saying you never found your brother after that?

320
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:47,720
But you can register DNA or something like that nowadays.

321
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,870
I heard lots of missing people find one another that way.

322
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:55,130
Of course, we've done that.

323
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:58,920
We were among the first to try that out.

Also, until the very end of her life,

325
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:07,950
my mother searched for my brother.

326
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:12,440
It's been a lifetime of grief for me as well,

327
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,140
so I tried everything I could until now.

328
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,320
But I don't know if something bad happened to him that day

329
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,780
or he was adopted overseas.

330
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,900
We haven't been able to find him.

331
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,830
Oh, my goodness. How terrible?

332
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,830
I'm sorry.

333
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:53,080
I'm sorry, too.

334
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:57,620
This is my stop. Excuse me.

335
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:00,390
Ahjussi, I'm getting off.

336
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,060
This isn't my phone.

337
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,350
Driver, one moment, please!

338
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:10,820
Excuse me! Excuse me!

339
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:15,690
I was in a hurry, so I didn't notice our phone got switched.

340
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,320
I'm sorry.

341
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,600
It's okay. Please give me my phone back.

342
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,660
Yes.

343
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,910
Excuse me.

344
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,850
Why are you keep following me?

345
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,330
I'm sorry?

346
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:13,260
Are you trying to hit on me?

347
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:17,110
No, I'm not. I'm heading in this direction too.

348
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:21,940
Did you switch our phones on purpose?

349
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,780
It was my mistake that our phones got switched.

350
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:32,150
I've admitted and apologized for it.

351
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,620
But this is not right. You don't own this road.

352
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,750
I have the freedom to walk on this road as well.

353
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:43,230
Is that so? I got it, then.

354
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,930
He is following me!

355
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,220
Is he a psycho?

356
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,630
What's wrong with him?

357
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:02,320
What is it? Does she think everybody's into her?

358
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,680
I can start immediately tomorrow, right?

359
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,320
Yes.

360
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,460
Thank you!

361
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:27,590
I don't need excuses! I'm asking where my package is!

362
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:30,590
The delivery man told me he left the package at the security office,

363
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:33,020
and he even got a signature!

364
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,010
Yes, it's right that he got the signature,

365
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:40,130
but no one took the package. So I don't know what's happening as well.

366
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:44,420
A package disappeared? What's she talking about?

367
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:48,560
Do you know what's in that package?

368
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,470
It's a 20 million won speaker that was hard to get!

369
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:55,740
A 20 million won speaker!

370
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,960
2-20 million won?

371
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:05,640
Ajussi. I'm asking you where my stuff went.

372
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,820
Why aren't you saying anything?

373
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,560
Where's my package?

374
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,330
I don't know if this is the one.

375
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:16,420
- I'm sorry.
- What the heck.

376
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,240
Did you give it to someone?

377
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,850
Or did you take it?

378
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,570
No! It's really not me!

379
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:31,730
Then why only my package is missing!

380
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,910
Did it walk out on its own!

381
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,200
Please...

382
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:40,640
Excuse me.

383
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:48,430
Didn't you take a package from here this morning?

384
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:51,670
What? Me?

385
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:55,890
Yes, this morning, you bumped into me while leaving this place with a package.

386
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:58,760
I clearly saw you.

387
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:07,880
What's this woman saying? Then are you saying I took my stuff,

388
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,310
and I'm lying right now?

389
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:13,070
Is that what you're saying?

390
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,930
There's a surveillance camera here, isn't there?

391
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,360
Yes, there is.

392
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,510
Then why don't you check the surveillance camera first instead of arguing about it?

393
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:26,240
We'll know when we see the recording.

394
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,590
Yes. I'll check it right now.

395
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,980
Let's go.

396
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,080
Oh! Wait!

397
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:38,470
I think I took it this morning.

398
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:41,500
Yes, I remembered it now.

399
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,400
Yes, that's right.

400
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,220
How did I get confused about this?

401
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,060
I'm sorry.

402
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,690
I'm so sorry.

403
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,370
I'm sorry.

404
00:32:55,370 --> 00:33:00,730
I came here this morning and took it with me...

405
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:03,380
What kind of person is that?

406
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,340
Thank you.

407
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:10,580
It's my first day at work, so my clumsiness caused this to happen.

408
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,420
I'm sorry.

409
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,650
It's okay. Have a nice day.

410
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:17,330
Yes, have a nice day!

411
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:25,600
Mr. Park Soo Chul, from now on, even if you need to leave for just a moment, lock the door.

412
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,950
And make sure you record everything.

413
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,910
You were really lucky today.

414
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:35,820
I'll keep that in mind. I'm sorry.

415
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:46,180
Why is he living like that? He makes me worry.

416
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,580
Who is it?

417
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:58,880
CEO Kim. It's me, Driver Park.

418
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,390
Why did he come here?

419
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,880
Driver Park.

420
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,030
Thank you so much.

421
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:18,810
If it hadn't been for you, CEO Kim, I'd have been in big trouble.

422
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:21,670
No, it's alright. You don't have to do this.

423
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,820
Please, take this.

424
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,460
Anyone would have stepped forward in that situation.

425
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,340
No, CEO Kim!

426
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:34,960
You've helped my Dan Dan recently too. I'm very grateful to you in many ways.

427
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,640
If you have something bothering you or need my help,

428
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,650
please don't hesitate to call me anytime!

429
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:43,450
Okay.

430
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:46,550
Then, I'll get going.

431
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:11,370
Okay, let's eat!

432
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:16,910
Oppa. I don't have hands.

433
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,560
What?

434
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,730
It's delicious.

435
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:33,380
I said I don't have hands.

436
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:08,040
I can't keep seeing him.

437
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:25,440
Is this realty manager Kim?

438
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,210
Yes, it's me.

439
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:34,410
It's a bit uncomfortable staying in this office, so can you find an apartment for me?

440
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,220
Did you have your lunch?

441
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,930
Yes, sir.

442
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:54,070
Chairman Lee!

443
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:56,580
There was a ghost over there!

444
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,160
There's a ghost!

445
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,550
Chairman Lee.

446
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:10,660
Did something good happen recently?

447
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,220
Ah, no.

448
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:53,630
This is something I haven't seen.

449
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:04,820
This isn't just a regular handkerchief.

450
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:08,220
Somebody did embroidery on it!

451
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:16,130
There's a card in here too. Who is it from?

452
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,600
Welcome home, Chairman!

453
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,240
Yes. Was everything okay today?

454
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,460
Welcome home, Chairman.

455
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,080
Yes. Why are you in this room?

456
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,300
I was placing some flowers!

457
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:40,560
We changed out the curtain today, too.

458
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,690
Is that so? Thank you.

459
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:53,450
That handkerchief. It's definitely a woman's gift.

460
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:58,240
It's even hand embroidered! Who gave that?

461
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:04,020
Maybe Chairman does have a woman, as my mom said, but I just didn't know about it?

462
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:16,360
Did Chief Jo prepare this?

463
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:30,280
Chairman, thank you so much for yesterday.

464
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,990
Thanks to you, I found my phone,

465
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:35,850
and I got to see so many shining stars.

466
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:38,870
And I'm sorry.

467
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:41,350
You suffered under my weight, didn't you?

468
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:46,020
So I prepared this to send you my gratitude.

469
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:50,850
It's nothing much, but please take it as my heartfelt gift.

470
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,060
[L.Y.K.]

471
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:12,040
I heard from my husband that your daughter is 36 years old.

472
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:17,310
How dare she chase after our son, who's in his twenties?

473
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:20,900
My goodness! My grandson is still a baby.

474
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:25,530
How can she try to get my baby grandson? She's a total thief!

475
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:31,910
Those ignorant fools. A thief? How dare they say that to her!

476
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:38,160
That foolish idiot. Are there no men out there? How can she risk her life for such a guy?

477
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,180
I'm scared of someone knowing about this.

478
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:46,610
Mom. My stomach hurts. Open the door.

479
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,190
My goodness, she's acting up again!

480
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:53,020
Be quiet! There's a bathroom in there. Use that!

481
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:57,330
It's not that kind of stomachache!

482
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:03,850
Mom. Something's weird. Is my appendix going to burst?

483
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:08,960
What appendix? Do you think I'll fall for that kind of lie?

484
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,910
Mom, I'm being honest! It hurts so much!

485
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:16,890
It really hurts!

486
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:20,460
Lee Se Ryun. Stop putting on a show.

487
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:26,420
Do you think I'll let you date that guy? Snap out of it!

488
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:36,380
Hey, Lee Se Ryun. Why aren't you answering? Did you understand?

489
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:42,590
Se Ryun.

490
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,200
Lee Se Ryun.

491
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:52,870
What? Is she really sick?

492
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:56,170
A ruptured appendix is a real medical emergency.

493
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:04,970
Hey, are you really sick? Lee Se Ryun, why aren't you answering?

494
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:08,210
Wait, did she collapse?

495
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:13,610
Oh, Se Ryun? Se Ryun?

496
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:15,340
- Oh, my goodness!
- I'm sorry, Mom!

497
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:18,760
Hey! Hey, Lee Se Ryun! Stop right there!

498
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,970
Hey, Lee Se Ryun! Hey!

499
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:24,400
Stop right there!

500
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:36,820
Oh, my. Why are you here?

501
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:43,120
Hello, Mother! I'm really sorry about causing a scene drunk last time.

502
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:48,260
Listen, young lady. How can you come back here? Do you think you're welcome?

503
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:51,890
Dae Beom wasn't picking up his phone.

504
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:54,320
Is he inside?

505
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,470
Young lady. Do you think Dae Beom's crazy enough to pick up your calls?

506
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:03,410
Our Dae Beom said he doesn't like you, so why do you keep clinging on him? Why?!

507
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:07,040
Do you find Dae Beom so easy? Are we pushovers to you?

508
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:12,310
It's not like that! What happened last time at my house

509
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:18,610
was something that my family misunderstood. I'll apologize to you again!

510
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:23,800
Now, even my mom resolved her misunderstanding!

511
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:30,650
So if Dae Beom's at home, please call him out for me. Will you?

512
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:34,690
- Dae Beom!
- Dae Beom's not home!

513
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:40,590
Since Dae Beom said he's not going to see you, don't ever call, and don't ever appear here again.

514
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:42,210
Mother...

515
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:48,000
Why do you keep calling me your mother? Don't call me your mother. I'm starting to have goosebumps.

516
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,550
You're Dae Beom's mother, so...

517
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:55,200
Do you know what that stuck-up Madam, your mother, did to us?

518
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:00,540
She called us parasites. Parasites!

519
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,150
What?

520
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:06,680
We're not bugs, but we're human. How can you call people parasites?

521
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:11,050
Please let me apologize on her behalf. I'm so sorry!

522
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:15,220
She called us dirtbags, scammers!

523
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:19,320
Anyway, I can't forget what she said until I die.

524
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,960
So how can we become family with yours? Please leave.

525
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,810
- Please, Mother...
- Can't you hear me? Get out!

526
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:28,120
Stop it, Honey.

527
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,870
Honey.

528
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:35,090
Mr. Park.

529
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:39,470
Ms. Se Ryun. Can we talk for a minute?

530
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:43,120
Honey--

531
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:54,390
Ms. Se Ryun, I really think this is not right.

532
00:44:54,390 --> 00:45:00,070
As you know, we're very different in both family wealth and circumstances.

533
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:03,810
Even if Dae Beom says he wants to date you again, I'm against it.

534
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:06,600
The Chairman won't allow it as well.

535
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:15,120
Ms. Se Ryun. Please sort your mind out for everyone, and don't come here again.

536
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,300
Also, please don't call our Dae Beom again.

537
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,330
I'm begging you.

538
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:23,830
What's taking you so long?

539
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:30,960
Excuse me, old miss. Don't think of playing around with our Dae Beom again. I won't stand for it.

540
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,610
Let's go inside, Honey.

541
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:07,150
You're really crazy! You really went insane!

542
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:10,730
You need to go see a psychiatrist! You're crazy!

543
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:13,720
- Mom!
- Let's go, come on!

544
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,160
I'm not leaving!

545
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,430
Oh, you brat, seriously? We're going!

546
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:22,040
- Come on!
- Wait, Mom! Let go of my hair!

547
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:27,530
Be quiet! Because of you, I'm deeply upset.

548
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:32,250
- It's so upsetting!
- Let go of my hair! It hurts!

549
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:36,100
Dae Beom...

550
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:42,790
I'm going to go mad. This is driving me crazy.

551
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:04,390
Oh, Mrs. Jang? Where are you?

552
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:09,840
Can you see me for a second? I'll head over to you right now.

553
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:18,990
Mrs. Wang, I heard you graduated from the same middle school as my friend Gi Ja!

554
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:20,830
I only heard about it recently!

555
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:25,560
Right. But about finding a man for Se Ryun's arranged marriage.

556
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:30,350
How is it coming along? Has there been any good news?

557
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:36,810
There have been a couple of families, but...

558
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:41,530
I think they won't fit your standards, Mrs. Wang. That's why I wasn't able to contact you.

559
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:46,280
You thought they wouldn't fit my standards? What kind of household were they?

560
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:52,240
I'm not that picky! I wish it were just a decent family.

561
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:58,910
Then, Mrs. Wang, what do you think about a hospital director's son?

562
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:02,370
Hospital director's son? That sounds wonderful!

563
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:05,170
It's called Sarang Hospital. It's their son.

564
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:08,620
Oh! Did you say Sarang Hospital just now?

565
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:12,500
You should have contacted me earlier!

566
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,760
But their family's hospital is going through some financial difficulties.

567
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,490
So they were looking to seek help from their in-laws if they got married.

568
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:20,920
Everything was good, but that worried me.

569
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,240
What kind of worry is that?

570
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:28,150
Let me see. I heard their son did MBA in the States.

571
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:33,810
As long as the person's good, I'm fine! Tell them not to worry about the hospital.

572
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:38,020
I told you our Se Ryun has some shares!

573
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:43,630
As long as they marry, everything will be solved!

574
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,920
Are you sure you'll be okay?

575
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,890
Of course, I'm sure!

576
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:53,450
Mrs. Jang, let's arrange the meeting. Let's do it immediately! What about tomorrow?

577
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:55,890
Yes, I'll do it.

578
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:59,660
Is this a photo from your childhood?

579
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:04,560
Yes. It's a photo of my brother and me.

580
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,240
It's the only photo of us left in this world.

581
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:13,270
It looked similar to son-in-law Park's childhood photo.

582
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:20,790
It bothers me so much! I need to check it out for myself.

583
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:25,270
Where did she put the photo album?

584
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:34,530
Where did she hide the photo album?

585
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:36,640
Here it is.

586
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,700
Let's see.

587
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:48,170
It's not this one. Not this one as well.

588
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,710
Yes!

589
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:54,420
This is the photo I was looking for!

590
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:58,040
This is the photo. This is it!

591
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,400
How can this happen?

592
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,970
I wondered about it.

593
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:06,740
Oh, my, it's the same. How can it be so same?

594
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:10,000
Mom, what are you doing?

595
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,450
Mom, why are you doing this?

596
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:15,980
Why are you suddenly curious about Soo Chul's birth?

597
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:20,420
Listen. If things work out,

598
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:25,150
son-in-law Park might find his older sister.

599
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:26,450
What?

600
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:31,450
What are you talking about it? Soo Chul might find his older sister?

601
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:33,670
Mom. Have you gone senile?

602
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:36,250
What's going on with you?

603
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:40,690
The Madam of the house that I work in

604
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:43,710
has a little brother she lost when she was young.

605
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:45,540
A house that you work in?

606
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,220
Have you been working all this time?

607
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,020
Didn't you say you were going to the seniors' center?

608
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:51,430
That's not important right now!

609
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:52,980
You startled me.

610
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:58,350
That Madam lost her little brother as a child.

611
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:00,950
And the photo of her younger brother

612
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:06,150
and your husband's photo is exactly the same.

613
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:08,620
What? What are you saying?

614
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:13,640
I'm saying this exact photo of this one

615
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:17,260
was sitting on top of the Madam's bureau.

616
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:23,840
And she told me it was a photo of her little brother that she lost when they were young.

617
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,170
Mom, I'm shaking.

618
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:29,860
What do we do? Where is that place, Mom?

619
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:31,910
I need to check with my own eyes.

620
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:34,480
You could have mistaken.

621
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,830
Let's take this photo and verify it.

622
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:41,330
Sure. The Madam's probably not at the house right now. Let's go.

623
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:44,190
Madam, are you home?

624
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:48,950
Is no one home?

625
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,250
Are you home, Doctor?

626
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:57,540
Yeon Sil. No one's home. Come on in.

627
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:08,380
Mom, where are the photos?

628
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:12,430
Look, here. The photo is right here.

629
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:17,010
Oh, my goodness! Wait.

630
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:19,430
I'm getting the chills.

631
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:21,690
They are the same. He's wearing the same clothes.

632
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:23,550
- Yes, that's right!
- What's going on?

633
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:26,370
It's exactly the same!

634
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,450
- Look at this.
- What did I tell you?

635
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:34,970
They say the darkest place is under the candlestick. How can't they find each other when they're not that far away?

636
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:40,020
Call your husband right now and tell him we found his sister.

637
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:46,390
The Madam said she did everything to find her little brother.

638
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:49,610
If they meet each other like this,

639
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:53,060
then how happy would they be?

640
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:57,440
But Mom, what if we are wrong?

641
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:02,720
What? Well, then what should we do?

642
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,700
- DNA test!
- Yes, the DNA test!

643
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:09,880
- Right. They can do that.
- Yes, the DNA test.

644
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,540
Look at them.

645
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:18,280
Here, it's your favorite kiwi juice. Drink it.

646
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:24,750
How long are you going to be like this?

647
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:37,620
Se Ryun.

648
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:43,590
You know what my life has been, all these years.

649
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:48,200
You know it better than anyone in this world.

650
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:54,220
I have a wish. Please hear me.

651
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:59,900
There's a good marriage opportunity that came in for you.

652
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:05,120
If you meet him and like him, can you marry him, please?

653
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:09,340
This is my last wish.

654
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:12,060
I can't do that.

655
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:15,310
Se Ryun...

656
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,230
Padak! Padak!

657
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:28,400
Padak, Padak, Chicken skewers! Padak, Padak!

658
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,540
If you come to Hot Young Men!

659
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,610
We will grill it deliciously for you!

660
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:35,750
Welcome! Padak, Padak!

661
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:39,090
Padak, Padak, Chicken skewers! Padak, Padak!

662
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:42,690
Welcome to Hot Young Men. Thank you very much. What flavors would you like?

663
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:43,930
Sweet flavor for me.

664
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:45,640
Padak, Padak! Spicy one for me, please.

665
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,230
Yes. One sweet and one spicy. We will make them deliciously!

666
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:50,520
- Please wait a moment.
- Fire is coming in!

667
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,200
Please be careful.

668
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,100
What is it?

669
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:07,670
One moment, it will be ready in no time.

670
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:17,260
Why are you here? This is my workplace.

671
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:20,210
I had to say this to you for the last time.

672
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:24,830
For the last time, I want to ask you something.

673
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:31,840
My mom asked to meet someone for an arranged marriage.

674
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:35,740
Did you come here to tell me that?

675
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:38,120
Even now, if you want to,

676
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:41,930
I won't meet that person and move abroad with you.

677
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:46,720
Lee Se Ryun. I'm selling chicken skewers for 3,000 won each right now.

678
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:51,330
I could never buy the kind of apartment you live in, no matter how hard I try.

679
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:56,580
You and I live in different places. We are different kinds of people.

680
00:56:56,580 --> 00:57:00,790
You don't have to sell 3,000 won chicken skewers.

681
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:05,080
I will support your living.

682
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:08,940
So let's move abroad with me, will you?

683
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:20,850
Do you think I'm crazy? Why would I go with an ajumma who's seven years older than me?

684
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:25,560
What?

685
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:28,810
I played with you because you looked rich.

686
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:35,120
I had fun, so let's keep it as a happy memory.

687
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:40,160
I get it.

688
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:47,660
I will never appear in front of you anymore.

689
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,930
You're a bastard.

690
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:10,040
Welcome! Hot Young Men will grill it deliciously for you!

691
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,720
Padak, Padak!

692
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:14,870
Padak, Padak, Chicken skewers!

693
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:19,050
- If you come to the Hot Young Men!
- We'll grill it deliciously for you!

694
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:20,760
Welcome!

695
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,000
Padak, Padak!

696
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,930
Padak, Padak, Chicken skewers! Padak, Padak!

697
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:32,030
Let's say, Hot--!

698
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:37,800
Hey, cry or grill, just pick one.

699
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:41,610
Okay, Padak, Padak--!

700
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:03,170
Yes, hello?

701
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:07,120
Is it Secretary's Office? Hello, Secretary Yoon.

702
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,030
Why did you call me today?

703
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:12,670
Did Chairman say so?

704
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:22,810
Welcome home, Chairman.

705
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:25,980
Yes. Was everything okay today?

706
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:49,070
Did Chairman take the handkerchief that was in here?

707
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:53,460
[Chairman, thank you so much for yesterday.
Thanks to you, I found my phone, and I got to see so many shining stars.]

708
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:55,790
[And I'm sorry. You suffered under my weight, didn't you? So I prepared this to send you my gratitude. It's nothing much, but please take it as my heartfelt gift.]

709
00:59:55,790 --> 01:00:01,210
This was from Ms. Park?

710
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:03,160
What the hell is she?

711
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:07,290
Was she been flirting with Chairman like this the whole time?

712
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:09,960
Ms. Park. I heard from the Secretary's office.

713
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,870
Don't worry about the children and go.

714
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:14,170
Yes. Thank you.

715
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:18,230
But Ajumonie, what do you think is the reason why he's calling me?

716
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:21,440
I don't know. You will find out.

717
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,520
Excuse me.

718
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:28,980
Ms. Park, can I talk with you?

719
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:34,270
Chief Jo, if it's not urgent, can I talk with you tomorrow?

720
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:38,250
I will be late if I don't go out right now.

721
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,050
Where are you going?

722
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:42,020
Chairman asked me to come.

723
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:44,000
Did Chairman call you out?

724
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,590
Ms. Park. Hurry, you will be late.

725
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:49,240
Yes. I will be back.

726
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:05,410
He's over there.

727
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:18,740
Please, have a seat.

728
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:20,640
Yes.

729
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:31,350
Don't be too nervous. I just called you to have dinner together.

730
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:34,260
Okay.

731
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:40,630
When you asked to see me outside, I thought you wanted to scold me where there were no children.

732
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:43,280
Why would I scold you?

733
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:51,060
The children are doing well, thanks to you. Se Chan even received an award for the first time in a while, thanks to you.

734
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:54,370
I haven't done anything special.

735
01:01:54,370 --> 01:02:01,360
Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong are so well behaved, so I am the grateful one.

736
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:06,880
Please accept this.

737
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,380
It's a bonus.

738
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:10,570
A bonus?

739
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:14,370
You say you didn't do anything special, but that's not true.

740
01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:20,230
You've done great work since you came to our house.

741
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:25,790
Actually, this is the first time I've felt this peace in my mind since my wife passed.

742
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:33,530
I'm glad that my children are doing great without any problem. I'm grateful to you.

743
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:35,580
Chairman.

744
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:40,710
This is a bonus for your great work, so please feel free to accept it.

745
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:42,170
Thank you.

746
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:46,030
I will work my best in the future as well.

747
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:11,360
Why don't we toast to that?

748
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,120
Yes.

749
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:18,910
I have to drive, so I will just do the cheers.

750
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:21,160
Yes, Chairman.

751
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:30,400
Would you like to order?

752
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,030
I'm sorry. My date got canceled at the last moment.

753
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:35,550
I'll be back next time.

754
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:44,620
Sure, he gave me a bonus too.

755
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:48,380
It's true that Ms. Park took great care of the kids.

756
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:52,900
That's right. He's buying her a meal to encourage her.

757
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,410
It was so delicious, Chairman.

758
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:55,860
Thank you for the food.

759
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:57,620
- Did you eat enough?
- Yes.

760
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:00,490
Chairman, I will get the second round.

761
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:02,940
Since I just got some money.

762
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,420
Look at how that wench is acting.

763
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:06,090
What are you going to get for me?

764
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:08,100
You will see when we get there.

765
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:12,050
I used to work at a cafe near here.

766
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:15,750
They have a debak delicious drink.

767
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:19,320
Okay, let's go for the second round.

768
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,470
Chairman, come this way, please.

769
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:28,370
Chairman, since you bought me delicious food, so let me get the tea for you.

770
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:31,790
Let's have tea some other time.

771
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:38,080
That time, we parted after the meal, but they are going for the second round?

772
01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:46,520
Seriously...

773
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:54,220
Like what you said, this is daebak delicious.

774
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:57,020
Right? It's daebak, isn't it?

775
01:04:58,870 --> 01:05:02,440
Don't drink it too fast. You will get a stomachache.

776
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:07,190
It's been a while since I had this, so I'm really enjoying it.

777
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:16,570
The strawberry latte was good, wasn't it?

778
01:05:16,570 --> 01:05:19,740
- Yes, it was good.
- Right?

779
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:23,710
It's whack-a-mole! Do you know what that is?

780
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:27,110
Is there anyone who doesn't know that? I'm not that old.

781
01:05:27,110 --> 01:05:30,540
I thought you'd never played something like this.

782
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:33,470
Who do you think I am? Let's play it.

783
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:35,300
I'll pay this round.

784
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,850
Yes, sounds good.

785
01:05:44,990 --> 01:05:48,690
Ms. Park, since we're doing it, let's hit it well.

786
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:50,620
Yes.

787
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:09,090
Chairman, why are you so bad at it?

788
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:13,500
It's not as easy as I thought.

789
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:17,340
Actually, this is my second time playing this game.

790
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:19,760
Is it your second time?

791
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:25,350
I was on leave from military service and met a runaway kid and played it with her.

792
01:06:25,350 --> 01:06:29,390
I'm sure I played better back then.

793
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:35,410
If you were in the military, how many years ago was that?

794
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:39,390
I played whack-a-mole with a soldier once.

795
01:06:39,390 --> 01:06:41,530
It was when I was young.

796
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:45,450
At that time, I had run away from home for a few hours.

797
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:50,860
But a soldier ajussi said he would take me home.

798
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:53,970
But I really didn't want to go home.

799
01:06:53,970 --> 01:06:56,830
So I lied that I didn't remember the way home

800
01:06:56,830 --> 01:07:00,400
and rode his bike around many times.

801
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:05,530
I am sure that ajussi had very sore legs that day.

802
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:16,300
- Are you--!
- Are you--!

803
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:17,940
Are you the runaway girl?

804
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:20,600
Are you the military ajussi?

805
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,730
No way.

806
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:27,250
- Heukseok-dong!
- Heukseok-dong!

807
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:30,430
This is unbelievable.

808
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:34,010
Are you saying that solider was you?

809
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:39,530
What? Then, that runaway girl grew up this much?

810
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:43,650
I mean, she was a kid this small.

811
01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:47,170
When did she grow this much?

812
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:52,610
This is so amazing.

813
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:57,600
Chairman, did you go home okay on that day?

814
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:58,860
Of course.

815
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:03,030
I was worried about your legs. We went around so many times around the neighborhood.

816
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:06,770
♫ When I walk this road, it makes me cry ♫

817
01:08:06,770 --> 01:08:13,500
♫ It reminds me of that person's touch ♫

818
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,480
♫ I couldn't hold her and just trembled my heart ♫

819
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:17,660
Who is this girl?

820
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:20,580
Do you know her?

821
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:24,640
Chairman, please let me get down now.

822
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:28,550
I will take you to the front over there since we are almost there.

823
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:35,590
This isn't just a regular handkerchief. Somebody did embroidery on it!

824
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:43,920
♫ The more I try to grasp it, the further it gets ♫

825
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:50,280
She came into the house intentionally aiming for Chairman from the beginning.

826
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:52,870
♫ My unforgettable love ♫

827
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:56,990
She planned it from the beginning.

828
01:08:56,990 --> 01:09:04,560
♫ Why do you run away, love. Like a shy child ♫

829
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:11,130
♫ In case I lose it, I hold it tight ♫

830
01:09:11,130 --> 01:09:18,500
♫ But love always runs away, chased by longing ♫

831
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:25,140
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

832
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:28,190
♫ I have to abandon the longing and the grieves ♫

833

[Young Lady and Gentleman]

834
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:32,240
Where are the two going?

835
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,560
Are they going to a hotel?

836
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:36,360
What is Chairman Lee doing on the street with that young girl?

837
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:39,990
Ms. Park, that wench has been flirting with the Chairman behind our backs.

838
01:09:39,990 --> 01:09:41,840
What a cunning girl!

839
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:44,840
- What should I do?
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

840
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:48,000
Getting rid of that young girl is not a problem.

841
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,140
Mother-in-law.

842
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:50,790
This is Madame Wang from FT Group.

843
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:52,120
This is my daughter.

844
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,510
It feels very good today.

845
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:57,040
It looks like they met their destiny.

846
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,210
Excuse me. Please get out of the car.

847
01:09:58,210 --> 01:09:59,920
It looks like she really met the guy for an arranged marriage.

848
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,460
What is that you wanted to tell me?

849
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:03,610
I would like to take Ms. Park.

850
01:10:03,610 --> 01:10:04,630
My Dan Dan?

851
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:06,030
Chief Jo! Chief Jo!

852
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:08,190
My necklace is missing. The white one!

853
01:10:08,190 --> 01:10:09,410
Did Ms. Park take it?

854
01:10:09,410 --> 01:10:11,140
Madam, what is everyone doing here?

855
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:14,900
Not a tutor, but we had a thief at home!
