00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,240
[Episode 15]

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,140
This is not something you should involve.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,140
Chairman, putting everything else aside,

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,290
you cannot have someone who lied and deceived the children in this house.

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,620
I don't think that is right.

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,200
I already told you that Ms. Park didn't deceive, but I concealed it.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,790
Ms. Park is someone my children need the most.

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,580
Take that as the answer, and please leave.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,930
I can't do that.

10
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:37,900
I cannot work with someone like that.

11
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:42,600
Chairman, you will have to choose.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,770
Choose one between Ms. Park and me.

13
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,770
What did you say?

14
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,840
- Chief Jo.
- Chairman.

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,310
Ms. Park hid the fact that she's a daughter

16
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,140
of that family of frauds to all of us.

17
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,550
It's not something we can get past just because it's okay with you.

18
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,230
A daughter of a family of frauds?

19
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,730
Chief Jo, how can you speak so carelessly?

20
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:24,100
Also, I've already explained to you that Ms. Park didn't deceive anybody.

21
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,530
So what is the real reason you're acting like this?

22
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,890
Don't you know you're exceeding your authority?

23
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:39,410
Please choose who is the more important person to this house between Ms. Park and me.

24
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:47,410
Chief Jo. Do you have to do this?

25
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,140
Yes.

26
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,480
Then, please resign, Chief Jo.

27
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,870
Chairman.

28
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,470
Ms. Park is the one who did wrong.

29
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,900
But are you firing me?

30
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,240
What did I do wrong? How can you do this to me?

31
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,950
I'm not firing you.

32
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,690
You are the one who said you couldn't work with Ms. Park.

33
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:18,210
So you will have to choose. Either you work with Ms. Park or resign.

34
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,160
How can you do this to me?

35
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,130
If you were going to fire me like this,

36
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,860
why have you held onto me all these years?

37
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,450
Did you say I held onto you all these years?

38
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,460
Chief Jo. What is this nonsense you are saying?

39
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,860
Are you saying you haven't been aware

40
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,040
that I've been in love with you all along?

41
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,870
Chief Jo. What are you talking about it right now?

42
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,290
Are you saying you didn't know?

43
00:02:54,290 --> 00:03:00,610
I have devoted all of my youth to you and your family!

44
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,640
I've taken care of everything, from the smallest to the largest,

45
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,170
including your underwear!

46
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:12,140
As if I'm your wife.

47
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,700
But you didn't know?

48
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:20,020
Then why did you think I did all that?

49
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:25,130
Did you think my devotion was merely for the compensation of my small wages?

50
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:30,880
Is that all you ever thought of me?

51
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,440
Not even in my dreams did I think that you worked

52
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,820
in my home with those feelings.

53
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:46,390
It would be best if you no longer worked in this house.

54
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,270
Regardless of your opinions of Ms. Park,

55
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:55,110
I think it's best if you resign.

56
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,620
Chairman.

57
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,610
What a stupid idiot!

58
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,280
How can she say things like that?

59
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,040
It's all over now.

60
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,280
But still, how can he fire Chief Jo?

61
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,140
I can't stand this!

62
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,920
No, no. I should hold back until Se Ryun gets married.

63
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,470
I should hold back until Se Ryun gets her share of the company.

64
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,030
Let's hold back.

65
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,700
I can hold back.

66
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,640
Let's hold back.

67
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,620
Oh, my headaches!

68
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,850
It's infuriating! Oh, my headaches.

69
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,890
Madam.

70
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,700
Oh, you startled me!

71
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,530
How can you come in without a knock, Chief Jo?

72
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:52,260
Do you treat me disrespectfully because Young Gook did?

73
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,800
Chairman told me to resign.

74
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,520
I can't do this anymore.

75
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,730
I will resign.

76
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:08,400
Yes, you made the right decision.

77
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,350
Pardon?

78
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,850
Madam.

79
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:17,110
I mean, why did you tell him you have feelings for him?

80
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,920
Are you stupid, Chief Jo?

81
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,800
Do you really want me to quit?

82
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,350
What do you want me to do? I don't have any power!

83
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:34,240
Did you not hear that rude bastard call me Ajumeoni?

84
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,200
But still,

85
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,470
how can you treat me this way as well?

86
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:47,640
Chief Jo, even I will leave this place as soon as Se Ryun's wedding is over.

87
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,340
I no longer have any attachment to this place whatsoever.

88
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:58,610
So you should also forget about him. Why do you like that cold-hearted jerk anyway?

89
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,320
I understood your words clearly.

90
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,050
You swallow when it's sweet and spit out when it's bitter.

91
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,690
I had no idea you would treat me this way too.

92
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,020
Goodbye.

93
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,570
Oh, my!

94
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,280
What did she mean by that?

95
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,640
Hello.

96
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,080
Unni, do you think the Chairman's son is coming today as well?

97
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,570
I don't know. Let's go out now.

98
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,340
You go ahead.

99
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,680
- Okay, come out soon!
- Yes!

100
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,300
He'll fall for me, won't he?

101
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:06,510
Isn't the baby you gave birth to six years ago mine?

102
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,820
This Jin Sang Goo's child. Didn't you have my baby?

103
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,750
Someone saw you heavily pregnant at a gynecologist.

104
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,520
It's okay.

105
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:49,070
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, my baby.

106
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,740
It's okay.

107
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:57,030
Honey, Sarah has agreed to take care of our house from today.

108
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,110
Hello.

109
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,870
Please take good care of our house, Ms. Jo Sarah.

110
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,370
Se Jong, it's me, your mom.

111
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,830
Your mother's here.

112
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:19,440
I will always be next to you from now on.

113
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:48,020
Se Jong, please stay healthy like you are now.

114
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,430
I will come back.

115
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,430
No matter what.

116
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:13,190
It's just too peculiar.

117
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,510
He's a stalker for sure.

118
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,280
On the same bus, going to the same training,

119
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,560
and the same neighborhood.

120
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,910
He even comes to the convenience store where I work.

121
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,080
How can all that be a coincidence?

122
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,800
I have to check today if he really lives in that house.

123
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,130
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

124
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:43,560
I'm sorry.

125
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,630
Let me see. Are you okay?

126
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,300
I'm fine, so you don't have to care about it.

127
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,400
It's bleeding. Let me see.

128
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,820
I said I'm fine.

129
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,500
Where are the bandages?

130
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,110
I'm sure I packed them.

131
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,770
Here.

132
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,920
Please use this.

133
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,860
I will buy you one exactly the same.

134
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,950
Sure.

135
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,850
He's going to my neighborhood again.

136
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,240
Maybe he's not a stalker?

137
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,250
I guess he really lives here.

138
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,850
Then did I misunderstand him the whole time?

139
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,360
Excuse me, Ms. Kang Mi Rim.

140
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,300
Why did you follow me?

141
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,820
Are you a stalker?

142
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,180
How did he know my name?

143
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,730
Yes.

144
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:44,580
Ms. Park, are you okay?

145
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,640
I'm sorry I couldn't take care of you because I had to think about some stuff.

146
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,610
It's okay. I'm fine.

147
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,410
I'm sorry. I misjudged.

148
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:59,520
When you told me everything about your family,

149
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,380
I should have told everybody in the house.

150
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,650
Then, today would've not happened.

151
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:08,410
I made you feel pain and suffer again.

152
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,480
I should've thought more.

153
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,960
I'm really okay.

154
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:19,160
It's my fault that I didn't tell you right from the start.

155
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:25,750
Okay, you don't have to worry about that anymore from now on.

156
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,830
Yes.

157
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:33,700
But, Chairman.

158
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,120
Why? Do you have something to tell me?

159
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,040
Yes. It's something I heard from Mrs. Yeoju earlier,

160
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,040
that Chief Jo resigned.

161
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,840
It was so sudden,

162
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,320
so I wondered if it had to do with my incident earlier.

163
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,020
Ms. Park.

164
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,730
I will be honest with you.

165
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,860
It's true that your incident triggered it,

166
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,970
but Chief Jo did not resign because of you.

167
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,690
Then, why did she suddenly quit?

168
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:13,540
It's Chief Jo's private matter, so I can't tell you,

169
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,130
but she had other reasons to quit.

170
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,170
That's why she left.

171
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:21,200
So you don't have to worry about it.

172
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,760
Is that true?

173
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,820
- Really?
- Of course.

174
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,480
Why would I say something untrue?

175
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,620
Right.

176
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,900
Until we find Chief Jo's replacement,

177
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,620
can I ask you and Mrs. Yeoju to help,

178
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,520
even though it could be extra work for you?

179
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,890
Of course, don't worry.

180
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:48,230
I will do everything I can.

181
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,450
You can stop worrying and go upstairs and rest.

182
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:55,830
Yes. Please have some rest as well, Chairman.

183
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,470
Hello, ma'am. Who called for a driver?

184
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:28,450
- Over there!
- Okay.

185
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,670
Hello, are you the one going to Sangdo-dong?

186
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:53,080
Isn't life the pits?

187
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:58,140
Nothing turns out the way I want it to.

188
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:03,300
What's the point of trying so hard?

189
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:08,630
Life sucks anyway.

190
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,830
I agree with you.

191
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:14,020
But pit doesn't have a fault.

192
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,240
This rotting world!

193
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,370
It's totally horrible.

194
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,240
Ahjussi,

195
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,020
can you drive me to Sokcho?

196
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,080
Pardon? To Sokcho?

197
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,450
Yes.

198
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:46,040
I'll pay double for the additional fare.

199
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,260
D-Did you say double?

200
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,620
Yes! I'll do it, then.

201
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,560
I'll drive you to Sokcho.

202
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,830
We've arrived.

203
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:17,390
- Here.
- Yes.

204
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,750
Why did you pay me so much? Thank you.

205
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,490
Here is the key.

206
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,750
Thank you.

207
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,100
You are going back to Seoul, right?

208
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,990
Do you want me to wait for you?

209
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,350
I can get myself some food nearby.

210
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,310
I think you've had a few drinks.

211
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,600
No, it's okay. I will do it on my own.

212
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,760
Are you not going back to Seoul?

213
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,330
Why would I have come here if I was going back?

214
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,110
Go back safely.

215
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,240
Okay.

216
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,060
Sure, she should see the sunrise, at least

217
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,870
since she came all the way here from Seoul.

218
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,170
What did you say?

219
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,580
Are you in Sokcho?

220
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,520
If that's the case,

221
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,450
how are you getting back home at this hour?

222
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:39,790
It's not like I will sleep on the streets, Mom.

223
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:44,280
I'll kill some time in an Internet cafe and take the first train in the morning.

224
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,420
What?

225
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,780
Take a taxi home?

226
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:54,190
If I do that, I'll spend all the money I earned today.

227
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:58,200
Then what's the point for me to drive this far?

228
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:05,920
I'm okay, so don't worry about me and go to sleep.

229
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,850
Yes. I'm hanging up.

230
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,210
How can I take a taxi?

231
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,750
Are you not going back to Seoul?

232
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:24,370
Why would I have come here if I was going back?

233
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,940
But what did she mean by that?

234
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,050
If she doesn't go back, what will she do here?

235
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,610
Is she...

236
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,310
No way!

237
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:54,760
Oh, no. Something terrible will happen!

238
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,310
Where did she go?

239
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,010
- What did you do for me?
- Hey! Excuse me!

240
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:32,090
- What did you do for me, Father!
- Don't do this!

241
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,750
What are you doing!

242
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:40,780
Am I asking too much to be next to Se Jong?

243
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,030
Excuse me!

244
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,500
What are you doing?

245
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,250
Can't you even do that for me?

246
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,930
How can not even one thing that I wished for come true?

247
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:54,800
Why are you doing this to me? Why?

248
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,950
- Hey!
- What did I do so wrong?

249
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,310
Don't I deserve something for trying so hard?

250
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,690
Why not me? Why?

251
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:07,510
Hey! Listen.

252
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,920
Please don't do this. I don't know what happened to you,

253
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,750
but don't do this. You only have one life!

254
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,260
You have to think about your family. Get yourself together.

255
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,090
Let go of me!

256
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,850
Let me go!

257
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,310
Do you think it's all over when you die!

258
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:27,000
Does everything get resolved when you die?

259
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,240
Get yourself together.

260
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,790
Get yourself together!

261
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,860
I'm not trying to die.

262
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,320
I don't want to die. I don't want to!

263
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,280
I wasn't trying to die.

264
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,920
I cannot end my life yet!

265
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:57,780
Right, right. You have to live no matter what.

266
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,960
Let's live, no matter what.

267
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,420
Yes, you have to live.

268
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:05,750
I'm not going to die. I won't die.

269
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,480
Let's go.

270
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,880
I can't die yet...

271
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:14,580
Hey! Wake up!

272
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,480
Wake up!

273
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,450
Wake up! Excuse me!

274
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,450
No, please! Wake up!

275
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,870
Let's get out of here.

276
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,240
Oh, my back. Why is she so heavy?

277
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:39,360
It's salty. I need to go to a sauna and wash up.

278
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:50,350
I don't have to worry since her guardian is coming.

279
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,870
Jo Sarah. Jo Sarah!

280
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:59,200
Jo Sarah.

281
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:31,090
Sarah. Your mom's here.

282
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,680
Sarah.

283
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,110
Are you okay now?

284
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,690
What happened to you?

285
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:50,100
Why did you come all the way here?

286
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,070
Mom...

287
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,820
Did you really try to take your own life?

288
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,430
Jumped into the ocean?

289
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:02,180
Were you really trying to end your life? Why?

290
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:06,650
Why would you want to kill yourself?

291
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,650
Mom.

292
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:16,090
I got kicked out of that house.

293
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:20,120
Did you get kicked out? What do you mean?

294
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,450
Why? What happened?

295
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:28,850
Why did you get kicked out?

296
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,510
I understood your words clearly.

297
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,240
You swallow when it's sweet and spit out when it's bitter.

298
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,700
I had no idea you would treat me this way too.

299
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,730
Goodbye.

300
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,190
It's so upsetting.

301
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:57,820
I don't know. I have enough problems of my own.

302
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,520
My goodness! Who's calling at this hour?

303
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,230
[Gi Ja]

304
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:10,020
Is she crazy calling me at this hour?

305
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,830
She has no manners.

306
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,360
Hey, Wang Dae Ran. Are you ignoring my calls?

307
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,990
Do you want me to show up at your door right now?

308
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:28,300
Go ahead and ignore my calls one more time, and you will die in my hands.

309
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:33,090
Is she threatening me now?

310
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:44,080
Hey, Gi Ja. Do you know what time it is now?

311
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,470
So what? Do you think time matters right now?

312
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:52,740
How can you kick out my Sarah?

313
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,710
How can you do that to her?

314
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:59,150
It's not me. It's Chairman Lee who kicked her out!

315
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:02,030
You should have stopped him then.

316
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,870
Why didn't you stop him?

317
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,400
Did Chief Jo not tell you?

318
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,040
I tried to help her, and I almost got kicked out first!

319
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,190
I did more than I could do!

320
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,850
Why do you think she got kicked out?

321
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:24,430
She confessed her love to the Chairman, and that's why things got to this stage! You better know before arguing with me!

322
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:27,370
Did Sarah confess her feelings to Chairman Lee?

323
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:28,800
Yes!

324
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:34,310
If Chairman Lee had any feelings for her, he would've not fired her like that!

325
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,330
But he doesn't have any feelings for her!

326
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,880
That's why he cut her off like a knife.

327
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,560
He fired her because it's uncomfortable to have Chief Jo, who has a different intention for him.

328
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,610
Why did she do that in the first place?

329
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:47,230
Is your daughter stupid?

330
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,640
No matter how mindless she is, why would she say such a thing?

331
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,240
She made a dumb move!

332
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,970
You, bad wench!

333
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,310
What?

334
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:59,290
Sarah did so much for you.

335
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:02,960
How can you speak this way about her?

336
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,300
You are worse.

337
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,790
You're a worse wench!

338
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:10,930
I'll never forgive you. Never!

339
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:18,100
Forgive me or not, you do whatever you want! I'm hanging up now.

340
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:22,190
Hey--!

341
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:25,680
My goodness.

342
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:30,800
That wench.

343
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:38,410
Sarah.

344
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:44,010
I think you should give up Chairman Lee now.

345
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,800
You've tried enough.

346
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:52,310
And if it still didn't work,

347
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:55,400
it's not meant to be.

348
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,100
Even without you,

349
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,570
Se Jong is their son already.

350
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,520
To be honest,

351
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,310
it's better for him

352
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:12,070
to live there the way he is now.

353
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:18,070
So even for the sake of Se Jong,

354
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:21,800
you should give it up now.

355
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,840
Sarah.

356
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,090
Start fresh now.

357
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,970
You are young and beautiful still.

358
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:41,760
I beg you.

359
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:14,870
Why don't you take a picture over there as well?

360
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,120
Ms. Park.

361
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,400
Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong, thanks for coming.

362
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,330
Thank you very much for the invitation.

363
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:30,810
Ms. Park, your outfit suits you well. You look beautiful.

364
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,760
Thank you.

365
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,560
I feel awkward because the clothes are so beautiful.

366
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,610
No, it looks great on you.

367
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:42,620
Where is my dad?

368
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,490
He's coming over there.

369
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:16,390
Dad!

370
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,260
Yes, Se Jong.

371
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,030
Hello, Jenny and Se Chan.

372
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,980
Let me introduce two concepts from this fashion show.

373
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:48,670
First, we've combined athleticism in daily casual wear.

374
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:52,730
Didn't you want to wear stylishly after golfing as well?

375
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:56,360
These are products that would satisfy those desires.

376
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,980
Second, keeping the functionality of sportswear,

377
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:06,310
these can be worn flexibly during various activities.

378
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,980
Chairman, can you stop staring at me?

379
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:07,080
I know I look beautiful today,

380
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,350
but I worry that Jenny or Se Chan might notice us.

381
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,580
I was not staring at you.

382
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,300
I happened to make eye contact when I turned my head in that direction.

383
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,800
You've mistaken it.

384
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,200
Wow, it's amazing!

385
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,480
I feel like it's my birthday today.

386
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,220
Our whole family is eating in a restaurant altogether.

387
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:02,820
Right, it's been a while to eat altogether out with our dad.

388
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:06,960
I'm sorry, children. I've been busy with work lately.

389
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,390
I will make more time like this in the future.

390
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,190
Please promise us.

391
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,240
Yes, I promise.

392
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,990
What a beautiful family!

393
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,860
Would you like a photo?

394
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,620
Yes.

395
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:25,660
Come here, Se Jong.

396
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:30,100
The eldest daughter should go near your father too. Otherwise, you will be off the photo.

397
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,840
Did she say "eldest daughter?"

398
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,390
She said, "eldest daughter!"

399
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:37,650
She called our teacher, eldest daughter.

400
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,680
No, I'm not the eldest daughter.

401
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,650
I'm sorry?

402
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:43,970
She's not my daughter.

403
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:47,660
But my children's teacher.

404
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,050
I'm sorry.

405
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:52,650
Do I look that old?

406
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,850
That their teacher looks like my daughter?

407
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:58,900
I'm truly sorry I was mistaken.

408
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:04,310
Now that I look, she looks like a teacher, not a daughter.

409
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,620
Ms. Park.

410
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,320
Ms. Park, please join us.

411
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,250
Let's take the photo together.

412
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,820
Here we go.

413
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:20,270
One, two, three.

414
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:29,620
The sky is high, and it's breezy.

415
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:34,220
Why does my heart feel lonely today?

416
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,410
I think I'm feeling the autumn.

417
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:42,960
Dae Beom, how are you feeling?

418
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,280
Hey, let's eat out after work today.

419
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,230
Let's eat out together. Sounds good?

420
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,550
Say you want it.

421
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:53,660
How can we eat out when our business is not going well?

422
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,930
I'll go for a break.

423
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:59,300
Break, my foot.

424
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:11,900
What is the difference in status? What's the gap between rich and poor?

425
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:16,700
Rich and poor whatever, the business really sucks today.

426
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,410
That's not right.

427
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,300
Welcome, everyone! Padak! Padak!

428
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,760
Padak Padak!

429
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,110
The Hot Young Men is here! Please come for the chicken skewers.

430
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:29,700
The Hot Young Men's chicken skewers are here!

431
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,530
These are the best chicken skewers in this world!

432
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,980
The spicy flavor, explosively hot one, and more!

433
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:39,130
We have everything! Come and get it!

434
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,710
Wow, amazing.

435
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:51,340
Se Ryun. You really are beautiful.

436
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,160
Wow, really,

437
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,680
you look stunning.

438
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,060
Then should we choose this one?

439
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:04,960
This one suits you as well,

440
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,490
and the one we saw earlier is pretty too.

441
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:11,410
You can't say you like them all.

442
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:14,380
Choose the one you like.

443
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,510
Then, I will try just one more dress.

444
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,400
Of course.

445
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:26,010
It's the one and only in life. You have to pick the one you like.

446
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,710
Then, I will try that one.

447
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,420
Yes.

448
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:44,300
Where did Kyung Seok go?

449
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:49,380
Did he go to the restroom?

450
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,970
Oppa!

451
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,860
What are you doing? Have you gone crazy?

452
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,000
Are you threatening me with a suicide attempt?

453
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,570
Oppa, I don't think I can live without you.

454
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,650
If you get married,

455
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:09,690
I'm really going to kill myself!

456
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:14,900
Oppa, do you want me to die?

457
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:17,660
Why are you acting like this now?

458
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,220
I explained everything to you.

459
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,770
I told you why I had to get married.

460
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:25,310
The reason why I have to get married to that woman--

461
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,950
Be quiet. Don't even make a sound.

462
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,150
Yes, Se Ryun.

463
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:40,000
I had an emergency at the hospital.

464
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,250
It's okay. It can't be helped if it's an emergency.

465
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:50,630
I was worried because you disappeared all of a sudden.

466
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:54,300
Please call me when you are done with work.

467
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:00,290
- I will take this dress.
- Okay.

468
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,670
That's strange.

469
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:14,390
This is the correct code.

470
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:17,620
Maybe the sister-in-law changed it so that we couldn't get in.

471
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,520
Why would she do that?

472
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:24,310
She told us not to do the housekeeping work the last time we were here.

473
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:28,240
Still, how could she change the passcode?

474
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,000
It's not like I asked for a raise or anything.

475
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,420
Why can't she just use my service?

476
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,540
I told you not to come here! What is all this now?

477
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,840
Who else other than this family will hire me at this point?

478
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,860
I wanted to make some money to help you buy a house.

479
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,050
Who said we wanted you to help us with money?

480
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:49,190
Don't ever come back here. Let's go.

481
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:04,690
Why is it raining all of a sudden!

482
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:07,940
I think the house will be leaking again.

483
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,070
Is there any place to buy an umbrella?

484
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:12,240
We will get soaked.

485
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:18,560
Mom, the name of the villa where sister-in-law lives is Rose Villa, right?

486
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,540
Yes. Why?

487
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,240
Look at this, Mom.
 [For sale: South-facing, the best floor in Rose Villa for 2 billion won]

488
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,260
The Rose Villa is on sale for 2 billion won!

489
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:31,660
What? My goodness. The in-law's home is that expensive?

490
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,360
Do you think that's really selling on 2 billion?

491
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,800
My head is spinning.

492
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,720
Is that house selling at 2 billion won? Really?

493
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,350
Yes, that's how much Seoul houses are these days.

494
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:50,050
But why is that expensive house connected to the next place through the veranda?

495
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:53,790
You must have seen Mrs. Jang's home.

496
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:57,920
It's because the same person owns her home and the next unit.

497
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,680
Who's the owner, then?

498
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,140
Of course, it's Mrs. Jang.

499
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,400
But, Mrs. Jang rented out that expensive next-door unit

500
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,390
to her friend almost free by getting a little bit of security!

501
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:19,170
- Almost free?
- Yes!

502
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:22,710
There's nobody like Mrs. Jang these days.

503
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:26,220
She's an angel!

504
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,330
Mom, about my sister-in-law.

505
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:42,800
She's renting out the unit next door to her friend for almost nothing.

506
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,850
Even if she's a very close friend, isn't the family coming first?

507
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:51,100
I wish she would ask us to move in there.

508
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:54,470
Aigoo, don't jump to the conclusion first.

509
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:57,420
You will get hurt if you raise an expectation too high.

510
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,390
I really don't like this house, Mom.

511
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:03,190
Who lives in a leaky house like this these days?

512
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,430
Lady-in-law, are you home?

513
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,190
Who is that?

514
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:09,850
I think it's the sister-in-law.

515
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:11,490
I think it's her.

516
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:13,340
Sister-in-law, are you home?

517
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,260
Sister-in-law!

518
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,370
- Hello!
- Oh, goodness!

519
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:22,400
- Hello!
- Why did you come all the way here when it's raining?

520
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:27,210
Lady-in-law, didn't you leave food in front of my house?

521
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:30,900
Yes. We tried to leave it inside,

522
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:36,320
but we couldn't unlock the door, so we left it in front of the door.

523
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:41,490
If you had called me earlier, then I would have stayed home.

524
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:46,130
I got some Korean beef and fruits.

525
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:49,820
But what are those?

526
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:53,600
Is this the rain leaking through the roof?

527
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:59,010
Yes, it's an old house, so it leaks when it rains.

528
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:04,850
It's ridiculous! You should tell the owner to fix it!

529
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:11,280
We got this place cheap since it'll get redeveloped soon, so the owner won't spend money to fix it.

530
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,510
It only leaks when it rains.

531
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:16,460
When it isn't raining, it's fine.

532
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,190
Please sit over here and avoid the rain.

533
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:21,750
It's okay over here.

534
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:24,140
Oh, my goodness.

535
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:32,560
But still, the moisture could create fungus, and that's bad for your health.

536
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:38,630
How can there's a house like this still exist in Seoul?

537
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,850
Don't worry.

538
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:46,230
We can take the mat outside and dry it when it gets sunny, and it'll be fine.

539
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,750
All of our family are working hard to save money.

540
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:53,100
We should be able to move out someday.

541
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:59,940
Even I am trying to make some money to be helpful to my son-in-law buying a house.

542
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:03,120
That's why I went to your place to work.

543
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:08,120
What are you saying? Are you trying to upset her?

544
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:14,790
Lady-in-law. I never knew that was your intention.

545
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:20,830
Are you asking us to move out?

546
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:26,660
I'm sorry. I will help you with the deposit, so please look for another place.

547
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:32,410
Mi Sook, how can you do this out of the blue?

548
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:36,640
That's because I just visited my brother's house,

549
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,990
and they were collecting the rain leaking from the ceiling with bowls, and I could smell musty fungus smell.

550
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:45,650
I was so upset that I was speechless.

551
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:50,930
That's the reason, Gi Ja. I'm sorry, but please find a new place.

552
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:54,120
Even if you feel bad for your brother,

553
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,930
but what am I supposed to do if you ask me to move out all of a sudden?

554
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:02,900
I'm not saying you should move out today. I will give you two to three months.

555
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:09,970
You were going to move out in a year. Can you just think you're moving out a bit earlier?

556
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:12,520
My Sarah just got fired.

557
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,950
Why are you doing this on top of that?

558
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:17,260
Why did she get fired?

559
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,860
I don't know.

560
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:22,230
It's time for her to leave that place, anyway.

561
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:24,490
Sarah has plenty of places to go.

562
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:27,960
Of course, she does, Gi Ja.

563
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,570
I'm sorry to add this on top of your situation.

564
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:35,570
But I wouldn't ask if I could help it.

565
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:38,730
It's because you didn't see that miserable situation.

566
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:42,160
Six people live in that leaky house.

567
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,890
Who lives in a leaky house these days?

568
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:52,310
There are only two of you. My brother's family is six.

569
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:55,850
Are you really doing this to me, Mi Sook?

570
00:44:55,850 --> 00:45:00,690
I feel like I've done more than enough for you as a friend.

571
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:04,570
So please try to understand my position this time.

572
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:08,660
Please find a new place as soon as possible.

573
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:11,970
Please. I will get going now.

574
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,290
Terrible wench.

575
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:21,830
She uses all kinds of excuses to kick me out.

576
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:25,440
I can't stand bruises to my ego. Okay, I'll leave.

577
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:32,460
But where should I get a lease with a deposit of 100 million won?

578
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,530
It's not like I'll hit the jackpot all of a sudden.

579
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:40,990
Okay, let's at least give that a try.

580
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:45,400
In this situation, my pride is not important.

581
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:54,280
Madam, would you like me to do that?

582
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,320
No, it's okay, I'm done.

583
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:02,410
Madam. I bet your feelings got hurt because of me.

584
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:04,790
I'm so sorry.

585
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:06,690
It's all right.

586
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:10,950
I'm tired, so let's not talk about that anymore. It's exhausting.

587
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:21,330
If I could do what I want to do--!

588
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:25,980
No, what's the point of making a fuss about it now?

589
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,730
That gutless Young Gook.

590
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:35,710
Sure, as soon as Se Ryun gets married and gets her share of the company, I will be out of here.

591
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:38,670
How are my pretty babies doing?

592
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:41,070
My pretty babies.

593
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:43,390
My babies!

594
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:49,990
Yes, my pretty things.

595
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:51,870
Just wait a little longer.

596
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:55,800
Let's all get out of this house together.

597
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,960
What's this?

598
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,620
Was there something wrong with the lunch?

599
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:04,140
Oh, my! What's happening?

600
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:07,600
My stomach hurts.

601
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:12,370
Hello!

602
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:14,800
Is Chief Jo okay? How is she doing?

603
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,230
Of course, she's doing very well.

604
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:18,630
I'm glad.

605
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:21,300
Why did she quit like that all of a sudden?

606
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,250
What is the reason she left this place?

607
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:26,640
Ahjumma, Dae Ran's here, right?

608
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,660
Is Dae Ran in her room?

609
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:33,170
Yes, she is. Go on in.

610
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,960
Dae Ran. I'm here.

611
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,050
She's not here. Did she go to the bathroom?

612
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:57,580
What's that light?

613
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:15,140
It's g-gold.

614
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,590
How many gold bars are in there?

615
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:20,750
Chief Jo's mother is here?

616
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:30,200
What brings you here without prior notice?

617
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,860
Dae Ran.

618
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:35,980
I thought you never wanted to see me again. Why did you come?

619
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,100
That's why I'm here.

620
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:42,170
To make up with you and to discuss something with you.

621
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:43,910
What do you want to talk about it?

622
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:49,620
Dae Ran, I'm so sorry for getting angry with you yesterday.

623
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:53,740
Sarah was so upset, and that made me upset too.

624
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,790
And honestly, I felt disappointed with you.

625
00:48:56,790 --> 00:49:00,160
I couldn't sleep either because I was very upset too.

626
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,830
Did you think I would be okay?

627
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:04,790
Ah, I see.

628
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:07,110
I didn't know you would feel that way.

629
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,920
But Gi Ja,

630
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,580
it will be difficult for Chief Jo to come back to our house.

631
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:14,490
She made a critical mistake.

632
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:17,780
So if you came to ask for us to rehire her, forget about it.

633
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:22,080
I will look for new employment for her somewhere.

634
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:29,200
This wench, after using my daughter for every kind of work!

635
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:34,190
Dae Ran, thank you for thinking of her.

636
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:38,230
But that's not why I'm here.

637
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:40,980
Really? What then?

638
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:46,110
Actually, something urgent came up.

639
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:49,170
So can you lend me some money?

640
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:52,190
Money? How much?

641
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,860
1 million won?

642
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:58,560
No, about 200 million won. Would you please lend me?

643
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,420
200 million won?

644
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:04,930
Not even 2 million won or 20 million won? I don't have that much money!

645
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:08,990
I get monthly allowances from Chairman Lee.

646
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:12,610
But you are the Madam of a wealthy family!

647
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:16,160
Don't you have an emergency fund?

648
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,930
I will pay you back for sure.

649
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:21,040
Ask Chief Jo how desperate my life has been.

650
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,310
Even with my daughter's wedding coming up, I have no money.

651
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:30,760
I'm dreaded just thinking of asking for money from Chairman Lee.

652
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,290
She has a safe full of cash and gold bars.

653
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:38,180
How can she lie to me like that?

654
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:45,620
Dae Ran, I didn't want to say this, but a long time ago,

655
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:49,480
your mother ripped off my mother's lodge money.

656
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:53,460
In today's money, it'd be at least 200 million won.

657
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:56,110
What?

658
00:50:56,110 --> 00:50:58,940
My mother ripped off lodge money?

659
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:02,240
Yes, she did. It's not you who did it,

660
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,970
but ethically speaking, shouldn't you pay us back?

661
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:09,020
Oh, my goodness. Do you have proof of it?

662
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,830
With what intention are you talking about my mother?

663
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:14,250
Dae Ran, let's not raise our voices.

664
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:17,080
Just lend me some money if you have it.

665
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:20,630
After what happened to Sarah, now we have to move out of our house too.

666
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:23,440
I'm not asking you to give me money. I'm borrowing it.

667
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,990
I beg you. I will pay you back.

668
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:27,490
Dae Ran, please.

669
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:31,210
I said I don't have big money like that!

670
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:32,670
Do you really not have it?

671
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:37,860
No! I really don't have it!

672
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,140
What a terrible wench.

673
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:50,690
She's not a friend!

674
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:54,840
She's worse than Chairman Lee.

675
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:03,730
And why is my umbrella acting up too?

676
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:06,860
Okay, today's the worst day.

677
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:10,620
Have a good life!

678
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:20,220
It's raining.

679
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:34,280
Driver Park.

680
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:38,060
- I will escort you to the car.
- Pardon?

681
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:40,800
It's raining a lot, so you will be soaked otherwise.

682
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,470
Let's go.

683
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:46,240
Thank you.

684
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:03,610
- Thanks again.
- Drive carefully.

685
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:28,260
It's nice that you came out for me.

686
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:31,020
Your shoulder is getting all wet.

687
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:34,630
I'm fine as long as you don't get rained on.

688
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:37,280
It's not okay!

689
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,550
We should use it together.

690
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:42,380
I don't want you getting rained on, Ji Young.

691
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:44,850
You'll catch a cold.

692
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:47,380
I don't like you getting hit by the rain either.

693
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:51,910
If you catch a cold, I won't be able to see you.

694
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:54,370
Then...

695
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:57,910
We can do it this way.

696
00:53:57,910 --> 00:54:01,370
Now we both can stay dry.

697
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:04,630
We should've walked like this from the beginning.

698
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:06,930
It's nice.

699
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:11,430
♫ But love always runs away, chased by longing ♫

700
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:18,590
♫ It would be nice to take a break
 ♫

701
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:29,580
♫ It would be nice to take a break
 ♫

702
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:42,810
What am I thinking about right now?

703
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:45,940
Why would I think about that woman?

704
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:51,310
Honey, sister-in-law stopped by today.

705
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,030
- My sister came by?
- Yes.

706
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:58,920
She brought fruits and meat.

707
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,920
Seriously...

708
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:04,670
Why does she keep getting us expensive things?

709
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:09,920
She wants to feed you, not us, of course.

710
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,560
But she came to our house today

711
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:16,700
and left very sad.

712
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,010
- Why?
- What do you mean why?

713
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:20,980
It rained all day today.

714
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:24,250
She was shocked to see the leaky roof in our house.

715
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:28,070
What houses have a leaky roof as we do these days?

716
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:30,630
That's because this house is up for demolition for redevelopment.

717
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:33,270
If it weren't for that, we would've fixed it.

718
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:37,050
Let's move to a house that doesn't leak by next year.

719
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:39,590
Honey, did you know about this?

720
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:41,480
Your sister has two houses.

721
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,450
The house next door is hers too.

722
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:47,300
What? Did she say that?

723
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:53,080
No. I thought it was weird that the balcony is connected to the next door,

724
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,230
so I asked the real estate agency.

725
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:59,560
And they said the next door is also hers!

726
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:02,130
But then that expensive house,

727
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:04,990
sister-in-law rented to her friend almost free!

728
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:08,750
- She just got a little bit of security!
- Is that so?

729
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:11,240
They say blood is thicker than water.

730
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,710
Shouldn't you come before her friend?

731
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:17,030
If she lets it to a friend for almost free,

732
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:20,090
wouldn't she ask us to move in there?

733
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:22,880
What are you talking about right now?

734
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,870
Don't say something like that again.

735
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:26,780
You scared me.

736
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:29,950
I'm telling you this once and for all.

737
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:32,090
Noona is Noona, and I am me.

738
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:35,050
We lived apart for more than 50 years and just reunited.

739
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:39,450
Our relationship will get destroyed at the moment when you think something like that!

740
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:43,840
It's not like I'm trying to steal her house next door.

741
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:47,400
And if she were to give it to you, shouldn't you accept it?

742
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,530
She rented it to her friend for next to nothing.

743
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:52,130
What's the big deal with giving it to her little brother?

744
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:55,930
Isn't helping each other in hard times a family?

745
00:56:55,930 --> 00:57:00,600
Honey, if your sister went through a hard time, wouldn't you help her?

746
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:04,130
It's ridiculous. Why are you making me a crazy person?

747
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:08,610
Wait. What's wrong with you?

748
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,750
[Ways to look younger]

749
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:24,620
Would that make me younger?

750
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:27,710
What am I doing right now?

751
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:38,080
Chairman, let's see each other for a moment.

752
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:13,880
Has my oldest daughter come?

753
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:21,360
Why do you still have that in mind?

754
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,440
It's because I wore something bright-colored today

755
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,870
and styled my hair that way.

756
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:30,420
Also, I look younger than my age.

757
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,250
You must be happy since you look younger.

758
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:38,540
Jenny calls me a Kkondae old man.

759
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:40,740
A Kkondae old man?

760
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:43,580
No, you don't seem like an old man.

761
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:46,310
You look like an Oppa.

762
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:55,320
Do I really look like an Oppa?

763
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,720
Of course.

764
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:02,800
Then shouldn't you call me Oppa?

765
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:07,950
Oppa?

766
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:09,900
You said I look like an Oppa.

767
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:13,260
Then you should call me Oppa.

768
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:23,330
For that, I think I will need more practice.

769
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:29,090
I guess you can't say it when you look at my face.

770
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:31,730
It's not that.

771
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,220
Oppa.

772
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:43,350
Is that enough?

773
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:45,460
Let's go together.

774
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:48,980
This Oppa will buy you ice cream.

775
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:54,710
Ms. Park!

776
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:58,210
You have to take this Oppa with you.

777
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:19,240
Chairman, you should head in first.

778
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:23,020
It would be weird if we went in together.

779
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:24,840
You should go in first.

780
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,360
Ladies first.

781
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:30,980
Okay. Then I'll go in first.

782
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,990
Chairman.

783
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:23,560
Chief Jo, why did you come here at this hour?

784
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:30,680
Chairman, why Ms. Park but not me?

785
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:36,230
What do you mean by that?

786
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:43,210
I just saw you and Ms. Park.

787
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:47,300
What am I lacking compared to Ms. Park?

788
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:53,070
Chairman.

789
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:56,720
Would you please look at me just once as a woman?

790
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,390
Please give me one chance.

791
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:03,860
Chief Jo. Please stop talking about that.

792
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:06,130
Chairman.

793
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:12,860
Why do you think Ms. Park, in her twenties, is attracted to you?

794
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:18,230
Ms. Park is after your money.

795
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:20,450
- Chief Jo!
- Do you think I'm wrong?

796
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:28,050
Why would a girl in her twenties be interested in a much older man with three children?

797
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:31,330
It's because of your money. Money!

798
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,760
But how can you fall for her?

799
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:39,590
I've looked at you for five years with a pure heart.

800
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:42,530
I did my best to be your woman!

801
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:47,810
And by putting everything I have and devoted myself to you.

802
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:51,760
But why don't you look at me once?

803
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:58,580
Chief Jo.

804
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:01,830
I don't want to discuss this further. You should go.

805
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:04,430
One moment please, Chairman.

806
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:08,350
Let me ask you one thing.

807
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:15,060
Have you ever seen me as a woman, even once?

808
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:21,970
No, not even once.

809
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:25,540
Your severance pay will be deposited by the end of this week.

810
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:27,790
Thank you for your work until now.

811
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:29,780
Chairman...

812
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:31,650
Chairman.

813
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:35,040
I've only looked at you. I have no one else but you.

814
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,710
I'm being truthful, please.

815
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:41,500
Can't you give me just one chance?

816
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:07,960
What did I just see?

817
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:11,010
Chief Jo was hugging Chairman.

818
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:13,000
What kind of a relationship do they have?

819
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,070
My goodness! Were they in a relationship before?

820
01:04:16,070 --> 01:04:18,400
Did Chairman dump her?

821
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,580
Oh, my goodness!

822
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:29,440
Ms. Park. Where were you at this hour?

823
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:33,400
Ah, I was just...

824
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:38,550
Ms. Park, were you with your boyfriend?

825
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,050
How did you know?

826
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:44,950
It's written all over your face.

827
01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:48,680
"I just saw my boyfriend."

828
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:52,880
Really? It hasn't been for long.

829
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:57,830
I just poked at you, but you are naive indeed.

830
01:04:57,830 --> 01:05:02,220
Ms. Park, what is your boyfriend like?

831
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:06,130
I will tell you later.

832
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:10,520
It's a bit too early to say anything.

833
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:13,530
Okay, I got it.

834
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:16,840
I will go upstairs first.

835
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,580
So my Dan Dan has a boyfriend.

836
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:27,600
Wonder what he's like. I hope it's not someone strange.

837
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:34,160
I'm sure our smart Dan Dan would not date a bad person.

838
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:48,680
Ms. Park. I found out why Chief Jo quit.

839
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:51,170
Really? Why?

840
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:53,160
That's because--

841
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:57,980
Ms. Park, we were going to play badminton.

842
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:01,080
Right, you go ahead, I'll be right behind you.

843
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:02,210
Yes.

844
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:04,300
Let's go.

845
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:10,560
Ahjumeoni, what was the reason?

846
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,160
That was--

847
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:16,220
No, nothing. Why don't you go out with the children?

848
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:18,330
Okay.

849
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:31,540
No, no. I might get kicked out if I spread the word.

850
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:47,500
Victory!

851
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:48,900
Ms. Park team!

852
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:50,470
Victory!

853
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:52,580
Hit it, Se Chan.

854
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,720
High five!

855
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,040
I played well, didn't I?

856
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,190
Yes.

857
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:18,240
I'm going to beat you, Se Jong!

858
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:20,110
Boo-hoo!

859
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:22,220
Boo-hoo to you!

860
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:33,750
Why is Young Gook keep looking at Dan Dan like that?

861
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:36,510
Dan Dan has a boyfriend.

862
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:42,870
- Noona!
- Yes!

863
01:07:42,870 --> 01:07:46,970
CEO Anna.

864
01:07:46,970 --> 01:07:50,110
Noona, what are all these?

865
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:54,690
Now that we've successfully finished launching, I bought presents for children.

866
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:56,910
Presents?

867
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:58,330
Is it our presents?

868
01:07:58,330 --> 01:07:59,990
Yes!

869
01:07:59,990 --> 01:08:01,560
It's mine!

870
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,100
These are really nice!

871
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:05,260
Wow, amazing!

872
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:07,070
I wanted this.

873
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:09,250
Amazing!

874
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:11,980
It's really cool.

875
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:15,780
It's so nice.

876
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:18,600
Thank you.

877
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,780
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

878
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:23,280
- Thank you.
- Yes!

879
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:31,460
I brought you some tea.

880
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:33,000
Thank you.

881
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,480
- Can we talk for a minute?
- Of course!

882
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:44,920
Thank you, Young Gook.

883
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,910
With your support, the latest launching was a success.

884
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:49,980
It was worth coming to Korea.

885
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:53,420
What are you saying? It's a win-win for both of us.

886
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:56,210
I am thankful too, Noona.

887
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:04,340
I have something to ask you.

888
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,300
Yes, what is it?

889
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:14,030
Do you have feelings for Ms. Park, by chance?

890
01:09:26,910 --> 01:09:34,590
♫ Why do you run away, love. Like a shy child ♫

891
01:09:34,590 --> 01:09:41,130
♫ In case I lose it, I hold it tight ♫

892
01:09:41,130 --> 01:09:48,350
♫ But love always runs away, chased by longing ♫

893
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:52,760
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

894
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:55,770
[Young Lady and Gentleman]

895
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:57,110
Soo Chul. Honey!

896
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:58,270
Did something happen?

897
01:09:58,270 --> 01:09:59,650
I just saw Dan Dan's mom.

898
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:02,720
I told you not to talk about that woman! She's dead.

899
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:05,800
That woman can't appear before Dan Dan and Soo Chul.

900
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,180
I feel strong because of you, Ms. Park.

901
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:10,500
Because you are by my side, I can rely on you.

902
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:12,130
Really?

903
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:15,040
Is this your house? Are you two the only people here?

904
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:16,420
Did you lose your mind?

905
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:18,120
Isn't that the Sokcho woman?

906
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,010
What are you doing with those shoes?

907
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:22,420
You've prepared the papers for Se Ryun's share, right?

908
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:24,080
Yes, they are ready for the signature.

909
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:29,990
Once Se Ryun marries today and signs the company papers, I'm out of your life, you rude bastard.

910
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:33,160
I have a bucket list of things I've wanted to do with a boyfriend.

911
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,180
What do you want to do?

912
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:35,350
Go up the Namsan stairs--

913
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:36,900
Lee Young Gook? It's good to see you.

914
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,250
Who is she? Your niece?

915
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:40,460
What?
