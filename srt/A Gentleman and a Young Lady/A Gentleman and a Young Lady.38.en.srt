1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,080
That's really great!
 [Episode 38]

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,760
My sincere congratulations to you. I'm so happy!

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,860
If I'd known, I would have put more effort before coming here.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,140
You should have told me in advance.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,380
I'm so curious what kind of person she would be.

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,740
I don't know why I feel nervous.

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,920
Is she here?

8
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,650
CEO Anna, hello.

9
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,620
Y-Yes, Ms. Park.

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,690
What brings you here..? Young Gook.

11
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,080
That's right, Noona.

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,140
Ms. Park is my girlfriend.

13
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,610
What?

14
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,430
Please sit down, Ms. Park.

15
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,750
Thank you.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,880
I've already ordered the course menu for us. Is that okay?

17
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,260
Yes, yes. That's okay.

18
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,230
But, what's going on here?

19
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:33,960
Ms. Park. When you mentioned a boyfriend before, did you mean Chairman Lee?

20
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,870
Yes.

21
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,430
Oh my, this makes no sense.

22
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:45,260
Does this make sense to you two?

23
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:50,100
Young Gook, this is not right.

24
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,390
Noona, what's wrong?

25
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,470
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,910
I have something urgent.

27
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,290
I have to go first.

28
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,380
Noona.

29
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:26,010
I think CEO Anna can't accept me as your girlfriend.

30
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,680
That's not it.

31
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,600
I think she's in shock because it was unexpected.

32
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,770
I should have told her in advance before introducing you.

33
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,160
It's my mistake. Don't worry.

34
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,830
Young Gook, please see me after Ms. Park leaves.
[Ji Young Noona]

35
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:03,510
Noona, you made me startled in front of Ms. Park earlier.

36
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:11,210
I thought you would be happy and congratulate me like the time I introduced Jenny's mom to you.

37
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,330
Why did you do that?

38
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:17,380
It's different for Ms. Park than it was for Jenny's mom.

39
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,780
What is the age gap between you and Ms. Park?

40
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,420
She's just 27 years old now.

41
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:29,450
You also have three children. It's not right for you to be with that young lady, that's why.

42
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:37,190
- Noona.
- I'm saying this because I care for you like a little brother.

43
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:42,170
You will be criticized if your relationship with Ms. Park becomes public. It'll be nothing but gossip.

44
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,640
She's a way younger woman.

45
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,070
Also, she's a live-in tutor for your children.

46
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:51,020
Young Gook. This isn't right.

47
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,770
Noona.

48
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,440
Is it that wrong for me to be with Ms. Park?

49
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,560
Even if everyone in the world criticized me, I thought you'd be on my side.

50
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,230
I thought you would trust and understand me.

51
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,420
That's why I wanted to introduce her to you first.

52
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:24,270
I had not imagined you would react this way, out of all people.

53
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,200
- Young Gook.
- Yes, as you said,

54
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,220
I am much older than Ms. Park and have three children.

55
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,740
So I've worried a lot.

56
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:42,840
After thinking about it a lot, we began to date seriously.

57
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:49,480
I'm speechless seeing you reacting like this.

58
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,560
I understand how you feel.

59
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,140
I will get going now.

60
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:08,160
What do I do?

61
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,260
Dan Dan, why are you dating a man with three children?

62
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,260
Here, Ms. Park.

63
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,840
Thank you.

64
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,820
Ms. Park.

65
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,090
About you and Chairman Lee seeing each other.

66
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,560
Who else knows about this other than me?

67
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,020
Does your father know?

68
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,610
No, only Madam knows.

69
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,080
No one else knows yet.

70
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,990
You were the first one we went to see.

71
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:58,610
What did Madam say?

72
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:08,010
See? She's opposed to it, right?

73
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,910
Ms. Park. This is not right.

74
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,770
You and Young Gook are not compatible no matter who looks at you.

75
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,080
It's because of you two's social status or age gap.

76
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,720
Young Gook also has three children.

77
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,470
And he was engaged to Chief Jo not long ago.

78
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,290
You are still very young with a long road ahead of you.

79
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:33,160
Why would you date someone like Young Gook?

80
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,460
Ms. Park, is it because of money?

81
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,430
Are you doing it for money?

82
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,260
CEO Anna.

83
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,140
It's not like that.

84
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,430
Without being aware,

85
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,520
I started liking him one day.

86
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,170
So please don't misunderstand it that way.

87
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:04,690
Chairman and I genuinely like each other.

88
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,940
Yes, Ms. Park. You can like someone.

89
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,870
But it can't be Young Gook.

90
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,180
You are still young and pretty.

91
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,620
You should meet someone your age and start a life together.

92
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,080
Why would you be with someone who has three children already?

93
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,080
How upset would your dad be when he finds out?

94
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,640
So please, Ms. Park.

95
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,660
Stop it right here.

96
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:40,650
I know you care about me a lot.

97
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:46,180
But I can't break up with Chairman.

98
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,150
I'm sorry. Excuse me first.

99
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,010
Ms. Park. Ms. Park!

100
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,930
Ms. Park!

101
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,240
Why are you meeting up with my Dan Dan?

102
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,400
You promised not to do this.

103
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,090
What did you tell my Dan Dan?

104
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,040
What did you say to make her cry like that?

105
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,920
- Did you...
- No, Soo Chul.

106
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,170
It's not what you think.

107
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,690
She is seeing an unideal man, so I'm trying to stop it.

108
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:25,370
I met up with her to change her mind.

109
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,740
Soo Chul. Our Dan Dan is in big trouble!

110
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,660
What nonsense are you saying?

111
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,890
She's seeing an unideal man?

112
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,650
Our Dan Dan is dating someone much older than her

113
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,860
who also has children.

114
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,950
What?

115
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,740
Is Dan Dan dating someone much older than her

116
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,100
who also has children?

117
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,640
What nonsense are you saying?

118
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,470
Do you think Dan Dan would do that?

119
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:01,340
Besides, even so, why do you interfere?

120
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:06,230
Don't try to use this crazy excuse to see my Dan Dan.

121
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,190
Got it?

122
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,900
Are you going to leave her like that?

123
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,600
What do I do with Dan Dan?

124
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:40,080
Our Dan Dan is dating someone much older than her

125
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,510
who also has children.

126
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,000
[My Dan Dan]

127
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:01,120
The person is not answering the call. After the beep...

128
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,750
Ms. Park.

129
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,900
Chairman. Why are you standing here?

130
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,620
Why weren't you answering the phone? I was worried.

131
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,700
Did something happen?

132
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,940
No, nothing.

133
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,490
I had my phone on silent.

134
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,840
I'm sorry, Chairman.

135
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,390
You don't have to be sorry.

136
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,110
It's good if nothing happened.

137
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,400
But Chairman.

138
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,360
Didn't you go to work? Why are you here?

139
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,520
I shouldn't have suggested meeting with CEO Anna.

140
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,310
I was looking for congratulations, but it turned out to be an uncomfortable meeting.

141
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,670
I thought you might feel terrible, so I came to make you feel better.

142
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,130
Let's play whack-a-mole and eat pork cutlets.

143
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,530
And ride a bike. What do you say?

144
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,290
Yes. I love it.

145
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:12,400
Then, maybe we can go around 100 times on the bike.

146
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,600
No, it would be too hard for you.

147
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,590
I'll settle for fifty rounds.

148
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:21,190
Ms. Park. Who do you think I am? Let's go for a hundred rounds.

149
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:24,880
- I will go around until you get sick of it.
- Okay.

150
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,510
Dan Dan.

151
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,440
Why are you two holding hands?

152
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,670
What did I just see?

153
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,210
Driver Park.

154
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,990
I mean, Father.

155
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,100
Hello.

156
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,920
Chairman, why are you calling me "Father?"

157
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,930
What are you saying?

158
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,840
Chairman, please explain.

159
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,530
Why were you holding my Dan Dan's hand?

160
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,800
- That is...
- Dad, talk with me.

161
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,590
- But..!
- I'll explain everything to you.

162
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:32,190
Dan Dan, why are you holding Chairman's hand?

163
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:37,190
I ran into CEO Anna earlier today.

164
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:41,590
She told me you are seeing someone unideal, so I was worried.

165
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,190
That's not the case, right?

166
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,950
What CEO Anna said was not true, right?

167
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:53,250
She said you were dating an older man with children.

168
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,260
That's not true. Right, Dan Dan?

169
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,510
Yes, Dad.

170
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,080
All of that is true.

171
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,710
Dan Dan.

172
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,520
Dad.

173
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,880
I like Chairman.

174
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,290
If he says okay,

175
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,730
I would like to marry him.

176
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,610
What did you say?

177
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,700
Dan Dan, what are you saying?

178
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,670
Are you crazy? Do you know how old he is?

179
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,070
And he has three children. Three!

180
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,740
None of that matters to me.

181
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,390
Dad. I really like Chairman.

182
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,410
Dan Dan.

183
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,770
Why are you doing this?

184
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:42,060
You are young and naive.

185
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,660
So you fell for him being nice to you.

186
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,940
But you have to come to your sense.

187
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,980
How can you fall for that so easily?

188
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,840
No.

189
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,990
This can't be it. You can't stay in that house.

190
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,030
Please quit right now and move back home with me.

191
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,350
I don't want to.

192
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,360
Dad, I liked Chairman first.

193
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,780
I'm the one who told my feelings to him first.

194
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:09,230
And now, we genuinely like each other.

195
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,800
So please do not speak of him in that way.

196
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,910
Dan Dan.

197
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,690
Because you've heard about us out of the blue,

198
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,840
you are acting out of surprise.

199
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:24,280
But please calm down. And let's talk again later.

200
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,630
I will go now.

201
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,450
Dan Dan, get yourself together.

202
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,020
Get yourself packed and come home with me.

203
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,550
No, Dad.

204
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,030
I'm not going. Also, I'm still working at the Chairman's house.

205
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,970
You can't act irresponsibly like this.

206
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:44,160
Please don't worry about me. I will take care of my business.

207
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,210
Dan Dan...

208
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,560
Dan Dan!

209
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:01,670
Why is she acting like that?

210
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:05,870
She's a smart and sensible girl. What happened?

211
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,010
What did Chairman Lee do to my daughter?

212
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,620
That bastard...

213
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,840
Chairman.

214
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,260
Ms. Park, are you okay?

215
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,320
What did your father say?

216
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,310
I guess he was shocked.

217
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:36,370
Yes. Because it happened so fast.

218
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,040
If I put myself in his shoes,

219
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,000
and if my Jenny told me she was dating someone like me,

220
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,510
I think I would have been shocked and worried like your father.

221
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:49,870
Chairman. We were prepared for things like this.

222
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,160
My dad reacted that way since he was a bit shocked.

223
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,940
But he has always been on my side.

224
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,050
I'm sure he will understand soon.

225
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:03,070
We should have told him first.

226
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,050
Ms. Park.

227
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,780
Since things happened this way, let's go tonight and formally meet your family.

228
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,420
I think that would be best.

229
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,230
Yes, Chairman.

230
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:20,010
Let's push it forward.

231
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,580
I'm home.

232
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,460
Yes, honey. You're home on time.

233
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,140
Noona's here, too. What's going on tonight?

234
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:38,240
Dan Dan called earlier to say she wanted to introduce someone to us.

235
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,410
It sounds like a boyfriend.

236
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,940
What?

237
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,690
- Is Dan Dan bringing someone to introduce?
- Yes.

238
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,930
Why are you so surprised?

239
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,730
We are home.

240
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,900
- Dan Dan.
- Welcome, Dan Dan.

241
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,480
Didn't you say you were bringing someone?

242
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,540
Oh, my goodness.

243
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:04,570
Hello.

244
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:09,270
What are you doing here, Chairman Lee?

245
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:14,410
How did you come together with our Dan Dan?

246
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,010
Chairman Lee, let's go outside.

247
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,590
- Let's talk outside.
- Dad.

248
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,990
Chairman and I,

249
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:24,900
we are here to meet my family formally.

250
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,820
Hello, I'm Lee Young Gook.

251
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:36,190
I'm dating Ms. Park, so I've come to introduce myself formally.

252
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:42,530
Are you saying you want to date formally with our Dan Dan?

253
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,420
Yes, Grandma.

254
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,140
Dad.

255
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,680
Mom.

256
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,680
Aunt.

257
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,230
I am in a relationship with Chairman.

258
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:56,090
Chairman is...

259
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,600
my boyfriend.

260
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,280
Oh, my...

261
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,980
It's a humble place, but please have a seat first.

262
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,920
Why would he sit down?

263
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,780
Chairman, let's go outside.

264
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,970
Let's have a talk.

265
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:24,100
I will come back after seeing Father.

266
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:30,060
Dad is going overboard.

267
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:37,680
So that Chairman is Dan Dan's boyfriend?

268
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,710
Oh my, Daebak!

269
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:43,190
What's going on here?

270
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,500
How can this happen?

271
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,710
Chairman. What are you doing with our young Dan Dan?

272
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,700
What did you say?

273
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,730
You are doing what formally with Dan Dan?

274
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,130
How can things like this happen?

275
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:11,200
I've thought about it a lot before making this decision with Ms. Park.

276
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,910
I am not seeing her casually.

277
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,520
We are seeing each other seriously, Father.

278
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,490
Please don't call me father!

279
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,510
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

280
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:23,250
Even if Dan Dan liked you out of immaturity,

281
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,400
you should have said no and talked reason into her.

282
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,690
You can't do this, Chairman.

283
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,450
I can never approve of this.

284
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,290
Please leave right now.

285
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,730
And please do not call Dan Dan again.

286
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,750
Dad, how can you be this way when he's here to introduce himself formally?

287
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,240
You go back inside, right now.

288
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,140
Aren't you going overboard?

289
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,110
- Ms. Park.
- I won't talk to you anymore, Dad.

290
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,050
I will do whatever I want.

291
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,520
Chairman, let's go.

292
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,690
Let's go, hurry.

293
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,620
Dan Dan! Park Dan Dan!

294
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,670
Ah, that girl...

295
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:07,560
I'm going to the store. I didn't finish closing everything.

296
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,220
I will go with Dae Beom.

297
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,530
Yes, get going then.

298
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,050
But what did just happen?

299
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,950
Chairman Lee is seeing Dan Dan.

300
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:25,540
I have never heard of anything this shocking in years.

301
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,040
I know. This is daebak shocking.

302
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,700
But, listening to what Chairman Lee was saying,

303
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,910
he said he was dating our Dan Dan seriously.

304
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,640
Does that mean he's going to marry her?

305
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,780
Oh my, does that mean Dan Dan will be madam of the FT Group?

306
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,680
Oh, my!

307
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,710
Honey, are you going to approve this?

308
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:56,680
Speak sensibly. Are you out of your mind!

309
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,900
Why are you shouting like that?

310
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,230
He's 14 years older than Dan Dan and has three children. Three!

311
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,360
Also, he was engaged to a different woman recently!

312
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,890
What kind of nonsense is that?

313
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,910
Yes, that's true.

314
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:17,490
Even though Chairman Lee is good and kind,

315
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:20,530
he's not the best partner from the parents' point of view.

316
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:25,270
Dan Dan is a young lady who has not bloomed yet.

317
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:31,240
It's not right for her to be with a widower with three children.

318
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,600
That's right.

319
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,030
But still, he's the Chairman of the FT Group.

320
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:40,300
He looks good as a young man. Even with three children, he's capable.

321
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,230
Even if it's not Dan Dan, he could find a young woman with no previous marriages.

322
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:49,680
Yes, that's right. There are lots of women wanting Chairman Lee still.

323
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:54,060
I'm sure. And for them to come to meet the family formally,

324
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:59,430
it sounds like they are in a serious relationship. What should we do?

325
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:03,810
Can't you stop? This won't happen.

326
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:07,050
It's late, Noona. Please go home now.

327
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,170
Ah, honestly.

328
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,710
I'm sorry, Chairman.

329
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,860
You must be very upset.

330
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,630
Because my dad was too harsh.

331
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:37,960
No. It wasn't as bad as I imagined.

332
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:43,460
Ms. Park. This is just the start for us.

333
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,440
Yes.

334
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,260
We have barely begun.

335
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:57,800
There are lots of mountains for us to climb yet.

336
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:05,170
Yes. After this mountain, there will be another to climb.

337
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:13,710
Ms. Park. Let's tell Jenny after we get your father's permission.

338
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:17,570
Yes. I think that would be best.

339
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,570
Chairman, one moment. Stop the car, please.

340
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,140
Why?

341
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,480
Since we are not feeling so good, let's unwind our bodies.

342
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,320
What? What do you want to unwind?

343
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,240
Here you go!

344
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,990
Nice.

345
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,750
Are you going to be like this, Chairman? How can you never let me win?

346
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:07,040
The world of competition is ruthless. How can I let you win?

347
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,870
When you were 22 years old, you won with all your might against Se Jong with the arcade game, too.

348
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:14,950
You are really mean.

349
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,550
- Me?
- Yes!

350
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:22,030
I could really tease you when you get your memory back from that time.

351
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:26,850
You used to call me, "Ms. Park Noona, Ms. Park Noona."

352
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:32,450
Since you won against me playing ruthlessly, call me "Ms. Park Noona" just once.

353
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,420
I think I will feel better after that.

354
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,950
Ms. Park. Why are you saying such nonsense?

355
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:43,590
I know you are angry, but don't talk nonsense.

356
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:47,010
I'm frustrated because your memory hasn't all come back.

357
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:50,520
You really called me Ms. Park Noona.

358
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,090
Okay, okay. I will go easy on you. So let's go.

359
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,710
No, thanks. I don't want to play.

360
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:01,850
I really don't want to play it anymore.

361
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,890
Are you really going to be like this? How can you never go easy on me?

362
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:12,120
Okay, okay. I will really go easy on you this time. I will play with my left hand.

363
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,660
I don't want the left hand. Play with your foot.

364
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,590
Take that!

365
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:21,750
Hurry, play with your foot.

366
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:29,860
I feel like I can fly after doing something physical. Doesn't it feel nice?

367
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:33,000
Yes, I agree.

368
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,640
Chairman.

369
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,580
No matter what my dad says and how much he opposes us,

370
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:44,430
please don't change your mind. Okay?

371
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,600
I won't change my mind.

372
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,620
Let's get through this together.

373
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:03,660
Se Chan wants to go to the strawberry farm tomorrow. Are you coming, too?

374
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:07,440
Yes, let's go together. We won't get a chance to go all together after the school vacation is over.

375
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,600
Let's go to places together for the remainder of the break.

376
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,400
I'm getting excited more than kids. Strawberries picked from the farm will be delicious.

377
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,540
The children will love it too.

378
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,190
Let's go.

379
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:29,300
Let's play again next time. I can win that time, seriously!

380
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,410
You were just lucky.

381
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,580
The drink tastes bitter today.

382
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,040
Why does it taste so bad?

383
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,990
Is something going on with you these days?

384
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,440
Nothing's going on.

385
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,750
Why don't you drink with me?

386
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,940
Okay, after I'm done cleaning.

387
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,500
Aigoo.

388
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,420
We are closed--

389
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:09,250
Hello.

390
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,560
Boss!

391
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:18,380
Can I have one 500cc beer and spicy chicken?

392
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,610
We are closed for the day.

393
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:27,160
But I came all the way from Choengdam-dong

394
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,900
to eat the chicken from this restaurant.

395
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,760
Can't I even have a chicken leg?

396
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,050
I will leave right after a glass of beer and one chicken.

397
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:42,070
Please? Boss...

398
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,650
Dae Beom.

399
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:51,730
She wants to eat our chicken. Why don't you just make one for her?

400
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:54,330
I will walk around the neighborhood and go home.

401
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:59,850
Where did the jokbal restaurant's Hyungnims go?

402
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:04,160
Boss! Please bring me the beer first!

403
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,820
I am thirsty.

404
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,270
That couple is full of drama.

405
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:17,580
Why does that young lady like Mr. Park's son so much?

406
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,860
He's good-looking and manly.

407
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:25,010
It must be nice to be young.

408
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:28,560
I wish someone would follow me around like that.

409
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:33,130
Who would do that to you?

410
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:39,700
But Hyung, our neighborhood hasn't been quiet since they moved in.

411
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,890
It's more fun than a tv show.

412
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:48,240
Don't be pathetic. Quit watching other people dating.

413
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,750
Go and boil some pig feet. That's my wish!

414
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:05,420
When could I love like that?

415
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,830
Let's go boil some pig feet.

416
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:17,550
Ah, it's really refreshing.

417
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:29,830
It's really delicious! This is it.

418
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,680
Why are you doing this, Lee Se Ryun?

419
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:38,950
Dae Beom. I got used to the chicken here.

420
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:42,600
I can't get the taste from any other chicken place.

421
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:47,030
That's why I'm here. I have no other intention.

422
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:50,840
I came for the chicken.

423
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,780
Okay. Then eat and go.

424
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:58,080
It's delicious.

425
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:05,410
Why is this so delicious?

426
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:11,110
Is it because Dae Beom fried it deliciously for me?

427
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:14,500
It's so good!

428
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,840
Ah, it's delicious.

429
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:04,580
Ajussi, please follow that taxi that just left from here.

430
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:02,530
How can he be with my young daughter?

431
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,330
That bastard...

432
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,000
Here is your lunchbox with Sikhye and coffee.

433
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,080
Thank you.

434
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,620
Ms. Park, please go first. I left my phone behind.

435
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,200
Okay.

436
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,470
- Children, let's go.
- Yes.

437
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:34,570
Bye-bye.

438
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:38,220
Have fun.

439
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,920
Where are they going now?

440
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,390
They are all going to a strawberry farm, including Chairman.

441
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:49,540
What? Young Gook and that Ms. Park wench all together?

442
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:53,390
Hey! Chairman Lee, please come see me.

443
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,400
What are you doing with the children?

444
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,770
Are you even using the children for your love affair with that vixen Ms. Park?

445
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,840
Please don't interfere with my business.

446
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,360
I will get going.

447
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,700
Your father in heaven will be wailing!

448
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,840
How can you pick a girl from the parasite family out of all the women?

449
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,620
Ah, really.

450
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,070
That punk...

451
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,640
Mrs. Yeoju.

452
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:20,320
About that vixen and Young Gook dating.

453
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,780
Did you really not know about it?

454
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,910
No, I didn't even dream of it.

455
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:28,300
But does it make sense?

456
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:32,680
How can he have a love affair with a young girl who works in his house?

457
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,570
Is our family going to get destroyed?

458
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:38,880
I mean, how can Young Gook go completely crazy like that?

459
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,930
Chairman is one thing, but I'm worried for Ms. Park too.

460
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:45,960
He's way older than her and has three children. How can she fall for him?

461
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,450
I had no idea there was that side of her in Ms. Park.

462
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:51,700
I only thought of her as someone very pure.

463
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,760
Pure, my foot. All of the pureness on earth froze to death.

464
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,580
Like the old saying, a coy cat climbs the stove first.

465
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,630
She's very bold, cunning, and not ordinary.

466
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:04,290
She planned this from the beginning for Young Gook's money.

467
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:07,460
I mean, think if Young Gook was a widower with no money.

468
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,930
Would a young girl even look at an older guy

469
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:13,860
with three children?

470
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,380
Hey, Chief Kim.

471
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:23,530
Are you writing down what I'm saying to snitch it to Chairman Lee? You are going to go down if you keep doing so!

472
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:27,320
Chief Kim, I didn't say anything!

473
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,480
Oh, my! Mrs. Yeoju!

474
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,180
Chief Kim is such a treacherous informer!

475
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,910
It's infuriating. Call Driver Kang to get ready.

476
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,640
It's infuriating! You! Treacherous informer!

477
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,280
Mom, is that true?

478
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,520
Yes! I'm still steamed.

479
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,560
Se Ryun, please go see your brother and talk him out of it.

480
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,210
Does this make sense?

481
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:01,000
How can he be with that country bumpkin?

482
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,860
Mom, are you really sure that he's dating Ms. Park?

483
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,440
I'm certain!

484
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,050
He said with his mouth that he likes Ms. Park.

485
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:12,020
So please meet with your brother.

486
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:15,570
And stop him. My words don't even get registered.

487
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,240
How could something like this happen?

488
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,730
Our family will collapse at this rate.

489
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:22,740
What if he marries that girl?

490
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,320
That would be the end for us.

491
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:30,280
Do I have to bow down to that ridiculous girl to get allowances?

492
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,220
I doubt that would happen.

493
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,780
Hey, Lee Se Ryun, this is all because of you.

494
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,220
If you hadn't given up your company shares,

495
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,970
I wouldn't care who he marries!

496
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:46,960
But to think I have to live bowing down to her, I would rather die.

497
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,080
Do you understand what you've done to me now?

498
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,070
Do you get it now?

499
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,540
Good grief.

500
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,990
It makes no sense.

501
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,420
Yes, hello?

502
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,540
Yes, this is Bong Joon Oh.

503
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:14,170
Yes, really?

504
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:17,340
Yes! I can come.

505
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,510
Yes, thank you!

506
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,270
Yes, thank you!

507
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,970
What is it? Who called you?

508
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:28,020
Mi Rim.

509
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,700
I think heaven was impressed.

510
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,880
I had an audition for a high school student.

511
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,700
And they just called me.

512
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,050
He asked me if I could film today, so I said yes!

513
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:43,640
Really? Joon Oh, that's so great!

514
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:48,530
Mi Rim. I'm too excited and nervous.

515
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,510
You will come with me, right?

516
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,620
Of course.

517
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,060
Go!

518
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,370
- Hey!
- Run!

519
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,910
Run! Run!

520
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:05,780
Hey, stop!

521
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,300
Hey, run!

522
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,590
Jump over! Come on!

523
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:13,040
Hey, you!

524
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,860
Stop there!

525
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,640
Okay! Good!

526
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,600
Thank you!

527
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,540
Good job today.

528
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,730
- Good job!
- Good work.

529
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:30,120
Okay, all right.

530
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,720
All right.

531
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,310
Okay.

532
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:36,450
Joon Oh. How was it? Did you do well?

533
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,970
Yes. The director said, okay and good, in one go.

534
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:42,250
Is that true?

535
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,490
Yes, really.

536
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:47,580
Mi Rim. I'm so happy and having fun right now.

537
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:50,160
I've never done anything this fun and happy in my whole life.

538
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,790
Really? Did you have that much fun when you didn't have any lines?

539
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:56,400
Yes, it's fun. It's so exciting.

540
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,100
You did great. Drink this.

541
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,210
- Thank you.
- Good job!

542
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:04,560
- Should we go now?
- Yes, to where?

543
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,610
- Over there.
- To there?

544
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:14,280
Se Jong, slow down. You might get hurt.

545
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,800
Wow, a strawberry.

546
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,490
Wow, it's very ripe.

547
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:24,190
- Awesome!
- This is mine, right?

548
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,970
- I got the longest one!
- Your's still tiny.

549
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:29,560
Mine is tall.

550
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,440
It's delicious.

551
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,700
Se Jong.

552
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:43,860
- I want to choose it!
- I'll pick my own too.

553
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,910
- Thank you.
- Wow!

554
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:54,130
That looks delicious.

555
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,820
Why don't you try it?

556
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,210
Hyung, Ah.

557
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,950
What is that?

558
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:08,260
Chairman.

559
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,180
It's good, right?

560
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:19,440
It's a beautiful couple.

561
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,910
Dad.

562
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:25,260
What are you doing?

563
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,280
This is a gift for you, Noona.

564
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,330
I don't need it. Let's go.

565
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:38,480
Noona almost caught you.

566
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,780
Please be careful. Okay?

567
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,860
Fighting!

568
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:51,290
You fed me first.

569
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:55,740
- Dad!
- It's good.

570
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:00,440
This is a daebak big strawberry. Dad, ah!

571
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,530
Ah!

572
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:11,300
It's so good. This one's for you.

573
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,740
Is it good?

574
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,150
Yes, it's daebak delicious.

575
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,460
Ms. Park.

576
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,790
Isn't it good?

577
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:24,390
Please eat this, Dad.

578
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,830
- It's really sweet.
- Let's pick some more.

579
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,720
Okay.

580
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:39,620
♫ Strangely, ♫

581
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,900
♫  I'm drawn to you ♫

582
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,470
You have to be careful.

583
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,520
Okay.

584
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,640
Se Chan, can you move a bit?

585
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,100
It's hot, okay?

586
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,270
Stir it like this.

587
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:03,790
♫ Woo, you are always my love ♫

588
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:09,190
♫ I feel love, only you ♫

589
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:11,240
Do you want to try stirring, Se Jong?

590
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,500
♫ It is breezy wind ♫

591
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:19,490
It really feels good!

592
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:23,050
It looks delicious.

593
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,280
♫ You're mysterious like deep ocean ♫

594
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,640
Be careful since it's hot.

595
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,860
Is it good?

596
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,020
Yes.

597
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:36,560
♫ You come to me like a child sometimes ♫

598
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,300
- It's hot.
- Jam!

599
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,430
Hey.

600
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:46,290
You, come here!

601
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:48,440
- Hey, be careful! Careful!
- You!

602
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,560
- You'll hurt yourselves. Be careful.
- Come here!

603
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,550
You, rascal.

604
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:05,630
Hey.

605
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:09,130
♫ I feel love, only you ♫

606
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:12,740

00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,950
♫ It is breezy wind ♫

608
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:17,050
I'll get it on you, too.

609
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:20,070
♫  Woo, you are my love  ♫

610
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,540
One, two, three.

611
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,460
[Madam]

612
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,850
Why isn't she saying anything,

613
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:38,310
even after I told her about what's going on between Chairman and Ms. Park?

614
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:44,180
Right. It's not like I'm not allowed to go there.

615
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:47,010
Sarah! Hey.

616
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:48,250
Are you going somewhere?

617
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:50,620
I have something to take care of.

618
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,430
If it isn't something important,

619
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:54,650
what do you say you go shopping with me instead?

620
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:57,650
Let's switch up the mood. We can eat out too!

621
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:58,760
Let's go later.

622
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,260
Hey, come on!

623
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:04,270
Mom, your face looks better now.

624
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:07,000
Did you go to the hospital?

625
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,090
I slept so well without even dreaming.

626
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:14,210
Good sleep is truly the best for people.

627
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:16,930
I'm glad. I'll be back.

628
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:19,850
Hey, Sarah...

629
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:24,390
That girl. When does she plan to get over it?

630
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:26,950
Gosh, I'm so upset.

631
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:29,570
Forget about shopping or whatever.

632
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:31,670
My goodness.

633
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:34,600
Oh, Chief Jo! It's been so long.

634
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,940
Seeing you is making me tear up.

635
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,740
Me, too.

636
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:43,810
You have no idea how lonely I've been in this home since you left.

637
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:47,650
Chief Kim, that woman is a treacherous, go-getting informant of Chairman Lee's!

638
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:52,220
She went straight away to Chairman Lee to tattle on me just because I pulled Ms. Park's hair out a little.

639
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:55,320
I really can't live like this.

640
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,600
But Chairman and Ms. Park...

641
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,640
Are you certain about their relationship?

642
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,160
Yes!

643
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:07,410
They went out with the kids today too. They're so brazen about it now!

644
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:09,420
When I said something about it,

645
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,810
he said to mind my own business.

646
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:14,530
Gosh, how do I live like this? Tell me, how?

647
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:16,860
All of Se Ryun's shares have been passed over to Young Gook.

648
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:20,430
I seriously can't live like this! How am I going to live through this?

649
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:24,030
I'm really going crazy. I think I'm going to cry.

650
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:25,790
I don't know how to live on anymore.

651
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:29,180
After kicking me out, how could Chairman do this?

652
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,390
How could he do this?

653
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:35,330
- How...
- I'm so upset.

654
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:03,170
Chief Jo?

655
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:06,560
What are you doing here?

656
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:09,140
I dropped off Se Jong's birthday present,

657
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,820
and it's been a while since I came, so I took a look around the kids' bedrooms.

658
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:15,980
I wanted to see if there were any sudden changes or if something was missing.

659
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,870
But why would you do that, Chief Jo?

660
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:19,730
I'm clearly here.

661
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:22,550
Also, you're a visitor now, Chief Jo.

662
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:24,640
Visitor.

663
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:29,880
Oh my, Chief Kim.

664
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,240
I'm Jo Sarah.

665
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,870
I was here for over five years.

666
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:38,240
I just looked around the kids' bedrooms out of my best interest.

667
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,900
Why are you making such a big deal out of this?

668
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:48,300
Are you saying you did the right thing then, Chief Jo?

669
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,310
Don't ever do this again.

670
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:52,240
If you cross the line one more time,

671
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,510
I'm going to report it to Chairman.

672
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:55,840
Head downstairs, please.

673
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,790
Hurry.

674
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:14,800
My poor, Se Jong.

675
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,620
I can't even be by Se Jong's side anymore?

676
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:24,410
I just want to be by my Se Jong's side, at least.

677
00:46:58,570 --> 00:46:59,880
Who is it?

678
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,740
Hi, I'm Ms. Jung, the flower shop owner.

679
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,800
When I was working there,

680
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,660
I bought the flowers and arranged them myself.

681
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:13,170
Did they hire a florist now?

You already have all the required licenses.

I love it, Ms. Jo Sarah.

It looked like you offer in-person services too.

I'll take care of that from now on.

I really got over all my feelings for you.

Yes.

I can't get a hold of her.

715
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:18,290
Ms. Park went out with the kids with Chairman.

716
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:19,720
What did you say?

717
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,730
Did they go out?

718
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:25,150
All right.

Are they even taking the kids out together now?

720

What do I do?

Dan Dan took the kids out together with Chairman Lee.

724
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:55,920
Are you just going to sit back and let Dan Dan date Chairman Lee?

725
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,240
Why are you worrying about that?

726
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,920
Dan Dan is my daughter.

727
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,000
I will take care of it myself. You just mind your own business.

728
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,510
How can I not worry about this?

729
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:08,660
You told me to back off, but what are you doing?

730
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,270
It's going to be delicious!

731
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:35,300
I'll do it for you.

732
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,900
You have to wash your hands before you eat the strawberries.

733

- I'll get you out, Se Jong.
- Okay.

734
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:42,000
- We made so much strawberry jam too!
- Yes, we did!

735
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,710
- We have arrived.
- It was super delicious.

736
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:45,680
- Let's go, let's go!
- The strawberries were so good, right?

737
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,960
- Yes.
- Park Dan Dan!

I'll be taking Dan Dan.

What's wrong, Dad?

742
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:10,720
Just go without a word. Or else I'm going to get mad here.

- Ms. Park!
- Ms. Park!

744
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:18,560
Dad, why is Driver Park acting like that?

745
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:22,840
Something must have happened at Ms. Park's home.

746
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:28,710
Dad. Ms. Park's dad is so scary.

747
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,650
It's all right.

748
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:36,550
Jenny and Se Chan. Let's go in.

749
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:47,210
Are you okay, Ms. Park?

750
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:49,010
You went home, right?

751
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:51,580
Should I go pick you up now?

752
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:54,960
Ms. Park. Contact me if you need my help.

753
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,600
I'll be waiting.

754
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,210
We have a new mission, Se Jong.

755
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:18,440
Mission? What is that?

756
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,440
It means we have a job to do.

757
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,090
A crisis has come up between our dad and Ms. Park's relationship.

758
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:27,330
Crisis?

759
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:30,510
Hyung... why did something like that happen?

760
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:32,530
They love each other.

761
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:36,380
Suffering is bound to follow after real love.

762
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:40,350
So we have to help our dad and Ms. Park. Got it?

763
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:41,830
Yes.

764
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:44,440
- We can do it!
- We can do it.

765
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:49,740
Let go of this, Dad! I said, let go!

766
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,010
Oh, what is this sound?

767
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:54,330
- It sounds like Dan Dan.
- What?

768
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,250
Let go of me first and then talk. Let go!

769
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:01,280
Talking doesn't work with you!

770
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,910
Why didn't you listen to me in the first place? Give it to me.

771
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:06,890
Come here.

772
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:09,730
Get in there!

773
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:11,800
Dad! Open the door!

774
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,490
Why in the world are you doing this, Dad?

775
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:16,260
Mom! Grandma! Please open the door for me!

776
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:19,340
Aigoo, Son-in-law Park. What are you doing?

777
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:22,090
What's wrong with you, Honey? Why are you locking Dan Dan in the room?

778
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:24,660
Gosh, are you crazy?

779
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:28,560
Don't open the door for her. Stay in Mother-in-law's room in the meanwhile.

780
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,970
Gosh, Honey.

781
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:33,720
Dad!! Please open the door for me!

782
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:37,850
Dad. Do you think you do this will change my mind?

783
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:40,250
I've liked the Chairman since a long time ago.

784
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:43,470
Why do you have a problem with me liking him? Why are you acting like this?

785
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:47,750
Is this the Joseon era, Honey? How could you do this?

786
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:50,470
Locking your child in a room is not the solution.

787
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:53,870
Seriously. You have to make her understand.

788
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:56,100
It's not something you can do with force.

789
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,330
She is not listening to me!

790
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:01,120
How can I just let her do whatever?

791
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,720
She's always going out with that punk and the kids together.

792
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,650
How can I just sit back and watch?

793
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:09,430
Don't open the door for Dan Dan.

794
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:12,090
Don't you open it either, all right?

795
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:16,420
What about the bathroom? The room doesn't have a bathroom, and you're just going to lock her in there?

796
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:21,320
Don't worry about that! That's not the problem right now.

797
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:28,450
Dan Dan! You can't take a step out of this room until you break up with Chairman Lee. Got it?

798
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,880
Seriously, how could you do this, Dad?

799
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,120
What's wrong with me liking the Chairman?

800
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:37,800
He's really a good man.

801
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:42,540
Mom? Grandma? Please open the door for me.

802
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:46,850
At least give me my phone, Dad. Please?

803
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:48,730
At least give me my phone!

804
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:51,190
No!

805
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:53,770
That's never going to happen until you say you'll break up with Chairman Lee.

806
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:58,420
Do you think I'm going to break up with him by you doing this, Dad?

807
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,220
I'm never going to break up with him.

808
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:03,320
I would rather die than break up with him!

809
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:06,310
Do you know how hard we fought for our love?

810
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:10,170
I endured a lot of heartaches for us to like each other.

811
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:13,280
How could you do this after all the pain we went through to be together?

812
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,930
You just shut your mouth!

813
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,780
Who is that?

814
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:53,060
Who is it?

815
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:55,650
It's me, Lee Young Gook.

816
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:06,320
Chairman? Hello.

817
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:09,710
Honey, the Chairman is here.

818
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:16,580
Why did you come here?

819
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:20,840
I have something to tell you. Please let me come in for a bit.

820
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:26,650
Chairman? Is it you?

821
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:34,390
I'm not going to hear anything out unless it's about the two of you breaking up.

822
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:36,970
Chairman! I'm here, Chairman!

823
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:40,110
Do not change your mind whatever my dad says!

824
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:42,590
No matter what!

825
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:53,790
Father. We went through a lot to find out our feelings for one another.

826
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:57,890
We thought about it and pondered on it a lot before we decided to go out.

827
00:57:57,890 --> 00:58:03,180
Please trust us once and give us a chance.

828
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:06,730
Dad! This wasn't an easy decision for us.

829
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:09,210
Please allow us to date.

830
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:11,850
Be quiet, Dan Dan!

831
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:17,480
I don't want to hear that stuff, Chairman.

832
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:20,090
No means no.

833
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:21,380
Go home, please.

834
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:24,460
Dad! Please allow us to date!

835
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:27,470
I really won't disappoint you, Dad.

836
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:31,550
So please! Please allow us to date, Dad!

837
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:34,160
I said, no!

838
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:39,550
What parent on this earth will have their daughter marry an older man with a bunch of kids?

839
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:41,600
Who would allow this in their right mind?

840
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:45,590
Dad! Don't say stuff like that to the Chairman!

841
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:47,740
I really love him!

842
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:50,790
I love the kids too!

843
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,690
Please go back. I beg you.

844
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,960
I'm sorry.

845
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:02,590
I'll be back next time.

846
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:05,810
No. Don't come.

847
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:10,630
Also, don't think you'll ever see Dan Dan again.

848
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:14,070
Send over Dan Dan's stuff tomorrow.

849
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:16,270
And please leave, now.

850
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:24,040
What are you doing? Hurry up and go.

851
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:28,020
I'll get going then.

852
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:31,820
Wait for me a little, Chairman.

853
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:34,120
I promise I'll go back, Chairman.

854
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,940
You can't waver no matter what, Chairman.

855
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:39,850
You didn't forget the promise you made me, did you? You got it, right?

856
00:59:39,850 --> 00:59:42,350
You, be quiet!

857
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:48,020
You went too far, Dad! How could you do this?

858
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:50,230
How could you do this to Chairman?

859
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:53,570
Open the door, Dad!

860
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:12,350
Dad... Open the door!

861
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:17,210
Please open the door for me, Dad.

862
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:51,350
Son-in-law Park?

863
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:55,210
Even if we keep her locked up, shouldn't we feed her at least?

864
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:57,740
You should feed her first and then scold--

865
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:01,020
No. Don't give her food.

866
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:03,670
She will say she'll break up if she's hungry.

867
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:05,580
Until she says she's going to break up,

868
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:08,140
don't ever give her food!

869
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:15,520
Is anyone home?

870
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:19,310
What is that sound? It sounded like young kids.

871
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,280
I'm sorry to bother you so early in the morning.

872
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,470
Hello, Driver Park.

873
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:38,680
- Hello.
- Oh, dear.

874
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:41,420
What brings you here this morning?

875
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:44,930
We came because we missed Ms. Park.

876
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,440
Se Chan! Se Jong!

877
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,970
- Ms. Park!
- Ms. Park!

878
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:55,880
Why is this door locked?

879
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,950
Why won't the door open?

880
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:01,240
Don't tell me you locked Ms. Park in so she can't get out?

881
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:04,030
- Ms. Park!
- Ms. Park!!

882
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:07,400
Let Ms. Park out, please!

883
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,970
- Let her out, please!
- Ms. Park.

884
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:12,640
Se Jong. Don't cry.

885
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:13,600
Ms. Park!

886
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,910
Don't cry, Se Jong.

887
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:20,080
Driver Park! No matter how angry you are, doing this is a violation of human rights!

888
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:24,510
How could you lock her up like a prison?

889
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:29,870
I would rather be punished with Ms. Park then!

890
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:32,980
Hurry up and lock me in with Ms. Park!

891
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:34,720
- Me, too!
- Ms. Park...

892
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:39,310
I want to be locked with my brother and Ms. Park too!

893
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:42,480
- Ms. Park!
- Ms. Park!!

894
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,350
Se Jong... Don't say so.

895
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:51,190
Ms. Park...

896
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:54,020
- Ms. Park!!
- Ms. Park.

897
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:57,580
Please let Ms. Park out!

898
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:01,060
- Ms. Park.
- Please let her out.

899
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:05,020
- I'll take you home, Se Chan and Se Jong. Let's go.
- Ms. Park.

900
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:07,530
- No!
- No!

901
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:15,370
- Ms. Park!
- Ms. Park...

902
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:24,510
- Ms. Park!
- Please open the door.

903
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:27,130
- Ms. Park!
- Ms. Park...

904
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:35,730
Ms. Park!

905
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:39,580
- Ms. Park.
- Ms. Park!

906
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:41,790
- Ms. Park!
- Ms. Park!

907
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:43,790
- Ms. Park!
- Ms. Park!

908
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:47,320
- Ms. Park!
- Ms. Park!!!

909
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:51,230
[Fantom]

910
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:11,570
Yes, this is Lee Young Gook.

911
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:16,860
Chairman. Se Chan and Se Jong are at my house right now.

912
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:20,000
Pardon? My Se Chan and Se Jong?

913
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,050
Yes! Are you going to use your kids now?

914
01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:29,040
There's no use in you doing this. Come and take your kids right now!

915
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:33,210
Yes, I'm sorry. I'll go right now.

916
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:36,900
- Ms. Park!
- Ms. Park!

917
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:41,050
- Ms. Park!
- Ms. Park!

918
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:44,260
Ms. Park!

919
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:46,550
Ms. Park!!

920
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:49,750
Please open the door!

921
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:52,530
Se Chan, Se Jong. Let's go home.

922
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:57,050
No! I'm not going home! I'm going to stay with Ms. Park!

923
01:04:57,050 --> 01:05:00,100
I don't want to go either!

924
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:05,250
- Ms. Park!
- Listen to your dad, Se Chan and Se Jong.

925
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:10,770
- No!
- Ms. Park.

926
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:13,530
- No!
- Come on out, Lee Se Chan.

927
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:15,680
Hurry!!

928
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:20,390
- No!
- Come on out!

929
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:23,680
Dad!!

930
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,240
Oh, gosh.

931
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:29,890
It was hectic with both of them crying.

932
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:31,710
- Goodness.
- Seriously.

933
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:34,950
What in the world is this?

934
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:05,410
Lee Se Chan. Why did you get involved with what's between adults?

935
01:06:05,410 --> 01:06:08,940
I told you I was going to deal with it myself.

936
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:11,830
Also, why are you taking taxis with Se Jong? It's dangerous.

937
01:06:11,830 --> 01:06:14,380
What if something happens?

938
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:18,030
Don't scold him, Dad.

939
01:06:18,030 --> 01:06:21,070
I said I'll come with him.

940
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:26,320
How could you do nothing when Ms. Park is locked up like that, Dad?

941
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:29,110
Ms. Park wants to go with us,

942
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:32,880
and she misses us! Why are you doing nothing?

943
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:37,100
Shouldn't you bring her with us even if you have to break down the door?

944
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:41,220
Why are you making Dad sad, Hyung?

945
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:46,110
You can't break down other people's doors.

946
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:00,310
Grandma! Grandma!

947
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:03,170
I want to use the bathroom!

948
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:07,590
You already went to the bathroom 30 minutes ago while your dad was here.

949
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:09,440
But you're telling me you need to go again?

950
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:13,510
I'll get kicked out, too, if you run away.

951
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:17,830
Don't bother playing cheap tricks! No means no!

952
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:22,910
It's r-really urgent, Grandma!

953
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:24,930
Really?

954
01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:28,070
I'm telling you, yes!

955
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:29,940
You better promise me then.

956
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:33,500
You're really just going to use the bathroom, okay?

957
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,590
Yes!

958
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,060
It's urgent. Very urgent.

959
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:54,000
- I'm sorry, Grandma!
- W-what?

960
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,680
Dan Dan! Hey! Dan Dan!!

961
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,890
Thank you!

962
01:07:58,890 --> 01:08:00,260
Thank you for the food!

963
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:02,250
Thank you for coming!

964
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:03,910
Goodbye.

965
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:06,090
Come back next time!

966
01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:11,320
I don't know if it's because of the crazy morning with the Chairman and kids,

967
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:14,890
we just opened, but I'm exhausted already.

968
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,260
Yes, Mom?

969
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:26,000
What did you say? Dan Dan ran away?

970
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,800
- What?
- Oh, gosh. What do we do, Honey?

971
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,280
Dan Dan ran away.

972
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:30,540
When?

973
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:33,210
Just now, a moment ago.

974
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:39,580
Honey! What do we do?

975
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,770
Dan Dan! Dan Dan!

976
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:14,410
Dan Dan! Stay there, Dan Dan!

977
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:19,070
Dan Dan!

978
01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:21,240
Dan Dan!

979
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:44,600
Dad?

980
01:09:46,150 --> 01:09:53,820
♫ Why do you run away, love, like a shy child ♫

981
01:09:53,820 --> 01:10:00,430
♫ In case I lose it, I hold it tight ♫

982
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:07,760
♫ But love always runs away, chased by longing ♫

983
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:14,560
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

984
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:22,570
♫ I have to abandon the longing and the grieves ♫

985
01:10:22,570 --> 01:10:28,390
♫ What am I looking for on this road wandering ♫

986
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:30,740
♫ Why am I here for what ♫

987
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:33,620
[Young Lady and Gentleman]

988
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:36,510
If your disapproval made me break up, I wouldn't have even started.

989
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:39,120
- I'm going to get going.
- Oh, my goodness!

990
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:40,900
Why are you that startled?

991
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:44,180
I'm the only woman who can hug you from the back.

992
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:46,460
Our relationship is more of a problem than Dan Dan Unni's.

993
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:48,640
We're not that shocking of a couple.

994
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:53,300
We're just related by other's marriage, that's it. Don't worry.

995
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:54,760
Oh, gosh.

996
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,160
How did you know about this place?

997
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:57,770
It makes no sense that I wouldn't know this as your friend.

998
01:10:57,770 --> 01:10:59,750
I never said I was going to be friends with you.

999
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:00,830
Come on, let's just be friends.

1000
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:01,930
Ajussi.

1001
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:05,280
Chairman. It's me, Dan Dan's dad.

1002
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:06,760
Father.

1003
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,190
♫ I have to abandon  ♫

1004
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:11,780
Please break up with my Dan Dan.

1005
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:13,840
I'll do everything you ask me to do!

1006
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:18,990
Just please, let my Dan Dan go.
