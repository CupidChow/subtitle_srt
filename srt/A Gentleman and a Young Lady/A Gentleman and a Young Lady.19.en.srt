Hide well, or else I can see your hair!
 [Episode 19]

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:08,910
Hide well, or else I can see your hair!

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,290
Hide well, or else I can see your hair!

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,250
I'll look for you now.

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:24,180
Hide well, or else I can see your hair!

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,470
Are you here?

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:33,260
Stay still! If you move now, I'll get caught too!

8
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:06,930
I found you! Oh, yeah! Dad, you're the tagger now!

9
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,960
Ms. Park Noona, you're such a bad team player! How can you push me for you to survive?

10
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,280
Because of you, now I'm the tagger!

11
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,030
Wow, you're so mean.

12
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,550
No, it's not like that.

13
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:24,860
Why did you have to follow me to my hiding place?

14
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,790
There were lots of other places you could have hidden.

15
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:36,380
But why is my heart so tingling and painful?

16
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,760
What's going on?

17
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,940
- Dad!
- Dad!

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,800
Dad, what's wrong? Aren't you feeling well?

19
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,800
I'm fine. Maybe I'm feeling the post-injury symptoms.

20
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:59,040
I think you guys should continue the game without me. I'll go in and rest for a bit.

21
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,360
What's that? I just caught my dad.

22
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,020
Is he running away because he doesn't want to be the tagger?

23
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,100
Chairman, what's wrong? Are you feeling sick?

24
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,060
Chief Jo Noona. Something's wrong with my heart.

25
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,960
Your heart? What's wrong with it?

26
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,390
I think my heart was injured as well

27
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,010
when I got hurt in the mountains.

28
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:52,520
In what way is it weird? If you injured your heart, it's a big deal!

29
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,350
Tell me the symptoms in more detail.

30
00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:00,280
It happened all of a sudden while I was playing hide and seek with the kids.

31
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,520
I ended up hiding with Ms. Park Noona behind the tree,

32
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,920
and my heart started beating like crazy.

33
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,480
Were you hiding with Ms. Park?

34
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,650
Yes, I didn't run that hard. But my heart started beating hard.

35
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:23,940
So much so that I thought it would jump out of my body.

36
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:29,420
But it's strange. It got fine now.

37
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:35,000
What is this? He doesn't remember Ms. Park,

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,610
but did his feelings for Ms. Park revive and express through his body?

39
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,140
No, it can't be.

40
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:49,550
Isn't it strange how it happened so suddenly? Should I get my heart checked out?

41
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:53,910
Yes, I think that would be the best.

42
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:59,880
My memory is broken and what if my heart is broken too?

43
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:05,890
No, it's not. You were healthy before. I'm sure you are fine.

44
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,530
Then, Chief Jo Noona,

45
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:15,480
can you go to the hospital with me?

46
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:21,440
Of course. I will be with you.

47
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:30,540
We examined through ultrasound, and nothing was wrong. So don't worry about it, Chairman Lee.

48
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,270
Is that so?

49
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,890
But why did my heart beat so fast earlier?

50
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:42,380
It could happen. If you exercise hard or get surprised,

51
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,620
or if you see someone you especially like.

52
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,070
I was only playing hide and seek with my children.

53
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:55,660
Maybe it was because you got excited with the kids in a while.

54
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,000
It could happen when you are having too much fun.

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,870
Oh, is that so?

56
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:18,060
Ms. Park Noona, what brings you here?

57
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,390
I heard you went to the hospital.

58
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:29,000
I was worried if something went wrong with you

59
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,110
because I pushed you earlier and made you startled.

60
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,300
Well,

61
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,890
I didn't want to tell you because I didn't want you to feel guilty.

62
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,810
But since you asked, I have to tell you.

63
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:49,330
Actually, something went wrong with my heart because you startled me earlier.

64
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:54,170
So, I need to get surgery.

65
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,020
Really?

66
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,450
Did that serious issue happen because of me?

67
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:05,030
What do we do? I'm so sorry, Chairman.

68
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,340
I am kidding. It's just a joke.

69
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,180
Did you say you were kidding?

70
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,730
Did you really believe what I said?

71
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:25,860
You're not an elementary school kid. How can you believe me when I was just kidding?

72
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,320
Why are you acting like this, Chairman? How can you joke about something like that?

73
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,200
You must have believed me looking at your being angry.

74
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:39,380
Who believes in a story about needing heart surgery because of a startle?

75
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,760
Does it make sense? I don't think even Se Jong would fall for something like that.

76
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,890
You are really naive, Ms. Park Noona.

77
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:56,540
So you're saying that you are fine right now.

78
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:02,090
Yes, I'm fine. The doctor said there's no problem.

79
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,590
Okay, I get it. I'll get going.

80
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,630
What's up with her? Is she a dummy?

81
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,920
How can she be so naive? It's hilarious.

82
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,170
What was that? He's so annoying!

83
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,440
I'd give him a hit on the head if I could.

84
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:36,030
But I can't even do that. I shouldn't have asked.

85
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,080
Ms. Park.

86
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,260
Were you coming out of the Chairman's study just now?

87
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,140
Yes.

88
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,890
Why? Did he call you?

89
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,800
No, he didn't.

90
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,590
But while we were playing hide and seek, he said his heart didn't feel right,

91
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:00,330
so I was worried, and I had to ask him about it.

92
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,300
Ms. Park.

93
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,830
Why would you worry about that?

94
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,470
Pardon?

95
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,220
You don't have to worry about the Chairman.

96
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,970
And please refrain from going into his study from now on.

97
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,130
If you have anything to converse with him, speak to me first.

98
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,940
I am in charge of everything in this household.

99
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:24,960
Yes. I understand.

100
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:37,880
It's not like I can stay in this house and watch her 24/7.

101
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,820
That's right!

102
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,820
Chairman, I brought you some snacks.

103
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,570
Wow, it's my favorite chocolate cake.

104
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:59,190
You are the best, Chief Jo Noona.

105
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:06,680
I have something to discuss with you.

106
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,370
What is it?

107
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:13,380
It looks like it's too much for Ms. Park to take care of the children on her own.

108
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,530
That being the case, and since I've come back as well,

109
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:22,910
how about if we make Ms. Park work during the day only?

110
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:29,230
We can't do that without asking the children.

111
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,150
But, why?

112
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,580
I will be here at night instead of Ms. Park.

113
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:41,420
It would allow me to get close to the children before we get married.

114
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,500
Why would you ask the children?

115
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,800
Things like this are up to you and me.

116
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,550
We can't have it that way.

117
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,710
What do you mean?

118
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:04,450
When I dismissed Ms. Park last time without talking to the children, they were very upset.

119
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,790
So I made a promise to them.

120
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,310
I would make decisions about things that involve the children

121
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,720
by talking to them democratically first.

122
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:20,940
Why did you gather all of us? What do you want to say?

123
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,560
I have something to discuss with you.

124
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:29,510
I promised to discuss democratically with you guys about things that affect you.

125
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,290
I am one who keeps promises.

126
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,550
So, what do you want to discuss with us?

127
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,450
As you know, Ms. Park is a live-in tutor.

128
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,870
But what if we switch her to only work in the daytime?

129
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,530
Because Chief Jo Noona wants to stay here and look after you guys.

130
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,250
What do you guys think?

131
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:55,760
So are you saying switch the roles of Ms. Park and Chief Jo?

132
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,570
To simply put, that's what I'm saying.

133
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,630
I don't want that.

134
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,990
It's a no for me too.

135
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:05,860
I can't sleep if Ms. Park doesn't read for me at night.

136
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,300
Did Ms. Park ask to work during the day only?

137
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,650
Did she say it's difficult for her to live with us here?

138
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,480
No, it's not that.

139
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,960
Chief Jo wants to stay here so she can get close to you.

140
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:25,120
Dad, we three are completely in opposition.

141
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,110
Do you understand?

142
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,590
Yes, I do.

143
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,710
Your opinions are the most important.

144
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:37,130
I will follow your opinions and not make the change.

145
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:41,480
Children, don't you like that your dad's democratic?

146
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,470
Dad, please do not say a word of this to Ms. Park.

147
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,670
It would only hurt her feelings.

148
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,520
Okay, I got it.

149
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,280
What did the children say? Did it go well?

150
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:10,530
Well, the children don't want it. All three of them.

151
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,370
I beg your pardon?

152
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:18,130
It's not like she's quitting. They don't like Ms. Park commuting?

153
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,280
No.

154
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,810
A home tutor is there for the children.

155
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,780
If the children don't like it, then we shouldn't make a change.

156
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:30,180
We should leave it as it is.

157
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:37,340
I feel like the children only think of me as a housekeeper.

158
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:42,520
So I wanted to get closer to them before we got married.

159
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,660
Okay then, why don't we tell the children that we are getting married?

160
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,470
That's the only way I can get close to them.

161
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,550
Didn't you say you didn't want to surprise the children?

162
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:58,090
Since Jenny is a sensitive teenager facing the final exams,

163
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,230
you said we should wait until she's done with the exams.

164
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:06,060
I did say that back then...

165
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:12,800
Right, if Jenny finds out her dad and I are getting married, she would go outrageous.

166
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,530
She would ask when we started dating, was it before her mom died,

167
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,840
and oppose the marriage no matter what.

168
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:24,130
She would meet up with Lawyer Koh and check what's going on and make me go crazy.

169
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,390
I get it. Should I go now and tell them that we are getting married?

170
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:35,910
No! Let's wait until Jenny finishes her final exams.

171
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,050
Okay, then. As soon as Jenny finishes her exams,

172
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,430
I will take her for pizza and tell her.

173
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,470
I will tell Se Chan and Se Jong too.

174
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:45,890
I have to tell them as their father.

175
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:50,530
Yes, that would be the best.

176
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:54,500
You are absolutely right.

177
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:03,240
But, even if he's gone back to being a stupid 22 years old.

178
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,130
How can he be shifted around by his children like that?

179
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:14,700
But what if he falls for Ms. Park again?

180
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,440
No, he wouldn't do that this time.

181
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,880
He totally fell for me, so it won't happen again.

182
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,530
Se Chan, what brings you here?

183
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,670
I have something to ask you.

184
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,050
Okay, what is it?

185
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,820
Chief Jo.

186
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:45,810
Did you ask my dad for Ms. Park to come to work in the morning and get off in the evening?

187
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,720
What?

188
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,990
What's this?

189
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:55,590
Did he tell all the details to the children? It's ridiculous!

190
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:59,160
Yes, I did. Why?

191
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,220
Even if my dad reverted to 22 years old,

192
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:07,060
you can't just push things around as you want!

193
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,580
- What?
- Ms. Park is a precious person to us.

194
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,030
We barely stopped her from leaving our house.

195
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:18,100
Please don't say anything regarding Ms. Park from now on!

196
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:23,920
It's not like you are paying her wages.

197
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:34,670
What did he just say to me?

198
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,920
My goodness!

199
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:56,600
What are you saying?

200
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,990
What do you mean by clear it out by today?

201
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,300
Mr. Park Soo Chul, I'm sorry.

202
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,650
The economy is bad, so to cut labor costs,

203
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:10,500
they are reducing staff. I couldn't help it.

204
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,120
Since you are not a permanent employee, that's what happened.

205
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,000
Even so, how can you say that without any notice?

206
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,500
I'm sorry.

207
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,570
I couldn't do anything about it.

208
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,420
But you are still young.

209
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,910
I'm sure you will find something good.

210
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,510
Okay.

211
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,110
I understand.

212
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,620
Driver Park, what brings you here?

213
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:52,360
I am leaving my job here today.

214
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,730
So I wanted to say goodbye.

215
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,120
What?

216
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,490
Are you quit working here?

217
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,970
Why all of a sudden?

218
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,780
It just happened.

219
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,580
You gifted this scarf to me.

220
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,530
I've been grateful to you for many things.

221
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,230
Okay.

222
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,220
I have been grateful to you as well.

223
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,810
I've felt secure because you were here.

224
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,950
I'll get going now.

225
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,380
Please stay healthy, CEO.

226
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,860
Dan Dan's father.

227
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:04,850
It was so good to see you at least like this way.

228
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:10,180
Please stay healthy for the sake of Dan Dan.

229
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:22,020
I hope this lunch box can cheer up Soo Chul!

230
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,840
So that he will work hard,

231
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,460
and he'll become permanent and stay here for a long time.

232
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,960
What brings you here?

233
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,260
Hello. I'm just here to give this lunch box and go.

234
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:37,160
I put a lot of bulgogi and japchae here,

235
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,910
so please feel free to eat it with my husband.

236
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,100
But I don't see Soo Chul in here.

237
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,210
Do you mean Mr. Park Soo Chul?

238
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,380
He quit here earlier today.

239
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,660
Pardon? What did you say?

240
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,460
What are you saying right now?

241
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,460
He left for work this morning, but what do you mean he quit?

242
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,750
What are you saying?

243
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,930
It just happened that way because we had to reduce staff.

244
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,230
Are you saying my husband got laid off?

245
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:09,870
My husband? Why?

246
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,990
Honey!

247
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:21,120
Did you leave without saying anything because they asked you to?

248
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,190
What can I do? I was only a contract employee.

249
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:28,180
Even if you're a contract employee, how can they lay you off in a day?

250
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,910
You worked so hard all this time.

251
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:34,740
The company's situation is bad. I can't do anything about it.

252
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,100
Why do you care about the company's situation? We're going to starve to death!

253
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,950
How can you just quit because they asked you to?

254
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:45,520
You should have laid down on the floor and fought for your job.

255
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,520
- That's enough.
- How can you say that? We're going to starve to death now!

256
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,880
Finding a job is like catching a star. What are we going to do now?

257
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,520
You have no place to work right now!

258
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,990
My goodness.

259
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:05,790
Honey, we have to come up with a plan!

260
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:10,760
What is going on?

261
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,630
- Did Son-in-law Park lose his job?
- Yes!

262
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:19,430
He just left the company because they asked him to.

263
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:22,650
He should have fought and stayed no matter what.

264
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,180
What are we going to do now?

265
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,040
Is there a bad spirit attached to this family or something?

266
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,140
Why does nothing work out for us?

267
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:39,960
Geon and Dae Beom's business is not going well. And now Son-in-law Park lost his job.

268
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,270
I don't know.

269
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:57,470
Hey, we've sold six chicken skewers in five hours.

270
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:01,390
This is the worst! I think it's the worst.

271
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:05,470
We're wearing sleeveless in this cold weather, but it's useless.

272
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,780
Hey, for this month,

273
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:13,130
we earned less than a quarter of what I made from driving.

274
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:16,780
Dae Beom, let's close the business!

275
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,320
It's really pissing me off.

276
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:25,160
Uncle, I told you to get out of the business if you wanted to. I'll do it alone!

277
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:31,020
You little bastard coming at me with a glare like that.

278
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,890
Are you trying to have a go at me now?

279
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,780
Look, here!

280
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,920
Welcome.

281
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,580
Welcome? Look here, you guys.

282
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,810
How can you sell such garbage food?

283
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:48,140
Garbage food? How can you speak like that?

284
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,750
Ajumeoni, why are you picking a fight at someone's business?

285
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,410
Picking a fight? My child ate a chicken skewer here,

286
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,790
and almost died from a stomach ache all day.

287
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:02,270
How are you going to compensate for my child's stomach ache?

288
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,380
Stomach ache? It couldn't be.

289
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,060
How do you know the stomach ache is not from something else?

290
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,790
We use fresh chicken every day.

291
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,850
What? Fresh chicken, my foot!

292
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:17,120
My son didn't eat anything else but this chicken skewer!

293
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,130
Listen, everyone, please do not eat chicken skewers from here. They are all garbage!

294
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,050
- That's not true!
- My child ate a chicken skewer from here

295
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:28,060
and almost died from stomach ache! It's all garbage here!

296
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:33,150
What proof do you have that your son got sick from eating our chicken skewers?

297
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,500
My goodness, are you going to hit me now?

298
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,020
Go ahead and hit me! Hit me!

299
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:43,080
You make my son get sick with this garbage, and now you are going to hit me!

300
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,360
You have to go bankrupt to get yourself together!

301
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,100
Ajumma!

302
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,230
Hey, hey.

303
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:56,600
Ajumeoni, how can you do this with the food people eat?

304
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,870
Just hit me then. Chicken skewers don't have a fault!

305
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,930
I'm going to report you to the police!

306
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:06,320
I'm going to send you to jail for selling spoiled food!

307
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,210
Just report us. Go ahead and report!

308
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,700
I will not let your business run.

309
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,220
I'll make you can't run the business anymore, so we'll see!

310
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:55,170
Brother-in-law!

311
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,940
Father.

312
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:05,050
Father, why are you doing that?

313
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,940
I'm sorry.

314
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,290
Why are you sorry?

315
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,840
You didn't do anything to be sorry.

316
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,620
I didn't want you to see me like this.

317
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:40,190
I wanted to succeed and pay you back.

318
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,610
Father.

319
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:46,020
Why am I like this?

320
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:52,110
Why am I in this state?

321
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:02,050
I never asked you to pay me back.

322
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,690
Dae Beom.

323
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:09,020
Who in this world never fails?

324
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,460
When things don't work out, you try it again.

325
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,960
If that fails, you try again. That's all.

326
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:23,050
Father, it's cold. Why don't you go home?

327
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:27,780
Also, please do not come back here.

328
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,910
I will go now.

329
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,710
Oh, yeah! Awesome! I've finally finished it.

330
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:56,880
I made this difficult thing. I'm great!

331
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,380
Two hours of focused work paid off.

332
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,430
I have to record this moment.

333
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,650
Wow, Hyung, that's amazing! Did you make this?

334
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:16,450
Lee Se Jong, don't touch it. Don't touch it!

335
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,280
Hyung...

336
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:25,030
Hey, Lee Se Jong! I told you not to touch it!

337
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:33,010
Lee Se Chan!

338
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,700
Lee Se Chan, what are you doing to Se Jong!

339
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:45,190
He broke my robot I worked for two hours to complete!

340
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:49,580
Are you saying you hit Se Jong for a mere robot? What is so important about this!

341
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,570
How can an older brother hit a younger brother?

342
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:57,330
How can you be so horrible and have no consideration? Who do you get that from?

343
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,860
Chief Jo!

344
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,350
Se Jong did wrong in the first place!

345
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,920
Oh, my, how dare you yell at me?

346
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,680
How can you speak back to an adult like that?

347
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,750
You are not even smart!

348
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:14,010
What? What did you say?

349
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:18,280
What's going on? What happened?

350
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,510
Ms. Park, what education are you providing to the children?

351
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:26,240
Teach Se Chan how to treat his younger brother first.

352
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:32,340
And make sure he never hits Se Jong ever again.

353
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:04,770
It's a robot you worked hard on for hours to make.

354
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:09,820
But you're upset because it broke in a second, aren't you?

355
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,950
I'm very good at putting together a robot.

356
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:19,850
Do you want to do it again with me?

357
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:24,750
No, please throw that robot away for me.

358
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:35,290
Chief Jo.

359
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:39,120
Actually,

360
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,680
I did wrong.

361
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:48,460
Hyung told me not to touch it.

362
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:53,460
But I did and broke it.

363
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:58,190
I will go and say I'm sorry.

364
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:00,120
Se Jong.

365
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,950
This is your brother's fault.

366
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,260
It was just a mistake that you dropped the toy.

367
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:10,250
But it's his fault that he hit you.

368
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,910
So, you don't have to feel sorry.

369
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:18,300
What did I say you would be when you grew up?

370
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,770
A great person.

371
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:25,150
That's right. Se Jong will take over from your father

372
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:28,900
and become the leader of the FT Group.

373
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,420
Such a great person does not have to bow down to just anyone.

374
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,360
Do you understand?

375
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,780
Is Se Jong okay?

376
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,770
He's calmed down now.

377
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,460
Chief Jo.

378
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,980
Yes?

379
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:08,660
Then can you calm down Se Chan as well?

380
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,670
What do you mean?

381
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:15,660
You were very harsh to Se Chan earlier.

382
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,730
My goodness.

383
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,410
What did you say?

384
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,940
I know Se Chan was wrong

385
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:25,930
to get angry with Se Jong and hit him on the head.

386
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:31,620
But without knowing the details, you got angry only with Se Chan.

387
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:35,920
And you even said he's not smart.

388
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,830
I get that you might have said that because you were too surprised--

389
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:42,060
What are you saying to me, Ms. Park?

390
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:46,590
Are you trying to teach me as well? How dare you try to teach me!

391
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,590
That's not it. What I'm saying is,

392
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:52,950
when there is a conflict, you have to listen to both sides of the story

393
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,730
and decide fairly based on the facts.

394
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:59,120
But Se Chan's feelings got hurt a lot.

395
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,590
Look here, Ms. Park!

396
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:05,440
Se Jong is a kindergartner and much younger than Se Chan.

397
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,980
And Se Chan hit someone so much younger than him. Are you saying that's okay?

398
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,610
Shouldn't you stop Se Chan from hitting Se Jong again

399
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:15,610
by disciplining and punishing him clearly?

400
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:19,160
Instead of what? You want me to console Se Chan?

401
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,500
Please conduct your education properly.

402
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,470
If something like this happens again,

403
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:30,350
you will be held responsible as well.

404
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:42,590
It's raining.

405
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:46,250
But why is the sound of rain so loud?

406
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:50,620
Why is it raining so much when it's winter?

407
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,660
Next, we will have regional weather reports.

408
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:57,710
In Seoul and Gyeonggi Province right now is very cloudy and started to rain harshly.

409
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:00,340
It's going to lead to heavy rain overnight.

410
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,250
Please be careful of potential floods and landslides.

411
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,920
The reason for the heavy rain tonight is

412
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,910
- Flood and landslide?
 - due to the clouds forming above the ocean in the west coming to the capital area.

413
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:12,990
What about my gold?

414
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:16,910
What if they wash away in the rain?

415
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:23,350
Oh, my goodness!

416
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:28,430
Why is it raining this heavily today?

417
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:34,740
This is so annoying.

418
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,140
Oh, my babies!

419
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,560
You've come back!

420
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,870
Oh, my babies!

421
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,990
What? What is it?

422
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,950
Where did it go?

423
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,940
It was right here. Where did it all go?

424
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,450
Where did my golds go?

425
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,380
You were here! My pretty babies.

426
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,380
Oh, my babies!

427
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,590
What happened? My golds!

428
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:23,350
Where did they go? Why are they keep disappearing!

429
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:28,400
My golds! Where did you go, my babies?

430
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,220
My babies! Please don't go!

431
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:37,090
Don't go. Don't go!

432
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:40,230
It was a dream.

433
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:46,300
But why are my golds keep running away?

434
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,700
Could it be that they are not

435
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,950
in Young Gook's safe in his study?

436
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:54,370
Are they somewhere else?

437
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:57,650
No, no, no. Where would they go?

438
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:03,370
Right, right. They must be in Young Gook's study.

439
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,760
Of course, yes.

440
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:18,950
[We buy and sell gold]

441
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:33,670
[Baruni Jewelry and Gold dealer]
[Gold bars, we specialize in buying inventory products]
[We buy for the highest cash value]

442
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:37,210
Is it only 45 million won per bar?

443
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:42,970
But these are over 80 million won per kilogram.

444
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:47,810
Seriously, you're bashing the price too low.

445
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:51,090
If you don't like it, you should legally sell where they pay you that much.

446
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:54,120
- Why did you come to this back street shop?
- What?

447
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,920
You and I both have to do this without getting caught.

448
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,020
We should do a safe transaction.

449
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,130
That being the case,

450
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,110
we have to spend a lot of expenses.

451
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:06,770
It's the cost for the safe transaction.

452
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,350
Then, why don't we meet in the middle?

453
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:16,640
Pay me 47.5 million won per kilogram.

454
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,980
Sure, let's do that. 47.5 million won.

455
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:25,900
By the way,

456
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:31,470
how much would you give me for this?

457
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:46,470
For this, I'll think good for you,

458
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:50,860
and give you 300 million won.

459
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:58,570
300 million won?

460
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,580
Then, I'll sell this one too.

461
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:03,750
Please do the safe transaction.

462
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,780
Since this was my old man's safe,

463
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,410
I bet the secret code was passed down from him too.

464
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:23,460
Then would it be the old man's birthday?

465
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:30,480
It isn't the one.

466
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,810
What about Young Gook's birthday?

467
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,610
Are you home, Chairman?

468
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,710
Please give them to me.

469
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:41,680
- What did you buy so much?
- These are clothes and shoes for the kids.

470
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:51,510
What are you doing, Ajumma?

471
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,350
Why are you here, Ajumma!

472
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:58,060
That is... I was cleaning!

473
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,580
I was so thankful that you let me live here,

474
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,980
so I tried to clean your study at least.

475
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,670
Cleaning?

476
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,700
You are doing that?

477
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,320
Do you expect me to believe that?

478
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,730
What's the reason for you coming into this room?

479
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,880
I said, cleaning!

480
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,340
I'm really here to clean!

481
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:21,600
Madam!

482
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,340
You promised not to be seen by the Chairman.

483
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,640
Ah, really.

484
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:38,070
Why was I living with that enemy Ajumma?

485
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:42,520
Why can't I remember it? Why!

486
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,210
My goodness! Seriously!

487
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:51,260
Madam, how can you go into Chairman's study?

488
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,690
What if Chairman says you should get out of the house again?

489
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,140
Chief Jo!

490
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,590
Find out the passcode for the safe in the study!

491
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:02,820
But Madam! It's not the right time to do that.

492
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,280
Also, It's not like they are going anywhere!

493
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,410
Besides, if you get kicked out figuring that out, what good would that do?

494
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:13,580
Seriously!

495
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:19,550
Did she take it out on me just now?

496
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:22,010
Okay, fine.

497
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:25,380
It's not like they'd go anywhere other than the safe in the study.

498
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,000
Of course.

499
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:20,540
Mi Rim.

500
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:28,180
Mi Rim, please don't misunderstand what happened yesterday.

501
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:31,450
I didn't do that on purpose. I mean it.

502
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,290
I'm not a pervert.

503
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:36,360
Please believe me, Mi Rim.

504
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:42,250
I know that you are not a pervert.

505
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:47,000
And I think you are pretty cool.

506
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:50,040
What do you think of me?

507
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:55,120
I think you are pretty.

508
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,340
It's either I'm pretty or not.

509
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:01,770
What does "I think" mean?

510
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:05,850
You are pretty.

511
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:10,970
Then, should we start dating?

512
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:13,740
What?

513
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,900
[Fantom]

514
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,530
Sister-in-law?

515
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:34,400
Were you waiting to see me?

516
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,320
Pardon? Yes.

517
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,980
Why didn't you go inside and wait outside?

518
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:44,460
It's not like you came to see a stranger.

519
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:50,280
Sister-in-law, what's going on? Did something happen?

520
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,180
Sister-in-law...

521
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,170
What?

522
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:57,620
Soo Chul lost his job?

523
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,630
Yes.

524
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,680
What do we do now?

525
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:07,860
Our family has been living on the wages he brings in.

526
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:12,130
I don't know how we're going to live from now on.

527
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:16,380
I've looked everywhere trying to get a job.

528
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:22,550
But there was no place willing to hire a housewife like me.

529
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:28,120
That's why I've come here, despite shame and embarrassment.

530
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:32,400
Sister-in-law, can't you please hire me as a cleaner in this store?

531
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,200
Please let me work here, Sister-in-law.

532
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,470
Sister-in-law, what are you saying? Why would you work here?

533
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:46,000
I have to work at least for us to survive.

534
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,520
I'll help you out until Soo Chul finds a new job.

535
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,810
No, please don't do that.

536
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:56,870
If Soo Chul finds that out, he will flip.

537
00:41:56,870 --> 00:42:02,240
He even refused to live in your apartment.

538
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:10,320
No, I can't take it.

539
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,930
Just don't let Soo Chul know.

540
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:17,860
Use it for living expenses and endure for a while.

541
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:22,970
Soo Chul is healthy and hard working. He will find something soon.

542
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:25,220
Until he does,

543
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:31,130
I will help you with living expenses every month for a while, so don't worry.

544
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:33,650
Sister-in-law...

545
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:37,760
How will I pay you back for this gratitude?

546
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,510
You don't have to think about finding a job somewhere.

547
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:44,570
Please take care of our Soo Chul and do not let his pride suffer.

548
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:51,950
He will be going through the hardest time, having lost the job. Please comfort him a lot.

549
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,640
Yes, Sister-in-law.

550
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,970
Don't worry about it.

551
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:59,970
- Please put it in your bag.
- Okay.

552
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:20,620
How much is this?

553
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,690
Three million won?

554
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:26,210
She gave me a lot of money!

555
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:31,870
Is she going to give this much every month until Soo Chul gets a job?

556
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:34,620
Oh, my goodness!

557
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:42,060
I live in luxury, thanks to Soo Chul's wealthy sister.

558
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,850
CEO Anna!

559
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:50,440
Ms. Park.

560
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,460
Please don't run. You might fall!

561
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:56,890
I'm so excited and happy to see you.

562
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:58,890
Was it not difficult to find here?

563
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:01,240
I said I would come and pick you up.

564
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,840
I'm not a child.

565
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,740
It's easy getting here on the bus.

566
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:10,370
Maybe I thought of you as a young child.

567
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:15,650
I've been worried after leaving you all alone. Have you been well?

568
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:18,340
Has anything happened?

569
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,370
No, CEO Anna.

570
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:25,460
Let's go. I've made a reservation. Let's eat and talk.

571
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,460
Yes.

572
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,890
Dad!

573
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:34,980
Dan Dan.

574
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,780
Hello.

575
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,340
Yes, hello, CEO Anna.

576
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:43,020
What are you doing here, Dan Dan?

577
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:47,540
I wanted to buy Ms. Park a meal, so I asked for a date.

578
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,970
I suddenly left Chairman Lee's house,

579
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:53,280
so I didn't have time to say a proper goodbye to her.

580
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,370
I see. Thank you.

581
00:44:57,370 --> 00:45:03,350
Driver Park, since we are all here, why don't you join us?

582
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:05,580
No, thank you. I'm okay.

583
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:09,020
Dan Dan, please go ahead with the CEO.

584
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:12,400
No, please do join us.

585
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,590
I heard this place was good, so I made a reservation here. What do you think?

586
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:22,570
Do the steaks taste okay?

587
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:24,620
Yes.

588
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:29,350
Yes, it's delicious. It melts in the mouth.

589
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:31,800
Eat as much as you want, Ms. Park.

590
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,680
I will bring you here often.

591
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:38,970
Really? Thank you.

592
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:46,330
Since having steak in a nice restaurant like this in a while,

593
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:49,110
it reminds me of a teary steak I had before.

594
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:52,490
Teary steak?

595
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:54,350
What is that?

596
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:56,230
While I was in university,

597
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:59,800
a guy I met on my first blind date took me to a nice restaurant.

598
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,460
When did you go on a blind date?

599
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,730
Dad! Did you think I never went on a blind date?

600
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:10,210
And? You went to the restaurant, and then?

601
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:14,310
I said, let's just have pasta, which was cheaper,

602
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:19,500
but I guess he liked me, so he wanted to treat me to a steak.

603
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:24,390
So he ordered a steak and tried to cut it for me.

604
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:30,340
And while he was cutting, perhaps because I looked so pretty,

605
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:34,300
his hands were shaking like this.

606
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,080
His hands were shaking this much!

607
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:40,480
But then, the steak flew away.

608
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,310
Oh, no! Really?

609
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:46,720
We were poor students, so we didn't want to throw it away.

610
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:51,120
So I said, let's just pick it up and wash it and eat it.

611
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,940
Oh, no! How could you do that?

612
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,810
- Is it a true story?
- Yes!

613
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:59,300
But, the restaurant owner felt sorry for us,

614
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:04,870
so he made us a new one. It's a funny memory now.

615
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:27,270
Thank you for today, CEO Anna. I really enjoyed it.

616
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:29,220
Me, too.

617
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:34,440
I've relied on you a lot all this time. So it was good to see you again.

618
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,770
Thank you for everything.

619
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:41,540
What do you mean? I'm the one who's grateful.

620
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,090
I will see you again, Ms. Park.

621
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:47,140
Yes. Goodbye, CEO Anna.

622
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:55,170
Dad, what did it mean that CEO Anna just said?

623
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:59,810
Did you quit your job there?

624
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:05,300
What? Oh.

625
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:20,970
I was so happy just being with them.

626
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:24,170
Just sharing a meal makes me so happy.

627
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:26,280
His hands were shaking this much!

628
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:32,700
Is it possible to put everything back the way it was?

629
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,740
Hyung, can you pass it to me?

630
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:40,460
Let me play just once.

631
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,360
Se Jong, are you okay?

632
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,890
Se Jong! Oh, my goodness!

633
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:56,710
What do we do? What do we do?

634
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:59,860
Your nose is bleeding! What should we do?

635
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:02,140
My goodness!

636
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:06,060
Lee Se Chan! What did you do to my Se Jong?

637
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:09,350
Why are you acting like this? Why are you so mean!

638
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:13,010
Who do you take after!

639
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:16,320
No, I didn't. I didn't do it!

640
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:20,100
Oh my, look at him lying! Don't you know that lying is the worst?

641
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:24,090
Where did you learn something so terrible?

642
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:27,200
Chief Jo, what are you doing?

643
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:33,200
Lee Se Chan, if you do this to my Se Jong one more time, we'll see what will happen!

644
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:35,810
Chief Jo.

645
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:38,810
Why are you being like that to my older brother?

646
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:42,680
He didn't do it on purpose.

647
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,310
I fell on my own.

648
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:47,780
My goodness.

649
00:49:56,530 --> 00:50:03,110
Ms. Park. Why does Chief Jo only hate me so much?

650
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:06,320
Am I really such a terrible child?

651
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,770
No, you are not, Se Chan. Absolutely not.

652
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:13,000
Why does Chief Jo blame me all the time?

653
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,820
I really hate Chief Jo!

654
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:18,830
I really hate her!

655
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,040
What do you want to talk about?

656
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,710
Chief Jo, you went overboard.

657
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:34,410
What?

658
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:40,480
I saw it when I was coming home. Se Chan and Se Jong fell together while chasing the ball.

659
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,480
Se Chan didn't push Se Jong to fall.

660
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:48,320
But how can you not even listen to their stories and even hit him?

661
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,280
What? When did I hit him?

662
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:55,240
How can you say such a terrible thing to me? I'm going to be the madam of this house--

663
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:00,740
As a person who's going to become their mother, I disciplined Se Chan. That's all.

664
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:03,330
If he did something wrong, he should be disciplined.

665
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:06,890
Then you should listen to the kids first and scold them if they did something wrong.

666
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:11,630
And even if they did wrong, I don't believe you should hit the child.

667
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:14,080
What are you trying to do with me, Ms. Park?

668
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:17,010
I'm going to be the madam of this house!

669
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:19,760
How dare you talk to me with your eyes glaring like that?

670
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,480
Why don't you know your places?

671
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:29,800
What is going on with you two?

672
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,700
Are you fighting?

673
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:36,840
Chairman, what do you mean? Why would we fight?

674
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:40,150
It's nothing, so please don't pay attention.

675
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:41,980
No, Chief Jo Noona.

676
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:45,960
It sounded like Ms. Park was telling you off.

677
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:50,520
I need to hear from Ms. Park Noona for what's the reason.

678
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,710
What's going on?

679
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:56,880
Yes, Chairman. It's something you ought to know.

680
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,580
Ms. Park. Please stop.

681
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:02,210
No, it's about the Chairman's children.

682
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:04,630
He, more than anyone, should know.

683
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:09,340
There's no reason for the Chairman to worry about it.

684
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:13,150
Yes, please. I need to know if it's about my children.

685
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:15,970
Please tell me.

686
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:21,690
Yesterday, Se Jong mistakenly broke a toy that Se Chan put together after two hours of hard work.

687
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:24,200
So Se Chan hit Se Jong on the head.

688
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:30,110
But without listening to their stories, Chief Jo scolded Se Chan only.

689
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:35,420
She was even saying very hurtful things to him while doing so.

690
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:37,020
That is...

691
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:41,710
And just now, Se Jong and Se Chan fell at the same time while playing with a ball.

692
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:44,290
And that caused Se Jong a nose bleed.

693
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:51,240
Se Chan did not cause Se Jong to fall, but Chief Jo suddenly hit Se Chan.

694
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,060
Ms. Park!

695
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:55,860
Did she hit Se Chan?

696
00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:02,530
Yes. Why would Chief Jo not listen to the kids' stories and only scold Se Chan all the time?

697
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:06,930
I believe that is wrong.

698
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:10,430
Children know when they are treated differently.

699
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:15,130
The discriminative treatment hurts their feelings and is not good for their emotional development.

700
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:23,450
And, no matter the reason, violence is bad.

701
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:27,780
Ms. Park, what do you mean by violence? How can you put it that way?

702
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:32,000
I was shocked to see Se Jong's nose bleed, so I gently pushed Se Chan.

703
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,930
Chief Jo! Why are you lying?

704
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:38,010
You absolutely hit Se Chan!

705
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:42,180
Please stop both of you.

706
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:44,860
That's enough.

707
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,800
Yes, that's right.

708
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:55,950
Chief Jo hit me on the back.

709
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:57,880
Really?

710
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:01,050
Chief Jo only scolds me every day.

711
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:05,930
I don't know why she likes Se Jong and dislikes me always.

712
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:11,150
I think Chief Jo hates me.

713
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:14,370
I don't think that's it.

714
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:19,100
It's because Se Jong is very young, that's why.

715
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:22,740
But Chief Jo definitely did wrong with this.

716
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:28,490
I will make sure something like this never happens again.

717
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:32,460
So don't cry, Se Chan.

718
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:45,880
Chief Jo Noona, no matter what wrong behavior the children do, please don't hit them.

719
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:50,270
If you scold them and hit them, they will go sideways.

720
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:56,620
My middle school friend, Byung Cheol, ran away from his house for that reason and couldn't even finish middle school.

721
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:04,180
Have you not heard the phrase don't even hit the child with a flower?

722
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:08,390
Even if you are the one I'm supposed to marry,

723
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:13,940
I won't tolerate you treating my young children like that.

724
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:24,890
Chief Jo Noona!

725
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:42,550
Chief Jo Noona!

726
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,320
The call cannot be connected.

727
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,160
I think she's really upset.

728
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,830
Was I too harsh?

729
00:55:56,830 --> 00:56:02,500
No, I wasn't. Chief Jo Noona was clearly wrong this time.

730
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:08,080
This is why 41-year-old Lee Young Gook delayed his wedding.

731
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:12,000
Why is everything complicated and difficult?

732
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,430
Auntie, a bottle of soju and some pork skin, please.

733
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:19,680
Okay!

734
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:27,250
I mean, even if he's a stupid 22-year-old,

735
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:31,950
how can he crush me in front of Ms. Park?

736
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:38,060
Seriously. What should I do with that wench, Ms. Park?

737
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:52,600
- Wait a minute. I will bring it.
- Yes.

738
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:56,300
You came here today. Sokcho night beach lady.

739
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:05,470
Ajussi, do you know me?

740
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:07,450
Pardon?

741
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:11,090
Who do you think you are to sit in front of me?

742
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:15,000
What kind of joke is that?

743
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,820
It's me!

744
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:19,910
The cute teddy bear.

745
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:26,340
Look here, Ajussi. We don't know each other's names or anything.

746
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:31,500
So why do you think it's okay for you to sit here without my permission?

747
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:36,530
You are not mistaken about anything, are you?

748
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:42,790
No, I'm not mistaken.

749
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:47,470
If I offended you, I'm sorry.

750
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:51,300
Ajussi, I am getting married.

751
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:54,310
From now on, please pretend you don't know me even if you see me.

752
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:57,140
You know what it means, right?

753
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:01,630
We don't know each other.

754
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:12,920
Yes, I understand clearly. I won't show that I know you so please don't worry.

755
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:18,970
And, congratulations on getting married.

756
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:22,800
I mean it. Congratulations.

757
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:49,880
That's right. How did I get here after all?

758
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:08,040
What would have happened to Se Chan if I weren't there?

759
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:11,320
And even if Se Jong is very young.

760
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:14,750
Why does she discriminate against Se Chan like that?

761
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:17,410
It hurts his feelings.

762
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:24,140
For the sake of our Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong,

763
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,640
I will have to stay in this house.

764
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,440
I will protect the children.

765
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,500
Right, I will not leave no matter what.

766
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:40,600
Ms. Park Noona.

767
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:45,320
- Chairman.
- What are you doing here?

768
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:51,110
Well, I was feeling a bit frustrated.

769
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:54,950
I came out because I felt the same.

770
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:57,060
Let's have a drink together.

771
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:59,550
Please sit.

772
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:15,940
Ms. Park Noona. I want to thank you for earlier.

773
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:21,410
I think Se Chan feels better because of you.

774
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:27,750
Even still, he is probably very upset.

775
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:33,020
From what I see, because you treat the kids fairly and truthfully,

776
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:36,320
the children like you.

777
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:40,150
What is this? Is he complimenting me?

778
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:42,270
What's up?

779
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:46,010
What I am saying is I feel I can trust you.

780
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:51,010
And that I feel secure that you are in our house.

781
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:54,810
Please take good care of our children in the future as well.

782
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:58,460
Yes, I will.

783
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:08,920
We should have done this a lot earlier.

784
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:13,210
Let's get along well from now on as well, as a member of the same house.

785
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:15,560
Yes.

786
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:32,350
What's wrong?

787
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:38,100
That is...

788
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:41,520
I just remembered that I was doing cheers with beers

789
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:46,490
with someone here, just like we did now.

790
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:50,300
Oh, sure, you did!

791
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:54,180
Do you think you did cheers with a handful of people here?

792
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:57,100
Excuse me first.

793
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:02,510
Why does she leave in the middle of drinking?

794
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:06,410
Ms. Park Noona has no manners.

795
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:09,550
We don't hit off that well.

796
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,050
Chief Jo Noona.

797
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:35,030
Chairman, earlier today--

798
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:38,620
No, let me say it first.

799
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:42,420
I am sorry about earlier.

800
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:46,140
No, Chairman. I'm the one who's sorry.

801
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:49,740
I should've thought about it more.

802
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:55,310
Se Jong is a baby who needs hands-on guidance from adults.

803
01:02:55,310 --> 01:03:01,480
Also, I almost raised Se Jong myself.

804
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:04,250
I think I was overprotective about him without realizing it.

805
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:09,940
I'm sorry. I overreacted to Se Chan as well.

806
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:13,580
I was too harsh to you as well.

807
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:16,820
I'm sorry. I want to apologize.

808
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:21,850
So please don't be angry.

809
01:03:21,850 --> 01:03:26,590
You are not angry anymore, are you?

810
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:42,960
I have a call.

811
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:47,090
It's from Jung Woo. Koh Jung Woo. One moment, please.

812
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:49,050
Yes, it's me.

813
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:52,870
Young Gook, I need you to come to the office tomorrow.

814
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:56,250
What? To the office?

815
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:59,630
Am I not on sick leave?

816
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:01,690
Okay, I get it. I'll be there tomorrow.

817
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:04,570
I will see you then.

818
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,200
Why to the office?

819
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:11,050
Isn't Executive Director Han taking good care of everything? Is something wrong?

820
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:15,060
It's not that. If you vacate the Chairman's office for too long, rumors might go around.

821
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:18,490
Rumors like whether the Chairman is alive or dead. And it might affect the company's stock price.

822
01:04:18,490 --> 01:04:21,220
Whether the company is going bankrupt or not and calling an emergency Directors' meeting

823
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:26,130
to choose a new Chairman, it can go crazy like that.

824
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:31,930
Chairman. Did your memory come back all of a sudden?

825
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:37,540
I feel like you've gone back to your original state.

826
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:43,110
I've been going to the office with my father since I was seven and got trained in business management.

827
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:48,340
Chairman. You are amazing.

828
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:51,870
Even so, please come with me tomorrow.

829
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:56,600
Jung Woo tells me to say nothing and just come by, but I shouldn't make mistakes.

830
01:04:56,600 --> 01:05:00,680
My memory loss must not be revealed for a while.

831
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:03,190
I get it. I will come with you.

832
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:05,290
I told you already.

833
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:09,510
I will always be by your side.

834
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,770
Hello, Executive Director Han.

835
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:43,050
Welcome, Chairman.

836
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:48,610
Executive Director Han, how come you turned into a grandpa?

837
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:54,930
Young Gook, you agreed not to say something like that.

838
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:57,340
Ah, right.

839
01:05:57,340 --> 01:06:00,990
Chief Jo Noona. I shouldn't say anything today.

840
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:04,830
Please pinch my back every time I open my mouth.

841
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:08,500
I was joking. It was a joke.

842
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,760
I haven't gone that far yet.

843
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:15,110
Chairman, please just follow me.

844
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:17,610
Let's go.

845
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:29,610
Now, the new madam of this company is me.

846
01:06:33,450 --> 01:06:34,950
Hello, sir.

847
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:37,980
Yes, thank you for your hard work.

848
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:40,850
Young Gook, just greet people with your eyes.

849
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:43,530
Ah, really?

850
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:52,190
We've put off the merger until your memory returns.

851
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:56,700
And I'm managing the projects that were underway.

852
01:06:56,700 --> 01:07:01,470
Chairman, please take a look at them when you have time.

853
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:13,570
Executive Director Han, please take good care of things until my memory comes back.

854
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:16,390
I will take these home to study.

855
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:21,470
Yes, Chairman. Excuse me first since I have a meeting.

856
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:28,400
Executive Director Han! Fighting!

857
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,750
Fighting!

858
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:37,670
It's so suffocating.

859
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:42,040
I thought I'd die from wearing the tie.

860
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:48,590
Jung Woo, what will happen to my father's company if my memory never comes back?

861
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:52,480
Do you really not remember anything?

862
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,520
Nothing at all?

863
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:58,660
I think it was the moment the accident happened,

864
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:02,190
but I only remember the moment rolling down the mountain trying to catch a handkerchief flying away,

865
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:04,470
and drinking a beer with someone at the convenience store.

866
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:08,660
I think I remember a bit, but it's all mixed up.

867
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:10,670
Really?

868
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:15,410
I think your memory will come back at some point if it keeps going like that.

869
01:08:15,410 --> 01:08:19,500
Right, I really hope so.

870
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:23,290
Right, can you clear your schedule for Christmas Eve?

871
01:08:23,290 --> 01:08:26,010
Christmas Eve? Why?

872
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:29,260
On that day, I'm going to get married.

873
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:33,180
What? Are you getting married?

874
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:34,670
To whom?

875
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:38,210
What do you mean, to whom? To Chief Jo Noona.

876
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:41,770
I heard I was in a relationship with her before I lost my memory.

877
01:08:41,770 --> 01:08:44,080
I heard that we promised to get married before this year passed.

878
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,720
What?

879
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:49,320
You and Chief Jo were going to get married?

880
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:52,070
Why are you so surprised? You didn't know?

881
01:08:52,070 --> 01:08:54,180
Of course, I'm surprised.

882
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:59,560
Let alone getting married, but I've never heard of you dating each other.

883
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:05,280
You told me that you were dating someone with a huge age gap.

884
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:07,600
What?

885
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:12,310
Was I dating someone much older?

886
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:14,390
No, it's not that.

887
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:20,650
You were dating a young lady who was much younger than you.

888
01:09:20,650 --> 01:09:27,390
Was I dating a young lady much younger than me?

889
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:42,780
♫ A smile blooms in every step ♫

890
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:47,500
♫ It's a shiny day because of you ♫

891
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,590
♫ It's sunshine day ♫

892
01:09:49,590 --> 01:09:56,490
♫ Strangely, I'm drawn to you ♫

893
01:09:56,490 --> 01:09:58,660
♫ Nobody will understand me ♫

894
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:01,730
[Young Lady and Gentleman]

895
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:05,930
Chief Jo Noona, I just cannot understand. I've committed a mortal sin.

896
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:07,850
What do you mean?

897
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:11,740
Does Lawyer Koh know that the much younger young woman is Ms. Park?

898
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:13,350
I will check it for myself.

899
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:15,290
I am here for an interview for the driver's position. Which way should I go?

900
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:18,630
Delicious chicken skewers are 5 thousand won for ten...

901
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:21,300
Don't think about anything else, just come with me.

902
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,370
Se Ryun.

903
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:25,380
Whatever they do with each other, why do I have to care?

904
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:27,210
Ms. Park Noona! Ms. Park Noona!

905
01:10:27,210 --> 01:10:30,770
Didn't you see me? I wanted to talk to someone about it.

906
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:33,180
It's about my friend, not me.

907
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:36,550
Your invitation for me to go to the US with you, is that still valid?

908
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:40,700
I no longer want to live trying to match a life I don't remember.

909
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:44,400
I cannot marry you, Chief Jo Noona.
