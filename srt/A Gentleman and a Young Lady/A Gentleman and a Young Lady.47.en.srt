00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
[Episode 47]

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,880
Chief Jo, you...

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,790
The child you're pregnant with...

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,670
Whose baby is it?

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,140
That baby inside of you.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,250
It's not mine.

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,470
How is that baby mine?

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,260
Tell me with your own lips.

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,070
Whose baby is it!

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,980
Chairman.

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,790
What did I do with you?

12
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,410
We didn't do anything.

13
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,290
Nothing happened between us.

14
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:46,680
I have never thought of you as a woman.

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,740
But how could you do this?

16
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,720
Are you still going to insist it's my baby?

17
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,630
Tell me clearly.

18
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:59,390
You can't lie to me anymore.

19
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,890
All my memory has come back.

20
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:15,210
Chairman...

21
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,640
It's not your child.

22
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:24,060
I'm sorry. I've done a terrible thing.

23
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,210
How can you do such a thing?

24
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,380
Why?

25
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,610
Did I ever give you any chance

26
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,140
for this to happen in the first place?

27
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,780
Did I ever do something terrible to you?

28
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:58,490
So were you trying to take revenge on me or something?

29
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,210
Tell me.

30
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,960
Why did you do this?

31
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,420
Chairman...

32
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,080
I've been in love with you.

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,160
I did it so that I could stay with you.

34
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,580
What did you say?

35
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,170
Is that the reason?

36
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,020
Is that all?

37
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,520
You turned my life upside down, and what?

38
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,280
You are insane.

39
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,020
Crazy.

40
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,940
I just wanted to be with you.

41
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,390
That's why I did it.

42
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,260
Chief Kim!

43
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,610
Yes.

44
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,730
This woman is crazy.

45
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,690
Get her out of here right now!

46
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,570
Yes, sir.

47
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,240
What's this?

48
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,620
She said she wanted to study,

49
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,520
but is that why she wanted to take English classes?

50
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,490
So she could go on a date?

51
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,260
What...

52
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:41,090
What is he doing with my innocent, Ms. Park Noona?

53
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,680
I don't think I can live in the same house as Ms. Park Noona.

54
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,160
I wait for her if she's not around.

55
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,850
I keep missing her.

56
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,330
This is something out of my control.

57
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,830
Chairman.

58
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,750
Your nose is bleeding. What should I do?

59
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:31,370
Park Dan Dan, which star are you from?

60
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,510
The way you eat cotton candy

61
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,460
looks as sweet as cotton candy.

62
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:00,240
♫  When I walk this road, it makes me cry  ♫

63
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,000
I was trying to protect your head with my hand.

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,460
Then we started rolling together and bumped our lips while bouncing!

65
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,000
But what are you accusing me of?

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,230
But then why were you looking at me for 0.00001 seconds?

67
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,020
W-Why were you looking at me?

68
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:24,230
♫ My beautiful love ♫

69
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:28,480
From now on, I'm just going to like Park Dan Dan.

70
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,260
I won't even call her Noona anymore.

71
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,480
I will call you by your name.

72
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,650
♫  The more I try to grasp it, the further it gets ♫

73
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,160
♫  Goodbye is easy  ♫

74
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,030
That's what I did when I turned 22-year-old.

75
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:50,930
I liked Ms. Park with all my heart.

76
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,670
♫ Why do you run away, love ♫

77
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:00,660
♫ Like a shy child ♫

78
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,330
♫ In case I lose it ♫

79
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,250
♫  I hold it tight  ♫

80
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,010
♫ But love always runs away ♫

81
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,450
♫ chased by longing ♫

82
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:21,800
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

83
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,610
♫ It would be nice... ♫

84
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,490
Chief Jo.

85
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,740
It's not true, right?

86
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,740
What Young Gook said earlier.

87
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:55,360
Is the baby you are carrying really not Young Gook's?

88
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,500
Chief Jo, why don't you say anything?

89
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,720
Is the baby really not Young Gook's?

90
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,140
Is it someone else's baby? Really?

91
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,940
Madam...

92
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,390
Hey, you!

93
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:17,640
You are worse than an insect.

94
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,860
How can you pretend it's his baby when it's not?

95
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,590
I lived as a mistress all my life.

96
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,040
But I never did something like that.

97
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,760
How can you?

98
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,090
How can you play with a baby's life?

99
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,120
How? Hey!

100
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,400
You are not human, are you?

101
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,610
You are not human!

102
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,030
Get out of my sight. Get out, you wench!

103
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:44,020
You wench, how can you do that with a baby?

104
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,830
Chief Kim! Mrs. Yeoju!

105
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,760
Get out. Get out now!

106
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,180
Hey, you wench.

107
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,110
What a terrible wench.

108
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,910
- Mrs. Yeoju, where is coarse salt?
- It's here, ma'am.

109
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,510
You, wench.

110
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,560
You are worse than an insect.

111
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,310
Hey, wench, get out of my sight.

112
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,010
Don't you ever come back here, you terrible wench!

113
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,750
Let's go inside.

114
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,720
Close the gate. Close the gate! How awful!

115
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,190
I'm sorry.

116
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,970
I'm sorry.

117
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,120
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,470
Let's eat.

119
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,080
It's delicious.

120
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,460
- This is it!
- This is it!

121
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,260
- Mom!
- Grandma!

122
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,460
What are you two doing?

123
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,290
You won a lottery today, getting kissed from both ends!

124
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,320
What are you doing in the middle of a meal?

125
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,410
Mom, I love you so much!

126
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,920
This is the last leg.

127
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,510
Let's try it.

128
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,430
It tastes clean.

129
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,880
What do you think?

130
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,830
Please tell us. Don't make us wait.

131
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,490
- How do you like it?
- Oppa. Uncle.

132
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,110
This is really good!

133
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,560
It perfectly suits my taste, too.

134
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,630
What do you think, Grandson-in-law?

135
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,180
It's totally daebak.

136
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,820
Let's put it on the menu right away.

137
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,840
- Okay, good.
- We got it!

138
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:13,010
We have an order. You all keep eating. I'll go for the delivery.

139
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:16,830
It's okay. Delivery is a job for a junior like me.

140
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,590
Junior? Are you a junior, Uncle?

141
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:23,030
He just started learning the work, so he is a junior.

142
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,660
Let's do it together, Uncle.

143
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,440
Enjoy!

144
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,040
Sarah!

145
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,430
Sarah, are you okay?

146
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,490
Did something happen?

147
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,990
Are you not feeling well?

148
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,560
No.

149
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,870
Nothing happened.

150
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,650
You don't look well.

151
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,070
I will help you.

152
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,750
Get out of the way. I'm fine.

153
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,320
Don't mind me.

154
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,620
You might collapse.

155
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,790
I will take you to the Chairman's house.

156
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,830
I can't go there.

157
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,910
I'm on my way out of that place.

158
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,000
Did you?

159
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,620
I will take you home then. Let's go.

160
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,340
Let go of this! I said, get out of my way!

161
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,410
Please.

162
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,120
Do not interfere in my business.

163
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,360
Why is she going into a hotel alone instead of going home?

164
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,490
What happened?

165
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,760
Something is going on for sure.

166
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:31,730
Congratulations, you made it through a terrible time.

167
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,210
Are you going to let Jo Sarah get away like that?

168
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,860
I don't think you should.

169
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,220
She should be punished by law.

170
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,910
I will start the lawsuit.

171
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,530
No.

172
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:52,270
I can't tolerate that crazy woman getting involved in my life in any way whatsoever.

173
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,000
I will just pretend I had a nightmare

174
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,780
and forget about everything.

175
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:02,260
I don't want to go through any more commotion because of her.

176
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,600
Okay, then.

177
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,250
I will just correct the article about the pregnant fiancée.

178
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,130
Okay.

179
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:16,960
What are you going to do with Ms. Park now?

180
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,510
I've broken up with her already.

181
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,010
But you've got all of your memory back.

182
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:26,200
Chief Jo's pregnancy got revealed as a lie. So why?

183
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,200
Apart from Chief Jo's case,

184
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,340
that young lady, Ms. Park,

185
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:38,050
had to go through so much trouble because of me until now.

186
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,260
She got hurt and suffered in pain.

187
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:45,030
It's all because of too many ups and downs in my life.

188
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:51,110
I don't want Ms. Park to get entangled in my life anymore.

189
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:54,140
I think letting her go like this is the right thing to do.

190
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,530
Young Gook.

191
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,970
- Dad.
- Dad.

192
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:17,900
- Dad, is it true your memory from when you turned twenty-two came back?
- Yes.

193
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,860
Does that mean all of your memory is back now?

194
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,170
Is there anything you're trying to remember anymore?

195
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,110
No, there isn't. Everything came back.

196
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,960
Congratulations to you, Dad.

197
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,190
Same here.

198
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,920
Where's Se Jong?

199
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,520
He's sleeping in his room.

200
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,350
Dad, does this mean you will get back to Ms. Park?

201
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:41,260
And we can see her too?

202
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:45,920
Children, can we have a chat in my study?

203
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,150
- Yes.
- Yes.

204
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,500
All of his memory came back?

205
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,630
What do I do now?

206
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,240
Jenny and Se Chan, it's true all of my memory has come back.

207
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,260
So Chief Jo will not come back here anymore.

208
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,110
Taking advantage of my memory loss,

209
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,020
she fabricated an unforgivable lie.

210
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,090
Dad, I'm so glad your memory is back.

211
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,590
You would've been in big trouble.

212
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,710
But even so,

213
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:34,140
Ms. Park will not be back here.

214
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:38,980
It's because Ms. Park and I have broken up already.

215
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:43,690
Dad. Wasn't it because Chief Jo Ajumma lied?

216
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,780
Now that all of her lies have been revealed,

217
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:49,380
you and Ms. Park can get back together.

218
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,120
Hey, Lee Se Chan, didn't you hear what Dad just said?

219
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,770
Dad and Ms. Park have separated.

220
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,880
Besides, does their relationship make sense?

221
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,270
Why not? Does it not make sense if you think it doesn't make sense?

222
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,560
I totally think their relationship makes sense.

223
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,090
Do I have to explain why it doesn't?

224
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:11,720
Hey, Dad is not a university student, open to dating just anyone.

225
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,830
He has to find someone who would be our mother.

226
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:17,450
But how can Ms. Park be our mother?

227
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:21,260
She's only thirteen years older than me. She's an Unni to me.

228
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,440
Children. That's enough.

229
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,700
I won't be seeing Ms. Park again.

230
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,980
So, Jenny, don't worry.

231
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,470
Dad, you made the right decision.

232
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,450
Ms. Park is not compatible with you as your girlfriend.

233
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:41,390
You have to think of your age and us, your children.

234
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:46,670
So I think you have to cautiously date someone who can be our mother as well.

235
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:50,500
Someone young like Ms. Park becoming our mom is a bit farfetched.

236
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,800
Why is age important in love?

237
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,910
Your heart is the important thing. And your soul too.

238
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:00,080
If Dad gives up his love because of us, would that make you happy?

239
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,720
What do you know about love when you're only a kid?

240
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,030
What? Then are you old enough to know?

241
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,770
Do you want to die?

242
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,870
Lee Jenny. Lee Se Chan!

243
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,640
At any rate, please consider what I said.

244
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,160
I will go upstairs first.

245
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,890
Se Chan.

246
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,150
Let's not talk bout Ms. Park anymore.

247
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,770
And if Se Jong looks for Ms. Park,

248
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,410
can you explain it well to him?

249
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:42,790
If not, it will be hard for both Ms. Park and me.

250
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,790
Okay?

251
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,470
Okay.

252
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,170
Aren't you cold? Isn't it a bit drafty?

253
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:11,010
No, I'm not cold at all.

254
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,400
It's warm and cozy.

255
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,560
Really?

256
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,640
Yes, really.

257
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,070
If I may confess to you,

258
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:28,460
I'm happy for the first time in my entire life.

259
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,300
Is that true?

260
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:35,100
Yes, sincerely.

261
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,490
Se Ryun.

262
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:44,040
Ah, seriously, who's calling me?

263
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,900
- Ah, really.
- Who is it?

264
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,050
- Who is it?
- My mom.

265
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,450
Oh, it's Mother-in-law.

266
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,260
Why won't you?

267
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,500
I was just fooling with you.

268
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,350
What? Were you fooling with me?

269
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,890
My baby Bambi!

270
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,250
- Ah, honestly.
 - The person you are trying to reach is unavailable...

271
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,570
Why isn't Se Ryun answering her phone?

272
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:17,600
I need her here to survive.

273
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,450
Why is Young Gook so quiet when his memory is back?

274
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,270
It's scarier because he's quiet.

275
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,170
Why are you knocking so harshly?

276
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,820
I thought you were breaking the door.

277
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,330
Ajumeoni.

278
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,510
Why did you do it back then?

279
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,850
What? What about it?

280
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,750
When I lost my memory and turned into a 22-year-old,

281
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,780
you took advantage of my memory loss

282
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,600
and told me that Chief Jo and I were promised to marry each other.

283
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,440
And you made me get engaged to her.

284
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,300
Did you conspire with Chief Jo and make me do it deliberately?

285
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,030
Including what Chief Jo did now?

286
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:08,160
Hey, hey. No, I didn't do that!

287
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,330
You weren't the only one who got fooled by Chief Jo.

288
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,200
I was deceived too.

289
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,480
She told me that she was in a relationship with you.

290
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,220
And I trusted her words that you'd promised to marry each other.

291
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,020
And what happened this time, that she scammed you with a baby?

292
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,460
I'm speechless from the shock.

293
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,020
Isn't that something a human shouldn't do?

294
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:34,180
So, I slapped her and kicked her out of the house.

295
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,190
And I sprayed her with coarse salt too.

296
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,340
I made sure she never came near here again.

297
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,040
That startled me.

298
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,880
I can't stop shaking.

299
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,870
I barely made it.

300
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:56,640
But because I slapped her,

301
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,720
is Chief Jo going to tell Young Gook that I conspired it with her for their engagement?

302
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,990
I doubt it. If she's a human, she can't do that.

303
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,970
That's right. No, no. I'm sure.

304
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,080
Oh, I'm startled.

305
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,190
What is it, Mom?

306
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:03,030
Hey, you... Why didn't you pick up? Why was your phone off?

307
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,730
Do you know what happened at home?

308
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,710
What happened?

309
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,610
What? Oppa's memories when he turned 22 all came back?

310
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:14,360
Are you serious?

311
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:20,720
Mom, but what do you mean by that?

312
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,810
The baby Chief Jo's pregnant is not my brother's baby?

313
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,880
Are you saying Chief Jo lied all that?

314
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,560
How could she lie about that?

315
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,910
That's ridiculous.

316
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:42,170
Mom, I have to hang up. I'll call you later.

317
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:47,220
What was all that? Did Chairman Lee's memory come back?

318
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,310
But what do you mean Chief Jo's baby isn't Chairman Lee's?

319
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,890
What do you mean it was all lie?

320
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:57,880
Yes, Se Ryun. Tell us. What was that about?

321
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:03,200
Well... Apparently, Chief Jo's baby isn't my brother's.

322
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,400
What?

323
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,740
Oh, my!

324
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:14,030
She got pregnant with another man's child and lied until now using my brother's memory loss.

325
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:18,680
As soon as my brother regained his memory, the lies were exposed.

326
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:24,280
So her coming to our house and crying was all a show?

327
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,360
She's really evil.

328
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:33,030
My goodness. How could she tell a lie like that?

329
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,400
She must be crazy.

330
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,090
Yes. She is crazy.

331
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:42,210
My brother went through so much pain because of this.

332
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:45,870
My goodness. I'm speechless.

333
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:49,730
Then whose child is it?

334
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,840
She wouldn't say.

335
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,920
Anyway, so my brother chased Chief Jo out.

336
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,610
What's going on?

337
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:03,380
I mean, we said mean things to Chairman Lee when he did nothing wrong.

338
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,900
It's a relief that his memory came back and solved all misunderstandings.

339
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:13,280
Daughter-in-law, and everyone else here, all of this is a secret to Dan Dan.

340
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,580
Dan Dan will try to meet Chairman Lee again if she learns about this.

341
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,950
So please keep it a secret from her.

342
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:22,780
But Honey, do you think Dan Dan won't find out just because we keep it a secret?

343
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,900
Now's not the time, even if she learns about it later.

344
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,760
He's right. Dan Dan has finally put herself together.

345
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,860
All of us should be careful of our words.

346
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:40,280
Act like you don't know anything for a while, okay?

347
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,200
Okay, I will.

348
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,960
It's unbelievable and makes me shake the more I think about it.

349
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:51,830
How could she get pregnant with someone else's child and make a scene saying it's Chairman Lee's child?

350
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:54,210
Scary, scary. She's a very scary woman.

351
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,940
By the way, where did Geon go?

352
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,730
What?

353
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:01,920
- Where did he go?
- He was just here.

354
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,750
Se Jong!

355
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,620
Chief Jo Ajumma.

356
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:38,920
What's going on?

357
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:46,170
I'm sorry, I have something to take care of,

358
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:49,000
so I'm going to be going someplace very far.

359
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,330
I don't think I'll ever be able to see you again.

360
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:59,390
Today is probably the last day.

361
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:03,110
So I came to say goodbye.

362
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:06,030
Really?

363
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,110
Yes.

364
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:14,930
Se Jong, eat well, sleep well,

365
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:18,210
and grow up healthy, okay?

366
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:23,780
You'll be a great person when you grow up.

367
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,490
My Se Jong...

368
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,920
Live well and happily, okay?

369
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:37,290
Okay. I hope you live happily, too.

370
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:02,460
That's a strange picture.

371
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,900
When I don't know where she dumped my child away,

372
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,690
but she's crying and making a fuss over someone else's child.

373
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,420
Wait a minute,

374
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,160
what is this?

375
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,880
Ms. Sarah!

376
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,560
Ms. Jo Sarah!

377
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:34,950
I saw her leave a few moments ago.

378
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,120
Oh, okay.

379
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,900
Ajussi...

380
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,900
Sarah...

381
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:01,640
I heard that baby... is not the Chairman's child.

382
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:07,500
I heard you left that house because of that. Is that true?

383
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:16,750
That child... is mine, isn't it?

384
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:19,260
It's my baby, isn't it?

385
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:28,820
Is it really...

386
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,570
Is it really mine?

387
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,600
How could you!?

388
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,980
How could you do this!?

389
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:47,160
How could you do such a thing with my child!?

390
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,390
I'm sorry.

391
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,960
Ajussi...

392
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:03,590
I'm so sorry.

393
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,880
Sorry?

394
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,430
You're sorry?

395
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:22,090
Is this something you can get away with by just saying you're sorry?

396
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:26,730
Do you even hear what you're saying!? Why did you..!

397
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:29,280
Why did you do such a thing?

398
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:36,670
I wanted to be next to my Se Jong.

399
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,270
That's why.

400
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:50,130
What are you talking about?

401
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:53,750
Se Jong, the Chairman's son...

402
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:01,440
He is my child.

403
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:09,910
I left Se Jong... at the Chairman's doorstep when he was a newborn baby.

404
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:14,260
So I wanted to be next to Se Jong.

405
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,970
I wanted to get married to the Chairman,

406
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:23,540
and I wanted to become Se Jong's mother.

407
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,600
That's why I did it.

408
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,550
Then...

409
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:39,470
That child you said was dead was... Se Jong?

410
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:43,020
Yes, that's right.

411
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:48,470
I wanted to raise this child and Se Jong...

412
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:51,980
in that house.

413
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,210
That's why I did it.

414
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:57,590
Do you...

415
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:00,770
Do you think that makes any sense?

416
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:08,190
Even so, how could you... do such a thing with a child?

417
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:14,680
Then...

418
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:21,750
What does that make our child?

419
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:25,420
What does that make my child!?

420
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,890
I'm sorry.

421
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,850
I'm sorry.

422
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:38,810
I deserve any punishment from you.

423
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:41,040
Do what you will.

424
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,730
Do what you wish.

425
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,950
You...

426
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,780
You're such a...

427
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,940
You are such a bad woman.

428
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,400
Mom, Grandma!

429
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,300
You're here, Dan Dan.

430
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,130
- What is that?
- It's kimchi pancakes and potato pancakes.

431
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,920
Did you make that?

432
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,390
I made it for fun, so you can have it as a snack.

433
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:54,910
Dad, brother, come here and try some of this.

434
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:57,540
Dan Dan, what are you doing here?

435
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,780
I told you to rest at home and study like you like to do.

436
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,810
If the daughter of the business owner doesn't help, who else would?

437
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:07,610
And also, I'm going to meet up with Hyun Bin Sunbae here today.

438
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:11,550
Are you meeting with Hyun Bin?

439
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,230
- Hello.
- Welcome.

440
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,900
Hello, future attorney.

441
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,620
Oh, please stop it.

442
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,850
- Let's go, Sunbae.
- Wait.

443
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,960
Where are you two going today?

444
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,800
I'm taking Dan Dan to a celebration for my school's Sunbae's publishing.

445
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,230
- I want to introduce her to the school Sunbaes too.
- Oh, really?

446
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,110
That's a great occasion. Go ahead.

447
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:35,280
I'll be back. Bye.

448
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,230
Have a nice day.

449
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:43,520
I think Dan Dan really doesn't know anything about Chairman Lee regained his memory.

450
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,320
I guess now she's really not in any contact with him at all.

451
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,750
You're talking nonsense.

452
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,950
People who broke up don't need to be in contact.

453
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,710
[Brother's Jokbal]

454
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:03,550
They are going together again today.

455
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:08,340
I wonder if they're making excuses to go on dates.

456
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,080
He said they're going to a publishing party.

457
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,250
Hyun Bin didn't say it's a date yet,

458
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,500
so don't assume.

459
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,230
I'm saying not to get ahead of yourself!

460
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,340
Hey there, Mr. Park.

461
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:28,820
The more I look at them, Hyun Bin and your daughter

462
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:32,990
look so good together.

463
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:39,710
Yes. It's great to just look at the two youths heading off.

464
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,910
Right?

465
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,260
Thank you, Young Gook Sunbae, Jung Woo Sunbae.

466
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,250
You showed up even though you were so busy.

467
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:51,170
How could we miss it? You hold on to grudges for a long time.

468
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:55,290
That's true. I hold on hard.

469
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:58,990
Young Gook Sunbae, our Hoobaes are so grateful for you.

470
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,080
You always support us writers.

471
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,230
It's nothing.

472
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:13,410
- Congratulations, Sunbae.
- Oh, Hyun Bin, thank you.

473
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:17,010
Hello.

474
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:22,010
Hello. Long time no see.

475
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,990
Jung Woo, Young Gook!

476
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,650
Yes! Hey.

477
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,960
- Dae Won is calling for us. Let's go.
- Okay.

478
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:36,390
Dan Dan, say hello. Sunbae, this is Park Dan Dan.

479
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:39,350
She's a Hoobae who was a part of our Poetry Lover's club for a little bit.

480
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,220
Oh, really?

481
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,230
Nice to meet you, and thank you for coming.

482
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:47,370
Congratulations on publishing, Sunbaenim.

483
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:50,080
Hoobaenim, thank you so much.

484
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,180
You're welcome.

485
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,150
Have you... been well?

486
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,500
Yes.

487
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,740
I'm doing well.

488
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,530
How are you?

489
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,310
I'm doing well, too.

490
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:54,350
Don't worry about me.

491
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:57,150
I'm really doing okay.

492
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:02,000
I thought I'd have a very hard time if I broke up with you,

493
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,540
but I was surprisingly okay.

494
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:10,930
I met friends that I hadn't seen in a while and studied things I hadn't done.

495
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:15,930
There's so much to do that 24 hours in a day is too short.

496
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:18,520
So, Chairman,

497
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,730
I'm doing well,

498
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:25,130
so you worry about yourself.

499
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:27,610
I'm going to go now.

500
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,040
Dan Dan.

501
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,010
What's wrong? Why are you leaving already?

502
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:45,420
Let's leave after we watch the poetry reading.

503
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,010
I'm sorry, Sunbae.

504
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:50,380
I forgot I had something important planned.

505
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:54,030
Really? Well, too bad.

506
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,480
I'll see you later, then.

507
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,670
Yes. Sunbae, I'll get going first.

508
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,550
See you at work tomorrow.

509
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,540
Okay, get home safe.

510
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:48,380
I'm actually not doing well.

511
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:54,320
I'm not doing well at all.

512
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:56,940
And...

513
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:02,610
I missed you.

514
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,180
I can't believe my Sarah is pregnant with Chairman Lee's child.

515
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:24,730
What a relief that she can live with Se Jong for the rest of her life.

516
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:27,690
My mom must've helped from heaven.

517
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:30,090
She must've felt bad for Sarah.

518
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:32,810
Mom, thank you.

519
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,990
Hey! Lee Gi Ja!

520
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:38,050
You surprised me. Why? What?

521
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:42,710
Hey! How could you do that?!

522
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:45,330
You knew all of it, didn't you?

523
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:49,470
Of course, you couldn't have not known.

524
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:57,100
Where's your daughter? Where's this girl, Sarah?

525
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:02,640
Why are you like this all of a sudden? Why are you looking for Sarah here?

526
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,800
She's at Chairman Lee's house.

527
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,610
Wow, you're so thick-skinned.

528
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:12,860
I know Sarah was kicked out of his house. How dare you try to lie to me.

529
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,840
Where did you hide Sarah?!

530
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:20,310
Tell me now before I pull all of your hair out.

531
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:24,860
What did you say? Sarah got kicked out?

532
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:28,390
Saying it's Chairman Lee's child when she was pregnant with someone else's child...

533
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:31,380
How dare you say such a dirty lie?!

534
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,490
H-hey... What are you..?

535
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,910
Mi Sook, what are you talking about?

536
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:39,530
Sarah did what?

537
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:43,360
I'm too scared to live with you two anymore.

538
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,700
So leave my house right away. And don't come over that veranda!

539
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,220
Do you understand?

540
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:53,050
What do you mean Sarah is pregnant with someone else's child!?

541
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,450
Kicked out!?

542
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,560
Yes!

543
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,370
How can she do such a horrible thing as a human?

544
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:04,410
And she shamelessly came to Soo Chul and threatened him,

545
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:06,690
and made him kneel in front of her.

546
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:11,280
Also, she bruised my Dan Dan's heart.

547
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,070
Really!

548
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:20,750
I've never seen such a sight in my life!

549
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:23,170
Hey...

550
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:27,600
W-w-what is this all about? Did my Sarah get kicked out?

551
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,180
Why does this keep drooping? It's so upsetting, really.

552
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,150
Hey! Wang Dae Ran! Come out here!

553
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,010
- Come out! 
- What is that sound?

554
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:38,760
Hey! Hey.

555
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,560
Wow, you...

556
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,600
How dare you come here?

557
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:47,430
Hey, where's my Sarah? I'm asking, where's my Sarah!

558
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:52,300
Hey! Why are you looking for your daughter here?

559
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,230
Lee Gi Ja. How could you make such a scam?

560
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,870
You knew, didn't you?

561
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:02,660
How shameless of you to come here after she said someone else's child is Young Gook's?

562
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:06,420
You're so thick-skinned. Go, get out.

563
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:11,010
Wang Dae Ran, this is all your fault!

564
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:13,760
Sarah found peace and was living well after she left this house,

565
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,190
but you lured her to become the missus,

566
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:21,710
saying Chairman Lee's memory is lost!

567
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:24,720
You said you wanted a daughter-in-law that would take your side,

568
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,030
and told her to win the 22-year-old Chairman Lee's heart, didn't you!

569
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:29,920
You did!

570
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,180
Because you lured my Sarah now she's in this position!

571
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:39,050
What are you going to do about my Sarah? Take responsibility for her!

572
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,220
I'm telling you! Take responsibility!

573
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,290
You damn witch!

574
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:46,390
What is all this about?

575
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,640
Great timing.

576
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,910
Chairman Lee, listen to me.

577
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:56,200
Look here, what this is...

578
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,830
Is everything that she said true?

579
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:00,540
Is it?!

580
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:04,030
It's... Young Gook...

581
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:07,950
I'm sorry, forgive me. Please, I'm sorry.

582
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,920
Please spare me.

583
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,930
Please, forgive me, please.

584
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:17,170
It's all true. All of this, this wench lured my Sarah and did this!

585
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:21,660
Kick her out! Kick her out right now!

586
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,050
Don't ever forgive her!

587
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:24,420
Shut up!

588
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,410
I won't shut up!

589
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:28,170
I'm so cold.

590
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,670
Mom! Mom! What happened!?

591
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,870
What's going on?

592
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:36,500
I was kicked out by your brother. I couldn't bring anything.

593
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:40,590
I couldn't even grab my wallet, and I'm lucky I got this sock on.

594
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:43,610
Can you pay for the cab?

595
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:46,580
What?

596
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:51,130
So you lured Chief Jo...

597
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:53,890
Because Oppa lost his memory,

598
00:44:53,890 --> 00:45:00,890
you lied about Chief Jo and Oppa being in a relationship and tried to make them get engaged?

599
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:05,810
And the person who came up with this idea in the first place was you?

600
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:08,690
Yes...

601
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:11,480
I was in that house my whole life,

602
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,990
but I had no power,

603
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:17,490
and Young Gook wouldn't increase my allowance...

604
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:22,990
I thought maybe I'd be able to live comfortably in that house if Chief Jo became my daughter-in-law.

605
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:25,080
That's why I did it.

606
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:28,300
Mom, do you think that makes any sense!

607
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:33,160
How could you tell such a lie!?

608
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:37,560
I hate you so much now.

609
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,240
I'm so disgusted that I can't even look at you anymore.

610
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,920
Mom, leave.

611
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,750
I don't even want to look at you anymore!

612
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:48,970
How could you do such a thing!?

613
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:54,860
Oppa was in so much pain because of that!

614
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,940
I did it wrong.

615
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:01,260
Even so, how could you do this to me too? I'm your mother!

616
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:04,460
How can you call yourself mother!? I don't want a con artist as a mom.

617
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,430
Go, Mom. Get out, now!

618
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,800
Why are you doing this!?

619
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,330
Get out right now, I said!!

620
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:10,920
Se Ryun! Se Ryun!

621
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,490
- Se Ryun, please stop!
- Get out!

622
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:15,210
You're not my mom!

623
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:16,870
Se Ryun, why are you doing this? Stop.

624
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:22,190
She must've had nowhere else to go to come here.

625
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:24,040
Mom, go!

626
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,100
Go now! Get out!

627
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,760
You're not my mom!

628
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,150
Se Ryun, stop for a second.

629
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:34,070
Really! How can you do this!

630
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:39,530
How could she do that? Isn't she afraid of higher powers?

631
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:41,690
It's really unbelievable.

632
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:45,540
But it'll be bad if Soo Chul and Dan Dan learn about this.

633
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,610
I'm back.

634
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:51,090
Hey, Dan Dan, you're here!

635
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:52,730
Mom!

636
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:54,220
Be quiet, quiet.

637
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:56,930
My leg...

638
00:46:56,930 --> 00:47:00,230
Mom, Grandma, did something happen?

639
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:04,850
No, nothing happened. Go on and get some rest.

640
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:06,770
Okay.

641
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:15,490
In-law, I'm sorry but keep it down. Dan Dan's home.

642
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:21,380
My husband won't just sit back if Dan Dan learns about all of this. You'll be in big trouble.

643
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,620
What is she talking about?

644
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:32,490
Dan Dan doesn't know anything about Oppa getting his memory back.

645
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:36,120
Father-in-law said to keep it a secret from her,

646
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,930
because she can't get back together with Oppa.

647
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:45,140
But if Ms. Park learns that you were kicked out in the middle of the night, she will be curious.

648
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:47,910
What if she finds out because of that!?

649
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:50,550
Do you know how scary my father-in-law is!?

650
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:52,910
I know, I know!

651
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:58,190
Do I need to go then?

652
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:02,340
I can't live peacefully because of you!

653
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:05,210
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

654
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,990
Go. I'll try talking to Oppa.

655
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,710
Really? Really?

656
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:16,130
Se Ryun, thank you. Thank you!

657
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:21,210
You're going to help me, right? Thank you!

658
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:22,870
I'm so glad.

659
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:28,200
Oppa... I'm so sorry.

660
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,730
I'll apologize in her place.

661
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:36,920
Please forgive my mom just once for me.

662
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:41,360
Mom didn't know it would turn out this way.

663
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:47,240
Chief Jo was here for a long time and was good to the kids, so she wanted her to end up with you.

664
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,720
She really didn't mean any harm.

665
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:55,950
And she didn't even dream that Chief Jo would come into this house using such lies.

666
00:48:55,950 --> 00:49:00,960
Oppa... Please forgive my mom one last time. It'll be the last time.

667
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,860
If she does this again, I said I wouldn't forgive her anymore.

668
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:09,210
So Oppa...

669
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:15,400
I get it, so why don't you go home?

670
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,010
Oppa, I'm sorry.

671
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:21,140
I'm sorry for making you suffer.

672
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:27,190
Oh, Se Ryun.

673
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,400
Se Ryun, what did your brother say?

674
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,700
Did he tell me to leave? Did he tell me to pack?

675
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,590
Mom, this is really the last time.

676
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:40,360
I'm telling you clearly,

677
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,860
if you do this again, I'm not going to see you ever again.

678
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:48,110
Okay. How could something like this happen again?

679
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,920
So... I can live here, right?

680
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,360
You got a firm answer from your brother, right?

681
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,520
I'm so ashamed to see his face.

682
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,370
What is all this!?

683
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:01,030
I'm sorry.

684
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:08,670
But today, I learned again that you're the only one I have.

685
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:11,490
Mom, be good to Oppa.

686
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:16,510
With sincerity. I'm begging you.

687
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:19,680
Okay, okay.

688
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:30,090
I made it. I made it.

689
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:32,740
I'm okay now.

690
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:45,650
Congratulations, Sunbae.

691
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:48,020
Oh, Hyun Bin, thank you.

692
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,870
Hello.

693
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:56,850
Hello. Long time no see.

694
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:04,330
"Long time no see?" That's strange.

695
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:08,510
Chairman only met Hyun Bin Sunbae when he turned 22-year-old.

696
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:12,230
How is it "long time no see?"

697
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:18,010
Did his memory from that time come back?

698
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,300
No.

699
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:28,990
If Chairman remembered, I'd be the first one he'd tell.

700
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:32,560
Maybe it was just an expression.

701
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:48,400
Don't worry about me. I'm really doing okay.

702
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,290
I thought I'd have a very hard time if I broke up with you,

703
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:57,200
but I was surprisingly okay.

704
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,840
So, Chairman,

705
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:05,480
I'm doing well, so you worry about yourself.

706
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:46,160
Sarah, you should've come to me if something like that happened.

00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,170
Where have you been?

708
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:52,310
Because of you, I was worried and almost died!

I understand. Okay.

712
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,410
Sure, but let me ask you this one thing.

713
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:07,180
The baby you are pregnant with,

714
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:09,390
if it's not Chairman Lee's, then whose is it?

715
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:11,690
Is it Driver Cha's child?

716
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:16,830
No. It's not someone else child, but it's my baby. It's my baby!

717
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:20,820
Is there any child who doesn't have a father in this world?

718
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:26,800
When that child grows up and later asks about their father, do you plan to tell like that?

719
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,260
Yes, I'll do that. I'll say it like that!

720
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,130
Sarah, Sarah!!

721
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:35,980
How could you do such a thing to your child?!

722
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:42,640
Until now, I was always on your side no matter what you did.

723
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,030
But this is not right. This is wrong.

724
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:48,320
When you give birth to the child,

725
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:52,110
they will find out immediately if you get a DNA test.

726
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:54,630
This is wrong.

727
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:58,870
Why did you do such a stupid thing?

728
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:05,650
I just wanted to stay beside Se Jong.

729
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:08,930
Even for just a few months,

730
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:13,780
I just wanted to live with Se Jong.

731
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:19,660
And I thought I could get Chairman's heart in the meantime. If I can get his heart,

732
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:24,580
my Se Jong and this baby can live together.

733

You're crazy, totally crazy now.

Hey, how many times did I tell you?

737
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:39,670
It will be best for Se Jong to live in that house,

738
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:43,540
so we shall leave far from here. How many times did I tell you this?

739
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:48,200
If we had gone away that time, this would've not happened!

What are you going to do now?

741
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:56,500
What will you do now when you're pregnant with a baby without a father!

742
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,470
Please don't worry about me!!

743
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:00,320
I'll grow my baby. I'll do it all!

744
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:05,840
So I will not ask for help from you. Please don't worry about me!!

Dad, Ajussi, who knows Chief Jo Ajumma,

752
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:40,440
pulled out my hair here.

Ajussi, who knows Chief Jo pulled out your hair?

755
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:53,170
Yes, Dad. When I was playing with my friends at the kindergarten playground

756
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:55,940
that Ajussi called me, so I went over.

757
00:55:55,940 --> 00:56:01,720
He suddenly grabbed and pulled out my hair.

758
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,530
Is it true?

759
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:07,570
Is he really someone that Chief Jo knows?

760
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:12,890
Yes. When I was coming home from kindergarten with Chief Jo a long time ago,

761
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:16,890
I saw that Ajussi in front of our house.

Oppa.

811
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:53,340
Sang Goo Oppa. If I gather everything I have,

812
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:57,250
I can get up to 300 million. I'll give you all of it,

813
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:59,560
so promise me you won't show up again.

814
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,780
Let's end it with this, okay?

815
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:06,340
Of course, Sarah. I can promise that!

816
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:08,720
My broken heart won't heal with 300 million won.

817
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,360
But yes, for our son's happiness.

818
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:15,610
And to respect your effort, I'll put all of this behind me and forget about it.

819
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:20,510
In return, you have to send that money to me immediately.

820
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:24,090
Yes, I will.

821
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:26,620

Come and have a seat.

824
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:01,270
I came here to meet up with my dad.

825
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:05,600
Dan Dan, your dad arranged this meeting for us today.

826
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:09,330
So let's talk.

827
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:11,880
My dad arranged this?

828
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:17,720
I have nothing to talk about with you, CEO.

Dan Dan, can't you please give me one more chance?

832
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:38,530
What chance? You abandoned me before, and why are you acting like this now?

833
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:44,880
Dan Dan, come to the US with me.

834
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,860
For the things that I couldn't provide to you, everything that I'm sorry for you,

835
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:52,090
I want to make it up for you.

836
01:01:52,090 --> 01:01:56,000
I want to make up for everything I did wrong to you.

837
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,850
Come with me, your mom.

838
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:05,990
You're selfish until the very end.

839
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:09,000
You're just doing this to make yourself feel better, aren't you?

840
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,480
I refuse.

841
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:16,700
I don't have any intention of making you feel even slightly better.

842
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:19,850
I don't ever want to see you again.

843
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,300
"Mom?"

844
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:30,570
The only mom I have is the one who raised me since I was a baby.

845
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:33,610
She's my only mom.

846
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:40,630
Dan Dan.

847
01:03:22,610 --> 01:03:25,710
Dad!

848
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:29,800
Dan Dan, why are you already here?

849
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:36,200
Why are you doing this to me, Dad? Why do I have to meet that woman?

850
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:41,380
Dan Dan... She's still your birth mother.

851
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:44,010
She regrets it a lot.

852
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:48,800
She begged me for forgiveness, and she feels very sorry towards you.

853
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,840
She wants to do whatever it takes to make it up to you.

854
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:55,810
That's why I arranged for you two to meet and talk over a meal.

855
01:03:55,810 --> 01:03:58,110
Did you leave right away without eating?

856
01:03:58,110 --> 01:04:02,470
Dad, why do I have to eat with that woman?

857
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:06,530
What about what you've been telling me all this time? You said she died.

858
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:12,540
You hated her so much that for 27 years, you didn't even let me see a picture of her.

859
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:17,330
But now, you want me to sit and have a meal with her?

860
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:23,780
That's because... there's so much I haven't been able to do for you.

861
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:26,280
That's why I did that.

862
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:29,100
What?

863
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:32,640
I've only made you suffer.

864
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:39,010
But your mother can do many things for you.

865
01:04:39,010 --> 01:04:43,730
No amount of money in the world can make me forgive the mother who abandoned me!

866
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:46,950
Besides, what haven't you been able to do for me?

867
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:51,160
You stayed with me and raised me all these years!

Dan Dan...

So don't ever make me meet that woman again.

870
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:58,770
Okay?

871
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:29,580
Ms. Park, can I hug you for once?

872
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:34,540
Sure.

873
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:52,720
Ms. Park... if things get tough for you here, you can call me anytime.

Don't forget that I'm always here for you.

No.

What nonsense are you saying now?!

903

I said that petty 300 million won isn't enough!
