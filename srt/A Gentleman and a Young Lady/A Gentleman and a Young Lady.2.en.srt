00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,510
Stop right there!
 [Episode 2]

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,100
Young lady!

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,100
You shouldn't go in there!

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,420
Young lady!

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,580
- Young lady!
- Please, somebody save me!

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,810
It is dangerous!

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,740
You crazy man!

8
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,700
Save me!

9
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,440
Excuse me?

10
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,690
Hello?

11
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,420
Is he... dead?

12
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,950
What is this?

13
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,970
Did I just...

14
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,400
killed a person?

15
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,130
Did I?

16
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,970
Is this 112?
 [T/N: 112 is the number to call the police in Korea.]

17
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,830
Yes this is 112, please speak.

18
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:00,010
Hello? Please tell me what's going on!

19
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,660
Please hurry up and come here.

20
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,130
Hurry!

21
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,290
Careful!

22
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,940
I really didn't do it on purpose.

23
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,760
That crazy perverted man was coming after me.

24
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,870
Without me knowing,

25
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,100
with this tumbler, I once,

26
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,000
not even twice, hit him.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,850
Where is it? Are you sure it was here?

28
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,480
Yes. I think so. This way is right.

29
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,850
If only that perverted crazy man didn't follow me,

30
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,920
something like this would've not happened. Trust me!

31
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,880
Please believe me.

32
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:00,760
That person isn't dead.

33
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,310
He didn't die.

34
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,430
God, thank you!

35
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,950
It is that person. He didn't die.

36
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,810
He didn't die.

37
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,580
Who are you?

38
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,150
It is this person! This person!

39
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,610
He is a perverted guy who followed me.

40
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,470
What? Perverted?

41
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,650
Are you talking to me right now?

42
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:35,540
You were calling me 'Young lady' and followed me and tried to harass me earlier!

43
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,050
It's so absurd that I can't speak.

44
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,420
Is that this person is saying true?

45
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,620
It's not true.

46
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,840
Who are you to say that?

47
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,310
I was trying to help you in danger.

48
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:56,480
After this attack, you don't even apologize, and

49
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,450
you say that I did what?

50
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,580
Excuse me. What do you mean dangerous situation?

51
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:08,180
This lady did not see the Forbidden, Danger Zone sign.

52
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,400
It's a cliff there, so there was a fatal accident that happened recently as well.

53
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,530
So I was trying to help her not to get into an accident.

54
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,550
Then suddenly she hit me with something.

55
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,940
Danger zone? Forbidden Area? I can't believe this.

56
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,110
How are you saying such obvious lies?

57
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,020
This man is lying!

58
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,630
Danger Zone, and Forbidden signs weren't there!

59
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,310
Then we can go and check.

60
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,760
Then we can see who is lying right away.

61
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,390
Sure! Let's go right now!

62
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:45,320
You are about to be caught!

63
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:51,720
[Do Not Enter: This section is restricted from entering.]

64
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,500
How did this happen?

65
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,510
This sign was really not here.

66
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,320
Why did I not see it?

67
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,310
Why?

68
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,530
Are you going to say that I installed it?

69
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,040
No, that's not it.

70
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,670
It is such a big sign,

71
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:14,700
but the fact that I didn't see it is astonishing.

72
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,380
Officer, there is alcohol in here.

73
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,420
Excuse me.

74
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,750
Did you drink alcohol in the mountain?

75
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,210
That is...Something bad happened today.

76
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:41,590
I just had one sip. Just one sip.

77
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,550
My goodness, this Young lady.

78
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,930
Don't you know that you cannot have alcohol in the mountains?

79
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,560
I am sorry.

80
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,140
I am a bit weak with alcohol.

81
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,880
So,

82
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,860
is it true that this man did something bad to you?

83
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,890
I'm sorry?

84
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,980
Hey, there!

85
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,330
You can't go in there!
[Danger: Do Not Enter]

86

- Why is he coming this way? What is wrong with him?
- Excuse me, Young lady!

87
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,030
Young lady!

88
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,810
No, I think he was just calling out to me.

89
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,830
You just think so?

90
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,610
No, he didn't do anything bad.

91
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,470
He said it was dangerous, and don't go.

92
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:40,210
I am so sorry. So sorry.

93
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,230
Lawyer Koh, it's me...

94
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:51,890
You will have to come here right now. I will call again later.

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,240
I'll sue her for detriment, defamation, and false accusation of an innocent person.

96
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,160
Let's do with by the law.

97
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,870
I can't let this pass.

98
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,900
You will have to come to the police station with me.

99
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,610
Let's go, come on.

100
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,310
What do I do?

101
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,990
What's that?

102
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,760
A special assault crime with the use of a weapon?

103
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,220
You hit someone with a tumbler.

104
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,590
Since your lawyer came, you can leave now.

105

Please take good care of this.

106
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,770
I am so sorry. I will repay!

107
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:46,560
Please forgive this once. Please!

108
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,860
Please don't do this here.

109
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,550
I really did something wrong.

110
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,060
You were trying to help me in a dangerous situation but I didn't even know that.

111
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:01,570
I really thought you were a crazy psychopath.

112
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,620
This lady still have not come back to her senses.

113
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,600
Please make sure you include defamation.

114
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,230
That's not it! You are so handsome!

115
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,240
In a mystery thriller or drama,

116
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,560
the psychopathic murderers are usually so handsome.

117
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,660
You are just so handsome.

118
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,270
On top of that, you are wearing a great suit.

119
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:39,760
Where there's no one in the forest, you were coming toward me, calling me Young lady,

120
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,230
so without me knowing, I thought I was part of this scary movie,

121
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,890
so that is why I did that!

122
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,400
I am so sorry!

123
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,440
Please have mercy on me.

124
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,080
Please.

125
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,960
That lady must have been really shocked after doing that to you with the tumbler.

126
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:15,630
She confessed that she killed a person. I feel bad for her.

127
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,650
Young Gook.

128
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:21,850
What should we do? Just take care of it that way?

129
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,630
Here you go.

130
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,090
Thank you! Thank you!

131
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,720
You don't need to thank me, and from now on,

132
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,170
don't drink alcohol in the mountains.

133
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,650
Yes! I will promise that.

134
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,460
Take care.

135
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,150
Lawyer, please send me your account number.

136
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,360
I want to send him the hospital expense.

137
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,990
He probably won't take that.

138
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,890
I will send him your thoughts though.

139
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,080
Take care.

140
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,820
Thank you for your hard work.

141
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:03,170
It can't be like this.

142
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:07,700
I would feel better if I at least gave him the money for the hospital.

143
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,760
My goodness, could there be something prettier than this block of gold?

144
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,580
My cute little baby!

145
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:26,070
One, two, three, four!

146
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:33,060
Smell of money is better than the smell of perfume.

147
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,350
My cute babies.

148
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,010
Hey, you old geezer.

149
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,440
Are you looking at this right now?

150
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,090
Do you see the ring that you were searching for until your death?

151
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,990
Hey, if you think it is unfair that I am wearing this ring,

152
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,610
then try to steal it by coming back from the after life.

153
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,930
You bad man. Do you see this ring?

154
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,300
Madam! There's a big problem!

155
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,130
What is it? I almost had a heart attack!

156
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,760
Is there a fire somewhere?

157
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,930
Madam... The thing is...

158
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,610
something must have happened to the Chairman outside.

159
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,180
His clothes are a mess and he also hurt his forehead.

160
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,930
What?!

161
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,620
I'm sorry!

162
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:34,750
I was just in a hurry that I forgot to knock.

163
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,410
What is it?

164
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:41,410
What do you mean? I was worried that you got hurt.

165
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:48,800
Did you go to the mountain today as well while you were at work and got hurt there?

166
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,750
That was right! I knew it.

167
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:56,200
You have to think of your children and put yourself together! How long will you be like this?

168
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,320
What is the point of thinking of someone who is dead?

169
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,740
- A dead person is a dead person.
- Can you please leave?

170
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,400
I need to change my clothes.

171
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:08,460
Oh...okay. You can change your clothes.

172
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,390
I can't believe he even locked the door! Does he think I'm going to attack him?

173
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,300
If not me, who would even worry about him?

174
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,910
Oh, Chief Jo!

175
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,630
Why did he get hurt? Did you hear something?

176
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,180
I just talked to Lawyer Koh on the phone.

177
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:35,020
He went to the mountain, and he got hit by a strange woman.

178
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,610
Oh my goodness, what crazy woman?!

179
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,160
Oh my...

180
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,680
So did they put that crazy woman in jail?

181
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,230
No. Looks like he just let it slide.

182
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,080
What?! He shouldn't let this slide.

183
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:56,650
He's too understanding, just like his Father. He's only harsh with me.

184
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,750
But shouldn't he need to go to the hospital?

185
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,760
He went to Professor Kim's hospital.

186
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,320
Professor Kim said there was nothing wrong according to the tests,

187
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,730
and that there is nothing to worry.

188
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,370
That's great.

189
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,320
That's really a relief.

190
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,640
But ma'am...

191
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,110
That ring is something I haven't seen. It is very pretty!

192
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,230
How come you didn't wear something this pretty?

193
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,990
Hey, this isn't anything special.

194
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,960
He is probably the driver who was scheduled to have an interview today.

195
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,220
Open the door for him.

196
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,810
Please come in.

197
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:47,250
You've worked as a manager at the supermarket for quite some time...

198
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,740
Why did you quit?

199
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,570
Due to the company's situation, 6 months ago,

200
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:57,170
I resigned voluntarily.

201
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,750
Then, is it first time for you to work as a personal driver?

202
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,860
I never worked as a driver before,

203
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,280
but I was a driver soldier in the army,

204
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,780
and it has been over 30 years that I had no accident while driving.

205
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,040
Ah, really?

206
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,630
You probably heard about the condition that you have to move into this house.

207
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:16,730
Sometimes there are company works, but mostly, it's the household work.

208
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,070
There is a lot of mundane works.

209
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:23,580
If you just give me the opportunity to work, I will do my best.

210
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,090
Wait...

211
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:33,300
Did Young Gook see that I was wearing this ring earlier?

212
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,500
He wouldn't have stayed still if he had seen it.

213
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,780
He would have lost his temper and kicked me out.

214
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:43,230
That was really close.

215
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,860
Yes?

216
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,470
Madam, this is the new Driver Park Soo Chul.

217
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,110
He will be working starting today.

218
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:58,350
Hello. Glad to meet you.

219
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,410
Nice to meet you, too.

220
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:03,280
Can I just comfortably call you Driver Park?

221
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,480
Yes, of course.

222
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:09,110
I was so uncomfortable lately.

223
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,830
I feel great now that Driver Park is here.

224
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,840
Oh, Mrs. Yeoju!

225
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,260
Please guide Driver Park to where he will be staying.

226
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,450
Take care of him to make sure he is comfortable.

227
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,810
Yes, Ma'am. Please follow me.

228
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,620
He looks like a good person.

229
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,460
I think you made a good choice.

230
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,110
He has a good impression and seems calm.

231
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,820
But, he does not look like he would be a driver to somebody.

232
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,760
Maybe his business went bankrupt?

233
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,680
Do you have to move into that house today?

234
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,010
Yes.

235
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,500
They told me to move in today and start working tomorrow.

236
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,660
Did you see the people at that house?

237
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,330
They're not people who abuse their power and disrespect others?

238
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:06,430
No, they seem like great people.

239
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:10,790
But are you really going to do that work?

240
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,490
I don't want you to that work.

241
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,810
What are you talking about it? Of course, I have to do it.

242
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,660
We need to make more money to live.

243
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,530
And also, the salary is almost the same as my last company's.

244
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,250
Really? They give you that much?

245
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,770
I have to be grateful and work.

246
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:30,230
It is hard to find a job like this these days.

247
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,300
Okay.

248
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,100
I guess there is no choice.

249
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,840
If you are like this, how can I leave?

250
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,210
Is it because of the moving?

251
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,300
I already took care of it with the moving company and Mr. Jang.

252
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,260
You just have to take care of your small belongings.

253
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,420
That's not it.

254
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,800
You are not the person to do that kind of job.

255
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,160
Because of me and my family, you have to do these kinds of work,

256
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,360
so I am heartbroken.

257
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,860
I said I'm fine!

258
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,210
I was just worried about how you will move on your own.

259
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,840
Dae Beom isn't picking up the phone either.

260
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:13,900
He turned off his phone. There is no signal.

261
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,890
Honey.

262
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:20,610
Do you think something happened to Dae Beom?

263
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,680
What something? You are saying nonsense.

264
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,440
No news is good news.

265
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,850
Let's just wait a bit.

266
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,750
Okay.

267
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,600
Also...

268
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,830
you didn't hear from Dan Dan too, right?

269
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,320
Yeah.

270
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,230
You know...

271
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:45,200
Until we find a new place, Mr. Jang agreed to keep our stuff in his storage.

272
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,530
I'm sorry, but why don't you stay over at your friend Hee Sook's place for now?

273
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,180
There is nothing to be sorry about to Hee Sook.

274
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,910
When she was debating whether to divorce or not,

275
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,540
she lived with us for almost a year.

276
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:02,260
But still, you should say thank you and sorry to Hee Sook.

277
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,620
Honey.

278
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,450
It is going to be hard until we get settled,

279
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,790
but let's endure through it.

280
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,200
Yes, I get it.

281
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,320
This is so pretty. Give us this too.

282
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,890
This, too.

283
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,270
Why don't you try these on?

284
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,480
Ah, okay.

285
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:43,720
Dae Beom, baby, you'll look great in any of these clothes.

286
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,930
But still, try it on.

287
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,490
I want to see how you look.

288
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,800
- Okay.
- Let's go.

289
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,250
Your boyfriend is so handsome.

290
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,920
Is he?

291
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,800
Is he handsome?

292
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,310
This is so cute.

293
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,820
Baby, baby!

294
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,560
Try this on too! This too!

295
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:19,370
Baby, your body is like the sculpture in Greece.

296
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,370
It is like an art.

297
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,150
What are you doing? I am embarrassed.

298
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,580
What if someone hears?

299
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,420
Baby.

300
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,450
What do we do?

301
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,090
You are so handsome!

302
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,880
I can't help it. Come here!

303
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,540
What is it? So crazy!

304
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,800
Oh, my goodness! What is going on?

305
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,810
Yes?

306
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,710
Chairman, please have your medicine.

307
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,570
Thank you, Chief Jo.

308
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:04,520
Are you going somewhere?

309
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,010
Chief Jo, please take care of Se Jong and the children today.

310
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,170
I have some work.

311
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,410
Don't worry about the children.

312
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:15,640
It is something I should do.

313
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,980
But Chairman, isn't it better for you to take medicine and have some rest today?

314
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,310
You went through big trouble today.

315
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,960
I am okay now.

316
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,730
Chief Jo, please take care of the children.

317
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:41,120
It does not seem to be the company work. I wonder what he is up to.

318
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:47,730
What? Were you really treated as a psychopath pervert in the mountain? Young Gook, you?

319
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,810
That really happened.

320
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,540
Okay, stop now, Lawyer Koh.

321
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,500
But that lady was really funny.

322
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,490
Or should I say she was cute?

323
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:04,520
She said in movies and dramas, the psychopath serial killers are all handsome.

324
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,790
Because Young Gook was so handsome, she mistook him as a criminal.

325
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,280
That is the honorable scar.

326
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,140
Really?

327
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,900
I shouldn't laugh, but I can't help it.

328
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,990
I'm sorry, Young Gook.

329
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,520
Lee Young Gook, you still got it.

330
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:32,080
You are over 40 years old with three kids, yet you still hear that you are handsome from a young lady in her 20s.

331
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,920
I am jealous. Very jealous.

332
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:39,510
You won't say that once you get hit by a tumbler, too.

333
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,720
Young Gook was pretty good-looking when we were in college.

334
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:53,630
Whenever the theater club had a performance, Young Gook would always be the main character.

335
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,070
Gook Hee, you were great back then too.

336
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,260
You also played a lot of the leading female characters.

337
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,550
That's true.

338
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:07,660
How did we somehow become over 40 years old now?

339
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,310
Thank you for coming today.

340
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,900
Congratulations, Author Hong Chun Sik!

341
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,580
Congratulations.

342
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,230
Should we do cheers?

343
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,740
Yes!

344
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,140
A toast to wish Young Lady and Gentleman's big success! Fighting!

345
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,940
To big success! Fighting!

346
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,690
Cheers!

347
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,380
To big success! To big success!

348
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,605
To big success!

349
00:22:31,535 --> 00:22:35,031
We'll take the pictures now.

350
00:22:36,711 --> 00:22:40,101
Are you okay?

351
00:22:40,101 --> 00:22:42,011
I'm okay.

352
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:44,451
Let me take a picture! In three, two...

353
00:22:44,451 --> 00:22:46,811
Get more closely, one, two...

354
00:22:46,811 --> 00:22:48,631
Amazing!

355
00:22:48,631 --> 00:22:52,391
Please smile! One, two!

356
00:22:52,411 --> 00:22:54,801
Let's just go simple!

357
00:22:54,861 --> 00:22:56,701
Is it Reggae music?

358
00:22:56,701 --> 00:22:59,001
That's correct!

359
00:22:59,001 --> 00:23:00,551
That's correct!

360
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:02,681
Jenny.

361
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,461
Awesome! That's crazy.

362
00:23:05,461 --> 00:23:08,771
He prepared it a lot! Wow!

363
00:23:08,771 --> 00:23:10,241
No, really...

364
00:23:10,241 --> 00:23:11,441
Lee Jenny?

365
00:23:11,531 --> 00:23:14,531
If you listen to Reggae music...

366
00:23:16,201 --> 00:23:18,161
What are you doing right now?

367
00:23:18,161 --> 00:23:21,931
Why are you coming into my room without knocking?

368
00:23:21,931 --> 00:23:27,611
I did knock. I guess you didn't hear it because you had your earbuds on.

369
00:23:27,611 --> 00:23:29,681
What is it?

370
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:35,831
Jenny, it has been more than five years since I came into this house.

371
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:39,721
I want to have a good relationship with you, like friends.

372
00:23:39,721 --> 00:23:42,841
I am busy. Please leave.

373
00:23:42,841 --> 00:23:47,781
Okay. We can talk another time.

374
00:23:47,781 --> 00:23:51,031
Don't go to bed too late.

375
00:23:55,181 --> 00:23:59,311
What is wrong with her? She's so overreacting.

376
00:24:14,461 --> 00:24:18,631
Se Chan?

377
00:24:18,631 --> 00:24:23,171
Chief Jo, I was about to do my homework.

378
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:26,371
That's okay. At your age, you should like these things.

379
00:24:26,371 --> 00:24:28,951
You can study later on.

380
00:24:28,951 --> 00:24:31,461
Chief Jo is the best!

381
00:24:31,461 --> 00:24:34,841
The best! Do more!

382
00:24:42,491 --> 00:24:45,521
Jenny and Se Chan are so tiring.

383
00:24:45,521 --> 00:24:52,651
I am going to make sure those two get sent to America to study abroad.

384
00:25:37,211 --> 00:25:40,041
One, two, three. Awesome!

385
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:42,331
We arrived, Jang Gook Hee.

386
00:25:42,331 --> 00:25:44,511
Okay, okay...

387
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:46,761
I am okay!

388
00:25:46,761 --> 00:25:50,021
- I am not drunk!
- Hey, hey!

389
00:25:50,021 --> 00:25:53,571
You are going to fall.

390
00:25:56,161 --> 00:25:58,311
I am okay.

391
00:25:58,311 --> 00:26:01,691
I said I'm fine.

392
00:26:01,691 --> 00:26:08,391
If I fall, I can just get back up again. What is the problem?

393
00:26:08,391 --> 00:26:13,561
You should get back in the car. Go! Bye!

394
00:26:13,561 --> 00:26:16,751
Oh, my goodness! Who is this?

395
00:26:16,751 --> 00:26:18,831
Unni!

396
00:26:18,831 --> 00:26:21,151
Oh, my goodness!

397
00:26:21,151 --> 00:26:24,611
How long has it been, Chairman Lee!

398
00:26:24,611 --> 00:26:29,331
What happened to your forehead?

399
00:26:29,331 --> 00:26:33,881
Hello, Noona. Please talk comfortably to me like before.

400
00:26:33,881 --> 00:26:36,941
Should I, Young Gook?

401
00:26:36,941 --> 00:26:40,431
Why are you standing here like this? Come in for a second.

402
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:44,351
No, I was going to drop Gook Hee off and leave.

403
00:26:44,351 --> 00:26:48,021
Unni! I am not drunk.

404
00:26:48,021 --> 00:26:53,211
I am not drunk at all, but he insisted he would drive me home.

405
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:56,601
You, really!

406
00:26:56,621 --> 00:26:59,051
Then I really cannot have you just leave.

407
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:01,661
Young Gook, please come in even for a little bit.

408
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,041
Just a little bit.

409
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:04,321
You, follow me!

410
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:06,511
Let's go in.

411
00:27:06,511 --> 00:27:09,621
- How long as it been?
- You.... You should go--

412
00:27:09,621 --> 00:27:11,071
How have you been?

413
00:27:11,071 --> 00:27:14,151
- Let's see each other faces more often!
- Yes.

414
00:27:14,151 --> 00:27:17,011
It's so good! Oh, my, you!

415
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:19,561
Take care of our Gook Hee, Young Gook.

416
00:27:19,561 --> 00:27:21,451
Walk straight!

417
00:27:21,451 --> 00:27:24,021
Let me go!

418
00:27:25,761 --> 00:27:27,711
Be careful of the stairs.

419
00:27:27,711 --> 00:27:35,591
The thing he needed to do was to see Gook Hee?

420
00:27:38,121 --> 00:27:43,971
Young Gook, have this snail noodle dish.

421
00:27:43,971 --> 00:27:46,271
Looking at this reminds me of the past.

422
00:27:46,271 --> 00:27:49,741
During college, you made this a lot for us.

423
00:27:49,741 --> 00:27:52,041
Do you remember that?

424
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:55,721
When you and your friends all came to our place together,

425
00:27:55,721 --> 00:28:00,401
I'd make this spicy snail noodle in a big bowl, and you all loved it!

426
00:28:00,401 --> 00:28:03,151
That's right! We did that!

427
00:28:03,151 --> 00:28:05,521
We all ate as if we starved for days.

428
00:28:05,521 --> 00:28:10,751
We would fight each other to eat more. Do you remember that?

429
00:28:10,751 --> 00:28:17,241
That feels like yesterday, but you somehow are now over 40.

430
00:28:17,241 --> 00:28:20,681
Unni, let's not talk about age.

431
00:28:20,681 --> 00:28:22,511
That is annoying.

432
00:28:22,511 --> 00:28:29,401
Also, we are only 41 years old.

433
00:28:29,401 --> 00:28:33,321
That's true. Who would think you guys are in your 40s?

434
00:28:33,321 --> 00:28:35,971
You're still a bachelor and bachelorette, right?

435
00:28:35,971 --> 00:28:41,161
Unni... did you say, "bachelor"? What kind of bachelor has three kids?

436
00:28:41,161 --> 00:28:44,101
I am a bachelorette though.

437
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:48,111
This girl doesn't know how to match the mood.

438
00:28:48,111 --> 00:28:50,791
Would it hurt her to act more lady-like?

439
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:53,691
- Mi Sook!
- Yes?

440
00:28:53,701 --> 00:28:57,301
Gi Ja, what is that?

441
00:28:57,301 --> 00:28:59,341
I-It is a side dish.

442
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:01,941
I brought some as I was making mine.

443
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:04,481
What side dish?

444
00:29:04,481 --> 00:29:08,731
Ah! You know Sarah's mom.

445
00:29:08,731 --> 00:29:11,791
Yes.

446
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:15,011
Is it stir-fried anchovies again?

447
00:29:15,011 --> 00:29:17,851
Next time, make me seasoned dried pollack.

448
00:29:17,851 --> 00:29:20,761
I still have the anchovies from last time left over.

449
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:22,561
O-Okay.

450
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:24,501
But, thank you! I will eat them well.

451
00:29:24,501 --> 00:29:27,091
Hey, you can go now.

452
00:29:27,091 --> 00:29:29,491
Thank you, Unni.

453
00:29:29,491 --> 00:29:34,041
Young Gook, please have a seat!

454
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:35,781
Why don't we gather!

455
00:29:35,781 --> 00:29:37,451
Here, everyone!

456
00:29:37,451 --> 00:29:39,111
Bottom's up!

457
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,051
Let's all do bottom's up!

458
00:29:41,051 --> 00:29:43,341
Bottom's up! Cheers!

459
00:29:43,341 --> 00:29:44,781
Hurry up and drink.

460
00:29:44,781 --> 00:29:46,341
- Seriously.
- Aren't you drinking too much today?

461
00:29:46,341 --> 00:29:52,031
Sarah is working hard at his place, but he is having fun here.

462
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:53,881
Darn it!

463
00:29:53,881 --> 00:29:56,071
Let's drink up!

Do you know who's at Mi Sook's house right now?

470
00:30:14,131 --> 00:30:15,631
It's Chairman Lee Young Gook!

471
00:30:15,631 --> 00:30:21,761
Chairman Lee Young Gook, the one you're secretly head over heels with!

472
00:30:21,761 --> 00:30:25,331
He's being treated as a son-in-law at Mi Sook's house right now!

What? A pervert?

490
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:22,321
You were calling me 'young lady' and followed me and tried to harass me earlier!

I am so sorry!

492
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:29,571
Please have mercy on me.

493
00:31:29,591 --> 00:31:34,341
Why did I do such a thing today?

494
00:31:34,341 --> 00:31:37,711
Am I crazy?

495
00:31:37,711 --> 00:31:44,161
But I should've somehow given him the money for the hospital.

496
00:31:44,161 --> 00:31:50,101
What if he changes his mind later and sues me?

The stepmom and her family

500

ruined our home not once, but twice.

But Dad only takes the stepmom's side.

I can live well on my own.

Yes.

511
00:33:37,901 --> 00:33:42,021
Eating like this is quite simple and nice.

512
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:44,931
This blueberry compote was well made without it being too sweet.

513
00:33:44,931 --> 00:33:48,941
Se Jong, you like bread more than rice and soup, right?

Yes.

515
00:33:51,551 --> 00:33:56,861
Se Chan, I told you not to use your phone during meal time.

516
00:33:56,861 --> 00:33:59,301
Give me your phone. You can't use it anymore.

Give it here.

520

Se Jong, you have to eat carrots as well.

521

529
00:35:08,601 --> 00:35:16,691
Mrs. Yeoju, I'll have my meals separately from tomorrow. If I kept eating like this, I think I would get indigestion.

530
00:35:19,371 --> 00:35:23,401
Oh, Se Jong, you are eating well today.

531
00:35:23,401 --> 00:35:28,021
Chew it well and eat slowly.

Look at this. The color is pretty, right?

Is this the color you're wearing it?

It looks a bit different, but it's the same one.

Yes, this is the back door. The main entrance is around over there.

The driver's room is this good?

611

It is so good. So quiet and cozy.

613
00:41:22,931 --> 00:41:25,731
There is even a bed.

614
00:41:28,891 --> 00:41:32,191
The bed is also a good one.

615
00:41:32,191 --> 00:41:36,041
But it would've been nicer if they put a double bed.

616
00:41:36,041 --> 00:41:37,791
Honey...

617

628
00:42:18,351 --> 00:42:22,051
I am really tired right now.

It's true.

632
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:34,041
Honey, then you better stay here quietly until I come back.

633

If they know you are here, I will be in trouble.

Okay. Do you think I'm stupid?

635

Mom! Why did you send me money when you don't have any?

654
00:44:01,191 --> 00:44:06,381
Why do you think I sent it? Because you left without any money, so I thought you might starve to death.

655
00:44:06,381 --> 00:44:09,461
How dare you give me attitude when you're wrong?

656
00:44:09,461 --> 00:44:13,061
I'm staying really well! Actually, I'm staying unnecessarily fine!

657
00:44:13,061 --> 00:44:17,811
Really? Where are you now?

658
00:44:17,811 --> 00:44:22,851
I am at my friend's house, so don't worry about me.

659
00:44:22,851 --> 00:44:26,741
I am glad that you have a good friend.

660
00:44:26,741 --> 00:44:32,801
Your dad and I moved out of the old place and finding a new house right now.

661
00:44:32,801 --> 00:44:36,161
When we move to a new place, I will call you.

662
00:44:36,161 --> 00:44:37,851
Okay.

663
00:44:37,851 --> 00:44:42,851
Mom, I will go see you once I become successful.

664
00:44:42,851 --> 00:44:47,391
So don't send me money and you just use it, okay?

665
00:44:47,391 --> 00:44:51,471
Okay. I got it.

666
00:45:00,191 --> 00:45:02,711
Baby!

667
00:45:02,711 --> 00:45:06,041
What's wrong?

668
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:10,281
What is going on?

669
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:13,971
Se Ryun, I have something to tell you.

670
00:45:13,981 --> 00:45:17,291
What is it?

671
00:45:17,301 --> 00:45:20,071
What's going on with your face?

672
00:45:20,071 --> 00:45:23,661
Why are you suddenly so scary and serious?

673
00:45:25,651 --> 00:45:28,901
I think we won't be able to see each other for a while.

674
00:45:28,901 --> 00:45:30,981
Why?

675
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:39,431
Actually, I need to make money because my family went bankrupt, so I'm not in a position to have a relationship.

676
00:45:39,431 --> 00:45:42,901
Once I settle, I will call you.

677
00:45:42,921 --> 00:45:47,351
Are you saying it's because of money?

678
00:45:47,351 --> 00:45:51,211
You can't see me because you have to make money?

679
00:45:51,211 --> 00:45:53,401
Right, until I am settled.

680
00:45:53,401 --> 00:45:56,691
My money is your money, so why are you worrying about that?

681
00:45:56,691 --> 00:46:00,081
Baby, you don't have to make money.

682
00:46:00,081 --> 00:46:04,091
I have a lot of money.

683
00:46:04,091 --> 00:46:07,281
What?

684
00:46:07,291 --> 00:46:11,691
We are lovers.

685
00:46:11,691 --> 00:46:16,781
Everything that is mine is yours.

686
00:46:16,781 --> 00:46:18,971
Se Ryun...

687
00:46:18,971 --> 00:46:23,921
So don't say that you can't see me because you have to make money!

688
00:46:23,921 --> 00:46:25,731
I will punish you!

689
00:46:25,731 --> 00:46:27,751
Se Ryun, you...

690
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:32,041
I thought you had another girl besides me.

691
00:46:32,041 --> 00:46:35,121
Another girl?

692
00:46:35,121 --> 00:46:37,871
In my life dictionary, there is no 'another girl.'

693
00:46:37,871 --> 00:46:42,111
In Park Dae Beom's life, Se Ryun is the only woman.

694
00:46:42,111 --> 00:46:43,651
- Really?
- Really.

695
00:46:43,651 --> 00:46:45,661
- For reals, right?
- Yes.

696
00:46:45,661 --> 00:46:50,231
- You can't take that back.
- Sure.

697
00:46:50,231 --> 00:46:52,971
I'm so happy!

698
00:46:59,332 --> 00:47:01,892
Oh, Madam!

699
00:47:01,892 --> 00:47:03,682
I guess you're coming back from a workout.

700
00:47:03,682 --> 00:47:06,192
I was thinking of calling you soon.

701
00:47:06,192 --> 00:47:10,742
To me? Why?

702
00:47:10,742 --> 00:47:16,632
Are you going to have your friend continue to live at your place?

703
00:47:16,632 --> 00:47:20,382
Probably for another two years. Her situation is a bit rough.

704
00:47:20,382 --> 00:47:24,252
Just now, another customer came by again.
 [Real-estate agency]

705
00:47:24,252 --> 00:47:30,162
Madam. Do you know that you can charge over two million won in rent for that place?

706
00:47:30,162 --> 00:47:31,522
Really?

707
00:47:31,522 --> 00:47:35,472
Yes! I'm saying this because it's such a waste!

708
00:47:35,472 --> 00:47:37,492
Madam, tell me the truth.

709
00:47:37,492 --> 00:47:41,892
Did you even get one hundred million won as a deposit?

710
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:43,332
Don't ask me.

711
00:47:43,332 --> 00:47:46,882
Oh, my gosh. You didn't even get one hundred million!

712
00:47:46,882 --> 00:47:50,182
The best location house in Seoul! My goodness!

713
00:47:50,182 --> 00:47:55,252
I can't believe it. You give it almost for free!

714
00:47:55,252 --> 00:47:58,732
Such a waste.

715
00:48:06,212 --> 00:48:09,322
She's nothing but a daughter of a widow...

716
00:48:09,322 --> 00:48:13,452
A Chairman of a large company is way out of her league.

717
00:48:13,452 --> 00:48:16,742
She's wasting her time reaching for something impossible.

718
00:48:16,742 --> 00:48:20,512
Who's going to want her--

719
00:48:20,512 --> 00:48:24,222
I won't be able to marry her off to anyone.

720
00:48:24,222 --> 00:48:29,612
Yes, there is no time to be like this.

721
00:48:39,442 --> 00:48:43,922
Seriously though, does Gi Ja have no conscience?

722
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:47,982
Living in this expensive place, she should at least pay a bit of rent,

723
00:48:47,982 --> 00:48:51,232
or at least pay more deposit fee.

724
00:48:51,232 --> 00:48:56,432
The mom and daughter wear good clothes.

725
00:48:56,432 --> 00:49:01,322
Right, Gi Ja is a very good friend of mine.

726
00:49:01,322 --> 00:49:06,022
Let's just have her stay there for another two years.

727
00:49:06,022 --> 00:49:11,022
- What is a good friend for?
- Mi Sook!

728
00:49:11,022 --> 00:49:12,892
Mi Sook!

729
00:49:12,902 --> 00:49:15,972
Yes. What is that?

730
00:49:15,972 --> 00:49:17,952
These are apple mangos.

731
00:49:17,952 --> 00:49:21,882
You like these. It tasted so good, so I brought it thinking of you.

732
00:49:21,882 --> 00:49:25,112
Do you buy these expensive fruits for yourself?

733
00:49:25,112 --> 00:49:28,942
Huh? This is imported.

734
00:49:28,942 --> 00:49:33,562
Gi Ja, don't be offended. I'm saying this because you are my friend.

735
00:49:33,562 --> 00:49:38,722
You have to leave this house after two years.

736
00:49:38,722 --> 00:49:44,192
Do you know how much housing and rent fees have risen?

737
00:49:44,192 --> 00:49:46,762
Of course, I know.

738
00:49:46,762 --> 00:49:49,922
That is why I will never forget your kindness.

739
00:49:49,922 --> 00:49:54,672
So what I am saying is that, nowadays, people live up to 100 years.

740
00:49:54,672 --> 00:50:01,672
So we might live until 100 years old. We should make more money when we are young and able.

741
00:50:01,672 --> 00:50:04,442
Young Ja is even working at a grocery store as a cashier.

742
00:50:04,442 --> 00:50:09,902
So you shouldn't just play around and do something.

743
00:50:09,902 --> 00:50:12,982
This girl has no idea what I'm going through.

744
00:50:12,982 --> 00:50:17,292
I wish I could punch her little mouth!

745
00:50:17,332 --> 00:50:24,232
Okay, I got it. Don't worry! As long as we're alive, we won't starve!

746
00:50:24,232 --> 00:50:32,632
Hey, do you remember that civil servant guy who has a 25-pyeong apartment that you mentioned?

747
00:50:32,632 --> 00:50:37,232
Is it still possible to arrange a blind date with Sarah?

748
00:50:37,232 --> 00:50:41,692
Of course! They actually called me again a few days ago.

749
00:50:41,692 --> 00:50:46,682
I don't know where their son saw your daughter, but he seems to like her a lot.

750
00:50:46,682 --> 00:50:48,842
But I thought Sarah wasn't interested.

751
00:50:48,842 --> 00:50:50,852
That's not true!

752
00:50:50,852 --> 00:50:56,972
Mi Sook, can you set up the blind date as soon as possible, like today?

753
00:50:56,972 --> 00:50:59,832
Really?

754
00:51:08,202 --> 00:51:13,392
Did I drink too much yesterday?

755
00:51:13,432 --> 00:51:15,792
I'm okay!

756
00:51:15,792 --> 00:51:18,862
- Aigo! I said I'm not drunk!
- Hey, hey!

757
00:51:18,862 --> 00:51:22,192
You're going to fall.

758
00:51:26,252 --> 00:51:29,822
Yes. I'll have to drive a wedge in.

759
00:51:29,822 --> 00:51:33,072
So, she'll stop eyeing the Chairman.

760
00:51:39,512 --> 00:51:44,402
I'll be out for a bit. Call me if anything happens.

761
00:51:45,932 --> 00:51:51,152
Oh, Sarah! What brings you here?

762
00:51:51,152 --> 00:51:53,252
I have something to talk about with you.

763
00:51:53,252 --> 00:51:56,372
Something to talk about it?

764
00:51:56,372 --> 00:51:58,292
What is it?

765
00:51:58,292 --> 00:52:03,262
We could've talked about it at home later. Is it something important?

766
00:52:03,272 --> 00:52:05,322
Unni...

767
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:10,502
The Chairman almost got really hurt at the mountain...

768
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:14,132
But did you have to call him out at night,

769
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:16,652
and go drinking?

770
00:52:16,652 --> 00:52:19,562
I didn't call Young Gook out.

771
00:52:19,562 --> 00:52:23,012
Young Gook came voluntarily.

772
00:52:23,012 --> 00:52:28,182
But even if I had called Young Gook out for drinking,

773
00:52:28,182 --> 00:52:31,772
why would that bother you?

774
00:52:31,772 --> 00:52:37,612
Unni... I think I have the right to be bothered.

775
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:44,112
I have been working at the Chairman's house for more than five years, including the time before his wife passed away.

776
00:52:44,132 --> 00:52:48,102
I took care of everything at the Chairman's home during that time.

777
00:52:48,102 --> 00:52:53,752
I'm especially doing my best so that he doesn't feel his wife's absence.

778
00:52:53,752 --> 00:52:57,982
Out of all those things, the Chairman's health is my number one priority.

779
00:52:57,982 --> 00:53:02,922
Jo Sarah... You're overreacting quite a bit, do you know that?

780
00:53:02,922 --> 00:53:09,242
You're acting as if you're someone special to Young Gook.

781
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:15,042
Of course... I'm someone special to him.

782
00:53:15,042 --> 00:53:18,102
I'm the chief manager of the Chairman's household.

783
00:53:18,102 --> 00:53:21,912
So, please don't do that anymore from now on.

784
00:53:21,912 --> 00:53:26,542
I'm busy, so I'll get going now. I'll let you get back to work, Unni.

785
00:53:37,712 --> 00:53:40,962
What's up with her?

786
00:53:45,482 --> 00:53:49,532
Does she have feelings for Young Gook?

787
00:53:59,252 --> 00:54:01,242
What is it, Mom?

788
00:54:01,242 --> 00:54:02,872
Now?

789
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:05,282
What is it?

790
00:54:08,632 --> 00:54:12,882
People may think you're the one going on a blind date.

791
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:18,952
I'm not the one going on the blind date, but why am I so nervous?

792
00:54:18,952 --> 00:54:22,492
Your daughter's here. Sarah!

793
00:54:25,252 --> 00:54:27,632
You're here too, Mrs. Jang!

794
00:54:27,632 --> 00:54:30,112
What's going on, Mom?

795
00:54:30,112 --> 00:54:32,562
You look so pretty today, Sarah.

796
00:54:32,562 --> 00:54:36,772
You seem to look a little younger too.

797
00:54:36,772 --> 00:54:39,862
- I'm getting a good feeling! I think it's going to work out well.
- Hey!

798
00:54:39,862 --> 00:54:42,972
Sit down. Sit down.

799
00:54:45,552 --> 00:54:48,942
What is it, Mom?

800
00:54:48,942 --> 00:54:51,822
He's here!

801
00:54:57,102 --> 00:55:00,532
- It's here...
- Ah!

802
00:55:06,272 --> 00:55:09,692
Nice meeting you.

803
00:55:34,272 --> 00:55:37,382
Let's go, Gi Ja.

804
00:55:37,382 --> 00:55:42,702
I hope she doesn't just leave...

805
00:55:48,352 --> 00:55:52,052
Wait, you're saying you came without knowing?

806
00:55:52,052 --> 00:55:55,072
Yes. I'm sorry.

807
00:55:55,072 --> 00:55:59,512
I never even thought of meeting or getting married in this manner ever.

808
00:55:59,512 --> 00:56:03,912
My apologies. I hope you meet someone nice.

809
00:56:06,182 --> 00:56:09,242
Hey, excuse me! Sarah!

810
00:56:09,242 --> 00:56:12,662
My goodness... Sarah! Hey!

811
00:56:12,662 --> 00:56:14,142
My goodness...

812
00:56:14,142 --> 00:56:16,992
How embarrassing.

813
00:56:16,992 --> 00:56:19,022
Ms. Sarah!

814
00:56:20,232 --> 00:56:22,362
Gi Ja.

815
00:56:22,362 --> 00:56:28,482
Did you see that guy's face? He was smiling from ear to ear.

816
00:56:28,482 --> 00:56:30,412
I think he liked Sarah.

817
00:56:30,412 --> 00:56:33,492
It was love at first sight!

818
00:56:33,492 --> 00:56:35,952
It's all thanks to you.

819
00:56:35,952 --> 00:56:39,382
If things work out today, I'll treat you grandly!

820
00:56:39,382 --> 00:56:41,862
All right. Please, do that!

821
00:56:41,862 --> 00:56:47,182
You should get to live with your head up high, thanks to your daughter and your future son-in-law.

822
00:56:47,182 --> 00:56:49,612
Don't forget about me then, okay?

823
00:56:49,612 --> 00:56:51,792
Of course, not!

824
00:56:51,792 --> 00:56:55,602
How can I forget your kindness?

825
00:56:55,602 --> 00:56:58,232
I'll carry you around on my back!

826
00:56:58,232 --> 00:57:01,342
- You mean it, right?
- Yes, I mean it!

827
00:57:01,342 --> 00:57:06,712
If it weren't for you... How could I have lived like this.

828
00:57:06,712 --> 00:57:11,142
Even my dead husband wasn't able to give me a life like this.

829
00:57:11,142 --> 00:57:13,862
Thank you... Really.

830
00:57:13,862 --> 00:57:16,862
You don't have to say that.

831
00:57:16,862 --> 00:57:23,822
My husband died from a heart attack at his prime...

832
00:57:23,842 --> 00:57:26,482
If it weren't for you... I...

833
00:57:26,482 --> 00:57:30,232
I think I would've gotten depressed.

834
00:57:30,232 --> 00:57:32,282
Mi Sook...

835
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:36,092
Let's stick close to each other like now,

836
00:57:36,092 --> 00:57:40,412
and depend on each other as we grow old.

837
00:57:40,412 --> 00:57:43,772
Let's do that.

838
00:57:43,772 --> 00:57:47,812
It's Madam Song.

839
00:57:47,812 --> 00:57:51,522
Yes, Madam Song.

840
00:57:54,242 --> 00:57:56,652
What did you say?

841
00:57:56,652 --> 00:58:00,212
R-Really?

842
00:58:00,212 --> 00:58:04,832
Oh, my... I'm so sorry, Madam Song.

843
00:58:04,832 --> 00:58:06,942
Yes, I'm sorry.

844
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:10,602
What's wrong, Mi Sook? Did she do something wrong?

845
00:58:10,602 --> 00:58:14,402
Gi Ja... Sarah didn't like that man...

846
00:58:14,402 --> 00:58:17,762
So she ended the blind date without even having a cup of coffee!

847
00:58:17,762 --> 00:58:19,942
Oh, my..!

848
00:58:19,942 --> 00:58:22,882
What kind of behavior is this?

849
00:58:22,882 --> 00:58:26,272
She should've at least had a cup of coffee for my sake!

850
00:58:26,272 --> 00:58:29,392
Is Sarah in her right mind?

851
00:58:29,392 --> 00:58:34,372
He's a government employee, has a decent sized apartment in Seoul, tall, and he's even the same age!

852
00:58:34,372 --> 00:58:38,392
Shouldn't she be grateful for a man like that?

853
00:58:38,392 --> 00:58:42,982
No matter how wrong she was... How could you say something like that?

854
00:58:42,982 --> 00:58:46,212
Am I wrong? She's already 36 years old!

855
00:58:46,212 --> 00:58:49,002
How does she not know her place even at that age?

856
00:58:49,002 --> 00:58:52,442
Okay! I'm sorry that she doesn't know her place!

857
00:58:52,442 --> 00:58:55,012
I'm sorry!

858
00:58:55,012 --> 00:58:59,552
Him balding a little bit.... that...

859
00:58:59,552 --> 00:59:02,292
That's the only one flaw he has!

860
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:05,412
I was going to pay for his hair implants!

861
00:59:05,412 --> 00:59:08,952
As a wedding present! I was going to!

862
00:59:08,952 --> 00:59:11,822
Oh, my gosh!

863
00:59:13,142 --> 00:59:15,922
Mom! Are you out of your mind?

864
00:59:15,922 --> 00:59:19,652
Why did you do that without even asking me? I didn't ask for that!

865
00:59:19,652 --> 00:59:22,242
Hey! For someone like you...

866
00:59:22,242 --> 00:59:26,622
You should be grateful for a man who's a government employee and has an apartment in Seoul!

867
00:59:26,622 --> 00:59:29,582
If you like him so much, you marry him!

868
00:59:29,582 --> 00:59:33,122
You know... You'll turn 40 before you even know it!

869
00:59:33,122 --> 00:59:38,462
You're getting blind date offers now because at least you're young and pretty.

870
00:59:38,462 --> 00:59:40,352
Jo Sarah!

871
00:59:40,352 --> 00:59:44,152
Nothing's going to happen with Chairman Lee Young Gook. Don't even dream about it.

872
00:59:44,152 --> 00:59:47,482
Even though he has three kids, he's still a chaebol.

873
00:59:47,482 --> 00:59:52,292
Do you think he'll even notice a poor widow's daughter?

874
00:59:52,292 --> 00:59:56,242
Everyone may be calling you, "Chief Jo, Chief Jo!" now.

875
00:59:56,242 --> 00:59:59,042
But, you're just a maid at that household!

876
00:59:59,042 --> 01:00:01,052
Mom!

877
01:00:01,052 --> 01:00:05,122
Out of all people... How could you say something like that to me, Mom?

878
01:00:05,122 --> 01:00:07,292
Because I'm your mom!

879
01:00:07,292 --> 01:00:10,052
That's why I'm telling you the truth!

880
01:00:10,052 --> 01:00:15,732
Call the man you met at the blind date now.

881
01:00:15,732 --> 01:00:22,132
Tell him you're sorry and that you'll meet him again. Here you go.

882
01:00:22,132 --> 01:00:26,252
Mom! I'd rather not get married and live alone.

883
01:00:26,252 --> 01:00:30,552
I'm not going to get married unless it's with Chairman Lee Young Gook. So don't ever do something like this again!

884
01:00:30,552 --> 01:00:34,322
Or else I'm not going to see you either.

885
01:00:34,332 --> 01:00:38,032
Until when are you going to just reach for the stars!

886
01:00:38,032 --> 01:00:40,412
Oh, my!

887
01:00:40,412 --> 01:00:45,222
Can you touch or eat stars?

888
01:00:45,222 --> 01:00:50,962
I'm doing this because I'm worried you're going to get old and die alone!

889
01:00:54,432 --> 01:00:58,362
Yes, I'll help with your oder--ah!

890
01:00:58,362 --> 01:01:00,692
- Welcome!
- Hello.

891
01:01:00,692 --> 01:01:04,552
Cafe latte and mango smoothie, right?

892
01:01:17,762 --> 01:01:21,422
Yes, just a moment please!

893
01:01:25,772 --> 01:01:33,582
♫  When I walk this road, it makes me cry  ♫

894
01:01:33,582 --> 01:01:40,282
♫  It reminds me of that person's touch  ♫

895
01:01:40,282 --> 01:01:47,842
♫  I couldn't hold her and just trembled my heart  ♫

896
01:01:47,842 --> 01:01:54,242
♫  My unforgettable love  ♫

897
01:01:54,242 --> 01:01:58,412
Park Dan Dan, you did well today too!

898
01:01:58,412 --> 01:02:02,422
♫  Like a shy child  ♫

899
01:02:02,422 --> 01:02:08,902
♫  In case I lose it, I hold it tight  ♫

900
01:02:08,902 --> 01:02:15,722
I can't continue to work off part-times and living day by day.

901
01:02:15,722 --> 01:02:19,202
Let's get a full-time job.

902
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:23,442
Park Dan Dan. You can do it!

903
01:02:23,442 --> 01:02:30,032
♫  It would be nice to take a break  ♫

904
01:02:30,032 --> 01:02:32,292
How long is your friend going to stay here?

905
01:02:32,292 --> 01:02:34,162
I said, I can't help it for a while--

906
01:02:34,162 --> 01:02:38,532
No, no! You choose. Is it your friend or me?

907
01:02:38,532 --> 01:02:40,772
What kind of question is that?

908
01:02:40,772 --> 01:02:43,572
Let's talk later. Dan Dan's going to be here any moment.

909
01:02:43,572 --> 01:02:46,262
Just go!

910
01:02:49,922 --> 01:02:52,912
Dan Dan.

911
01:02:52,912 --> 01:02:54,872
Eun Ju.

912
01:02:54,872 --> 01:02:56,542
Dan Dan, it is--

913
01:02:56,542 --> 01:02:59,452
Eun Ju, I got a room.

914
01:02:59,452 --> 01:03:00,762
What?

915
01:03:00,762 --> 01:03:04,842
There's a good place near my part-time workplace.

916
01:03:04,842 --> 01:03:07,402
So I came here to get my stuff.

917
01:03:07,402 --> 01:03:11,512
Are you doing this because we were fighting?

918
01:03:11,512 --> 01:03:16,092
No! This place is far away from the cafe I'm working at.

919
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:18,962
That's why I got it.

920
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:22,912
I'm really grateful for everything you've done for me, Eun Ju.

921
01:03:22,912 --> 01:03:26,552
I'll be right out once I get my stuff.

922
01:04:06,682 --> 01:04:11,322
Park Dan Dan... Why did you come here?

923
01:04:11,322 --> 01:04:14,932
Everyone's living so well without me.

924
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:28,142
Is she the daughter of the people who lived here before?

925
01:04:28,142 --> 01:04:33,252
Their father asked me to tell his daughter they moved if she ever visits.

926
01:04:51,352 --> 01:04:53,762
Honey!

927
01:04:59,292 --> 01:05:01,862
Honey.

928
01:05:01,862 --> 01:05:03,852
Honey?

929
01:05:03,852 --> 01:05:06,582
I've got some medicine.

930
01:05:11,132 --> 01:05:13,772
There's no fever.

931
01:05:13,772 --> 01:05:17,882
Honey. Dae Beom's mom.

932
01:05:36,082 --> 01:05:40,052
It's hard to get employed these days. The ones still in school are having trouble, too.

933
01:05:40,052 --> 01:05:42,972
Professor. I still had high grades, and...

934
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:45,182
Anyway, fill out the paper before you leave.

935
01:05:45,182 --> 01:05:48,532
I'll contact you if a position opens up.

936
01:05:59,272 --> 01:06:03,132
Park Dan Dan!

937
01:06:03,132 --> 01:06:05,172
Professor!

938
01:06:05,172 --> 01:06:07,582
Why did you come to school?

939
01:06:07,582 --> 01:06:10,212
Ah...that's...

940
01:06:10,212 --> 01:06:15,002
This isn't like you. Why are you so down?

941
01:06:15,002 --> 01:06:21,122
Actually, I visited the employment counseling center to see if I could find a job.

942
01:06:21,122 --> 01:06:24,192
What? You got employed already!

943
01:06:24,192 --> 01:06:27,322
I still remember seeing your document.

944
01:06:27,322 --> 01:06:33,442
Something happened, so I had to quit.

945
01:06:33,442 --> 01:06:39,942
Professor. Is there a place where I can get employed?

946
01:06:39,942 --> 01:06:46,372
Never mind. I'm whining at you, Professor.

947
01:06:46,382 --> 01:06:52,742
Oh, it's time for my part-time job! I'll get going, Professor.

948
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:54,552
Dan Dan.

949
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:56,702
Yes?

950
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:05,262
Are you interested in being a live-in private tutor?

951
01:07:05,262 --> 01:07:07,972
Live-in tutor?

952
01:07:07,972 --> 01:07:11,982
Yes, but there are three children.

953
01:07:11,982 --> 01:07:17,862
Oh, Professor! I can do it, even if there are three, four, or ten kids!

954
01:07:17,862 --> 01:07:20,792
Please let me do it!

955
01:07:27,422 --> 01:07:30,622
Yes, Gook Hee?

956
01:07:30,622 --> 01:07:34,802
Really? Is there a good person?

957
01:07:34,802 --> 01:07:37,832
I have a meeting outside, so I'm heading out.

958
01:07:37,832 --> 01:07:42,382
I'll tell Chief Jo, so send her to my house.

959
01:07:44,742 --> 01:07:49,832
If it's a live-in tutor, it can resolve the housing and food all at once.

960
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:56,122
On top of that, it's my Professor's recommendation, so it'll be a trustable place!

961
01:07:56,122 --> 01:07:59,212
I guess there's always a way to live!

962
01:07:59,212 --> 01:08:04,762
Park Dan Dan. You need to get this job!

963
01:08:04,762 --> 01:08:08,512
I need to look as modest as possible.

964
01:08:12,842 --> 01:08:17,582
Se Jong! I think it's dangerous, so let me carry the ball.

965
01:08:17,582 --> 01:08:22,602
It's okay. I can carry it.

966
01:08:38,862 --> 01:08:40,812
It's dangerous!

967
01:08:40,812 --> 01:08:42,632
Oh, no!

968
01:08:42,632 --> 01:08:44,792
No!

969
01:08:59,172 --> 01:09:00,672
Se Jong!

970
01:09:00,672 --> 01:09:03,232
Se Jong, are you okay?

971
01:09:03,232 --> 01:09:06,412
Yes, I'm okay...

972
01:09:08,472 --> 01:09:12,852
Oh, are you okay? Oh, no!

973
01:09:12,852 --> 01:09:16,832
Kid. You need to be careful of cars from now on. Got it?

974
01:09:16,832 --> 01:09:18,722
Yes...

975
01:09:18,722 --> 01:09:20,772
Thank you so much.

976
01:09:20,772 --> 01:09:24,602
Won't you have to go to the hospital? It's bleeding...

977
01:09:24,602 --> 01:09:26,662
No! It's okay.

978
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:29,372
I have somewhere to go!

979
01:09:34,052 --> 01:09:39,712
Se Jong... You almost got into really big trouble!

980
01:09:39,712 --> 01:09:45,722
Se Jong, if something goes wrong with you, I can't live anymore!

981
01:09:45,732 --> 01:09:47,672
I'm sorry.

982
01:09:47,672 --> 01:09:50,882
I'll be careful...

983
01:10:27,122 --> 01:10:28,732
Who is it?

984
01:10:28,732 --> 01:10:30,182
Hello!

985
01:10:30,182 --> 01:10:35,352
I'm Park Dan Dan, here to take the interview for a private tutor.

986
01:10:41,782 --> 01:10:45,742
Wow... The trees are amazing.

987
01:10:45,742 --> 01:10:49,582
It's like a house straight out of movies!

988
01:10:53,322 --> 01:10:57,012
Are you a candidate to be our private tutor?

989
01:10:57,012 --> 01:11:01,362
Yes, Mother! I'm Park Dan Dan.

990
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:03,662
Did you think I'm the mom?

991
01:11:03,662 --> 01:11:05,672
Do I look that young?

992
01:11:05,672 --> 01:11:10,302
Teacher! You've passed no matter what!

993
01:11:10,302 --> 01:11:13,462
Come this way. The Chairman is waiting for you.

994
01:11:13,462 --> 01:11:17,022
Oh, yes, you should head in!

995
01:11:19,922 --> 01:11:23,522
Is she not the mother?

996
01:11:30,682 --> 01:11:33,742
Hello! Nice to meet you!

997
01:11:33,742 --> 01:11:36,942
I'm Park Dan Dan!

998
01:11:43,402 --> 01:11:45,672
Ajussi!

999
01:12:03,202 --> 01:12:10,182
♫  A smile runs to me in every step  ♫

1000
01:12:10,182 --> 01:12:16,992
♫  It's a shiny day because of you  ♫

1001
01:12:17,002 --> 01:12:23,962
♫  Strangely, I'm drawn to you  ♫

1002
01:12:23,962 --> 01:12:28,812
♫  Nobody will understand me, you're the one that I was looking for ♫

1003
01:12:28,812 --> 01:12:31,722
[Young Lady and Gentleman]

1004
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:35,472
I think a person like her is much more needed for Se Jong, Se Chan, and Jenny.

1005
01:12:35,472 --> 01:12:37,742
Park Dan Dan. Is she really your student?

1006
01:12:37,742 --> 01:12:40,472
You got employed as our in-house tutor!

1007
01:12:40,472 --> 01:12:41,792
Me? Really?

1008
01:12:41,792 --> 01:12:43,082
I thought I wouldn't get it.

1009
01:12:43,082 --> 01:12:45,282
D-Did he hire a new private tutor?

1010
01:12:45,282 --> 01:12:47,632
You fired the previous one because she was flirting with the Chairman!

1011
01:12:47,632 --> 01:12:49,422
She's just a hillbilly girl!

1012
01:12:49,422 --> 01:12:52,522
What if some other girl takes Young Gook away again!

1013
01:12:52,522 --> 01:12:54,482
Did he notice my feelings..?

1014
01:12:54,482 --> 01:12:56,022
Isn't this a man's underwear?

1015
01:12:56,022 --> 01:12:57,912
Dae Beom! Run away!

1016
01:12:57,912 --> 01:13:00,452
How dare you bring a man from a club into the house!

1017
01:13:00,452 --> 01:13:01,872
Isn't that our Dae Beom?

1018
01:13:01,872 --> 01:13:04,452
Didn't you hear Dan Dan's voice just now?

1019
01:13:04,452 --> 01:13:05,492
Dad?

1020
01:13:05,492 --> 01:13:08,972
Miss Park. Did something happen?
