[Episode 36]

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,800
So, did you look into it?

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:11,530
Aren't I right? Doesn't he have a kindergarten-aged daughter?

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:17,690
Mrs. Jang. Please keep it in secret.

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:22,450
I beg your pardon? Do you want me to keep it in secret?

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,820
To make sure my Se Ryun doesn't hear of it.

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,520
Please do not spread the rumor. I beg you.

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,360
What are you saying?

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:37,000
Are you going to hide this critical situation from your daughter?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,700
That's not right.

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,470
Even if he has a child,

12
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:49,220
he is hundreds and thousands of times better than that gigolo from the parasite family.

13
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:57,430
Where can we find someone like Seung Ho? Please keep it quiet.

14
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,440
Mrs. Wang.

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,150
This is our family's business. It's my daughter's business.

16
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,990
I will take care of everything from now on. It's not something you need to get involved in.

17
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,740
I'm here to tell you this.

18
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:13,070
Even so, how can you..?

19
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,800
Then, I'll take my hands off from this.

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,100
I've made it very clear. I am staying out of this.

21
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,970
Yes, please. Stay out of it.

22
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,770
Once Se Ryun's wedding is over,

23
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,010
Mrs. Moon and I will compensate you big for matching them up.

24
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,730
I'm not saying this to get the compensation.

25
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,140
I know. Regardless, I'll get going.

26
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,410
This is a sensitive matter for both families.

27
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:44,920
Please do not say anything to anyone.

28
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,770
I will go.

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:57,630
Even if she's put everything on the line for the company shares, how could she do that?

30
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:06,590
Is she not a biological mother to Se Ryun?

31
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:14,410
Where the heck did Mrs. Jang pick that up?

32
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,390
What should I do? No.

33
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:22,200
If Se Ryun doesn't marry this time, it will be harder for her to marry in the future.

34
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,500
That's right. This is all for Se Ryun. It's for her.

35
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:33,030
Oh, my head hurts badly. Oh, my head.

36
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,040
Hello!

37
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:43,990
Hyung, Hyung. Mr. Park's chicken restaurant came out for sale real cheap.

38
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:48,820
But it hasn't been long since the owner changed. Why is it up for sale again?

39
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,720
I think she needs quick cash. She's asking 200 million won less than what she paid for.

40
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,480
What? 200 million won less? Is that true?

41
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,040
Yes, but instead, you have to pay it all in a single payment.

42
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,250
Hyung, let's buy this one, too.

43
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,100
This is for you, Mrs. Lee.

44
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,000
This is for you.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,060
You got one more store.

46
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,070
At this rate, everything around here will belong to you.

47
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:28,700
We only have seven stores. It's no good to bluff things up.

48
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:34,390
But, it hasn't been long since you bought it.

49
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,580
Why are you selling it?

50
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,130
It's just because I couldn't be bothered.

51
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:45,240
Why are you asking things like that? Obvious she's in need of cash.

52
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,440
You must have worried over money a lot lately.

53
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,920
Your face doesn't look well.

54
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,600
Are you suffering from insomnia? If that's the case, place half of an onion above your pillow.

55
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,010
I sleep well when I do that.

56
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,450
If it's all done, please excuse me.

57
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,600
- Yes, yes.
- Wait..!

58
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:10,430
Who uses a stinky onion method for that these days?

59
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,770
A half onion does the job every time.

60
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,810
Oh, my legs...

61
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,190
Excuse me, are you looking for someone?

62
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:39,940
Yes. That is... It's nothing...

63
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,740
This is from an anonymous donor. It's 500 million won.

64
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,170
Please use it for the children, for good causes.

65
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:06,560
Excuse me! Wait!

66
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,010
Now that I donated for the children.

67
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,740
I hope the nightmares will stop.

68
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,210
I won't go to hell when I die.

69
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:36,050
This 300 million won is for what her mother took from my mother.

70
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,430
I will keep it for when we have to move.

71
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:49,940
Why did I lose my mind and steal just to suffer like this?

72
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:54,090
It will be okay now.

73
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,730
It will be okay, Lee Gi Ja.

74
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:02,730
Dae Beom, Yeon Sil, come and sit here. There's big trouble.

75
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,830
Why, what's wrong? Did something happen to Geon?

76
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,440
No, it's not that.

77
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,390
What's wrong, Mother-in-law?

78
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:15,010
I just heard the realtor talking.

79
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,300
The owner of our store got changed.

80
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,890
Pardon?

81
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:25,750
Does that mean our rent will go up? What should we do?

82
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,480
- Hello, you've come.
- Yes, how are you doing?

83
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:35,380
Did you both hear? Apparently, we have a new owner.

84
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,110
- Yes, and it's me.
- Pardon?

85
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,720
My brother and I bought it together.

86
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,840
So we came to say hello. We should tell you about the change.

87
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,930
Congratulations! I'm happy to know you are the new owners.

88
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,750
Thank you.

89
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,120
We will not be raising the rent, so please do not worry.

90
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,270
Thank you.

91
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,570
If you could sweep the front clean, I'm good.

92
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,950
Yes, of course. Don't worry.

93
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,380
Are we going to explore a cave? Really?

94
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,630
Yes. Your sister and brother are waiting for you.

95
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,860
Hurry, let's hurry.

96
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,850
Since we are in a hurry, can I give you a piggyback ride?

97
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,050
Yes!

98
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,900
Okay, get on!

99
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,730
Mr. Se Jong, how are you feeling?

100
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:33,780
I'm feeling great! I feel like I'm flying!

101
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:39,960
If I knew you like piggyback rides, I should've done it more often.

102
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,420
Why is Ms. Park doing that? She's spoiling Se Jong.

103
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:48,980
And how dare she put Se Jong on her back?

104
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,030
[Teddy Bear Ajussi]

105
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:08,630
I've been thinking about what you said.

106
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:13,760
You told me to run away.

107
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,850
But I won't do that.

108
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:22,270
What happened in your past,

109
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:31,110
those things are not important to me anymore because I like you a lot.

110
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,690
So much so that none of that matters at all.

111
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,910
I like you that much.

112
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,550
That being the case,

113
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:48,030
let's see each other as we have.

114
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,360
No, Ajussi. I can't do that.

115
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,530
Let's stop here.

116
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:06,620
I said it was okay with me. It doesn't matter to me.

117
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,220
Ajussi.

118
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:20,070
There is a reason why I can't go on with you. And it's not something you can solve.

119
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:24,420
Besides, I don't want to date someone who knows my weaknesses.

120
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,970
I don't want to feel bad every time I see you.

121
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,890
Ajussi.

122
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,590
Please meet someone better than me.

123
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:43,370
Ajussi, please don't call me again.

124
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,450
- Wow, so cool.
- It's really long.

125
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,060
That's fantastic.

126
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,050
Look at the mustache.

127
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,990
It's attached over there.

128
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,020
Dad, are you enjoying yourself?

129
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,900
They've done a great job making them.

130
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,610
It's really awesome.

131
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,730
Dad, is there something going on lately?

132
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,540
You took us to the museum the other day.

133
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,080
And now you've brought us to this cave experience.

134
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,290
Before, you used to refuse our requests saying you were too busy.

135
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,220
Is there some other reason?

136
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,300
Well, that is...

137
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:54,290
I feel I've neglected you guys for too long.

138
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:58,280
I will try to make more time like this and do things like this often.

139
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,480
Don't you like it, Jenny?

140
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,340
No, that's not what I meant.

141
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,710
I'm saying it because I like it.

142
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,340
- Promise?
- Yes, I promise.

143
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,830
Yes! Yes! Yes!

144
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:15,400
Dad, we have two roads to choose from.

145
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,940
I will go this way.

146
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,000
Se Jong, let's go with Noona.

147
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,770
- Since we are brave siblings.
- Okay!

148
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:33,060
Why don't you two go that way?

149
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,460
Let's go.

150
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,160
Wow, so cool!

151
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,290
The kids are so close to one another.

152
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:53,150
They left without us.

153
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,130
Ms. Park.

154
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,360
Let's go that way.

155
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,330
Yes.

156
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,110
Why do you look so surprised?

157
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:16,610
We can hold hands now, can't we?

158
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,520
I didn't say anything.

159
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,460
It's very dark here.

160
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,890
It looks like we are lost.

161
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,210
It's too dark here.

162
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,380
The kids would get scared here.

163
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,530
There's light!

164
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,690
They are pretty.

165
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:55,000
They are very pretty.

166
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,260
The fishes are very tiny.

167
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:04,200
They are so cute.

168
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:10,580
The fishes are breathing like this.

169
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,600
Dad!

170
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,030
Ms. Park!

171
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:39,400
- Dad!
- Ms. Park.

172
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,510
Yes! Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong, I'm on my way.

173
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,640
Oh, no!

174
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,150
That's pretty.

175
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:08,270
The tree looks like it's made of gold.

176
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,890
Isn't it real gold?

177
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,180
It really looks like gold.

178
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,780
There is a treehouse too.

179
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,690
Those are stars.

180
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,770
Dad, did something happen?

181
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,530
What's wrong with your face?

182
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,800
What do you mean? Nothing happened.

183
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,810
I'm very happy to spend time with you guys.

184
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,230
I don't think so.

185
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:36,030
I'm sure something bad happened to you.

186
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:39,580
Well, that is...

187
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,080
It's nothing bad.

188
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,630
But someone pushed me at the aquarium, so I fell.

189
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,100
I think that's why I'm a little startled.

190
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,620
Who? Who pushed you?

191
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,260
And you did nothing?

192
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,630
It was dark in there, and the person ran away so I couldn't catch the person.

193
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,000
That's terrible.

194
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,090
What kind of a person would do that?

195
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:05,250
- Right?
- Yes.

196
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,110
It's me, Cha Geon.

197
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,690
Let's meet. I have something to say.

198
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,260
I'm in front of your house.

199
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:53,480
The person you've called is not answering the phone. After the beep, you'll be connected to the voice mail.

200
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:12,400
Isn't Ms. Park too harsh?

201
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,770
If she pushed me like that,

202
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,950
shouldn't she leave a text at least?

203
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,240
[Mountain Bunny]

204
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,860
Why?

205
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,380
Your voice sounds like you are still mad.

206
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:38,030
Are you mad because we couldn't kiss because I pushed you?

207
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,180
Listen, Ms. Park.

208
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,240
What kind of person do you think I am?

209
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,560
It's not because of that.

210
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,200
I fell when you pushed me.

211
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,000
And I almost injured my tail bone.

212
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,840
I'm sorry.

213
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,040
The truth is, I was very flustered.

214
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,250
I was worried that the children might see us.

215
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:03,590
We almost got caught doing what we were doing.

216
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,760
Okay, okay.

217
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,540
It was an urgent moment, so I'll understand and move on.

218
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,710
Chairman. As a gesture of apology, I will buy you a hot steamed bun.

219
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,330
Let's meet at the convenience store.

220
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,730
Why, Ms. Park?

221
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,530
Are you craving a steamed bun?

222
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:24,420
Yes. Maybe because it's the winter, I'm craving them.

223
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,760
Let's go together.

224
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,410
I will buy it for you.

225
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:30,300
Ms. Park. I will just go quick by myself.

226
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,900
You worked hard looking after the children. Just rest, I'll get it for you.

227
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,570
Really?

228
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:40,530
Of course, I'll be back soon.

229
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,530
Welcome!

230
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,990
Is there only one steamed bun?

231
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,300
I need about five.

232
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,330
Yes, that's all we have for ones all steamed.

233
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,420
I see.

234
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,900
Ms. Park.

235
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,270
Ms. Park.

236
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,820
Chairman, you were so quick.

237
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,350
I worried that it would get cold.

238
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,780
So I ran like I was doing a 100m dash.

239
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,950
I'm touched.

240
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,900
It's nothing.

241
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,940
But they only had one, so I couldn't get any for the children.

242
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,640
Please eat before it gets cold.

243
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,340
It's toasty hot like it just came out of the oven.

244
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:12,120
I guess you really dashed.

245
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,340
Go ahead and eat.

246
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,020
You said you wanted one.

247
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:24,890
Let's share and eat together.

248
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,160
Okay.

249
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,410
Cheers!

250
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,860
It's delicious.

251
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,760
I've never tasted a steamed bun this good in my whole life.

252
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,040
Maybe because it's a bun that you ran there to get it?

253
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,170
Ms. Park, can I come in?

254
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,730
Jenny, I'm getting changed at the moment.

255
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:27,240
One moment!

256
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,440
Go in there.

257
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,860
Hurry, please get under there.

258
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,760
Yes, Jenny. Were you still awake?

259
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,820
No, I was going to.

260
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,620
But I needed to cut this nail.

261
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,260
And I couldn't find my nail clipper anywhere.

262
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,400
Ms. Park, please lend me your clipper.

263
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,620
Yes, yes.

264
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,190
- Here.
- Thank you.

265
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,680
Ms. Park, did you just buy this?

266
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,640
Can I try it on?

267
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,530
Yes.

268
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,460
But Ms. Park.

269
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,370
I feel like I smell hot steamed buns somewhere.

270
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,950
Hot steamed bun?

271
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,880
I can't tell.

272
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,830
That's strange.

273
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,650
Is something wrong with my nose?

274
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,490
This is not my style.

275
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,270
I will return the clipper tomorrow.

276
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,460
No, no, no. You keep it.

277
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,440
I have another one.

278
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,190
Thank you, Ms. Park.

279
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,700
Good night.

280
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,500
Good night.

281
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,620
Is she gone?

282
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,810
Yes. I will look out for you.

283
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,890
You should leave now.

284
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,950
Jenny might come back.

285
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,500
Chairman, now, now.

286
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,500
What's wrong, Chairman?

287
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,260
Did something happen upstairs?

288
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,920
No, it's nothing.

289
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,720
I was checking on Se Jong.

290
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,980
Yes, then.

291
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,400
What's wrong with him?

292
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:10,430
What was that...

293
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:15,200
What would have happened if Jenny had seen us?

294
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,880
Yes, it's me.

295
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,310
Chairman, did you get back to your room safely?

296
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,460
Yes, I did.

297
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:32,010
I feel frazzled. Let's not do that at home again.

298
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,890
"Let's not do that?"

299
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,690
What, exactly?

300
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:40,100
What I'm saying is...

301
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:44,660
It's not easy dating within the company.

302
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,810
Why are you laughing?

303
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,760
Ms. Park, are you laughing at me?

304
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,360
I'm just laughing because you're so cute.

305
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,930
The 22-year-old Chairman was cute and lost too.

306
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,630
What did you say?

307
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,880
Was I lost?

308
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,960
Chairman, have a good night.

309
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,760
You have to dream of me tonight.

310
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:35,200
Chairman, where are we going? Are we going for a drive?

311
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:38,160
Yes, we will go for a drive.

312
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,170
And there's a place I want to show you.

313
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:47,730
It's my deceased mother's birthday today.

314
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:50,850
I see.

315
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:26,970
How old was your mother when she passed away?

316
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:31,750
She was 45 years old.

317
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:37,280
45 years old?

318
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:42,910
She passed away so young.

319
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,680
Yes.

320
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,770
I was 18 years old.

321
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:57,340
Then, you would've been in 11th grade.

322
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,970
At that age,

323
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:02,830
you were still too young.

324
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:06,120
You must have missed your mother a lot.

325
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:13,410
I've been coming here alone since my wife died.

326
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,950
Now that you are here with me,

327
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:21,550
I don't feel lonely and have someone to rely on. It's nice.

328
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:25,530
Let's come together next winter too.

329
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:29,610
Okay. Thank you.

330
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,080
Ms. Park.

331
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,510
Can I buy you pork cutlets today?

332
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,700
Yes. I finally get to have a port cutlet.

333
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,570
It's exciting.

334
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,730
Se Ryun, you said you have news for us.

335
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,230
Is it something good?

336
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:56,060
Well, I'm getting married.

337
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,150
Are you getting married?

338
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,710
Congratulations!

339
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,870
Is it for real, this time?

340
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,510
Yes, it is.

341
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:08,330
I won't be running out of the wedding hall like the last time.

342
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:12,150
Who is it this time? What kind of a man is he?

343
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,980
It's someone you know.

344
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,970
It's Oh Seng Ho from Jinsa Group.

345
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:22,440
The one you dated briefly in the States?

346
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,850
Yes. It worked out like that.

347
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:28,720
You guys dated for a bit and broke up.

348
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,960
When did you get back together?

349
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,250
We ran into each other by accident.

350
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:37,840
And after a while, it worked out like that.

351
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,290
Se Ryun, I've heard a rumor about Seung Ho.

352
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,590
What rumor?

353
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:49,050
Some woman left him with a child, didn't you know?

354
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:52,400
What are you saying?

355
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:57,170
Seung Ho was dating someone working in an adult establishment but broke up because the family opposed it.

356
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,500
So the woman left the baby with him and left.

357
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,680
Did he not say anything about it?

358
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,510
No, not at all.

359
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,320
Are you sure about that?

360
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,690
I've never heard of it.

361
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,130
Really?

362
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:15,170
Maybe it's not true?

363
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,170
I'm sure not.

364
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:20,270
If someone hides something like that and gets married, that's a fraud.

365
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,970
Seung Ho wouldn't hide something like that.

366
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,450
They are first love to each other.

367
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,690
That's right. He's not someone who would do something like that.

368
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,440
I'm sorry, Se Ryun.

369
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:35,130
I must have misheard. Please don't pay attention.

370
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,230
Right, okay.

371
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:46,470
Oh my, is that so, Mrs. Moon?

372
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,680
Thank you for being considerate.

373
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,150
Yes, I will see you at the pre-wedding meeting.

374
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,980
Yes, yes.

375
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,310
- Is it Seung Ho's mother?
- You've come at the right time.

376
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:01,160
Mrs. Moon says she just made a contract at the 100-pyeong unit

377
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,680
in Alice Queen villa in Cheongdam-dong and asking would it be small for you.

378
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,250
Isn't 100-pyeong big enough for a newlywed?

379
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:11,260
Mom, that's not the issue.

380
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,940
I heard something strange.

381
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,880
Something strange?

382
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,090
I want you to look into this for me.

383
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,660
It's not something I could ask Seung Ho.

384
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,540
What? What is it?

385
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:29,160
There is a rumor Seung Ho has a child.

386
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:31,410
What are you saying?

387
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:33,360
Who says that? That's all false rumors.

388
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,780
Don't you think I'd have looked into all that before I agree to the marriage?

389
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:40,600
Also, don't you think Mrs. Jang would've looked in these already?

390
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,840
Mom, what do you mean?

391
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,800
Why would Mrs. Jang look into Seung Ho?

392
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,510
No, I meant...

393
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,530
After you and Seung Ho started seeing each other,

394
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:55,030
I asked Mrs. Jang to look into it for me.

395
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,230
Really?

396
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:01,920
Also, rumors like that are common about people like us.

397
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:07,130
So you just have to trust me and get married.

398
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,920
Okay.

399
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,920
I think I was shocked hearing that.

400
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,710
I'm going to have some iced coffee before I go.

401
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:16,690
Okay, okay.

402
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,550
Oh, my god. What's this?

403
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:25,570
Did that rumor already spread around? Where did she hear it?

404
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,620
Should I tell her now?

405
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:32,170
No, no. What if Se Ryun wants to cancel the wedding?

406
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:35,240
Where can she meet someone like Seung Ho?

407
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,800
Oh my, what do I do?

408
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,300
Oh, my head.

409
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,210
My head...

410
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,270
I think I'm doing something wrong right now.

411
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:02,110
Why do I feel so anxious and off?

412
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:08,420
I miss Dae Beom.

413
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,450
I can't be like this.

414
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:12,890
I've gone crazy.

415
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,960
Hello?

416
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,410
Hello, Ajumma.

417
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:29,450
Now?

418
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,780
What did you say?

419
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:36,260
Ajumma, is everything you said true?

420
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:40,100
Mrs. Wang told me not to tell you.

421
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,370
She wants to get you married as is.

422
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:46,010
But I feel you should know.

423
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:48,570
Of course, Jinsa Group is a good family.

424
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:52,230
And you and Seung Ho have known each other for a long time.

425
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:56,280
But from my point of view, I thought it's something I should tell you.

426
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:00,200
That's why I've asked you to see me.

427
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:08,890
Is it true that my mom told you not to tell me?

428
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:14,150
I thought about it a lot before calling you.

429
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:19,840
The most important thing between a married couple is trust. I didn't want it to become a problem later.

430
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:27,740
Thank you very much for contacting me.

431
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:39,610
I should not have arranged for you and Seung Ho to meet.

432
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:42,530
I'm really sorry.

433
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:45,630
What are you saying?

434
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:51,510
Your mom desperately wanted you to get married, so I looked around.

435
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:56,730
And at that time, Jinsa Group family was interested in you.

436
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:02,850
So I came up with a scenario where you two could meet "by accident."

437
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:07,160
And you looked good together.

438
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:12,490
I never knew things would turn out this way.

439
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:14,480
Are you saying...

440
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,810
Seung Ho and I reuniting was not by accident?

441
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:29,630
I'm sorry, but excuse me first.

442
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,630
What do I do?

443
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:38,870
Mrs. Wang's family will have a fuss.

444
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:45,800
No. It still was the right thing to do.

445
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,640
I'm the one who introduced them.

446
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:53,750
I can't cover up a fraudulent marriage.

447
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,720
Lawyer Koh, what are you saying?

448
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,720
Jinsa Group has been buying our stocks?

449
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,720
Even by creating a ghost company?

450
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,280
That's not all.

451
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,040
Oh Seung Ho, the second son of Jinsa Group that Se Ryun's dating,

452
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,930
he has a hidden daughter.

453
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,850
What?

454
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:16,270
Which means he has another woman.

455
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:19,260
But he still dated my Se Ryun?

456
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,710
It seems like Jinsa Group got rid of the child's mother a while ago.

457
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,240
But his relationships with women are messy.

458
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,640
The back story of why he split with his previous wife too.

459
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,520
I don't even want to talk about it.

460
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,450
How dare he try to approach my Se Ryun...

461
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:41,780
On top of that, they have been buying our company's stocks with a ghost company.

462
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:48,010
I think they knew about Se Ryun's ownership of the shares and approached her intentionally.

463
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,530
Mom.

464
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:56,070
Mom! Mom!

465
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,400
What's the matter?

466
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,330
Where is my mom?

467
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:02,880
She's in her room.

468
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,310
What's going on?

469
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:12,820
Why did you come back, Se Ryun? Did you forget something?

470
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:18,410
Mom, I heard that you also knew that Seung Ho has a seven-year-old daughter.

471
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,830
But why did you say that's not true?

472
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:23,140
Why did you tell her not to tell me?

473
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,610
Were you going to deceive me and make me marry him?

474
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:29,510
Se Ryun. The thing is...

475
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:34,660
I wondered about it, but it was true.

476
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:37,350
It's not anyone else,

477
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:40,520
but how can you do this to me, Mom?

478
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:45,330
No matter what happens to me or how unhappy it will make me,

479
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:48,080
all it matters to you is that I get married to get the shares. Is that it?

480
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,000
Is that why you were going to deceive me and get me married?

481
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,370
- Se Ryun.
- Even if I insisted on going through with this marriage,

482
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:58,550
you are the one who should have stopped me!

483
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:04,290
Are the shares more important to you than me?

484
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:06,420
Am I really your daughter?

485
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,220
Am I the daughter you gave birth to?

486
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,640
Se Ryun, that's not it.

487
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,970
Since you and Seung Ho are first love to each other,

488
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:16,130
I wanted to make it happen.

489
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:20,980
Mom. I just met with Mrs. Jang.

490
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,410
To make me and Seung Ho meet,

491
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,570
you intentionally set up an accidental encountering.

492
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:27,470
How can you...

493
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:31,860
How can you make me this miserable?

494
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,940
Did you have to go that far to get me married?

495
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,930
Se Ryun.

496
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:41,430
Se Ryun. Whether it was accidental or intentional reuniting,

497
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:44,530
what does that matter?

498
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:48,330
You don't have to worry about the child. Mrs. Moon will raise her.

499
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,120
Her birth is registered under Mrs. Moon as well,

500
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,450
so she will not affect you and Seung Ho.

501
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:57,460
But if you found that out, I thought it would upset you.

502
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,060
So, I decided to cover it up and carry on.

503
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,410
That's why I did that, Se Ryun.

504
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:06,320
Do you think you are making any sense!

505
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,010
How can you deceive Se Ryun for a fraudulent marriage?

506
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:12,950
To someone who even has a hidden child?

507
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,610
Why do you do things like this?

508
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,710
Oppa, please leave.

509
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:21,140
This is my business. So please leave.

510
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:26,280
Jinsa Group even created a ghost company and bought our company's share.

511
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,150
Did you know that too?

512
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:33,080
Oppa, is that true?

513
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,730
So Seung Ho's family has had their eyes on our company too?

514
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,450
No.

515
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,170
No, they are not the kind of people who would do that.

516
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:46,250
Even if that's the case, what's wrong with buying our shares?

517
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,990
Hey, Young Gook, be truthful with me.

518
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:53,580
Isn't this because you don't want to give up shares to Se Ryun when she gets married?

519
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:57,010
What? What did you say?

520
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:01,660
Mom. Why are you acting like this?

521
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:06,830
I can't handle you anymore, Mom.

522
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:09,060
You've disappointed me.

523
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:13,300
I don't even want to call you mom.

524
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:23,310
Se Ryun. Se Ryun!

525
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,540
What should I...

526
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,210
What should I do now?

527
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:47,930
Se Ryun! Se Ryun!

528
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,150
Really? Ms. Se Ryun is?

529
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:07,290
Yes. She's not registered as Madam Wang's daughter but of the deceased former Chairman and his wife.

530
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:11,090
Madam Wang couldn't even be registered as a family at all.

531
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:12,660
I see.

532
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,690
Chairman lived with Madam Wang

533
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:18,880
for twenty years until he passed away in a separate house in Pyeongchang-dong.

534
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:24,550
But the former Chairman didn't leave a dime to Madam Wang.

535
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:28,110
He left some shares with Se Ryun on the condition that she gets it when she gets married.

536
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:33,630
That's why Madam Wang's been desperately trying to get Se Ryun married so that she can get the shares.

537
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,720
I see.

538
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,530
Why do you think Chairman Lee dislikes Madam Wang?

539
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:40,650
Chairman Lee's mother, who passed away,

540
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:49,520
got sick from suffering by Madam Wang and passed away so young when Chairman was only in high school.

541
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,650
When you think of it, the Chairman has had a sad life.

542
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,220
He lost his mother while in high school.

543
00:40:55,220 --> 00:41:01,900
The wife he loved so much died so young after only a few years together.

544
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,490
Jung Woo Oppa.

545
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,050
It's me, Se Ryun.

546
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,370
Can we meet?

547
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:47,880
Hello, Mi Rim.

548
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,690
Good afternoon, Boss.

549
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:56,390
What's going on? We have the same scarves on. Where did you buy yours?

550
00:41:56,390 --> 00:42:00,430
My son bought mine from his part-time job earnings. What about you?

551
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,450
My friend gave it to me as a gift.

552
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:08,120
How could this happen? Of all the scarves in the world.

553
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:12,620
How could we end up with exactly the same scarves?

554
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,170
Mom, I'm here.

555
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:16,840
Hey, Joon Oh, come over here. Look at this.

556
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:23,140
Mi Rim has the same scarf as me. Isn't that incredible?

557
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:26,610
That's true.

558
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:34,040
Hey, Bong Joon Oh, why are you coming to the store so often these days?

559
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,340
What's going on?

560
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:39,450
I was nearby for an audition. But I blew it today as well.

561
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:44,630
For how long are you going to be catching clouds in the sky?

562
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,390
I don't know.

563
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:50,130
Aren't you going to hear your mom? Hey, Bong Joon Oh, Bong Joon Oh!

564
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:54,840
Please, please, listen to your mom!

565
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:02,270
Hey, Bong Joon Oh, how can you be so careless?

566
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:06,090
How can you buy us the same scarves?

567
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:13,330
Please think before you do something. Our relationship almost got caught by your mother.

568
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:21,090
I know. Because you two are the women I love the most in the world, I bought the same thing without thinking about it.

569
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:25,440
Are you saying you love me as much you love your mom?

570
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,140
Of course.

571
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,960
Joon Oh.

572
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,530
Didn't you know?

573
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:37,740
I knew you liked me, but not to that extent.

574
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:50,010
I really like you.

575
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:57,770
Let's get along like now without fighting for a long, long time.

576
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:59,850
Yes.

577
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:06,140
Yes.

578
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:13,260
- Se Ryun.
- Chairman Lee, Se Ryun has something to tell you.

579
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:21,350
Oppa. From what I understand, if I give up my shares, they will automatically go to you.

580
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:23,920
I will give up all of my shares.

581
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,670
Se Ryun.

582
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:32,820
Lawyer Koh. I mean, Jung Woo Oppa, please process it that way.

583
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:44,220
I want to die. I really want to die.

584
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:52,610
Se Ryun. Where have you been? Do you know how much I've worried about you?

585
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:58,600
Se Ryun, please sit down and listen to me.

586
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:03,060
Se Ryun. The reason why I didn't tell you about that is--

587
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:08,880
Mom. I've given up all of my shares.

588
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,550
What?

589
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:15,610
You scared me!

590
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:20,770
Even if you are angry at me, how can you joke about things like that?

591
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:27,570
Se Ryun. The reason why I asked Mrs. Jang to keep it quiet is all for you.

592
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:30,060
I thought you were going to marry him anyway.

593
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:35,060
What's the point of getting upset with news like that.

594
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:39,810
And you don't have to worry about the child since she's legally under Mrs. Moon and her husband.

595
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:44,110
She will have nothing to do with you.

596
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:49,890
I wanted you to be with your first love. That's why I asked her to keep quiet.

597
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:56,200
Mom. Even if you are trying to convince me with such nonsense,

598
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,660
it doesn't matter anymore.

599
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:02,760
Se Ryun, why are you scaring me like that?

600
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,910
Mom. All this time,

601
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:14,260
I've not had anyone who got close to me with genuine feelings.

602
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:20,080
The people I dated before, like Ji Seob, Min Ho, Gyeong Seok, and even Seung Ho.

603
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,950
They all came to me because they were after my shares.

604
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:28,850
Even my friends are only interested in using me.

605
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:33,050
They got close to me because I'm the daughter of the FT Group.

606
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:40,950
Mom. Do you have any idea how lonely I've been because of it?

607
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:44,520
No one has accepted me for who I am, as I am.

608
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:50,510
That's why whenever I meet someone new, I start with suspicion.

609
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:55,730
Yes, I'm sure this person is like that too.

610
00:46:55,730 --> 00:47:01,150
Do you know how sad and lonely being like that is?

611
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:05,110
Yes, Se Ryun.

612
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:11,500
But since you are my mom, you are the one who gave birth to me.

613
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:18,130
But how? How could you deceive me too?

614
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:26,820
I've concluded that the thing that's making my life unhappy are the shares, so I've handed them over to my Oppa.

615
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:32,980
So from now on, don't ever think of selling me off to somewhere that ridiculous.

616
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:38,650
Se Ryun. Why do you keep speaking strangely?

617
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:43,510
You are lying to make me upset, right?

618
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:48,710
You're saying this on purpose because you are mad at me. This is not true, right?

619
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:51,820
No, I've handed everything over.

620
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:57,920
My dad's will says if I gave up my shares, they would go automatically to Oppa.

621
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:05,320
I met up with Lawyer Koh and signed the papers, and processed everything. I told Oppa about it as well.

622
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,030
Mom.

623
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:14,680
Now that I am free, so please stop hanging yourself to the shares.

624
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,860
Please live freely.

625
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:32,280
Lawyer Koh.

626
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:38,860
Is it true Se Ryun gave up her shares?

627
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:45,720
It's true?

628
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:55,720
Hey, how can you do this?

629
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:01,290
How dare you give them up? Do you know what I've lived for until now?

630
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:03,610
Are you crazy? Are you!

631
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:05,550
Mom...

632
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:10,030
Bring them back. Bring them back, now!

633
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:13,710
Mom! It's all over for us.

634
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:17,840
So please don't hang on to it anymore!

635
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:25,590
Mom. I'm really sorry.

636
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:33,540
No, it can't be...

637
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:39,070
I can't have Young Gook take them from me.

638
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:43,390
No, no...

639
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:46,530
I can't.

640
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:49,450
I can't let him take it away.

641
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:56,210
The preparations for the fashion show are going smoothly without issues.

642
00:49:56,210 --> 00:50:02,280
But Young Gook, what is it about Se Ryun handing over her shares?

643
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,790
Thing is...

644
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:07,040
Get out of my way!

645
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,570
- Hey!
- Madam.

646
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:12,970
Hey, you! You know why I'm here.

647
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:15,810
You better cancel that now. Now!

648
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:20,000
Se Ryun made a crazy decision since she's shocked and out of her mind!

649
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,160
Oh good, Lawyer Koh. You're here too.

650
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,720
The shares Se Ryun relinquished, you can cancel that, right?!

651
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,890
Right?!

652
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:32,110
Those shares have now been absorbed by the company.

653
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:35,230
That's how it's been handled, so just know that.

654
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:39,460
Hey! What do you mean by it's handled that way? By whose permission?

655
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:41,430
Who decided that should go back to the company?!

656
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:44,300
Reverse it. Give it back. Reverse it right now!

657
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:47,060
I cannot do that!

658
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:50,260
Those shares originally belonged to Se Ryun.

659
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:53,070
Her shares, by her will,

660
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:55,360
she decided to give them back to the company.

661
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,480
What right do you have to come here and act this way?

662
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,160
Leave immediately.

663
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,910
What?!

664
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:05,450
You bastard! How can you do this!

665
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:06,570
You!!

666
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,600
You bastard! How can you do this!

667
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,500
Please stop, Madam Wang.

668
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,190
Calm down.

669
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:14,840
I told you not to butt into my business!

670
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,680
Hey, you're trying to get revenge on me, aren't you?

671
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,620
Because of your mother, you're trying to get revenge on me!

672
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,870
Madam Wang, this is the company. Please calm down.

673
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:27,350
Young Gook.

674
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:34,160
Secretary Yoon, please have Driver Kim escort her to the house.

675
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,050
Yes, I will.

676
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:40,380
Hey, Lee Young Gook!

677
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:41,170
Madam Wang.

678
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:45,760
Lee Young Gook, you bastard. You bastard...

679
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:53,890
You bastard...

680
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:03,480
Seung Ho, why did you hide that you have a daughter?

681
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,190
We innocently dated in the past,

682
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:09,930
and since we ran into each other again, I thought we were meant to be together.

683
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:12,070
That's why I tried to make it work.

684
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:16,380
But you were scheming from the beginning.

685
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:18,560
You devised an entire plot with others.

686
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,040
Sure, even up to that, it's fine.

687
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,690
I was seeing another man at the time.

688
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:27,860
And you said you wanted to be with me even doing so, I understand.

689
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:30,570
Regardless, this isn't right.

690
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:33,620
How could you deceive me the fact that you have a kid?

691
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:37,530
Se Ryun, Cho Rong is my child,

692
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:41,090
but she's registered under my mom's name, so I thought it would be alright.

693
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:44,520
Which is why I didn't think it was necessary to tell you.

694
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:48,880
Are you calling that an excuse?

695
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:53,240
Let's end it here.

696
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:57,040
Se Ryun. I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

697
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,780
I just didn't want to lose you. The feelings I have for you are real.

698
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,720
Are your feelings real?

699
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,920
Yes. I'm sincere.

700
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,120
But Seung Ho, I don't have a single share.

701
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,370
I gave them all to my brother.

702
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:15,410
Even still, are you going to hold onto me?

703
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:17,810
What?

704
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:24,680
I knew you'd do that.

705
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:27,480
You jerk.

706
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,500
I'll send the painting you gave me tomorrow.

707
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,900
This is it for us.

708
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,770
S-Se Ryun.

709
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:58,410
Will you really be okay?

710
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:03,420
I really don't have any regrets. I feel so free.

711
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,810
I'm serious.

712
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:12,070
When I was younger, I was FT Group's hidden daughter.

713
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:15,570
When I got older, I was a mistress' daughter.

714
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:19,570
Now I'm heiress of the company's share.

715
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:24,000
No one has ever seen me for who I am.

716
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,530
All they'd do is talk behind my back.

717
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:34,610
Oppa, now I can't trust anyone.

718
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:40,750
Even now, I want to escape from what's been strangling me.

719
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:49,890
Others may not, but I know you'll understand.

720
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:58,960
Then what are you going to do moving forward?

721
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:06,250
I don't know. For a while, I'm not going to make plans or think about much.

722
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:12,810
I get it. But if you need any help at all, let me know.

723
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:19,980
Oppa, that promise you made about not throwing my mom out,

724
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:24,810
please keep that promise.

725
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:27,740
She never got to marry our dad officially,

726
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:33,930
and always living her life as a hidden woman is a scar on her heart.

727
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:39,080
It's always been her dream to be FT Group's Madam.

728
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:44,350
Even if it's a fake one, let her live it.

729
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:50,570
Let her have that one thing.

730
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:55,310
Okay, I get it. I promise.

731
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,360
Thanks, Oppa.

732
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:10,530
The only daughter I have betrayed me.

733
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:16,870
Now I have nothing left but death.

734
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:21,390
Let's just die.

735
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:27,200
Hey, you old bastard!

736
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,820
You wait right there!

737
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:35,150
I'm going to find you in the afterlife and strangle you to death.

738
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:40,800
I'm going to pummel you into pieces, you bastard!

739
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:47,840
Okay. Let's go.

740
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,100
Let's go, let's just die.

741
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,880
Let's just die...

742
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,450
Let's die.

743
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:57,810
Let's just die...

744
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:05,960
I'm going. I'm dying...

745
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,630
Oh, it's cold.

746
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:13,720
Oh, it's so cold.

747
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,670
What kind of water is this ice-cold?

748
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:17,890
It's freezing!

749
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:19,790
It's too cold for me to die.

750
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:22,300
It's freezing! It's too cold for me to die.

751
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:26,120
I really want to die, but it's so cold I can't.

752
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,620
I'm cold! I'm so cold.

753
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:30,070
So cold.

754
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:32,060
Oh, my, it's freezing.

755
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:34,020
I really want to die, but it's too cold.

756
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:36,210
So cold.

757
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:38,830
Oh, my, it's freezing.

758
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:49,390
Hey.

759
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:52,520
Can you sleep?

760
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:55,760
Wake up.

761
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,200
Wake up, I said.

762
00:59:06,350 --> 00:59:08,190
W-what...

763
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:12,810
What are you doing here at this hour?

764
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:17,500
I can't sleep.

765
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:21,410
I feel so unfair that I can't sleep.

766
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:26,240
Young Gook, I won't ask you for all the shares.

767
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:30,360
Just half. Just give me half, Young Gook, okay?

768
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,910
Chairman Lee.

769
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:43,680
Get out of my room, now.

770
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:52,640
Young Gook, put yourself in my position.

771
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:58,450
I lived with your father for over 20 years but look at me now.

772
00:59:58,450 --> 01:00:03,750
Your father didn't leave a dime for me.

773
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:08,150
And Se Ryun's shares were the only thing I lived for.

774
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:13,550
Even if Se Ryun was out of her mind and gave those shares to you, you should've stopped her.

775
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:17,860
How could you just take it?

776
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:25,230
Young Gook, if you have warm blood pumping in your heart.

777
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:29,690
If you have an ounce of sympathy for me.

778
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:32,120
You're not supposed to do this to me.

779
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:38,630
Young Gook, just give me a quarter of those shares, at least.

780
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:43,110
Young Gook, Chairman Lee...

781
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:45,710
It's legally not possible.

782
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:49,250
There's nothing I can do anymore.

783
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:54,910
Hey, do you think I came here at this hour to talk about the law?

784
01:00:54,910 --> 01:00:59,010
I'm talking to your human feelings. Human natures!

785
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:03,210
My life. I'm talking about one woman's entire life right now!

786
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:11,350
Did you just talk about a woman's life in front of me?

787
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:13,720
Why are you raising your voice?

788
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:18,820
Because of you, a family was broken, got an illness,

789
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:25,050
and passed away early. It's my mother's life. What do you think about her life?

790
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:29,910
My mother passed away when she was only 45.

791
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:31,490
Because of you!

792
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:33,530
So what!

793
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:39,410
So is that why you won't give me a single share?

794
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:42,850
Yes. I can't give anything to you.

795
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:48,170
Even if I could, I won't.

796
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:49,890
Hey, Lee Young Gook!!

797
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:51,190
Hey!!

798
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:53,190
From this point on, you're my enemy.

799
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:57,300
I'm going to stay in this house until the walls crumble.

800
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:59,180
I'm going to dry your blood out.

801
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:02,510
Let's see who wins, you or me!

802
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:05,810
Madam Wang, please calm down.

803
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:09,060
Hey, Mrs. Yeoju! How am I supposed to live?

804
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:11,030
How am I supposed to live? How do I live?

805
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:12,470
