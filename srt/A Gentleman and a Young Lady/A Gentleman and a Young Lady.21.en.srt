[Episode 21]

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,080
The ball is over there.

3
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,000
What the hell are you doing now?

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,050
What do you mean?

5
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,200
I thought you might get hurt,

6
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:04,550
so all I did was hold your head in my hands to make sure you didn't get hurt.

7
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,200
You just on my lips--!

8
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,570
I mean, you did that!

9
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,020
T-That's just...

10
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,300
I was trying to save you.

11
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,110
I was afraid your head might get hurt.

12
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,950
When I was trying to hold your head with my hands...

13
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,340
We rolled and our lips collided.

14
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,480
What did I do wrong?

15
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,990
If I hadn't held your head,

16
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,650
he-here...

17
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,350
Your head would have broken by hitting here.

18
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,420
You would have gone to the emergency room!

19
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,630
But then you looked at me for like 0.00001 seconds.

20
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,140
W-Why did you look at me?

21
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,170
When did I do that? When?

22
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,400
Also, what if I looked at you?

23
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,300
What is this? Are you saying I did it on purpose?

24
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:04,480
It's like saving someone from drowning and them asking you where their bag is.

25
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,110
Also, when I was sliding down here,

26
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,320
who was the one pulled me tight by my waist?

27
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,350
You are the one who pulled my waist!

28
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,080
You hold on to my waist first!

29
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,820
What is this?

30
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,130
By any chance...

31
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:30,770
Did you do it on purpose to make this kind of a situation?

32
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:35,800
What the hell are you saying?

33
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,690
Dad! Ms. Park!

34
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,050
- We are here.
- Here, here.

35
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:47,370
Chairman, let's talk about this again later.

36
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,890
Do you think I'll be scared if you say so?

37
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,710
But...

38
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,810
What really happened?

39
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,970
Left foot. Left foot. Left foot.

40
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,070
Left foot. Left foot. Left foot.

41
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,800
Left foot. Left foot. Left foot.

42
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,050
♫ Even just once ♫

43
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:30,440
♫ If I get to see you again. ♫

44
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,660
When I tripped, I did hold on to the Chairman.

45
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,180
I cannot deny that fact.

46
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,800
Then like what Chairman said,

47
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,580
did our lips really collide because of the rebound from rolling?

48
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,090
No, that's not true.

49
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:52,730
Certainly, before our lips collided for 0.00001 seconds,

50
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,670
he looked at me.

51
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,220
If that happened by coincidence,

52
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,430
then why did he look at me at that moment?

53
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,920
Why?

54
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,010
The coffee smell is so nice!

55
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,080
It's very nice! Very nice!

56
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,880
It's ready. I'll bring it for you.

57
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,360
No, I will drink it here.

58
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,630
Or should I drink in the living room?

59
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,650
Because Young Gook is not here, I can roam everywhere in the house. I feel alive today!

60
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,920
I wish Young Gook took kids out for exercise every morning like today.

61
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,430
- Madam, here you go.
- Thank you.

62
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,600
But where is Chief Jo? Didn't she come to work yet?

63
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,950
That's right. Chief Jo told me that she's sick and didn't come for work today.

64
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,760
Is Chief Jo sick?

65
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,800
Yes, Gi Ja. I was going to call you.

66
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,140
Hey, Wang Dae Ran!

67
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,490
What are you going to do with my daughter?

68
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,380
Sarah is on her death bed, and I don't even see the shade of you!

69
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,420
What are you going to do with my daughter now!

70
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,670
Why are you yelling at me when your daughter is sick!

71
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,050
What?

72
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:11,610
Did Young Gook really say that? Did he say he can't get married?

73
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:16,530
Yes. He said he sees me only as a Noona.

74
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,580
So, he said he couldn't get married.

75
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,030
You two even went to the vacation home, and how could you not be able to seal the deal?

76
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,240
- What's so hard about getting a man on your side?
- Hey!

77
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,680
Do you think she is like you?

78
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,520
Watch what you are saying!

79
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,580
I told you this before!

80
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,930
I said this is impossible!

81
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,520
It's insulting our pride.

82
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,290
You should put an end to this now.

83
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:48,200
Just forget about it! Besides Chairman Lee, half of the people on Earth are men.

84
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,890
Also, we can live well without Chairman Lee!

85
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,900
We can live a fine life--!

86
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,790
Right, right. I'm exhausted too.

87
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,630
Let's end it right here!

88
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,590
Put an end to it now.

89
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,330
No, I can't. I can't put an end to this.

90
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,350
What did you say to me, Madam?

91
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,810
If I help you live at the Chairman's house,

92
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,970
you said you would make me the madam of the house,

93
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,910
your daughter-in-law, no matter what!

94
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,360
But how can you say you'll quit now?

95
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,060
I didn't start this conversation.

96
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,730
Your mom, Lee Gi Ja, said we should end this first!

97
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,000
Hey, Wang Dae Ran!

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,460
What are you going to do now?

99
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,610
You got her into this, so you take responsibility for it!

100
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,230
My goodness! It's giving me a headache.

101
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:38,820
You're frightening me. This is exhausting!

102
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,590
Wait a minute.

103
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,970
Mistress Ajumma! Are you out of your mind?

104
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,340
I'm not wearing anything! What the heck are you doing?

105
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,830
I knocked before I came in!

106
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,340
He calls me Mistress every chance he gets. Rude bastard.

107
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,230
Mistress Ajumma.

108
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:00,400
You are living here under the condition of staying out of my view. What happened to that?

109
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,170
Get out of the house now if you don't keep the promise!

110
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:07,170
Seriously! I didn't come here because I wanted to see you.

111
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:12,840
Chief Jo was too ill to come to work because of you.

112
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:18,430
Chief Jo Noona couldn't come to work because of me?

113
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,970
- Why?
- "Why?"

114
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,690
Don't you know why?

115
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,080
I heard that you told her you couldn't marry her.

116
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,560
She got shocked and got sick now.

117
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,460
Is she very ill?

118
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,270
Of course, why else couldn't she come to work?

119
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,690
How could she not be sick when she heard something very hurtful?

120
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,570
She's been looking only at you all this time.

121
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,590
You can't do that to Chief Jo, who sacrificed for you.

122
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,550
You can't just use her when it's convenient.

123
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,430
Heaven will punish you for that.

124
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,780
Even so, I can't remember anything.

125
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,660
She only feels like a Noona to me.

126
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:03,630
How can I marry her when I don't feel anything toward her?

127
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,020
How about, if you can't marry her,

128
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,530
just getting engaged?

129
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,560
- Get engaged?
- Yes!

130
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,350
You will marry her when your memory comes back.

131
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,660
You can't hurt a woman you will marry, can you?

132
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,190
That's not right.

133
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,180
Engagement?

134
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:05,360
I thought he would be easier to handle since he reverted to 22 years old.

135
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,790
But how can it be more difficult?

136
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,630
Even so, I'm not backing off.

137
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,620
It wasn't easy to get this far, so I can't give up now.

138
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,570
I will never quit it.

139
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,330
Of course.

140
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:20,650
I've already told everyone in the neighborhood that you will be the next FT Group's madam.

141
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:24,950
How can I say that it didn't work out? I can't do that.

142
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:28,210
Once you draw the sword,

143
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,930
you have to cut through something.

144
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,440
Then why did you tell me to quit just then?

145
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,470
I did it because I was frustrated.

146
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,580
Anyway, Sarah,

147
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,330
just quit it whenever if it's not going well.

148
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,560
I can support you now.

149
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,280
With what?

150
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,620
If you don't live off me, I'd be happy.

151
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,190
You don't know anything.

152
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,820
Who is it?

153
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:02,160
Who is it? Oh!

154
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,810
Sarah, Sarah! It's Chairman Lee!

155
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,940
What? Chairman? Why is he here?

156
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,330
Why, Why?

157
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,800
Drink some water first.

158
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,170
Chairman.

159
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,960
Are you okay?

160
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:37,520
I'm sorry I couldn't go to work.

161
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,010
How could you when you are sick like this?

162
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,250
Sarah.

163
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:48,980
Chairman Lee brought you flowers and a cake.

164
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,580
- Please, have a seat.
- Thank you.

165
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,130
Please sit.

166
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,040
I'll leave you two alone.

167
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,700
It's because of me, isn't it?

168
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,320
You are sick because of me.

169
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,400
I'm sorry.

170
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,610
Chief Jo Noona.

171
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,480
Please understand me.

172
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,750
As you know, I'm trying as well.

173
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,380
But, I can only think like 22 years old.

174
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:37,560
And I can only think of you as a Noona, not a girlfriend.

175
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,740
What about me?

176
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:45,730
Should I grow old and die waiting for you?

177
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Let's get engaged this Christmas Eve.

178
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,610
Chairman.

179
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:04,490
Let's get engaged first, and let's get married when my memory comes back.

180
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,970
So please don't be mad at me.

181
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,570
If you are like this,

182
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:14,030
it upsets me, and I feel sorry for you.

183
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,170
Okay.

184
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:24,410
But I hope we don't stay engaged for too long.

185
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,620
But still, I don't want to get married until my memory comes back.

186
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,710
I don't want to force myself when I don't remember anything.

187
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:37,970
He seems naive but very stubborn.

188
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:43,160
Sure. I don't like it, but I have to settle for an engagement at least.

189
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,890
That will give me a chance to bring his heart around to me.

190
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,580
And move the wedding date forward.

191
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,900
Don't you want to be engaged?

192
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,070
It's not like that.

193
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,330
Let's get engaged.

194
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,230
You didn't delay our wedding on purpose.

195
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:10,570
It's because you were injured, so it couldn't be helped.

196
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:16,850
Let's get engaged on Christmas Eve.

197
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,920
Thank you for understanding.

198
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:28,530
I will try hard to regain my memory.

199
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,880
Right, Lee Young Gook. Good job. Well done.

200
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,640
I should get engaged with her, at least.

201
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,830
I shouldn't hurt Chief Jo Noona anymore.

202
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,180
What are you doing, Ms. Park Noona?

203
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,790
We should finish our conversation.

204
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,790
What conversation?

205
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,830
I don't have any more to say.

206
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:09,120
What did you mean when you said I held on to your waist on purpose?

207
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,330
I didn't do it on purpose.

208
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,110
Okay, then.

209
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:20,000
Let's just say you didn't do it on purpose.

210
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,330
That's not good enough.

211
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:26,880
I really, really didn't do it intentionally.

212
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:33,090
Anyway, let's just forget about what happened.

213
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:37,840
Since you didn't do it on purpose either.

214
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,440
It's very unfair to me,

215
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,120
but let's do it that way.

216
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,520
What? It's unfair to you?

217
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,650
I'm the unfair one!

218
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,570
You are the one who touched me first.

219
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,690
If you didn't hold on to my waist when you fell,

220
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,580
our lips wouldn't have touched each other.

221
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:05,700
It's so unfair that my first kiss at 22 years of age happened like this!

222
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,970
What about me? It was my first time too!

223
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:14,150
Anyway, let's all forget about it!

224
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:22,800
What the heck did I just say? Why did I say that?

225
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,800
What did you just say?

226
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,900
That was your first kiss?

227
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,670
Chairman! You are the father of three kids!

228
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:44,870
What kind of nonsense are you saying?

229
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,820
It's so unfair!

230
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,450
I have no memory of it, but I have three kids.

231
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,340
I haven't kissed or dated anyone properly.

232
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,090
But I have three kids.

233
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:03,840
I don't know! I'm going to do whatever I want from now on.

234
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,850
Ajussi, I'm sorry.

235
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:23,270
And thank you so much for coming today.

236
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,530
What was that?

237
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,510
Why is she doing that to me?

238
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,380
I can't figure it out.

239
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,100
Why am I keep thinking about it?

240
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,570
She's getting married.

241
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,440
Anyway, why is there no news from the interview?

242
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,760
Did I get rejected?

243
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,350
Who is this?

244
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,860
Yes, hello?

245
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,870
Yes, it's Cha Geon.

246
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,790
Pardon me?

247
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,970
Did I get the job?

248
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,460
Is this really for real?

249
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,390
Ah, yes, I get it.

250
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:15,660
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

251
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,150
Geon, what are you thanking for?

252
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,860
- Mom. I got a job.
- What?

253
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,980
I just got the call for acceptance!

254
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,230
What did you say? Is that true?

255
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:36,300
Yes. It's just a driver job, but it's with a big corporation. I'll get a paycheck every month!

256
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,780
Is that true?

257
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:44,100
Ah, is this a dream or real? It's real.

258
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,570
Does it make you that happy that I got a job?

259
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,860
Aigoo. Of course, I'm happy!

260
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:55,370
Aigoo. Now all you have to do is get married.

261
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:58,770
I just got the job. How can you talk about getting married?

262
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,200
I'm sure I could marry someday.

263
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:08,860
Did you make up your mind?

264
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,890
It's hard to believe all I need is the deposit.

265
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,270
I heard the premium for this place is very expensive.

266
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:18,230
Of course. How could I get a premium from you?

267
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:22,690
I told you. I'm paying you back for saving me.

268
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:26,810
But still, it's too much to ask for you.

269
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:31,240
If that's the case, contact me after you succeed in running the business.

270
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,120
You can pay me back the premium then.

271
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:42,050
Thank you. Sergeant Heo.

272
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,630
I will give it a try.

273
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,430
Yes. You will do well

274
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,800
Please succeed.

275
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,400
Yes.

276
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,310
But I have a favor to ask.

277
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:58,670
I will need time to come up with the deposit.

278
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,580
Give me a few days.

279
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,380
Yes, yes.

280
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,410
When you say you'll take the business, I can wait.

281
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:13,250
I will tell the realtor I've found someone to take over the business.

282
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:18,140
Thank you. Thank you very much.

283
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,230
It's good!

284
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,790
- Try this.
- Okay.

285
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,850
- It's so good!
- Really?

286
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,630
It's more delicious and fun since I'm eating with you.

287
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:10,830
Me, too. Everything tastes good and fun being together with you.

288
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:21,820
Mi Rim, do you want to live together like this?

289
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,980
Shall we?

290
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,910
Joon Oh.

291
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,140
Joon Oh!

292
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,980
When did you come?

293
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,510
Mom. I just came home.

294
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,810
You should have called me.

295
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:06,510
I would have come home earlier.

296
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,200
I just came for a few minutes.

297
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,330
I packed up a few essential things along with some side dishes.

298
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,400
You should have told me.

299
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,670
I would have made more delicious foods.

300
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,170
It's okay. This is more than enough.

301
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:22,500
Before, you didn't pack any food even if I begged you to do so.

302
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,020
- Look at you now. Aren't you sick of eating out now?
- Yes.

303
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:31,640
Your cooking is the best.

304
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,010
What did you pack anyway?

305
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,510
I didn't have much side dishes.

306
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:38,510
I will make a few more dishes for you to take.

307
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:43,260
No, Mom. I don't have much time, so I have to go.

308
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,500
Are you going already?

309
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,000
Ah, really. You are making me upset.

310
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,420
You always come here and leave so soon.

311
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,620
I'm sorry, Mom.

312
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,800
Mom, I will visit more often.

313
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,360
Let's go out together for a meal next time.

314
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,690
And go to a movie too.

315
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,810
I don't expect something like that.

316
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:15,870
It's not like you have time to do so.

317
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:19,020
Don't worry about me, and just focus on your study.

318
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,190
It's not easy studying to be a doctor.

319
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,350
Okay.

320
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:28,050
I will.

321
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,330
- I will get going.
- Okay.

322
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:35,480
It's still upsetting me!

323
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:43,230
Wait, that's strange.

324
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,970
It's not even the weekend. How did he come here?

325
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,620
Did he finish the final exams?

326
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,280
Park Dan Dan. Are you crazy?

327
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,120
Why do you keep thinking of it?

328
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,940
Just forget it all.

329
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:20,180
Why can't I concentrate?

330
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:42,130
That was not just an accident.

331
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,840
I could have avoided it for sure.

332
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,130
But at that moment,

333
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,550
it was like being pulled by a magnet.

334
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,520
I went to her lips.

335
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,310
Why did I do that?

336
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:00,640
I couldn't do it with Chief Jo Noona even though I planned for it.

337
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,650
What's going on, really?

338
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:08,060
By the way, she hadn't kissed anyone until age 27?

339
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:12,700
Then that means Ms. Park Noona doesn't have a boyfriend.

340
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,150
Then did she never have a boyfriend until now?

341
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,800
No way.

342
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,890
Please come in.

343
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,330
Why?

344
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,720
Do you want to argue some more?

345
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,210
It's not that.

346
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,850
I have something to tell you.

347
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:43,730
What is it?

348
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,020
After I finish working here,

349
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,000
I have to go my own way.

350
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,860
So I would like to study something.

351
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,600
Once I take Se Jong to kindergarten, it's my free time.

352
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:05,290
Would it be okay if I take an English class at that time?

353
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:08,990
That's during your free time.

354
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:12,770
It doesn't matter if you take an English class or a Math class.

355
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:17,060
Also, if you study English, it'll be helpful for my kids, too.

356
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:20,310
So please do.

357
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,010
Thank you.

358
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:25,120
I will get going then.

359
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:35,360
It's still a while before her contract ends.

360
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,120
But why is she getting ready to leave already?

361
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,540
What?

362
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,550
What did you just say?

363
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:46,610
Did you say you want to take out this house deposit to do business?

364
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:48,900
You can't do that, Honey.

365
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,790
It's such a great opportunity to miss.

366
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,090
He will hand it to me without getting the premium.

367
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,810
You couldn't get a better deal.

368
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:58,120
That's all a fraud.

369
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,670
Who would give you a store without getting the premium?

370
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:04,420
He's a reliable senior from the military.

371
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,410
He wants to pay me back for saving him before he migrates.

372
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:10,540
I don't care about his reason. I'm sick of doing a business.

373
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:14,380
Besides, the owner of this house won't give us the deposit anyway.

374
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,780
If the business fails after using the deposit,

375
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,620
we really have to get out on the street!

376
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,440
I haven't even started, and you're speaking about failing.

377
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,710
No one wants to fail in business.

378
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:28,780
But not even one out of ten makes it by running a restaurant.

379
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,320
Honey, why do you want to get into something so risky?

380
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,360
Dae Beom failed in his business, and if you do the same, I'll die prematurely.

381
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:43,030
Honey, can't you just get a job that pays a salary?

382
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:47,400
Honey, I know what you are worried about, but I've checked it all.

383
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,320
There is good foot traffic in the area.

384
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,770
I've talked to a number of realtors nearby.

385
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,820
They all said it's a good spot.

386
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,440
They all said it's hard to find something like that without paying the premium.

387
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,200
I still don't like it. Please find a job that pays the salary.

388
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,220
Yes, Son-in-law Park.

389
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,070
Please think carefully.

390
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:08,810
It's easy to start it over from failing when you are young,

391
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:14,210
but it will be hard at your age if it doesn't work out.

392
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:17,630
You heard what my mom said, didn't you?

393
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,720
Why is everyone so negative?

394
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,630
If it's true that he doesn't have to pay the premium,

395
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,930
it's worth thinking about it.

396
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,760
You can't get a chance like this.

397
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,200
Everyone is hindered by having to pay the premium.

398
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,580
Let's not just talk about it,

399
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,130
but you should go and take a look for yourself, Noona.

400
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,160
You should stay quiet.

401
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,450
Do you wish to see us all go bankrupt?

402
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:45,860
Honey, I will take out as much house deposit as they'll let me and start the business.

403
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:51,800
No, you can't! What if you go bankrupt by using the house deposit?

404
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:56,280
I'm against this! I said so!

405
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,450
Do you want me to change the deposit to monthly rent?

406
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:01,210
How can I come up with that kind of money on short notice?

407
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:06,320
But can't you make it happen?

408
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,360
Yes.

409
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,830
I get it.

410
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:39,920
You have no security, and all personal loans have ceased.

411
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,160
What is it?

412
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,390
What do you want to say?

413
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,990
Mom, you know that thing we have.

414
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:59,590
Let's give it to my brother-in-law.

415
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:02,260
What are you talking about?

416
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,890
That thing!

417
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:06,890
I'm asking you, what thing?

418
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,880
- I don't know what you are saying.
- Mom!

419
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,780
You know what I'm saying.

420
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,930
The 20 million won that we put away.

421
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:16,360
What good is it to hide it inside the closet?

422
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,870
Let's invest it in my brother-in-law.

423
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:22,820
Besides, I have a job and get a salary every month from now on.

424
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,860
Don't speak of it.

425
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,810
I can't let go of that money.

426
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:32,720
You know that we made that 20 million won working hard in Vietnam without sleeping.

427
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,050
It's for when you get married.

428
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:39,010
Don't even speak about it. I can't take that out.

429
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,730
Mom.

430
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:45,260
And Geon. What were you talking about it?

431
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,880
Were you hiding 20 million won in secret?

432
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,900
Yeon Sil, the thing is...

433
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,670
Geon said no.

434
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:00,270
But I put away that 20 million won.

435
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,580
Mom, how can you do that to us?

436
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,710
Why are we living in this rotten house with a leaky roof?

437
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:11,990
Because you used our house deposit five years ago for Geon's business.

438
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:14,670
But instead of repurchasing our house that you lost,

439
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:19,040
how can you put away the money?

440
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,900
That's why I gave you 50 million won.

441
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,390
It's because we felt sorry toward Son-in-law Park.

442
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:29,050
But I put away 20 million won for Geon's wedding someday.

443
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:32,640
He's your younger brother. Is it that unfair to you?

444
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,160
Yes, it is. It's very unfair to me!

445
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:39,940
Oh, my goodness. You are only sister to him.

446
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:43,270
Even if we gave you all of 70 million won,

447
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:47,160
you should've said, "Mom, 50 million won is too much."

448
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,360
"Keep that 20 million won and use it for Geon's wedding."

449
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,490
"You would've worked so hard in Vietnam to make that money."

450
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:57,680
Don't you think that's what you should've said?

451
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:02,580
How can you say that out of all people?

452
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:06,530
How can you? It's unfair to me.

453
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:10,470
Do you know why we end up living like this?

454
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:14,140
How come you only think about Geon?

455
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:17,990
Do you not feel bad for Soo Chul, who works so hard to make a living?

456
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:23,040
How could you only care about your own son?

457
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:30,810
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

458
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:33,490
Don't be like this to mom.

459
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:36,700
I'll pay back all of that money before I die.

460
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:42,070
I will die after I pay it back.

461
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:47,400
No, no. I'm the one that's sorry.

462
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:54,070
I'm sorry for being a poor and incompetent parent.

463
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:37,780
Dae Beom is so cool.

464
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,540
You'll catch a cold. Here.

465
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,870
Thank you.

466
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:57,730
It feels good.

467
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:02,250
Baby, let's have a toast.

468
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:06,820
Here's to our future. Cheers!

469
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:19,530
It's so good to be like this.

470
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:25,500
I'm so happy I could cry.

471
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,530
What about you?

472
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:31,270
I'm happy too.

473
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:35,090
Dae Beom, let's go look at houses tomorrow.

474
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:39,450
- A house?
- Staying at the hotel is uncomfortable.

475
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,980
Would you prefer Cheongdam-dong or Seongsu-dong?

476
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,150
Don't you already have a house?

477
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:47,910
We can't go to that house. I don't know when my mom might stop by.

478
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:55,800
I want to stay with you uninterrupted for a while.

479
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,650
Also, that house is too small for the two of us to live in.

480
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,910
Okay, let's do that.

481
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:04,290
Let's do cheers.

482
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,960
Thank you.

483
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,680
It's detoxing juice. Drink up.

484
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,040
Mom, how do I look?

485
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,340
Do I look young?

486
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:31,720
How can a 37-year-old ever look 22-year-old?

487
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,630
Is there no way I could look young?

488
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:37,620
I hate hearing him calling me Noona.

489
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:41,100
What should I do?

490
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:45,520
With the way things are, what are you going to do if the Chairman regains his memories?

491
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,700
What are you going to do when everything goes down the drain?

492
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,950
Getting engaged is useless.

493
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:55,620
You need to think of a way to speed up the marriage.

494
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,300
That's why I'm doing everything I can.

495
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,730
I put more effort into my make-up and exercise more.

496
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:04,660
I even drink detoxing juice.

497
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:08,680
Instead of doing all that, go to an island with him.

498
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,740
Island? What island?

499
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:15,020
Why can't you catch a hint?

500
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,770
I can't even seduce him for you.

501
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:21,260
Do you really not know? That classic way?

502
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,550
Go to an island, and the boats are all stopped, so you two...

503
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:30,110
When that happens, the job is done.

504
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,290
If you get pregnant,

505
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:35,380
even if his memory comes back,

506
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:39,890
there's nothing to be afraid of and just go for it.

507
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:42,900
Hey. Go right now, to an island.

508
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,140
Is that how you did it?

509
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,050
We'll go to the school.

510
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:51,980
Jenny, have you heard of the saying happiness does not come from grades?

511
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,460
Don't try too hard on your exam. Try not to make mistakes.

512
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,130
Don't try too hard on the exam?

513
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:59,800
Grades don't decide your happiness.

514
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,830
So don't be nervous and relax.

515
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:05,320
If you don't know the answer, just pick 3.

516
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,860
Okay?

517
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,610
I get it.

518
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:11,170
I'm heading to school.

519
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:14,280
Lee Jenny, good luck!

520
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:19,570
Dad, I'm heading to school as well.

521
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:22,020
Peace.

522
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:26,850
Dad, you didn't forget our plans for tonight, right?

523
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:30,130
Se Chan, I forgot my memories,

524
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,990
not our promise. Don't worry.

525
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,110
Then I'll see you later.

526
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:39,760
Dad, I'll go to the kindergarten as well.

527
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:44,030
Se Jong, have a fun time in kindergarten today as well.

528
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:49,550
I will. But can I play the arcade game just once today?

529
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,930
Arcade game? Go for it.

530
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:55,000
Really? I'm excited!

531
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,100
You're the best!

532
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,540
Ms. Park, let's leave fast

533
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,030
and play the game before we go.

534
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,940
Sure.

535
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,660
Se Jong.

536
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:13,140
Let's play that game together with me.

537
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,790
Kick, Kick. Flying Kick!

538
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:24,520
Kick!

539
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:28,220
Flying Kick. Oh, yes!

540
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:31,540
Se Jong, I won again.

541
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:36,920
Whatever I do, I lose.

542
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,620
Se Jong. The competition has to be ruthless.

543
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:44,290
If you want to beat me, you'll have to practice more.

544
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,410
Even if he's 22 years old,

545
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:48,670
how can he be so thoughtless?

546
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,860
What's so hard about letting Se Jong beat him once?

547
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:54,310
Does he have to try so hard to win against a child?

548
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:57,870
Se Jong, should I beat him for you?

549
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:00,790
Yes. Take revenge for me.

550
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:02,960
I got it.

551
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,290
Chairman, let's have a match with me.

552
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:09,810
Sure. Bring it on.

553
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,910
Come on!

554
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,930
Fight!

555
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,840
Go, Ms. Park!

556
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,330
Go, Ms. Park!

557
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:30,650
- Go, Ms. Park!
-  Die! Die!

558
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:32,980
Go, Ms. Park!

559
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,850
Ms. Park Noona, you're pretty good at this game.

560
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,860
Have you played it a lot?

561
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,730
But I'm not that easy to beat.

562
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,630
Go, Ms. Park!

563
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,880
Go, Ms. Park!

564
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,220
- Go, Ms. Park!
- Die!

565
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,160
What are you doing here?

566
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:55,100
Ms. Park Noona, how can you get up all of a sudden?

567
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,190
Ms. Park, isn't Se Jong late to the kindergarten?

568
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:01,360
It's 5 minutes after the beginning of class.

569
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,590
I'm sorry.

570
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,960
Let's go.

571
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:13,330
Chairman, what are you doing sitting here like that?

572
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:18,740
Were you playing a game suitable for kindergartners?

573
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:22,640
It's not illegal. Am I not allowed to play it?

574
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,380
Chairman!

575
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:28,560
Right, I have to study the documents that Executive Director Han sent me.

576
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,030
I'm busy, so excuse me first.

577
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,740
He annoys me to no end.

578
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,110
Chairman.

579
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:49,030
Please do not nag me.

580
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:51,650
If you have to, keep it short.

581
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:56,320
Chairman, people outside do not know about your accident.

582
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,760
You are still the Chairman of the FT Group.

583
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,640
Especially, everyone in this neighborhood knows who you are.

584
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:08,420
But how can you play those games that kids play on the street

585
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:13,280
with someone who works for you in the house?

586
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,010
I got it. I will be careful.

587
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:20,190
Yes, you must, for the sake of the company.

588
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:23,570
What if the media reports about you losing your memory?

589
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:25,680
Wouldn't it be a big problem for the company?

590
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,700
I get it. That's enough.

591
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:35,680
Chief Jo Noona.

592
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,640
You should've rested more. Why did you come to work?

593
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,450
Are you okay now?

594
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:45,830
Maybe because you came by yesterday,

595
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:48,610
I completely recovered like a miracle.

596
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:55,340
You're my special medicine for me, before and now.

597
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:59,780
Chief Jo Noona, why are you being so cheesy?

598
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:06,600
Chairman, starting today, let's go on dates to recover your memory.

599
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,640
Dates to recover my memory?

600
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,890
I thought about it, and first and foremost, we need to recover your memory.

601
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:18,580
It's for the sake of the children and the company.

602
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,410
That's true.

603
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:24,880
I will take you to places we've been on dates starting today.

604
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,330
Then, your memory will come back soon.

605
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:31,680
Let's try our best.

606
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,800
Okay. Let's try our best together.

607
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,720
Yes.

608
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,700
Let's apply this rule to our examples.

609
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,940
I am going to the beach.

610
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,050
I am going to the beach.

611
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:51,510
You are doing homework.

612
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,820
You are doing homework.

613
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:57,410
We are watching the movie.

614
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:59,670
We are watching the movie.

615
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:01,990
You are taking the bus.

616
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:05,070
You are taking the bus.

617
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,740
You are doing homework.

618
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,760
Where are we at right now?

619
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,290
Here.

620
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:14,790
I am going...

621
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:18,150
Are you Park Dan Dan?

622
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,450
Hyun Bin Sunbaenim?

623
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:37,180
Yes, it's me, Ma Hyun Bin.

624
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:44,920
Did you register for an English class?

625
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:50,900
Yes. If I go to the US with you in six months, I have to prepare for it.

626
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,330
Good job.

627
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:56,090
I've been working hard on English,

628
00:42:56,090 --> 00:43:01,090
but it's hard to open my mouth when I try to speak.

629
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:04,890
Could I adjust to life in the States?

630
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:07,310
I'm worried a little.

631
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:10,790
When you face it head-on, you will improve soon.

632
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:15,630
I have no doubt you will do well. Do not worry.

633
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:20,010
I feel that I'll be fine since you say so.

634
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:22,880
Of course, you will do well.

635
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,050
How is Young Gook doing, by the way?

636
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:29,510
Is his memory coming back at all?

637
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,480
He's the same.

638
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:39,720
I'm worried. Young Gook doesn't like me since he doesn't remember me, so I can't go see him.

639
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:44,530
How are the children? Are Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong having a hard time because of him?

640
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:46,190
The children are doing fine.

641
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:51,820
The Chairman plays games and exercises with them more like a brother or a friend,

642
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:54,370
so the kids got brighter than before.

643
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:57,390
That's good, at least.

644
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:02,080
But it must be hard for you, Ms. Park.

645
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,080
No, it's not.

646
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:10,550
I've heard that you and the Chairman have known each other since you were both young.

647
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:15,520
But how can he not recognize you now?

648
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,220
Ms. Park. Since you're here, let's go out for a meal together.

649
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:22,110
There is a good pork cutlet place across the street from here. Let's go.

650
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:24,450
Would you please let me get this meal for you?

651
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:26,950
No, what are you saying? I'll get it for you.

652
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:32,470
Please let me buy this time. I got paid yesterday, too.

653
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:35,730
Really? Then, should I taste the meal that you're buying it?

654
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:37,750
Yes, please.

655
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:41,310
- Okay, let's go.
- Yes.

656
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:48,100
Baby, what do you think of this car? Do you like it? Do you want to drive it?

657
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:51,630
Of course, I do. It looks awesome.

658
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:56,370
I knew you would like it.

659
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:58,360
Here. It's the car key.

660
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,700
What's going on?

661
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,780
It's your car. My gift to you.

662
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:05,050
What?

663
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:06,480
Se Ryun.

664
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,290
Why are you surprised by this?

665
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,790
Let's get in.

666
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:19,890
The weather's so great, Dae Beom.

667
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:23,340
Maybe it's because I'm with you.

668
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,720
It's amazing.

669
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,140
Let's go!

670
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:06,540
It's the fruit you brought me, why aren't you eating them?

671
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:10,300
You're not drinking the tea either.

672
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,470
Yes.

673
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,920
Why?

674
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:18,270
Are you having a hard time?

675
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:23,810
I heard from your wife that you left your job.

676
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:27,660
Noona...

677
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,960
What is so difficult that you can't even speak?

678
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,700
It's okay. Please tell me.

679
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:38,110
The thing is...

680
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:40,990
Please lend me some money.

681
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:43,230
Money?

682
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:47,020
A great restaurant came out, so I was trying to run it.

683
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:50,090
But I'm having a hard time coming up with the deposit.

684
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:55,130
I tried to take some of the house deposits out, but I couldn't do it.

685
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:59,320
Nor could I get a loan from the bank.

686
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:06,820
I contacted my friends, but they are all in similar situations as me.

687
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:10,120
I know this is shameless.

688
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:14,960
But I've come to see you.

689
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,760
How much is the deposit?

690
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:24,330
It's 50 million won.

691
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:33,190
I will pay that deposit for you.

692
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:35,070
Noona.

693
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:41,040
It's not 500 million nor 100 million won. It's only 50 million won. But why are you having trouble saying it?

694
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:46,790
Why would you ask everyone else when you have a sister?

695
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:51,510
You should have come to me from the start.

696
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:54,890
It's so upsetting me.

697
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:57,940
Thank you.

698
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:03,140
I will work hard and pay you back the money.

699
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:09,210
Soo Chul.

700
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,760
Soo Chul, please don't cry.

701
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:19,990
You have to be successful, okay?

702
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:25,400
Noona...

703
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:30,350
[Contract for Commercial Lease]

704
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:37,610
You made the right decision.

705
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:41,410
You will do well given all the apartments around it.

706
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:43,860
Ah, yes.

707
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:50,600
I don't need anything else but to get the monthly rent at the right time.

708
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,720
I hate late payments.

709
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,730
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.

710
00:48:54,730 --> 00:49:00,580
Also, I want you not to nail it around without permission,

711
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:04,140
and if you're going to renovate the place, please talk to the realtor first.

712
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:08,530
Yes, I get it.

713
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:18,260
Sergeant Heo.

714
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:20,500
Yes, Private Park. Did you sign the contract?

715
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,800
Yes, I just signed the contract.

716
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,090
Congratulations!

717
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:29,500
You are now the boss!

718
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,970
I will do my best.

719
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:34,750
Thank you very much.

720
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:36,630
I will never forget what you did.

721
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:38,280
You will do well.

722
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,440
You will be successful.

723
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:46,970
- Did you find the new owner?
- Yes!

724
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:48,990
Is he the new owner?

725
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:52,730
Soo Chul, say hello. They own this jokbal restaurant.

726
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:54,260
Please take good care of him.

727
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:57,480
And please help him generously.

728
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:02,710
Yes, let's work hard together as the neighboring businesses.

729
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:06,230
I'll look forward to working with you.

730
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:10,390
Yes, let's work great together.

731
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:13,910
When you clean this street, don't just sweep in front of your door.

732
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,800
You have to sweep all the way there.

733
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,350
When it snows, we have to sweep the snow.

734
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:23,080
This street has to succeed for all of us to succeed.

735
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:26,270
Yes, I get it. Please teach me a lot from now on.

736
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:29,110
That's enough, you punk.

737
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,370
I'm home.

738
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:34,500
Are you home now?

739
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:39,210
Please accept this.

740
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:41,390
What is it?

741
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:46,720
Your house that I lost doing business five years ago, I will buy it back for you before I die.

742
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,010
It's money that I saved working from Vietnam.

743
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:53,450
Please use it for taking the store. It's 20 million won.

744
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:58,130
It's okay, Brother-in-law.

745
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:00,590
I just signed the contract for the restaurant.

746
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:03,100
What? Did you sign the contract?

747
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:07,360
What are you saying? Did you really sign the contract?

748
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,010
Yes, Mother-in-law.

749
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:10,960
Yeon Sil, Yeon Sil.

750
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,930
Son-in-law Park signed the contract for the restaurant.

751
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:18,590
What are you saying? Did you sign a contract?

752
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:23,520
Yes. Here, this is the contract.

753
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,240
Leaseholder, Park Soo Chul.

754
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,470
But where did you get the money to sign the lease?

755
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:32,860
Did you get a private loan?

756
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,350
You shouldn't do that!

757
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:41,010
If you can't pay the private loan, they will take all your organs! Don't do that, Honey!

758
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:44,620
What nonsense are you saying?

759
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,380
I borrowed it from my sister.

760
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:49,070
What? Sister-in-law?

761
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:53,300
Did she lend us such a large amount of money?

762
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:56,110
Yes.

763
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:58,800
Noona gladly lent me the money.

764
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,730
Oh, my world. What a grateful person!

765
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:06,230
The current owner, my military senior, is moving out soon.

766
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:11,350
So after some renovations, I will start the business in two weeks.

767
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:16,270
I'm so happy for you, Son-in-law Park!

768
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:18,300
Congratulations.

769
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,790
Congratulations, Brother-in-law.

770
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:23,210
Thank you. Thank you, Mother-in-law.

771
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:26,310
Maybe things will work out for us from now on.

772
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:29,500
Geon even got a job.

773
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,930
Did he get a job?

774
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:36,820
Yes, he got a job as a driver.

775
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,950
He got a job at a big corporation.

776
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:41,250
Wow, a big corporation?

777
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:45,970
You were so busy with taking over the restaurant,

778
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:48,490
so I couldn't tell you.

779
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:54,970
But Geon got a job as a driver in a big corporation!

780
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:58,030
That's great. Congratulations, Mother-in-law.

781
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:00,170
Congratulations, Brother-in-law. But where is it?

782
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:04,220
It's the FT Group.

783
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:07,070
FT Group?

784
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:11,500
It's the company owned by the family where Dan Dan works.

785
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:15,570
Really? What does that matter?

786
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:20,610
He submitted his resume and passed the interview to get the job.

787
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:27,390
But Geon, try not to run into their Madam often, okay?

788
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:33,070
You don't want to get fired because she doesn't like you.

789
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:36,630
Mom, where would I see her when I work at the company?

790
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,520
I'm the company's driver.

791
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,850
I will have no reason to run into her.

792
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:44,620
That's true. Anyway, you must be happy, Mom.

793
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:47,360
You have a son working for a big corporation now.

794
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:51,320
Of course. I'm beyond happy!

795
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:56,210
Geon will get paid regularly now.

796
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:58,490
Son-in-law Park will do well, too.

797
00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:04,160
I guess my twilight time of life will be luxurious!

798
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:28,380
Your invitation for me to go to the US with you.

799
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:31,530
Is that still possible?

800
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:34,510
Of course! It's still valid.

801
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:38,470
I have about six months left in my contract with the Chairman.

802
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:43,110
I can go with you after that.

803
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:46,060
I'll take Soo Chul with us when we go to America.

804
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:51,940
Our family of three will start it over again in America.

805
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:02,010
Hello, CEO Anna.

806
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:05,360
Driver Park, can I talk to you for a minute?

807
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,940
Yes, it's fine.

808
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:12,740
I have a favor to ask.

809
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:16,250
Yes. Please tell me.

810
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:20,640
I have a business trip to Gangneung tomorrow.

811
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,370
Can I ask you to make the long-distance drive?

812
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:28,450
I'm still a bit scared driving for a long-distance in Korea.

813
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:32,500
Also, I'm not comfortable with other drivers from the company.

814
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,350
I guess it's too much to ask for you.

815
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:41,080
No, it's okay. I have time tomorrow. It's the least I could do.

816
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,880
What time should I be there?

817
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:48,720
Can you come to pick me up at 9 in the morning?

818
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,660
Yes, I'll be there before 9 AM.

819
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:55,740
Yes, I'll see you tomorrow.

820
00:55:57,770 --> 00:56:00,770
What's that call?

821
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:02,790
I have to go somewhere tomorrow.

822
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:05,340
I got a part-time job with long-distance driving.

823
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:09,680
Really? Will they pay you well?

824
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,680
I will go wash up.

825
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,370
Eat the fruit first.

826
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:17,710
They taste sour after brushing your teeth.

827
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:20,380
It's delicious.

828
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:24,210
He should have eaten first.

829
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,950
It's beautiful here.

830
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:33,670
I feel my lungs opening up.

831
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:38,670
You liked it the same when we came here last time.

832
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:45,710
That's why this is the second most precious place in our memory.

833
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:47,670
Is that so?

834
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:52,760
Yes. It's a place with a lot of memory for us.

835
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:58,330
Can you not remember even a little of this place?

836
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:02,730
No. I feel like this is my first time.

837
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:05,380
I don't remember.

838
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:12,380
Ah, it's cold.

839
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:14,890
What are you doing, Chief Jo Noona?

840
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:18,990
Don't you remember this as well? We played like this before.

841
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:23,890
Come and catch me!

842
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:26,090
Did I do that?

843
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:28,300
That's so old-fashioned and awkward.

844
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,750
Chairman!

845
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:40,510
Wait a minute!

846
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:44,130
I got a call from Se Chan.

847
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:46,730
Yes, Se Chan.

848
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:48,830
I didn't forget the promise.

849
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:53,290
Did Se Jong get home from kindergarten?

850
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:57,120
What about Jenny?

851
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,700
Why did Se Chan call him at this timing?

852
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,820
It's so annoying. Why is everything so difficult?

853
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:05,520
It's frustrating.

854
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:10,940
Which lodge would be the cleanest?

855
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,860
Maybe it's the fresh air, but the drinks are going down easy.

856
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:25,330
Chairman, have another glass.

857
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:36,060
This place is so great.

858
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:41,520
Next time, let's bring the children, Ms. Park Noona, and Mrs. Yeoju.

859
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:46,410
So let's see the ocean and eat delicious seafood together.

860
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:49,450
Yes, let's do that.

861
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:52,390
What should I do?

862
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:56,550
Chief Jo Noona, I think I'm drunk.

863
00:58:56,550 --> 00:59:01,130
What do you mean? You look fine to me.

864
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:04,160
On that note, let's do cheers!

865
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,520
Cheers!

866
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:14,010
Oh, no.

867
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:17,290
What is it, Chairman?

868
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:20,780
Are you tired? Sleepy?

869
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:24,020
No, it's not that.

870
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:27,310
I can't believe I forget about it! I'm in big trouble.

871
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:30,310
We have to go before we miss the last ferry.

872
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:34,250
There are plenty of places to stay here, what's the matter?

873
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:36,610
If we can't go today, we can go back tomorrow.

874
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:41,180
No, we can't. To celebrate Jenny finishing her exams, we promised to go to Namsan, ride the cable car,

875
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:43,120
and view the night scene. Let's go!

876
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,210
Namsan?

877
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:46,360
Yes, hurry up!

878
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:49,430
Ajumma, the bill, please!

879
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,540
Chairman, you can go to Namsan tomorrow.

880
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:57,540
Today is not the only day.

881
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:58,900
I can't.

882
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:03,420
What if we miss the last ferry? Come fast!

883
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:05,030
It's here!

884
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:07,220
Run, run!!

885
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,690
Let's go together!

886
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:12,730
Chief Jo Noona, come quickly!

887
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:14,540
Chairman!

888
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:17,210
Here, here!!

889
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:21,630
Why isn't the ferry leaving?

890
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:24,290
Go, just go!

891
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:27,710
- Chairman!
- Hurry, hurry!

892
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,580
Chief Jo Noona, see you tomorrow.

893
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:43,940
Driver, hurry up, please!

894
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:48,370
He's such a rude, crazy bastard!

895
01:00:48,370 --> 01:00:50,700
Is he doing that on purpose?

896
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:53,670
To make me upset?

897
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:58,190
I'm out of breath!

898
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,830
That will be so much fun!

899
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:10,410
Yes!

900
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:14,900
Why are you so excited? Is this the first time on the cable car?

901
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,620
It's my first time.

902
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:17,830
Me, too.

903
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:22,840
I've been on once in a school trip, but it's the first time riding with you, Dad.

904
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:26,900
Seriously, Lee Young Gook. What kind of life did you have until now?

905
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:29,670
You didn't pay attention to your kids, didn't play with them at all.

906
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:32,460
And you were two-timing.

907
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:35,390
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

908
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:43,150
Is this the first time for you too, Ms. Park Noona?

909
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:46,310
Yes, it's first for me.

910
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:49,310
Maybe she really didn't date anybody before.

911
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:51,470
This is a classic place to go on a date.

912
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:54,630
Well, who would put up with her strong personality?

913
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:58,630
She slaps you when you try to kiss her and doesn't give an inch in video games.

914
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:04,110
It would be too scary to kiss her. No wonder she had no boyfriend.

915
01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:06,820
Why do you stare at me like that?

916
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:10,180
It's nothing.

917
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:11,670
Kids, let's get on.

918
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:12,890
- Yes!
- Let's go!

919
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:14,130
Let's go.

920
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:16,470
Let's go!

921
01:02:53,990 --> 01:02:57,390
It's so pretty.

922
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:05,280
Noona, Hyung, look at the sky. It's full of stars.

923
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,470
Daebak. It's so pretty.

924
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:15,890
Chairman, look at the sky.

925
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:22,720
The sparkling stars are pouring over.

926
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,810
Yes, they are.

927
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:27,640
There are a lot of stars tonight.

928
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:33,060
This is the first time I've seen these many stars in my life.

929
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:38,680
It's so impressive.

930
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:42,880
It's so beautiful.

931
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:48,130
Dad, I've never seen so many stars like these.

932
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:49,870
They are really beautiful.

933
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:53,970
I will take you to see the stars often from now on.

934
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:55,300
Yes!

935
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:56,720
Nice!

936
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,290
Let's go to see the lovers' lock too.

937
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:01,110
Yes!

938
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:07,820
♫ My unforgettable love ♫

939
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:11,300
Ms. Park Noona, aren't you coming?

940
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:15,500
♫ Like a shy child ♫

941
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:22,500
♫ In case I lose it, I hold it tight ♫

942
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:29,960
♫ But love always runs away, chased by longing ♫

943
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:33,390
Ms. Park Noona,

944
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:36,530
are you crying?

945
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:39,180
Why?

946
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:46,900
Did I do something wrong?

947
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:51,400
No, it's nothing.

948
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:55,690
♫ But love always runs away ♫

949
01:04:55,690 --> 01:05:00,880
What was that? What happened?

950
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,540
Did I do something wrong again?

951
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:06,790
No, I didn't.

952
01:05:06,790 --> 01:05:11,420
I didn't do anything but watch the stars.

953
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:34,720
Hello, CEO.

954
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:38,390
Thank you, Driver Park, for coming on short notice.

955
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:40,450
I'm sorry for taking your time away suddenly.

956
01:05:40,450 --> 01:05:43,410
No, it's okay.

957
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:45,150
Should I get these into the car?

958
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,640
Yes, please.

959
01:05:50,370 --> 01:05:53,590
One moment, please.

960
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:01,250
It's a long distance. It will be tedious for you.

961
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:06,090
I prepared these so we could eat and chat along the way.

962
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:08,710
Ah, yes.

963
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,400
Let's go, CEO Anna.

964
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,350
Yes.

965
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:34,900
Ms. Park Noona.

966
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:38,030
What a coincidence!

967
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:39,780
Why don't you get in the car since we ran into each other?

968
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:41,300
No, I'm okay.

969
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:45,270
Please get in. Aren't you on your way to your class?

970
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:49,140
I'm going to the office to see Lawyer Koh. I will drive you on the way.

971
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:52,190
I'm really okay, Chairman. Please, go on your way.

972
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:56,310
I want to discuss with you about the children.

973
01:06:56,310 --> 01:06:59,270
About the children?

974
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:07,090
Chairman, you said you wanted to discuss something involving the children?

975
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:10,980
Is there a problem?

976
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:15,350
What I was going to say is...

977
01:07:15,350 --> 01:07:17,850
That is...

978
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:24,570
Ms. Park Noona. Even though I am only 22 years old, but I have my own educational philosophy.

979
01:07:24,570 --> 01:07:25,780
Pardon?

980
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:29,780
Do you know the children in our country score the lowest in the happiness meter?

981
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:31,780
Why would that be?

982
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:34,530
They are told to study, go to tutoring, and get the first place.

983
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:38,980
That's why they get slammed with the competition at a young age and have no time to feel happiness.

984
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:45,260
I don't want my children to be unhappy stuck in the competition treadmill.

985
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:46,300
Okay.

986
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:52,900
So on that note, please think about some programs that I can do with children.

987
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:56,920
For example, children can do exercise with me.

988
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:01,810
Something that we can experience and build memories together.

989
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:07,640
Yes, I will give it a thought and come up with something.

990
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:20,200
- Is this where you're taking the class?
- Yes.

991
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,130
Ms. Park Noona, when is your class finished?

992
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:25,450
I will pick you up on my way back from the office. Let's go home together.

993
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:27,640
No, it's okay. Thank you for the ride.

994
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:30,290
Have a safe drive.

995
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,900
Dan Dan.

996
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:40,990
Sunbaenim.

997
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:44,160
- Did you get your homework done?
- No.

998
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,190
- I thought so.
- Of course.

999
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:49,040
I wanted to ask you about stuff that I don't know.

1000
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,890
You look like you lost more weight.

1001
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:53,850
No, I didn't.

1002
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,580
What's going on?

1003
01:09:12,030 --> 01:09:14,490
Does Ms. Park Noona have a boyfriend?

1004
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:18,910
♫  It's a shiny day because of you  ♫

1005
01:09:18,910 --> 01:09:21,240
♫ It's sunshine day ♫

1006
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:24,500
♫ Strangely, ♫

1007
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:28,140
♫  I'm drawn to you ♫

1008
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:34,660
♫ Nobody will understand me. You're the only one that I was looking for ♫

1009
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:41,860
♫ Woo, it's a happy day like a dream, yeah ♫

1010
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:48,710
♫ Woo, you are always my love ♫

1011
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:52,620
♫ I feel love, only you ♫

1012
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:55,570
[Young Lady and Gentleman]

1013
01:09:55,570 --> 01:09:58,650
I can't figure out what's going on. Who's that guy?

1014
01:09:58,650 --> 01:09:59,980
Is he really her boyfriend?

1015
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:03,390
Why is Ms. Park Noona not coming home yet? I'll have to set a curfew from now.

1016
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:06,550
I will have to adjust to the ways of the Chairman and get close to him first.

1017
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:10,650
I know you are trying to get close to me, but don't force yourself to do something you can't do.

1018
01:10:10,650 --> 01:10:12,660
Ah, seriously, I can't do this!

1019
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:17,170
I'm here because the company sent me, but will I get fired on the first day of work?

1020
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:18,090
Where are you, Honey?

1021
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:23,320
Are you still not done with work? Your sister and everyone is here for a party tonight.

1022
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,030
Chairman, are you going somewhere?

1023
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:26,300
I should go to the athletic competition at Se Jong's kindergarten.

1024
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:27,390
Are you coming too?

1025
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:31,300
Of course. There will be games for the father to do together.

1026
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:35,850
If I don't go to this, Se Jong would feel left out.

1027
01:10:35,850 --> 01:10:38,290
Chairman!
