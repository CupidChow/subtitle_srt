00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:05,120
Chief Jo.
 [Episode 46]

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,060
Why are you lying?

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,780
Pardon?

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,820
Nothing happened between us on that day.

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,570
I didn't even bring you to the inside.

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,720
But what are you claiming we did on that day?

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,460
Chairman.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,870
Did your memory come back?

9
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,020
Just answer my questions.

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,660
Nothing happened between us on that day.

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,810
Stay calm, Jo Sarah.

12
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,740
Chairman's memory didn't come back completely.

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:44,280
If it did, he wouldn't ask me like this.

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,370
I guess I got mixed up.

15
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,390
The first day was like that,

16
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,600
but we went to the vacation house multiple times later.

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,850
Chief Jo. I have already checked with the manager of the vacation house.

18
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,960
That was the only day two of us went to the vacation house alone.

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,160
And he said we didn't stay overnight. Why are you keep lying to me?

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,120
Chief Jo.

21
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,410
Are you really pregnant with my baby?

22
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,720
Chairman...

23
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,660
How can you say something like that?

24
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,960
Since you are keep lying,

25
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,110
I can't trust that child is my baby anymore.

26
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,950
Chief Jo.

27
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,070
I think you should leave my house first.

28
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,910
And when the baby is born and gets the paternity test

29
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,420
and proves that it's my child,

30
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,320
then you can move back in.

31
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,540
Chairman.

32
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,620
Sure. There's nothing to worry about.

33
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,580
Chairman didn't fully recover his memory.

34
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,490
Just a partial memory came back. So there's nothing for me to be afraid of.

35
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,970
Sarah, when did you come home?

36
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,660
I just came home.

37
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,820
Why? Did something happen?

38
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,750
Nothing happened.

39
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,880
I just came home because I wanted to eat bibimbap with your gochujang.

40
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,940
- What did you buy, Mom?
- I got some pork belly.

41
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,420
Why don't you grill that? Let me eat it with this bibimbap.

42
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,390
Okay, I'll grill it right away--

43
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,550
Are you really sure that nothing happened?

44
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,890
I said nothing happened.

45
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,090
Chairman treats me very well since I'm pregnant.

46
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,220
Chief Jo acts that way with her baby as the weapon,

47
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,570
but the time is on your side.

48
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,670
So just wait until the baby gets born,

49
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,800
and it won't be late even if you decide everything after that.

50
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,150
There's a chance that child might not be mine,

51
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,770
but it makes me scared that there's still a chance that child might be mine.

52
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:17,130
If the child figures out later that their existence got denied even before they were born,

53
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,270
it would be very tragic.

54
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,500
Young Gook.

55
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:29,700
This all happened because I don't remember the time.

56
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,060
Why on earth can't I remember that time?

57
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,050
Why?

58
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,810
Why did I come here?

59
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,960
Chairman.

60
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,620
- Ms. Park.
- What brings you here at this hour?

61
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,830
Did you come here to see me?

62
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,490
No.

63
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,960
I came here to see Se Chan and Se Jong, and I would bring them with me if they were okay.

64
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,860
But it was too late, so I thought the kids would be asleep.

65
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,030
So I was about to just go home.

66
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,570
Really?

67
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,080
Is that all?

68
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,830
Of course, that's all.

69
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,940
I really just came here to see my children.

70
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,120
Ms. Park, I'm really thankful to you and sorry.

71
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,470
Thank you for taking care of my children.

72
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,140
I know that it should've not happened.

73
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,140
You don't have to say that.

74
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:12,140
Don't feel pressured. I'm willing to take care of them.

75
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,700
Also, the aunt of the children, Se Ryun Unni, is here as well.

76
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,810
So, don't worry about Se Chan and Se Jong.

77
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,610
Right. Thank you.

78
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:29,190
I'll come back later to take Se Chan and Se Jong.

79
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,770
Why don't you go in? I'll go home as well.

80
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,140
Chairman!

81
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,860
I know you are lying.

82
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,480
I know you came here because you missed me.

83
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,640
Chairman.

84
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,380
I'll always be waiting for you right here.

85
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:57,590
So, whenever you want to see me,

86
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,030
please come by anytime.

87
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:05,460
I told you this before.

88
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,160
I trust you, Chairman.

89
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,120
♫  Like a shy child  ♫

90
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:18,030
♫  In case I lose it, I hold it tight  ♫

91
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,200
Ms. Park.

92
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,990
We said we wouldn't be like this.

93
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:27,190
I really came here to see my children.

94
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:30,540
So, please don't misunderstand anything.

95
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,230
I'll get going.

96
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:41,980
♫  It would be nice to take a break  ♫

97
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,190
What about Chief Jo?

98
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:57,660
She said she'd be sleeping over at her mom's place and didn't come home.

99
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,290
Let's find a place for Chief Jo to stay.

100
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,760
Yes, I will.

101
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,080
Are you still sleeping?

102
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,090
Oh, Mother-in-law!

103
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,410
I'm awake!

104
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,630
I'm sorry. I guess I woke you up.

105
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,810
No, not at all. But what is this?

106
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,490
It's your breakfast.

107
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,030
Since you are different from us, I thought you would eat like this for breakfast.

108
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,260
I prepared a brunch menu.

109
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,340
I made it by searching on the internet.

110
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,980
Mother-in-law... Thank you so much.

111
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,970
The toast is just out of the oven,

112
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:55,030
so put some butter and strawberry jam on it when it's warm.

113
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,170
Yes.

114
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:01,530
Why? Is something wrong?

115
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:05,190
I just don't eat jam that much.

116
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:09,310
I can have some balsamic and olive oil for bread.

117
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,560
Balsamic? What's that?

118
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,690
I'll get it right away when I go to the grocery today.

119
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,610
Oh, no! It's fine, Mother-in-law.

120
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,250
I'll get balsamic for myself.

121
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:23,180
I need to get the one that suits my taste. You can't just buy it anywhere.

122
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,710
By the way, where's Dae Beom?

123
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,110
He said you're sleeping, so be quiet and don't wake you up.

124
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,350
So he just quietly ate bean sprout soup with rice and already went to work.

125
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:40,160
Mother-in-law... This is...

126
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,150
It's an instant coffee. What should I do?

127
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,530
I don't drink instant coffee...

128
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,250
I prefer Americano.

129
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,220
Oh, I'm sorry. What should I do?

130
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,300
I didn't know that well.

131
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,150
We only have instant coffee at home. What should I do?

132
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:02,700
Oh, don't worry! I'll just have a green tea, then!

133
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,380
We have green tea! Wait a second. I'll come back with green tea soon.

134
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,400
No, Mother-in-law! I can do it by myself.

135
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,550
No, you go ahead and eat this.

136
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:16,100
I'll bring you green tea soon.

137
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,870
Go ahead and eat. Okay?

138
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,700
Mother-in-law...

139
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,210
I'm so touched.

140
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:32,180
Where's green tea? I definitely saw it somewhere.

141
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,420
Why are you looking for green tea all of a sudden?

142
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:39,900
It's because our Se Ryun doesn't drink instant coffee.

143
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,780
Are you serving a master?

144
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,520
Are you working as a servant for your daughter-in-law?

145
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,440
If she doesn't drink instant coffee, then that's it.

146
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,930
I've never seen a mother-in-law acting like this for their daughter-in-law.

147
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,310
How can you say that I'm a servant?

148
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,780
I'm willing to do it for my precious daughter-in-law.

149
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,950
I mean, she just got married and moved in here.

150
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:04,960
But she's sleeping in without even caring about the breakfast at all. What's so precious about that?

151
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,520
Aigo, but you made breakfast for her and put it on a tray,

152
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,610
and brought it over to her room.

153
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,570
Why are you doing all this?

154
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,420
There's a reason, isn't it? Tell me.

155
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:22,390
Mom, be quiet. Se Ryun might hear you.

156
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:28,640
Mom, our Se Ryun has a stake in that FT Group company.

157
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,150
Stake? What's that?

158
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:35,310
Is it a golden calf or something?

159
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,990
Mom, it's not just a golden calf,

160
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:43,770
but think if there are a group of golden calves coming from that crossroad out there.

161
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:48,450
What? Is that true?

162
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:52,670
So how can I not take good care of our Se Ryun?

163
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,830
What are you doing, Younger-sister-in-law?

164
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,380
Oh, welcome.

165
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:00,310
- Hello, Elder-in-law.
- Welcome.

166
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,010
Hey, green tea is here.

167
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,900
- Okay, Mom.
- Wait, wait.

168
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,690
I don't need green tea. I already had tea.

169
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,340
No, it's for our Se Ryun.

170
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:14,480
She wanted Americano, but we don't have any coffee beans.

171
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,110
But didn't Se Ryun say anything about her room being too small?

172
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,190
No, not at all. She never lived in a place like this before,

173
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,640
and she said it's retro-style or something like that.

174
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,560
She said it's fun since it's a new experience for her.

175
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,760
Oh, my goodness.

176
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,690
I guess she likes Dae Beom a lot.

177
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:39,420
Also, did they file the marriage registration?

178
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,530
I don't think they did it yet.

179
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,200
Still?

180
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,420
Tell them to file the marriage registration first.

181
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,560
That's the most important part!

182
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,270
That's true!

183
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,500
Can I come in?

184
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,550
Yes, Mother-in-law.

185
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,840
I'm here too.

186
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,850
Oh my, you are here too, Aunt-in-law?

187
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:16,020
I was nearby, so I came to see how you were doing in this small room.

188
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,030
Are you really okay here? Aren't you cold?

189
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,800
Yes. I'm okay.

190
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,590
There's a bit of a breeze, but the floor is very warm.

191
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:31,640
And since I stay right next to Dae Beom, I don't feel the cold at all.

192
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,370
I like it better than a big empty house.

193
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,480
We can stick to each other and talk.

194
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,790
Right. You're newlyweds.

195
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:46,190
I like that she's so honest.

196
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,830
But, have you registered your marriage yet?

197
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,860
Not yet.

198
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,520
Not yet? You must do that first.

199
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,680
That's the most important thing. You're not really married until then.

200
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,720
When Dae Beom has free time, we will go together and do it.

201
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,220
All right, then.

202
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:14,870
But how are you so beautiful in every way?

203
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:19,310
Your eyes, nose, lips, and even her ear lobes are pretty. Don't you think so, Older-sister-in-law?

204
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,520
Yes, she is.

205
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:25,710
Why not say even her nostrils are pretty?

206
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:31,750
Yes, that's true. Even her nostrils are pretty.

207
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:36,690
Oh, my goodness, Elder-in-law.

208
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,450
Oh, these foxes.

209
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:46,210
Why are you all saying things like that?

210
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,690
That's strange.

211
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,780
Is there even a room for her to stay in this house?

212
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,950
There are lots of his family members too.

213
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,710
Is Se Ryun really living here?

214
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,760
When?

215
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:26,210
Oh my, look who's here?

216
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:32,030
Oh my, madam-in-law, what brings you here?

217
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:35,960
How dare you call me madam-in-law?

218
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:42,820
Sister-in-law, maybe you should call her gentleman-in-law since she doesn't want to be called a madam-in-law.

219
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:50,830
But why is wealthy madam gawking at someone else's house like a mouse?

220
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,340
A mouse?

221
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,350
Look at the ignorance of her words.

222
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,110
I had no idea how ignorant you were.

223
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:03,040
Still, isn't a mouse much better than a parasite? The pillar of parasites.

224
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,960
What did you say?

225
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,530
Yes, hit me. Hit me!

226
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,620
Please stop it.

227
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:13,080
Did you come to see our Se Ryun?

228
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,470
"Our Se Ryun?" How dare you?

229
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,880
How dare us? Just die, die.

230
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,620
Call the police! Go ahead and hit me.

231
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,530
What are you doing here? I never thought you'd come here.

232
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,210
It's too ridiculous that I'm speechless.

233
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,750
How can you live in a wretched place like this?

234
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,390
Mom, what are you saying?

235
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:42,700
Is this a place for human beings to live in?

236
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,250
Honestly, how can you lose your mind like this?

237
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:51,650
Mom. Please don't speak carelessly. This is my sanctuary. It's nice and cozy to me.

238
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:56,240
What? Cozy? Did you say cozy?

239
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,210
Please leave if you will speak this way.

240
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:02,180
I am so happy right now.

241
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:07,880
My mother-in-law treats me well, and all of his family is such good people.

242
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,690
I finally live in warmth like a human being.

243
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:17,180
So, please don't try to judge everything by your standard.

244
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,880
If so,

245
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,030
you should live in the place where you used to live. What the heck is this?

246
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:28,740
I've rented it out. I will live with Dae Beom's family for six months.

247
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,450
And then move out with Dae Beom. Just so you know.

248
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:38,200
Honestly. How can you hurt my feelings like that?

249
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,370
What is this? Is this a place for humans to live?

250
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,900
Honestly, it's frustrating.

251
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:54,400
Did someone die? Why would you cry for this?

252
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,900
If you have so much tear to shed, you should save your tears and shed them on our national independence day,

253
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,530
in front of the name of our heroes.

254
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:06,190
Are we not human beings who live here?

255
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:09,400
I can't listen to this anymore.

256
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,030
We have a bit of leaking from the rain, but other than that, it's all good.

257
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:18,720
Does it leak from the rain? Oh, my!

258
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,950
What is this?

259
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,680
I can't stand this.

260
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,410
Get out of my way!

261
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,970
- Madam, please don't do this.
- It won't take long.

262
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:33,340
I get it! It won't take long!

263
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,910
Young Gook. Young Gook.

264
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,330
Please give me 5 billion won.

265
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,910
5 billion won?

266
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,440
Do you know what kind of a dwelling our Se Ryun is living in?

267
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:54,610
She lives in a space as big as my palm.

268
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:59,740
I am angry with Se Ryun, and I don't like Dae Beom.

269
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,900
But still, how can you treat your one and only sister?

270
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:09,040
How can you let her live in a house like that?

271
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,590
Did Se Ryun ask you to buy her a house?

272
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:17,310
No, but as her brother, how can you have no interest in her?

273
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,800
She's no different than a beggar.

274
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Oh my, I've cried so much.

275
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,120
My eyes are swollen. Look at my eyes.

276
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,590
So did Se Ryun say she can't live there?

277
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:34,040
No! I'm saying I want to buy it for her!

278
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,420
I need to buy her a house right now, so give me 5 billion won.

279
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:42,860
Please go home. I will talk about that to Se Ryun directly.

280
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:49,030
Don't you trust me about buying her a house?

281
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,850
No.

282
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,410
Seriously, my goodness!

283
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,680
What are we going to do, Mi Rim?

284
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,220
Mi Rim.

285
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:12,320
Should we tell them everything and endure the consequences like you said?

286
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,040
Think as if we are going through a stormy ocean.

287
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,580
And not let go of each other's hands.

288
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:24,900
Are you confident you will not let go of my hands no matter what happens?

289
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,150
Yes. I will never let go of your hand.

290
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,970
Really?

291
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:36,000
Then, I will tell my mom first.

292
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,030
Really?

293
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:42,400
Yes. it'd be better for me to tell them than you.

294
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,020
If we are going to get beaten, I should get hit first.

295
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,020
Mom.

296
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,720
Yes, Joon Oh. What is it?

297
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,980
What is that?

298
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,580
It's your favorite, the fish bread.

299
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,920
I was craving for something.

300
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:12,140
You must've read my mind. Let's see.

301
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:17,280
No wonder I thought of you on my way here, so I lined up and bought it.

302
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,930
Is that so?

303
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:24,000
- Please have some.
- Let me have one.

304
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:30,590
It's good. Very delicious.

305
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,500
Right, charge forward.

306
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:39,940
- It's tasty.
- Mom.

307
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,610
I have something to tell you.

308
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:45,360
What is it?

309
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:56,550
Why do you eat the head first? It's better to start with the tail.

310
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:02,260
Is that right? Okay, okay.

311
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,330
The tail?

312
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,020
Yes, it's the tail. It's delicious.

313
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:13,010
I have to listen to my son.

314
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,690
Mom.

315
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,670
What?

316
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,960
I... a woman...

317
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,710
A woman?

318
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:30,040
Do you have a girlfriend?

319
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,310
No.

320
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:37,580
It's not that. But I will be...

321
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:42,500
Auditioning for a woman's role. What do you think?

322
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,630
You must have lost your mind.

323
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:49,700
Go back to school and forget about all that!

324
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,570
I don't know how I gave birth to a boy like you as my son.

325
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:58,060
You make me angry. I don't want to eat it.

326
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,820
What do I do?

327
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,690
Why does God give me such suffering?

328
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:13,310
Ah, honestly...

329
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:25,700
I'll always be waiting for you right here.

330
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:31,630
So, whenever you want to see me, please come by anytime.

331
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,210
I told you this before.

332
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,100
I trust you, Chairman.

333
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,810
Roll it like this, and do it one more time.

334
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:59,170
- Like this?
- You did it well!

335
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,890
Should we stamp it? What shape do you want to use? This one?

336
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,920
I want this one!

337
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,170
The teddy bear one. Oh, it came out great!

338
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:16,960
- Oh!
- Teddy bear.

339
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,530
- I made teddy bears.
- Se Chan, it looks like you! It's very cute.

340
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,600
- Does it look like me?
- Yes! It's very cute.

341
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,550
How is it?

342
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,180
Ahh, so cute.

343
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,760
Wow.

344
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,070
Daebak.

345
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:43,920
It looks delicious. Se Jong, try it first.

346
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,550
How is it?

347
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:50,090
Se Chan, why don't you try it, too?

348
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,050
It's very delicious.

349
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,850
It's delicious!

350
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:06,020
Yes, Chairman. The children?

351
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,620
They are with me now.

352
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,490
Now?

353
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,160
It's Dad.

354
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,920
Dad, we made cookies with Ms. Park.

355
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,430
- Is that so?
- Yes!

356
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:25,840
We made bunny-shaped, bear-shaped, and star-shaped cookies!

357
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,640
Do you want to try it, too?

358
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,960
Let's eat it when we get home. Let's get in the car.

359
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,740
Dad, are we going home already?

360
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,070
Can't we stay longer at Ms. Park's place?

361
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,800
Since Se Jong seems better now, you guys should come home.

362
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,180
It's not okay for you to stay too long at Ms. Park's place.

363
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,950
Chairman, it's okay with me.

364
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,610
Ms. Park says it's okay.

365
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,320
I want to stay longer.

366
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,130
Dad, since we met up now, let's all go to the game center

367
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,560
and karaoke as well!

368
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,570
Ms. Park, how does that sound?

369
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:02,870
Sure.

370
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,600
You can't do that. Get in the car, now.

371
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,280
- I don't want to!
- I don't want to!

372
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:14,550
Chairman, wait. Let's talk for a second.

373
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:22,020
Se Chan and Se Jong, stay right here for a second.

374
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,640
Chairman, aren't you going overboard?

375
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,330
The kids don't want to go that much.

376
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:36,210
Se Jong isn't fully recovered yet.

377
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,430
Also, I'm okay with it.

378
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:42,070
So let me take care of them for a few more days.

379
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:47,870
I appreciate your effort, but I don't think it's the right thing to do for both of us.

380
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,520
Since we broke up.

381
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,490
I'm saying it's fine for me!

382
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,100
It's not okay for me.

383
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:03,140
Ms. Park, forget about us now and have a happy life. I hope you stay healthy.

384
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,820
Se Chan and Se Jong, you two get in the car.

385
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:16,160
Ms. Park...

386
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,870
Lee Se Chan.

387
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,430
Ms. Park said it was okay with her.

388
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:48,700
But why are you not letting us stay at her place?

389
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,950
It's not okay to stay over at someone else's house for that long.

390
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,280
Now it's our aunt's place as well!

391
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,600
Can't we go over there to see my aunt?

392
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,510
You can't do that.

393
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,710
Did you say I can't even go there to see my aunt?

394
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:03,000
You are going overboard!

395
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,290
Ms. Park and I broke up. So if you see her that often,

396
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:09,410
you are making it hard for Ms. Park to start a new life.

397
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:12,120
That's why I'm saying this.

398
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,200
What brings you here?

399
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,040
Well...

400
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,830
Where should I put this?

401
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:32,680
Put it over there somewhere.

402
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:44,160
Jenny, I know you are busy, but can we talk?

403
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,350
I'm busy. Just cut to your point.

404
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:53,600
I know you must be uncomfortable since I moved in here abruptly.

405
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,110
Since I worked in this house for a long time,

406
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,940
I considered you kids comfortably.

407
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,640
But when I put myself in your shoes,

408
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:07,860
it would've been shocking since I'm here pregnant with your sibling.

409
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,930
But Jenny,

410
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:15,220
I wanted to have this baby next to your dad.

411
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:19,790
I can't say this to Se Chan and Se Jong since they are too young.

412
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:25,680
Jenny, let me know if anything makes you feel uncomfortable. I'll try my best.

413
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,530
I'm fine. I can understand.

414
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,240
But Se Chan and Se Jong can't understand it.

415
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,350
You also shouldn't just think about your position.

416
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:37,990
Why do you have to have the baby at our house?

417
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,960
I still don't understand that.

418
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,370
Also, it's true that it's uncomfortable to have you here.

419
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,920
You are not married to my dad.

420
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,820
Actually, you guys have no relationship whatsoever.

421
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,070
What you said is correct as well.

422
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,600
So I'll try my best as well.

423
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,430
Also, I'm so sorry that I yelled at you.

424
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,740
I want to apologize.

425
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:05,400
I'm not in the position to interfere,

426
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,550
so I'll follow if you and my dad decide.

427
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,530
Thank you, Jenny.

428
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,920
Welcome home.

429
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,120
You kids go upstairs.

430
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:38,430
Se Chan and Se Jong. Welcome, it's good to see you.

431
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,610
Se Jong, are you feeling better now?

432
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,340
Yes.

433
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,370
Is that really true?

434
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,440
- Yes.
- Yes.

435
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,380
It's all up to Dad.

436
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,800
Ms. Park said she was fine,

437
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,660
but our dad said we couldn't even go to her place anymore.

438
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,080
He also said we shouldn't even meet up with Ms. Park.

439
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,540
Ms. Park and our dad broke up.

440
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:20,720
But why can't we also can't see Ms. Park?

441
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,340
Can't you say something to Dad?

442
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,570
I'll say something.

443
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:30,220
But if our dad said so, I think we should listen to him.

444
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,520
You know it's done deal when our dad decides on something.

445
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,910
I don't like my dad!

446
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,490
I think our dad is going back to the old dictator.

447
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,120
I doubt it...

448
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:49,790
Is Chairman finally going to cut ties with Ms. Park?

449
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:22,290
Chairman, the memory that you talked about yesterday

450
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:26,640
is only one of the countless memories we shared.

451
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,750
That's why I'm sure when you remember all of our memories together,

452
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:39,210
you will open your heart to me as well.

453
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:47,110
So can't you accept me just once for the sake of our baby?

454
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:49,860
I will do my best, too.

455
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,330
I've already told Chief Kim.

456
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:56,370
To find somewhere suitable for you to live in.

457
00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:00,080
Chairman. I'm pregnant with your child.

458
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,740
Even if you don't remember, the baby is the proof of our love.

459
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,470
I've apologized and made up with Jenny.

460
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:12,050
I will be good to the children from now on.

461
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:15,160
Chief Jo.

462
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,330
As you said, everything will be solved when my memory comes back.

463
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:22,160
So do as I say.

464
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:28,000
I will accept it for now.

465
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:39,720
If you visit where I'll stay to see me and my baby at least twice a week,

466
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,900
then I'll consider leaving this house.

467
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:47,750
So please think carefully.

468
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:12,300
Right, it might be better to get out of here.

469
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,850
Instead of here, where it's surrounded by many sets of eyes,

470
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:20,850
I could be alone with him in the new house.

471
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:30,630
The children did not want to go.

472
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:34,010
They wanted to be with me.

473
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:43,130
Ms. Park. No matter what comes or what happens.

474
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,920
Can you believe in me?

475
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:56,830
He asked me to believe in him no matter what came.

476
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:16,290
Chairman, I'm outside of your house.

477
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:19,570
I need to see you now. I have to tell you something.

478
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:23,030
I will wait until you come out.

479
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,090
Ms. Park, why did you come here at this hour?

480
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:04,600
Chairman, I've thought about it over and over, and I can't break up with you.

481
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,230
We love each other so much.

482
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:11,180
I want to see you, even if it's like this.

483
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:16,540
So, please, don't say we broke up.

484
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,960
Don't tell me to forget you.

485
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,170
Why don't you listen to me, Ms. Park?

486
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:26,910
I am not going to listen to you.

487
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,640
Ms. Park. Chief Jo is pregnant with my baby.

488
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,400
No, she isn't.

489
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:51,080
I trust you, Chairman.

490
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,680
I trust you.

491
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,470
Ms. Park.

492
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:03,560
I can't run away from this reality.

493
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:08,690
I can't move an inch from the life I've lived.

494
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:15,570
Beyond Chief Jo, regardless of what happened.

495
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:18,300
You and I are not meant to be.

496
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,080
Chairman.

497
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:26,480
Look at us.

498
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,510
You are crying again because of me.

499
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:34,670
I've only made you cry and feel pain.

500
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:39,410
If you are with me, you'll only have painful life in the future as well.

501
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,930
Chairman.

502
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:50,970
So please forget about me, and be with someone that everyone will bless for you.

503
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:56,980
You have the right to have that.

504
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:07,870
Ms. Park. Is there anyone who blesses our union?

505
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:10,680
Other than Se Chan and Se Jong.

506
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,090
We should not have started at all.

507
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:21,480
Ms. Park, now you go your way.

508
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:28,310
If you come back to see me, I won't see you.

509
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:31,130
Chairman.

510
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:13,100
That wrench.

511
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:19,820
How can Chairman look at me when that young wrench is wagging her tail at him like that?

512
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,950
She's the reason why he won't give me his heart.

513
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:30,800
All because of her.

514
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,630
Hello?

515
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,190
Yes, Chief Jo. What made you call me?

516
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,050
Pardon?

517
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,990
Are you in front of our house?

518
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:11,860
What's Chief Jo doing here?

519
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,750
Se Ryun, stay out of this.

520
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:21,670
It's not something we should involve ourselves.

521
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:33,990
What brings you here, Chief Jo?

522
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,060
What is this?

523
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,430
Isn't this Dan Dan?

524
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:50,570
What is she doing with Chairman Lee?

525
00:39:52,330 --> 00:40:00,690
I really... I really want to die.

526
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:07,730
I moved into Chairman's house to have his baby at his house.

527
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:13,050
Chairman is finally opening his heart to me.

528
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:15,670
But Ms. Park comes to see him at our house.

529
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:20,380
And try to shake him like this? What am I supposed to do?

530
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:27,250
Ms. Park was the reason why my engagement was called off.

531
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:31,270
Chairman is trying to do the right thing for the sake of the baby.

532
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:35,570
I had no other choice but to come here.

533
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:40,730
What do you mean our Dan Dan is shaking up the Chairman's feelings?

534
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:47,510
She came in front of the house late at night and called Chairman to come out.

535
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:51,870
My baby will be born in a few months.

536
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:54,340
What am I supposed to do?

537
00:40:54,340 --> 00:41:03,300
Driver Park, please get your daughter away from the Chairman.

538
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:09,170
Ms. Park keeps using Se Chan and Se Jong to see the Chairman.

539
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:12,930
Please. Please help me.

540
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:18,350
Am I supposed to raise this baby without the father?

541
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:23,780
If it isn't for Ms. Park, the Chairman will come back to me.

542
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:28,750
So, please... I'm having a tough time.

543
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:32,480
I really want to die.

544
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,870
Oh, dear...

545
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,480
Dan Dan.

546
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:54,820
Dan Dan. What's going on here?

547
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:58,480
Are you seeing Chairman Lee again?

548
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:07,960
Ms. Park. I beg of you.

549
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:13,970
Please, break up with the Chairman. Please!

550
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:21,040
Ms. Park. Do you wish me to jump off the Han River and die?

551
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,310
Please think of the baby inside of me.

552
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:27,730
Please, Ms. Park.

553
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:37,190
Chief Jo. Please calm down.

554
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:43,320
I've raised my daughter wrong.

555
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,230
It's all my fault.

556
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:52,080
Don't worry about anything. Just think of your baby.

557
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:55,210
I apologize on her behalf.

558
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:58,650
We are truly sorry.

559
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:00,710
We are sorry.

560
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:03,330
We are sorry.

561
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,030
[My Dad]

562
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,010
Yes, Dad.

563
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:58,500
Dan Dan,

564
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:02,210
why are you doing this?

565
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:07,480
What are you going to do

566
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,330
if Chief Jo ends up jumping into the Han river?

567
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:17,760
And how are you going to endure the resentment if something happens to the child because of you?

568
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,740
How can you date Chairman Lee again?

569
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:27,070
You should do as you said if you said you would end it cleanly.

570
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:31,470
It's not right to hurt others.

571
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:37,150
Dad, I'm sorry. I'll never see the Chairman again.

572
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:40,790
You said this so many times now.

573
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:44,880
Do you know how many people are suffering because of you?

574
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,360
Son-in-law Park!

575
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:52,370
Honey! Honey, calm down. Calm down! Se Ryun, bring some water!

576
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:57,580
Honey, get it together. What do we do?

577
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:02,490
Honey, calm down, can you hear me?

578
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:09,220
I want to die, Dan Dan... I didn't raise you to be like this.

579
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:11,220
I didn't raise you to be like this...

580
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,840
I'm sorry, Dad.

581
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:18,450
I'm so sorry.

582
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:20,680
What do we do?

583
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:27,670
I'm sorry, Dad. I won't see him ever again.

584
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:34,150
What do we do?

585
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:39,500
What? Did Chief Jo say that?

586
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:44,100
Yes. She said Ms. Park split you two up,

587
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,680
and the engagement was called off because of Ms. Park as well,

588
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,170
and she said that now Ms. Park is trying to shake your feelings by using the kids.

589
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:54,090
Chief Jo said she would jump off in the Han river and die.

590
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:58,540
Because of that, my father-in-law almost collapsed from the shock,

591
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:02,300
and the whole family was confused and surprised.

592
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,770
- Is all of this true?
- Yes.

593
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:09,880
I'm so surprised that I can't calm down right now.

594
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:16,770
Even so, how could Chief Jo come to my father-in-law and cause a scene?

595
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:21,280
Even divorced couples only discuss about the child

596
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,270
when they find out about the pregnancy later on. Nobody gets dragged around on a leash like you do!

597
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:29,560
It's not like you are engaged or married to her!

598
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:34,670
To be honest, the child in Chief Jo's stomach could be someone else's.

599
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:41,530
I'm so angry at you! Ms. Park had to break up with you out of the blue.

600
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:47,190
Honestly, I feel so bad for Ms. Park.

601
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:49,520
Poor Sister-in-law...

602
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:55,310
My father-in-law knelt in front of Chief Jo,

603
00:46:55,310 --> 00:47:00,890
and Ms.Park knelt in front of my father-in-law. What is all this!?

604
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,740
Ms. Park!

605
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,320
Se Jong!

606
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:24,180
Ms. Park, what are you doing here? Did you come here because you missed me?

607
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:27,370
Se Jong, do you want to go get some ice cream?

608
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:30,770
Yes! I'm so excited!

609
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,120
Se Jong...

610
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,460
Yes?

611
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:56,640
I have something to tell you today.

612
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:04,380
Se Jong,

613
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:10,680
you already know, right? That we can't meet from now on.

614
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:19,080
I was helping you until now because you were sick.

615
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:22,230
But now,

616
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:25,150
even if you're sick,

617
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:28,440
I can't help you anymore.

618
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:34,460
Se Jong.

619
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:40,800
Your younger sibling is in Chief Jo's stomach.

620
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,870
That means

621
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:50,260
that your dad, Chief Jo, and you

622
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,750
will be a family one day.

623
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:59,530
So that's why I can't keep seeing you and the Chairman.

624
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:06,730
If I keep seeing you, Chief Jo will get hurt very much.

625
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:08,730
Right?

626
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:12,600
Se Jong,

627
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:17,100
from now on, like you had a good time with me,

628
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:21,850
have a good time with Chief Jo. Okay?

629
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:27,290
If you do so, you won't miss me when time goes by.

630
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:29,540
Can you do that?

631
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,760
Okay.

632
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:39,310
Starting today, don't cry even if you miss me.

633
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:44,820
Sleep well too.

634
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:49,310
Starting today,

635
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:53,480
stay strong and live happily.

636
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,630
Okay.

637
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,630
Pinky promise!

638
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:04,280
Pinky promise...

639
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:21,710
Welcome home, Se Jong.

640
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:23,650
Yes...

641
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:30,120
Se Jong, why don't you go in first?

642
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:34,850
I need to talk with Chief Jo.

643
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:36,880
Okay.

644
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:03,510
I came to apologize to you.

645
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:07,850
I'm sorry for everything.

646
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:14,220
I thought only of my feelings and not yours.

647
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:19,370
I'm sorry I didn't even think of

648
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:25,200
how much pain and suffering I'd cause to you.

649
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:33,110
I will make sure this doesn't happen again. I promise.

650
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:39,120
Thank you. Keep that promise.

651
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,040
I will.

652
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:44,770
Goodbye.

653
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:06,660
Thank you for meeting with me, Chairman.

654
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:13,240
I came to say goodbye to you for the last time.

655
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:20,140
I was blinded by the love I had for you,

656
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:24,890
and I couldn't think of the pain I would cause to other people.

657
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:32,320
I finally learned that love that you hurt others is not true love,

658
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:37,340
and I won't be happy with that kind of love either.

659
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:42,050
Chairman, as you said,

660
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:44,750
I...

661
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:49,510
I will stop here.

662
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:55,640
Please forget everything I said.

663
00:52:55,640 --> 00:53:00,890
I denied Chief Jo and your child and said mean things...

664
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:06,800
I must've been out of my mind for a moment. I'm so sorry.

665
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,380
I'm sorry for throwing a tantrum and forcing my way.

666
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,170
Now...

667
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:22,350
I will never come to see you.

668
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:24,810
Goodbye.

669
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:52,620
You drank all the blueberry milk I made.

670
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,300
Was it good?

671
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,010
Yes.

672
00:53:56,010 --> 00:54:00,400
Thank you so much for eating it deliciously.

673
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:11,760
Se Jong, you might not understand because you're young,

674
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:17,650
but your dad will have a hard time if you keep going to Ms. Park's house.

675
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:23,480
So, from now on, let's try to get along with me.

676
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:28,110
I'll do my best for you. I'll do my utmost best.

677
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:31,280
Okay?

678
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,240
Okay, Chief Jo Ajumma.

679
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:39,440
Let's try together.

680
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:44,340
Thank you, Se Jong.

681
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:48,980
Should we go play the arcade game in celebration of this moment?

682
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:52,360
I want to play on the way to the kindergarten tomorrow.

683
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:56,410
Okay. Let's play it tomorrow.

684
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:04,200
You got some blueberry here.

685
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:16,490
Ms. Park said she would never see the Chairman again,

686
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:20,770
and my Se Jong is back at home.

687
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:26,190
Now, the Chairman is all that's left.

688
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:31,800
I just need to win the Chairman's heart.

689
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:35,420
Yes?

690
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:41,510
Chief Jo, the Chairman is waiting for you in his study.

691
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:43,460
Is he?

692
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:04,610
Chairman, I heard you were looking for me.

693
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:13,750
Chief Jo, I heard you went to Ms. Park's house.

694
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,780
Excuse me?

695
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:18,910
Yes...

696
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:24,790
Chief Jo, I broke up with Ms. Park.

697
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:30,180
I liked Ms. Park, but I still broke up with her.

698
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:33,850
I'm very sorry for what I did to her.

699
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:37,070
So why would you go there?

700
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:39,190
You don't have the right to do that.

701
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:43,560
What in the world are you doing!

702
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:48,420
Chairman, I have your child.

703
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:53,100
I did that because you kept seeing Ms. Park, not me!

704
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:58,080
You say you broke up with her, but you kept meeting her and hugging her!

705
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,810
Do you call that broken up?

706
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:02,560
Do you!?

707
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:10,250
Chief Jo, did you follow me?

708
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:13,480
It's not...

709
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:20,290
Now I really can't have you in this house anymore.

710
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:22,120
Get out.

711
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,620
Get out right now.

712
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:26,950
Right this moment!

713
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:29,320
Chief Kim!

714
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:32,940
Yes, Chairman.

715
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:37,050
Chief Jo is going to leave this house right now. Help her.

716
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:38,320
Yes, sir.

717
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,780
Let's go.

718
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:05,020
I packed most of your luggage. Why don't you get ready?

719
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:08,030
I'll get Driver Kang ready.

720
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:14,690
Chief Kim. I can't leave right now.

721
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:18,310
Where do you expect me to go this late at night!?

722
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:22,820
You can go to your own house!

723
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:26,620
You must know how i feel because you have a mother too.

724
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:33,530
If a pregnant woman like me gets kicked out at this hour, my mom will faint!

725
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:37,830
The Chairman said to leave right this moment.

726
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:42,520
I'll leave even as soon as tomorrow if you find a temporary place for me to stay.

727
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:47,710
Shouldn't you at least find me a temporary place before you kick me out!?

728
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,250
What should I do, Chairman?

729
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:57,600
She said her mother will fall ill if she goes home now,

730
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:03,660
and she's crying and holding out, saying that she'd leave if we find her a temporary place to stay.

731
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:09,790
Okay then, go ahead and find her a temporary place to stay until she finds something permanent.

732
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:13,330
Okay, I'll look into it right away tomorrow.

733
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,860
I won't step back this easily.

734
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:36,830
I won't!

Why else would Dan Dan mop the floor until her arms give out?

741
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:16,760
She's doing all that so she can forget about Chairman Lee.

742
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:22,340
I don't think you'll have to worry about her seeing him again.

743
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:30,900
By the way, did that woman go back to America?

744
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,080
I'm talking about Anna.

745
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:36,990
How would I know that? I have no idea.

746
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:39,070
You better have no idea.

747
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:44,120
You promised not to see her again. Of course, you shouldn't know about her whereabouts.

748
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:50,180
You have to stay clueless about her well-being, okay?

Aren't you going to her daughter's 1st birthday party?

Oh, right. I almost forgot.

Gosh, I knew it.

Do you have a married friend who already has a 1-year-old kid?

Yes. We were in the same club in university.

01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:17,980
- I'll get going then.
- Okay.

Okay.

771
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:48,290
Maybe because they're both young.

772
01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:50,480
They look really good together.

They're a handsome couple.

Mr. Park. Aren't you and I hoping for the same thing?

Don't you think my son and your daughter make a great couple?

Excuse me. Yes!

What?

We'll know once we run the tests.

790
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:54,800
We'll discuss this after we get your results.

I'll get back to you.

[FT Group's Chairman Lee Young Gook's Fiancée is Pregnant!]

806
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:45,140
Chief Jo.

807
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:50,720
The article about your pregnancy. Did you leak it?

808
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,770
Yes.

809
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:59,970
Chief Jo. Why in the world are you doing this?

810
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:06,320
If you really like me as you claim to, there's no way you can do this.

811
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:09,580
Why are you doing this?

812
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:11,800
What exactly do you want from me!

813
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:18,720
Chairman. I'm pregnant with your child. What else would I want?

814
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,420
It's you, of course.

815
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:24,870
Becoming your wife,

816
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:29,860
that's all I hope for.

817
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:35,660
Chief Jo.

818
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:40,100
That will never happen, even if it's the end of the world.

819
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:44,960
Is that so? Then I won't ever leave this home either.

820
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:50,960
If you have Chief Kim or anyone else forcibly kick me out...

821
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:57,600
At that moment, you'll probably see an article with this title,

822

"FT Group's Chairman Lee Young Gook Kicked Out His Pregnant Fiancée."

"Drowned In The Han River."

825
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:37,530
Chairman! You can go to Namsan tomorrow.

826
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:39,670
Today isn't the only day you can go.

827
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:41,100
I told you I couldn't.

828
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:44,900
What if we miss the last boat? Hurry up!

829
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:47,280
Oh! That's our boat!

830
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,180
Run! Quickly!

831

Wait for me!

832
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:53,600
Hurry up, Chief Jo Noona!

833
01:07:54,790 --> 01:07:59,880
Spending time with you isn't fun. It's so boring to the point I have to lie.

834
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,270
But I hate myself doing that.

835
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:06,340
No matter how hard I try, I don't see you as a woman.

836
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:10,690
Which is why, I can't marry you, Chief Jo Noona.

837
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:14,400
Let's postpone our wedding.

838
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:22,330
We were never in a relationship before.

839
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:28,130
I never liked you, Chief Jo. Not even once.

840
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:30,280
Chairman...

841
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:33,200
Chief Jo.

842
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:36,500
Why did you lie to me?

843
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:39,870
We didn't have feelings for each other, nor were we meant to get engaged.

844
01:08:39,870 --> 01:08:41,790
Why did you lie to me!

845
01:08:41,790 --> 01:08:44,750
Why! Why! Why!

846
01:08:47,410 --> 01:08:53,750
Chief Jo. Don't ever show your face to me again.

847
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:56,660
Don't even come near me!

848
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:58,990
Our engagement is over.

849
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:10,720
Chairman.

850
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:16,670
I was wrong, Chairman.

851
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:19,540
I think I lost my mind for a second.

852
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:24,820
Chairman, please. Think about our unborn child.

853
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:29,560
Please give me one more chance. Please.

854

856
01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:06,120

Does that mean you can date Ms. Park again and we can see her too?

How could you do something like that with my child?
