[Episode 24]

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,540
That's great! Stay like that!

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,890
Why is Ms. Park Noona so beautiful?

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,390
I can't hold back anymore.

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,750
I will not hold back anymore.

6
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,630
I'm going to like Park Dan Dan from now on.

7
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,050
I won't call her Noona anymore.

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,400
I will call her "you."

9
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,300
♫ I'll call you by you ♫

10
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,120
♫ No matter what you say ♫

11
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:55,760
♫ So that you can feel me as a man, I'll hold you tightly ♫

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,570
♫ I'll call you by you  ♫

13
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,800
♫  I don't care what you say  ♫

14
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,060
♫ Don't be surprised ♫

15
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:13,330
♫  You're actually a young woman  ♫

16
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:41,030
♫  Whoever you meet, and whatever you do with them  ♫

17
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,990
♫ I can only wait ♫

18
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,830
♫ Because Noona, you're my woman, because you are my woman ♫

19
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,590
My heart has gone crazy.

20
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,550
I have never felt like this toward Chief Jo Noona.

21
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,370
What do I do now?

22
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,580
- Chairman.
- Chairman Lee.

23
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,320
Lawyer Koh.

24
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,850
- Chairman.
- Chairman Lee.

25
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,900
- Chairman.
- Young Gook.

26
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,460
Young Gook. What's wrong?

27
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,450
Are you feeling sick?

28
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,170
No, that's not it.

29
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,590
But I really feel terrible.

30
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,980
I will have to go home and rest.

31
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,010
Okay. Let's go.

32
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,140
Driver Kim, please get the car ready now.

33
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,950
Okay, good. We are done for the day!

34
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,760
Did you say your name was Dan Dan?

35
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,450
Are you sure it was your first time?

36
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,160
You did it well, like a pro.

37
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,990
Really?

38
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,970
I was worried that I might get in your way.

39
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,440
What do you mean, Dan Dan? You were fantastic.

40
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,260
I'm sorry, Ms. Park.

41
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,120
I got too excited, and I accidentally called you by your name.

42
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,300
I like it.

43
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,820
Please call me by my name from now on.

44
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,610
How can I?

45
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,240
Ms. Park Dan Dan, you really worked hard today.

46
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,970
Yes. Thank you.

47
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,050
CEO Anna, while we were shooting,

48
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,980
the Chairman came by briefly.

49
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,990
Chairman Lee Young Gook?

50
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,200
Really?

51
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:32,910
Yes. He watched it for a while but left because he didn't want to get in the way.

52
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,920
Really? I see.

53
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,550
Everyone, you've all worked hard today.

54
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,140
Let's wrap it up.

55
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,360
Yes. Good job.

56
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,640
Right, let's go home. Thank you.

57
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,920
Thank you.

58
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,250
I guess Young Gook doesn't want to see me at all.

59
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,560
He was here and yet didn't even say hi.

60
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,230
What if his memory doesn't come back at all?

61
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,820
That would be a big problem.

62
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,910
He's working hard so he will regain it, don't you think so?

63
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:07,180
Yes, I'm sure it will.

64
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,960
You did well, really.

65
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,640
Thank you.

66
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,450
Oh, Se Ryun!

67
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,110
Se Ryun. Wait!

68
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,190
I'm telling you Young Gook is like a mad bulldog.

69
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,650
You remember in high school, don't you?

70
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,930
He attacked me like a mad bulldog in front of your dad back then.

71
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,120
He's exactly like himself back then.

72
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,760
He will scream at me to get out for sure.

73
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,110
What do we do then?

74
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,170
Don't worry, Mom.

75
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:39,260
He doesn't act harshly to me, so you just stand behind me.

76
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,180
I will take care of everything.

77
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,920
Let's go in, Mom. Hurry.

78
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,560
- Se Ryun, really!
- Let's go.

79
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,560
Se Ryun!

80
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,490
Oppa, I'm home.

81
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,240
Oppa!

82
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,100
Ms. Se Ryun! You are here too, Madam!

83
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,340
Where is Oppa?

84
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,260
He just came home. He's in his study.

85
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,650
Did someone come?

86
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,380
Oppa, it's me.

87
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,010
Are you Se Ryun, by chance?

88
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:19,810
But how come you look so old?

89
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,530
I look so old?

90
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,860
How can you greet your younger sister like that?

91
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,120
Right. You are 36 now.

92
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,890
I heard you were in New York. When did you get back?

93
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,850
Are you trying to use Se Ryun to come back?

94
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,660
You're such a ridiculous Ajumma.

95
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:48,160
Oppa. You promised to be good to my mom.

96
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,310
That's how I could go to the US without worry.

97
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,910
Did I make a promise like that?

98
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,380
There's no way I would've made that kind of promise.

99
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,500
Oppa, how can you be like this?

100
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,770
Okay, I know you've lost your memory.

101
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,660
But, you can't treat my mom like this.

102
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,540
How can you kick her out while I was in the US?

103
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,900
Oppa, I'm really disappointed in you.

104
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,540
Lee Se Ryun.

105
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,810
You are my sister, but I can't live with that Ajumma.

106
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,760
What if you were in my position?

107
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,380
Don't you remember what happened to my mother because of her?

108
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:27,560
Whenever I see her, my blood flows upside down.

109
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,260
Do you think you can tolerate it?

110
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,520
Oka, okay, Oppa. Calm down.

111
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,650
I do understand how you feel in some ways.

112
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:40,610
But, we are siblings, no matter what.

113
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,000
And she is my mother.

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,330
So you said you would forgive her and come to an understanding.

115
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:49,570
That's how she came to live here with you.

116
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,350
I don't have any memory of that at all.

117
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,460
Besides, I didn't kick her out.

118
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,730
She left on her own.

119
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,820
Ajumma, speak for yourself.

120
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,040
Didn't you say you would leave if I opened the safe?

121
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,070
Oppa. Why is my mom an Ajumma?

122
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:11,190
I told you to stop calling her Ajumma!

123
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,440
Woah, I thought I would die from stress.

124
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,880
He really turned into a 22-year-old.

125
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,650
The way his eyes were on fire, it's exactly the way he was then.

126
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,490
I told you so.

127
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,650
I've been so scared of him I've had to avoid him

128
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,290
like a mouse in the living room and the kitchen.

129
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:37,210
I was afraid he might yell at me to get out if I bumped into him.

130
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,310
I've been so nervous lately.

131
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,590
Then, you should move out like me rather than live like this.

132
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,450
Why do you have to tolerate a situation like this?

133
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,140
I cannot do that. Don't even speak of it.

134
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,490
As long as I live here,

135
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,410
I get treated with the respect of being the Madam of FT Group.

136
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,960
Once I move out of here,

137
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,560
I am nothing but a mistress,

138
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,740
and you are the daughter of the mistress.

139
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,240
Then why did you tell him you were leaving?

140
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,100
You know his temper well.

141
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:11,440
It was because he was treating me disrespectfully.

142
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,440
If you are going to live here, you need to get your temper under control.

143
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:21,470
But at least, your brother is good to you.

144
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:29,480
Can you ask him where he has hidden my gold bars and money?

145
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:35,050
Mom! Didn't you say you got kicked out because of it?

146
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:38,800
Let's just forget about that, Mom.

147
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,180
Don't bother him.

148
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,150
When I get the share of the company,

149
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,590
I will fill this room with gold.

150
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:53,010
Se Ryun, will you really do that for me?

151
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:01,700
Where did Young Gook hide my gold bars if those were not in the study's safe?

152
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,260
And then...

153
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,780
This is really amazing.

154
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,690
The ice and coffee come out from the same machine.

155
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,560
It's delicious.

156
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,550
Now, I am waking up.

157
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,800
But how far back did his memory loss go?

158
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,740
Oh, look who's here!

159
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,410
Ms. Se Ryun, when did you return from New York?

160
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:44,520
I've been meaning to call you anyway.

161
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,110
Were you going to call me? Why?

162
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:53,460
Hasn't Madam told you yet?

163
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,010
If it's about Oppa's memory loss, I've heard and seen it.

164
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:03,810
No, I'm not talking about that.

165
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:09,410
Chairman and I will be getting engaged on Christmas Eve.

166
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,330
You can't miss an important event like that.

167
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,730
You will be there, right?

168
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,220
What did you say?

169
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:23,940
What are you and my brother doing?

170
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,220
Why is my life so complicated?

171
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:38,480
Nothing is going my way.

172
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,200
Okay, let's just play video games to cool down.

173
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,630
Oppa.

174
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,790
Are you getting engaged to Chief Jo?

175
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,120
Yes.

176
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,120
But you rejected Gook Hee Unni before.

177
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,450
And you rejected my pianist friend, Ji Soo.

178
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,860
You rejected all those great women.

179
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,340
And how could it be Chief Jo?

180
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,720
Did you really like her that much?

181
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,640
What is it about her that you like?

182
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,260
I don't know. Don't ask.

183
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,690
Actually, I'm getting engaged because I can't help it.

184
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,420
Before I lost my memory,

185
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:17,400
I was told that I was promised to marry Cheif Jo Noona.

186
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,920
What are you saying, Oppa?

187
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:26,000
You don't even remember it, but you're getting engaged because you can't help it?

188
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,930
What about now? Do you like her now?

189
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,030
No.

190
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,680
No matter how hard I try to remember the past,

191
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,040
I can only see her as a Noona.

192
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,710
I'm trying hard to like her.

193
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:43,440
But it's not working.

194
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,480
I'm really worried about it, actually.

195
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,370
It's driving me crazy to no end.

196
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:51,890
Why are you getting engaged, then?

197
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:56,870
You can do it once your memory is back if you want to.

198
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,520
I feel bad for Chief Jo Noona, then.

199
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:04,410
I've already changed the promise to marry to an engagement.

200
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,010
Still, you can't force yourself to do it.

201
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,340
Engagement is not a child's play.

202
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:14,000
What if you regret it later?

203
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,260
Do you think so?

204
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,040
Of course!

205
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,640
My goodness.

206
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,280
Mom, I can clean better since I'm excited.

207
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,080
Stop acting silly and clean it well!

208
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,720
I'm cleaning thoroughly.

209
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,590
Thank you for coming!

210
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,910
Yes, please visit us again.

211
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,290
Mr. Park, don't just sweep over there.

212
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:50,000
While you are at it, sweep this side as well.

213
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,270
I've been cleaning there every day myself.

214
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,860
Ah, yes. I will.

215
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,370
Hey, you. How can you say that?

216
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,980
He's busy since he just opened yesterday.

217
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,760
How can you say that rather than helping him?

218
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,120
That's why you are still unmarried.

219
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,930
You need a good heart to get married.

220
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:12,470
Why do you pick on me every day?

221
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,350
Ah, really.

222
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,040
Mr. Park, please leave it. We will sweep it.

223
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,460
No, that's okay. I should do it.

224
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:26,630
Mr. Park, you really are as generous as I heard of you.

225
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:30,750
By the way, isn't it uncanny?

226
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:35,190
That my son and your daughter know each other from the same university.

227
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,970
I know. Your son is tall and very handsome.

228
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:42,960
I think he got it from you.

229
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,930
I do hear that often.

230
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:49,820
Your daughter is beautiful and smart too.

231
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,990
Maybe because I don't have a daughter,

232
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,730
but I'm very envious of you.

233
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,950
Take the call.

234
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,460
It's CEO Anna.

235
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,070
Hello, CEO Anna?

236
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,000
Driver Park.

237
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,640
How come you came all the way here?

238
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,410
I was nearby.

239
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:26,270
Isn't it a busy hour at the restaurant?

240
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,100
We haven't opened for the day, so it's okay.

241
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,960
I meant to call you anyway.

242
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,930
You placed such a large order on our opening day.

243
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,940
Thank you very much.

244
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,140
Not at all Driver Park--

245
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,280
I mean, Boss Park.

246
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,700
Please feel free to keep calling me Driver Park.

247
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,640
I can't. You are the owner now.

248
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:55,620
I brought this because I thought you'd like to see it.

249
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,420
So I stopped by to see you.

250
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,850
What is it?

251
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,250
This photo is...

252
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,300
It's my Dan Dan.

253
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,740
Yes, that's right. Today we did a photo shoot for the new season,

254
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,870
and our model couldn't come because of an urgent situation.

255
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:19,040
But the director said, let's give it a try with Ms. Park,

256
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,330
and she did so well, like a professional model.

257
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:27,030
Dan Dan really is pretty.

258
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,340
Right?

259
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,420
Here.

260
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,090
She's very pretty.

261
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,020
I will get going now.

262
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,670
When the publication comes out, I will bring it to you.

263
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,270
Thank you.

264
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,190
CEO Anna. Since you're here,

265
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:04,180
why don't you come to our restaurant and have a meal if you have time?

266
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:11,120
We have whelk noodles, and the chickens taste better at the store.

267
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,100
I'm sorry, but I have to go. Maybe next time.

268
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,750
Okay. Please come by next time.

269
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:54,310
My head, heart, and soul are only filled with Park Dan Dan.

270
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:57,820
It doesn't make sense to get engaged to another woman.

271
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:03,230
If Ms. Park Noona has a feeling for me, I will cancel the engagement.

272
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,140
And fall in love with Park Dan Dan.

273
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,160
Ms. Park, the weather is spectacular today.

274
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,430
And the breeze is nice.

275
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:17,370
I don't want to go home right away.

276
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:24,230
So, what do you want to do, Mr. Se Jong?

277
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:30,810
You promised to play the arcade game only twice a week.

278
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:33,320
And you've already played twice.

279
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,820
Then not the arcade game,

280
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,070
but let's do another game.

281
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:44,710
Dad!

282
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,770
Are you done with kindergarten class?

283
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:51,360
I came out for a walk because the weather's nice today.

284
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,110
Since we are here together, it'd be a shame to go home right away.

285
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,520
That's right, Dad!

286
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,620
I don't feel like going home straight, either.

287
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:09,390
Right? Should we play some games, eat ice cream, and go Christmas shopping before going home?

288
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,320
Yes, I love it!

289
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,060
Why don't you two do that? I will go home first.

290
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:22,890
No, Ms. Park. I want to spend time with you.

291
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,740
Ms. Park Noona, Se Jong is desperately asking you.

292
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,110
Could you deny him, looking at his longing eyes?

293
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:38,900
It'd only be fun if you came along with us. Please?

294
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,180
Wow, you are doing well.

295
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,620
Are you enjoying yourself?

296
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,930
Watch me, Se Jong.

297
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:02,790
This is how you do it, Se Jong.

298
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,210
How come you are so good at this?

299
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:19,070
♫  comes back to me in a smile, and comes back to me in pain sometimes  ♫

300
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,020
Park Dan Dan is smiling.

301
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:26,080
She's smiling at me.

302
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,450
♫ You, the one I put in my heart  ♫

303
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:37,220
♫  I want to take you out on this cozy day  ♫

304
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:43,330
Chairman!

305
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,810
Dad!

306
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,950
Dad! What's wrong with him?

307
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:54,640
Is he dead?

308
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,110
Chairman!

309
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,250
Oh, no.

310
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,070
Chairman!

311
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,670
Dad!

312
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,230
Somebody, please!

313
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,970
Please help!

314
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,290
- Dad!
- I didn't die!

315
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,220
What are you doing? Were you pretending to be dead?

316
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,040
I don't like you, Dad!

317
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:24,570
What's wrong with you, Chairman? You startled me!

318
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,520
She's right.

319
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,830
I'm sorry. I was just playing with you.

320
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,560
I was playing around.

321
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:41,250
Ms. Park Noona. Did you really think I died?

322
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:46,400
Were you sad because of it?

323
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,150
Ah, seriously!

324
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:57,440
What do I do? She's pretty even when she's angry.

325
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,590
♫ I couldn't say enough ♫

326
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:07,580
♫ As much as I missed you all night long ♫

327
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,740
♫ I want to say this to you ♫

328
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:19,180
♫ Our time that was filled with excitements ♫

329
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,950
♫ The memory that's shining like you ♫

330
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:27,700
- Is it good?
- Yes.

331
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:33,140
Park Dan Dan, from which star are you from?

332
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:39,440
The way you eat the cotton candy is as sweet as the candy.

333
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,830
♫ The memory that's shining like you ♫

334
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,520
Dad, you have cotton candy on your face.

335
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,190
Wow, you look so funny!

336
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:53,990
You have some right here.

337
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,520
Park Dan Dan is smiling while looking at me.

338
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,630
She keeps smiling.

339
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,170
She also likes me.

340
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,360
I'm sure about it.

341
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,350
Se Jong, there's a squirrel!

342
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:15,880
♫ I'll always be by your side ♫

343
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:32,470
Jenny, here are the workbooks you asked for before.

344
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,020
Thank you, Ms. Park.

345
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,500
Eat some snacks while you study.

346
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,850
Jenny.

347
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:47,940
Dad, what is that?

348
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,810
Right, it's a Christmas gift.

349
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:53,640
Daebak. It's amazing!

350
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,500
Thank you very much, Dad.

351
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,080
- Do you like it?
- Of course.

352
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,610
Ms. Park, please help me put this together.

353
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,760
Okay.

354
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,060
It's done.

355
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,950
Right, should we turn the light on?

356
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,710
Yes.

357
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,720
Woah, it's gorgeous.

358
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,450
Ms. Park, doesn't this look very much like our house?

359
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:24,960
Yes.

360
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,620
It's so beautiful.

361
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,920
Dad, thank you.

362
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:35,520
- It's not much.
- Dad, you're the best!

363
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:43,190
What is all this?

364
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,620
What do you mean? It's your favorite sweet potato snack and Yakbab.

365
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,880
I even made a whole bucket of watery kimchi, so try it.

366
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,560
Didn't you say it kills you to make things like this?

367
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,940
But how could I eat this? I don't need it.

368
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,070
No, it's not, Dae Ran!

369
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:05,750
This is not hard at all. It's easy peasy.

370
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,500
I was only upset at Mi Sook on that day.

371
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,360
That's why I acted that way.

372
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,590
It wasn't because of you.

373
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,230
Really?

374
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:19,190
Of course. Why would I have a hard time because of you?

375
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,640
But that Mi Sook is beyond description.

376
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,030
Because she let me stay in her house,

377
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:28,280
she thinks she can ask me to cook anything.

378
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,010
Didn't you see her that day?

379
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:35,280
She was sitting right next to you and kept asking me to make more food!

380
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,580
That's why I got upset.

381
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,860
You should have told me sooner.

382
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:45,420
Dae Ran. You are welcome at our home any time.

383
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,850
Come any time to eat, drink, and talk with me.

384
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:52,860
I would be grateful if you did, in fact.

385
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,900
But I won't call Mi Sook anymore.

386
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:07,820
How is it? Is it good?

387
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,720
Yes. It's delicious.

388
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,620
Try this too.

389
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,660
It's good, isn't it?

390
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,910
I'm pretty good at cooking. Drink this, too.

391
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,090
My Se Jong.

392
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:39,020
Where is my grandson's room?

393
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:54,210
I found his room!

394
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:58,240
He's so cute!

395
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:13,120
Oh, my goodness!

396
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,130
Who are you?

397
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,660
Me? I'm Chief Jo's mom.

398
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:23,070
Why is Chief Jo's mom here?

399
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:26,810
That's because, since I was coming here,

400
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,710
I wanted to give Se Jong a gift.

401
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:32,920
Wow, Chief Jo only cares about Se Jong as well.

402
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,460
And you are also only giving him a gift.

403
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,220
That's because you two are already grown up.

404
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,170
Se Jong is still a baby.

405
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,450
I'm still a child, too!

406
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:48,850
You and Chief Jo are both discriminating! It's very odd!

407
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,760
Hey, kid.

408
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,280
That's not it.

409
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,430
Please get out of this room, now!

410
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:58,610
Also, please do not come here again.

411
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,010
Mom, what are you doing here?

412
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,460
Mom, please get out.

413
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:10,350
Chief Jo. She's not even family. For her to come upstairs is not a good manner.

414
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:13,960
That's right. I'm sorry.

415
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,830
Seriously, Mom!

416
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,640
Mom, what's wrong with you?

417
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,380
Why did you go upstairs?

418
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,520
I brought a toy for Se Jong.

419
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,010
And to use it as an excuse to look at Se Jong's room.

420
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:43,510
And to sniff my grandson's room smell.

421
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:46,900
Mom, are you crazy? Do you know how many eyes are in this place?

422
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,540
You are driving me crazy!

423
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:53,350
But it seems like you need to pull yourself together.

424
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:56,120
Those children are beyond ordinary.

425
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,310
They will swallow you whole, especially Jenny.

426
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:03,380
Don't even let me start. She's a piece of work. She's a spoiled princess.

427
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:07,360
Right? When you get married, you'll have to get rid of them first.

428
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,800
Otherwise, you will have no end of headache.

429
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,280
That's why I will send them to study abroad.

430
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,230
That's a good idea.

431
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,650
How much did we sell today?

432
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:25,600
I saw that we had more than half of the chicken left in the fridge.

433
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,610
We sold less than half of yesterday.

434
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:32,210
- We're in trouble.
- We had an opening day's luck yesterday.

435
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:36,060
And that CEO Anna ordered fifty chickens.

436
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,380
Today is the real first day.

437
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,760
Will we go bankrupt?

438
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,480
Watch what comes out of your mouth. It'll bring bad luck.

439
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,920
What do you mean a bankrupt? Don't plant a seed.

440
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,220
Mom, I didn't say let's go bankrupt.

441
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:55,430
I'm just worried because the sales dropped.

442
00:28:55,430 --> 00:29:00,060
If we are going to make it, we have to pull ourselves together.

443
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:04,380
People have to say our food is good.

444
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:08,910
How about if we add a new dish?

445
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:12,450
Shall we? Then how about a pho?

446
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:17,900
When I made the pho for your sister, she loved it as well!

447
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,190
Then people will come here just for the pho as well.

448
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:25,530
But Mother-in-law, we should make something that goes well with the chicken.

449
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:30,200
- Is that so?
- Then what should we make?

450
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:33,530
What if we can't pay the rent at this rate?

451
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,660
It's only been two days.

452
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,290
Don't be too discouraged.

453
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:41,190
And usually, the first six months are an adjustment period.

454
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:45,220
Right, we have to think positively.

455
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,460
Wow, the restaurant looks nice!

456
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,340
Congratulations, Brother-in-law and Noona.

457
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,680
How long has it been?

458
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,650
Do you know how much I've missed you?

459
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,050
You guys haven't been separated that long!

460
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:01,790
It's only been two days.

461
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:04,310
I'm sorry I couldn't be here for the opening.

462
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:08,260
You don't have to. You can't help it since you are a live-in driver.

463
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,530
That's right. It's beyond your control.

464
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,230
- Have you eaten?
- Yes.

465
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:16,760
How come you look so weary since living there?

466
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,060
Don't worry about that. Speaking from experience,

467
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:23,480
they serve nothing but the best with the meals.

468
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,950
That's right, Mom. Don't worry about me.

469
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:30,820
Okay. But since you are here, you should try the chicken.

470
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,360
Of course!

471
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,770
I will do the taste testing, so please bring me a chicken.

472
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:38,090
Okay!

473
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:40,580
Let's eat!

474
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:50,380
What are you doing?

475
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,280
I'm just browsing the internet.

476
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,080
What is it?

477
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,980
It's my share of this month's rent and expenses.

478
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:06,130
I told you I'd pay for it all.

479
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,730
No. I don't want to feel like I'm mooching off on you.

480
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:12,510
It's best to do these things half-half.

481
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:15,570
That makes me feel more comfortable.

482
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:19,490
Okay. If it makes you feel comfortable, let's do it that way.

483
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:24,410
But why aren't you coming to beauty school? Isn't that a waste of your tuition?

484
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,550
That's true.

485
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:29,610
But I don't think it's my thing.

486
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,580
I'm looking for something else.

487
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:34,290
Something else? What?

488
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,580
I don't know either.

489
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,000
I am trying to find one now.

490
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,080
Hey, who has time to look for their niche? You just do it what you can.

491
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,910
You're very privileged.

492
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:50,180
You better piggyback your mom around later. Don't forget how thankful she is.

493
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:04,710
What are you looking at?

494
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:08,490
I think you look pretty right now.

495
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:11,900
Did you just realize that?

496
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,330
Chairman!

497
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:23,520
Chief Jo is my woman. She and I slept together!

498
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:28,250
This engagement is something I cannot condone.

499
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,320
What do I do?

500
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:37,230
If he opens his mouth, everything is over for me.

501
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:41,980
Jo Sarah...

502
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:45,300
What should I do?

503
00:32:55,950 --> 00:33:00,830
How is it? Be honest.

504
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:03,200
Why? It doesn't taste good?

505
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,290
No. That's not it.

506
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,220
It's a bit ordinary.

507
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:15,910
Like the fried chicken you can get anywhere.

508
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,300
What did you say?

509
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,230
If you want your business to do well,

510
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:26,450
you need a unique flavor that people have to come all the way over here to eat.

511
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,370
I'm just saying that this isn't at that level, that's all.

512
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:33,990
People need to come from all over for this business to do well.

513
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:38,130
Think about why our chicken skewer business flopped.

514
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:42,370
We bought things from a factory. It's all the same flavor.

515
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:44,630
I know because I did it.

516
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:51,990
Anyway, people need to line up to eat brother-in-law's chicken for the business to succeed.

517
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,420
That's what it is.

518
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,410
Are you saying we're going to go bankrupt?

519
00:33:55,410 --> 00:34:02,430
Seriously! You are always so extreme. I can't even say anything.

520
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:07,170
When did I say you'd go bankrupt? I said this is what you have to do to be successful.

521
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,730
He's right.

522
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:12,300
The truth is, I only thought about selling a lot,

523
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,630
but I didn't pay much attention to the flavor.

524
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:18,170
So what should we do from now?

525
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:21,700
We should invent a flavor particular to our store.

526
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:27,150
Then, we should start testing tomorrow.

527
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:30,750
Yes, Mother-in-law.

528
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:34,430
Who is calling me at this hour?

529
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:39,890
Why aren't you picking up? Who is it?

530
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:42,730
What? Oh...

531
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:47,160
I'll go take this phone call, Mom.

532
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,190
What kind of call is it that he's going outside to answer it?

533
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,540
I know.

534
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:57,480
Yes, this is Cha Geon.

535
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,930
Can you see me right now?

536
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,540
What is it?

537
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:05,290
I have something to say to you.

538
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,740
Just tell me over the phone.

539
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:11,960
It's something I have to tell you in person. Please come out.

540
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,340
Okay. I'll see you there.

541
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,410
What is this?

542
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:31,490
I've put as much as I could, so you don't feel disappointed.

543
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,320
Why are you giving this money to me?

544
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,670
Ajussi, take that money

545
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,900
and please leave from the Chairman's house.

546
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:51,620
With that money, you'll be able to live until you find another job.

547
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,960
Look here, Chief Jo.

548
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,670
Ajussi, I'm getting engaged soon.

549
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,240
I'm begging you.

550
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,190
What did I do--!

551
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:15,410
What exactly did I do for you to give this money to me?

552
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:21,010
I'll say this again, but I won't do anything to you.

553
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:24,470
You're someone I don't know.

554
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:29,730
I have absolutely no reason to receive this money from you.

555
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:38,030
It seems like you misunderstand something by yourself.

556
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:42,400
I'm not that kind of a jerk.

557
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,590
So don't you ever call me out for this again.

558
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,310
Se Jong.

559
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:14,970
Dad, you have cotton candy on your face.

560
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:17,350
Right here.

561
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,530
She looked at me and smiled.

562
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:27,170
She smiles at me because she likes me.

563
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:31,600
Ms. Park Noona likes me as well.

564
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,220
I am sure.

565
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:40,050
I also like Park Dan Dan, and she likes me too.

566
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:44,040
Yes, I shouldn't deceive my feelings.

567
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:49,610
It's time to be honest.

568
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:55,650
Park Dan Dan, why do you keep thinking about the Chairman?

569
00:37:55,670 --> 00:38:03,130
You said you weren't going to do this. You shouldn't be doing this.

570
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:09,340
Chairman is going to be engaged with someone else soon.

571
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:26,080
Ms. Park Noona, come see me for a minute.

572
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,350
I have something important to tell you.

573
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:36,280
Something important to tell me? What is it?

574
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:57,450
Chairman, what is something important that you want to tell me?

575
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:07,450
You know that I will be engaged next week.

576
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,380
Yes.

577
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:16,760
But I don't think I can do it.

578
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,180
Pardon me?

579
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:30,500
Why are you telling me about it?

580
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,780
It's because of you.

581
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,820
Because of me?

582
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:45,720
Chairman, what are you saying right now?

583
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,390
I have feelings for you,

584
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:53,670
and I can't get engaged to Chief Jo Noona.

585
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,720
Chairman.

586
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:07,560
I really like you a lot.

587
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:14,930
Don't you have feelings for me as well?

588
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:22,740
Chairman, seriously, why are you doing this to me?

589
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:31,350
If you like me too, I will cancel this engagement.

590
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:37,270
Chairman, you are a really bad person.

591
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:40,750
How can you do this?

592
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:44,670
Please don't say that again to me.

593
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:51,110
Ms. Park Noona. Ms. Park Noona!

594
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:57,520
♫ Why do you run away, love. Like a shy child ♫

595
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,520
Ms. Park Noona.

596
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,100
Does she not like me?

597
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:14,230
But the way she looks at me... Her eyes looked like she liked me.

598
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,110
Am I wrong?

599
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:26,960
♫ Why do you run away, love. Like a shy child ♫

600
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:34,610
What's wrong with the Chairman? Why is he doing this to me? What did I do?

601
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:41,420
♫ But love always runs away, chased by longing ♫

602
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:48,760
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

603
00:41:48,760 --> 00:42:00,210
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

604
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,580
Who is it?

605
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:10,200
It's me, Lee Young Gook. Let's talk.

606
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:26,900
It's 3 in the morning. What's going on?

607
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:39,210
Chairman, what brings you here at this hour?

608
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:41,890
Ms. Park Noona.

609
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:45,230
Do you like me or not?

610
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:48,730
Please just answer that to me.

611
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:51,710
You like me, don't you?

612
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:57,070
What nonsense are you saying at this hour?

613
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:01,040
Just go wash your feet and go to sleep!

614
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:13,940
What's wrong with Chairman? Why does he keep stirring my emotion?

615
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:31,180
I guess Ms. Park Noona doesn't have feelings for me.

616
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:37,570
That's right, Lee Young Gook. You really can't do this.

617
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:40,540
Just like Ms. Park Noona said,

618
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:46,490
if you do this, you'll be a really bad person.

619
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:49,770
Get your mind right.

620
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:09,690
Oh, this dress is so pretty. Maybe because you're today's heroine, everything you wear looks good on you.

621
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:13,290
The young lady-in-law looks pretty, too!

622
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:14,950
They say young age is the power.

623
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:20,790
Everything looks good on you since both of you're young!

624
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:23,760
They are not even married yet. Why are you calling me young lady-in-law?

625
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,020
Honesty, no one knows that before you go into the wedding hall.

626
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,570
Look at me. I ran away from my wedding right before it started.

627
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:34,580
Hey, that's nothing to be proud of, you little brat.

628
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,810
I didn't say something that's not true.

629
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:44,000
Where's the other star of the day? Has he not put his clothes on yet?

630
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:48,360
Wow!

631
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:53,910
Look how tall he is!

632
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:59,720
That's right. Our Chairman Lee's suit fit is the best.

633
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,270
Looks okay, I guess.

634
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:06,590
You two looks so good together. Wouldn't it be nice if this were just the wedding?

635
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:12,410
Mom, in my brother's state, getting engaged is more than enough.

636
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:18,830
Chairman, let's take some photos.

637
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:23,610
Yes! Sarah, I'll take it for you.

638
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:28,390
- Kimchi!
- It's very nice! Smile!

639
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:31,830
Chairman Lee, smile!

640
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:36,170
Chief Jo, get closer.

641
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:37,710
Ah, it's pretty, it's pretty.

642
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:41,100
- Hey, get us, too.
- Wait!

643
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,880
Just take our picture as well!

644
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,420
Please send the children's clothes to the house when they're ready.

645
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,220
- Yes.
- Hey, let's take selfies!

646
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:50,300
Here, let me take it.

647
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,980
Chairman.

648
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:55,800
We should tell the children about us getting engaged.

649
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,470
Do you want me to do it?

650
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:02,290
No. I will tell them.

651
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:05,550
I'm going to change now.

652
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:08,790
You shouldn't leave. The background is gone.

653
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:10,750
- Don't leave.
- Where are you going?

654
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:14,190
The background is gone!

655
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:53,110
I think I like this one.

656
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:57,250
Ms. Lee, can you put this up against yourself?

657
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:01,340
This is the trendy design these days. Madam, you have great taste.

658
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,710
Can you turn to the side?

659
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:05,630
- Is this good?
- Yes.

660
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:07,280
Now the other way.

661
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,650
What do you think?

662
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:11,610
Oh, it's very bling-bling!

663
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:14,220
I like it. I'll take this one.

664
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:19,950
What kind of money does Gi Ja have to spend like that?

665
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:24,710
Those are all luxury brands' shopping bags.

666
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:29,540
On top of that, how can she buy luxury jewelry?

667
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:34,670
This is the taste of living.

668
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:39,740
I never knew spending money was this great.

669
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:42,630
Mi Sook...

670
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:58,280
Hey, why are you looking at me like that?

671
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:02,050
Stop looking at me like that, you brat.

672
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:05,760
Do you really have no idea why I'm like this?

673
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,670
You're not saying anything, so how am I supposed to know? You're just squinting at me.

674
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:13,470
Just say something. Talk to me.

675
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:18,020
All the bags, jewelry, clothes that you bought today at the luxury brands,

676
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:21,100
I think it'll be at least ten million won!

677
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,500
You're spending so much money around,

678
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,460
but how can you do this to me?

679
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:28,900
Every time you see me, you say, "I have no money!" talking like you're dying.

680
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,520
That is why I basically let you in this house for free.

681
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,940
If you're going to be spending money like this,

682
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:37,620
either give me more deposit money, or shouldn't you at least be paying a monthly rent?

683
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,840
Don't you think so?

684
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:46,010
Wow, you cry a lot over a stupid house.

685
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:50,010
Fine. I'll give it to you. That mere rent?

686
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:54,030
How much do you want? Will one million won per month will do it?

687
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:57,720
What? That mere rent?

688
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,430
One million won?

689
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:06,180
Have you been following around and digging up my back to see how much I spend?

690
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:11,610
I'm the one who's feeling betrayed.

691
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:16,800
Fine, I'll pay for it! I don't want to tiptoe you around while spending my money!

692
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:22,310
Hey, I'll transfer one million won to you right now.

693
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:27,220
I'll send you at the end of the month every month.

694
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:31,160
I don't like late payments.

695
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:37,060
I guess Gi Ja will be the mother-in-law of the FT Group and already getting money from them.

696
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:41,320
How can she take advantage of the future son-in-law, who reverted to 22 years old?

697
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:45,850
And then look at her, being so arrogant.

698
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:52,220
I transferred the money into your account. Look!

699
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,610
What are you doing?

700
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:04,080
Ah, yes. I'm trying a different recipe for the batter.

701
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,730
A different recipe for the batter? How?

702
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:09,730
Here, I added a bit of curry powder,

703
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:12,640
and I added a bit of green pepper to this one.

704
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,660
Oh, that's why it's yellow. And I can see green pepper in this one.

705
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,920
Go ahead and fry it. I'm curious what it'll taste like.

706
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,260
Yes, Mother-in-law.

707
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:26,770
Mother-in-law, how does it taste?

708
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:28,790
What do you think, Honey?

709
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:32,520
This pepper one is spicy, and it's perfect for my taste.

710
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:36,770
It cuts the greasiness and feels refreshing.

711
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:38,360
I like the curry one!

712
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,260
This is perfect for my taste.

713
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:42,770
I think kids will love it!

714
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,300
Do you think so?

715
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:50,190
It's good, right?

716
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:56,040
Se Ryun, I heard you went to New York. Did you go to our school?

717
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,520
Yes, of course.

718
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,600
I met Judy, Steve, and Professor Kim too.

719
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,940
They are doing great. They want me to say 'hi' to you.

720
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,630
- Really?
- Yes, it's been so long.

721
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:11,460
- They told me to come back to New York with you next time.
- That would be great.

722
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:14,100
I really miss them too.

723
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,500
- Why don't we all go to New York together sometime?
- Yes!

724
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,550
Where did you go to study abroad?

725
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:22,020
Excuse me? Study abroad?

726
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:26,680
Dae Beom studied at the West coast.

727
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:30,050
He majored in business at UCLA.

728
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:31,950
My brother studied there too!

729
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:34,820
Do you know Lee Seung Hyun by any chance?

730
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:38,480
My brother could be his Sunbae.

731
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:43,540
It's so long ago. How could he remember?

732
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:47,340
I can't even remember that well myself.

733
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,690
I'm a Physical Education college dropout.

734
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:53,370
I didn't go to a prestigious university and never even went to the US.

735
00:51:56,220 --> 00:52:00,110
Se Ryun, why are you lying?

736
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:02,690
Dae Beom...

737
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:05,930
Excuse me first.

738
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:08,290
I'm sorry, guys. Excuse me for a second.

739
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:11,200
Dae Beom! Dae Beom!

740
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,040
Dae Beom!

741
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,280
Did you have to do that?

742
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,640
You could've just nodded your head.

743
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,330
Did you have to embarrass me like that?

744
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:29,190
I mean, if you do that, how does that make me look?

745
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:32,900
Se Ryun, are you embarrassed by me?

746
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,320
When did I ever say that!?

747
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:39,420
Then why are you lying? This isn't the first time you lied.

748
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:42,160
When did I lie before?

749
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,600
You lied to your mom that I am the son of Mi So Steels company.

750
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:51,310
That's because... It's not because I was embarrassed.

751
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:53,790
I lied because I wanted to be with you.

752
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:58,700
Don't bring me to this kind of gathering ever again.

753
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,330
Dae Beom!

754
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:17,840
I'll be there in a bit.

755
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,740
You're the only one for me too.

756
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:26,090
We are true love.

757
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:28,400
Okay.

758
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:33,390
It's lasting for a long time this time. What kind of woman is she?

759
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:37,200
I'm sick of her. I'm going to end it after I get a car from her.

760
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,240
Car? You got a good one this time, didn't you?

761
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:44,770
What do you think of this watch? She bought me this yesterday.

762
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:50,510
This is a limited edition! There are only a few in this country.

763
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:55,660
You bastard! If you have girls like that, let me meet some too!

764
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,230
You're living such a dirty life when you're a man.

765
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:02,300
Do you want to live like that?

766
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:05,630
- Is he talking to us?
- What's up with that bastard?

767
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:10,570
If you're going to live like that, why don't you just die?

768
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:13,080
How can a man mooch off from a woman?

769
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,380
Hey, hey.

770
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:18,380
People like you make men look like idiots and dummies.

771
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,630
Get it together and live life the right way.

772
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:24,360
Does it feel good when you mooch off from a woman?

773
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,790
- Hey, don't do it.
- Don't stop me.

774
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:29,070
Hey, you just go on your way.

775
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:30,770
Did you just hit me?

776
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:33,840
You guys are dead today with my hands.

777
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,700
This bastard!

778
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,040
Dae Beom!

779
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:51,120
Dae Beom! Oh my, Dae Beom!

780
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:55,470
What... What happened?

781
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:58,060
Did you fight with those people?

782
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:01,390
Dae Beom. Oh my, oh my! What happened to your face!?

783
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:03,300
What are we going to do!? Oh my!

784
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:07,460
This must hurt! Oh, no...

785
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:29,150
Dae Beom. Don't worry. I settled it well.

786
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:32,250
I compensated the bar lady as well.

787
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:35,690
How? With money?

788
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:40,630
Of course, what else is there?

789
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,200
Dae Beom, let's go.

790
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,930
Let's go. I'm so cold.

791
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:46,070
Se Ryun.

792
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:52,600
Dae Beom. I'm really sorry about earlier.

793
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:56,160
I'll never make a situation like that again.

794
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:02,580
I really didn't know that gathering would become so uncomfortable for you.

795
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:06,420
I'm sorry, please forgive me?

796
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:09,990
Let's go. Come one, let's go.

797
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,860
Se Ryun. Let's end it here.

798
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:23,900
Dae Beom. What are you talking about?

799
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:26,540
What do you mean by ending it?

800
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:29,470
Why are you saying that?

801
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,700
I said I'm sorry.

I'll end it with them.
