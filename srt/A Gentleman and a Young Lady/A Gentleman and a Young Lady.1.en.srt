2
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,910
Ji Young. Ji Young. Wait a minute.

3
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,420
Let go. Let me go!

4
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:45,990
Don't go, Ji Young. Ji Young. Ji Young!
 [Year 1995, 26 years ago]

5
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,910
Why are you acting like this, Ji Young?

6
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,820
Let go. Let me go!

7
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,650
I know it's really hard for you these days.

8
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,310
I will do better. I'll put in more effort!

9
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:02,100
So please don't do this.

10
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,150
You drive me crazy whenever you act like this.

11
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,560
I'm not leaving because you did anything wrong.

12
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,450
It's just... it's suffocating.

13
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,710
This isn't living.

14
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,280
It feels like a prison.

15
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,710
It feels like a dark cave with no light!

16
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,160
What about me?

17
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,290
What about our Dan Dan?

18
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,380
Just consider me dead.

19
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,530
Ahjussi, please leave quickly. Quickly, please!

20
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:04,360
Anywhere far from here, please. Quickly!

21
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,740
I feel bad for Dan Dan's father.

22
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:21,470
She was deciding whether to stay or leave but in the end, she leaves.

23
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,910
Such a mean woman. How can she leave her child behind?

24
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,140
Aigoo, the baby still needs to be breastfed. What's he going to do?

25
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,420
How can a young man raise a child alone?

26
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,970
It's okay, Dan Dan. It's okay.

27
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,340
It's okay.

28
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:52,110
It's already been over a year since Dae Beom's father passed away due to a car accident, right?

29
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,090
What is our Dae Beom going to do without a father? I feel bad for you.

30
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,630
Ahjumma! Why do you feel bad for our Dae Beom?

31
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,140
From now on, please don't say that to our Dae Beom.

32
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,660
If he needs a father, I can get him a new father. So why would you feel bad for him?

33
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,950
I... I just said that because I felt bad that he doesn't have a father.

34
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,710
Why is she so angry?

35
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,310
Why are you laughing so much?

36
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,480
Did you get the laughing bug?

37
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,450
I don't know. I'm just content and happy.

38
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,490
Are you happy with just eating spicy rice cake since we're poor?

39
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,670
Yes. I just need you by my side.

40
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:19,310
Also, we have an amazing future.

41
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,500
Oppa. You'll become a world-renowned painter,

42
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:29,970
and I will become a world-renowned fashion designer.

43
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:35,680
I'm going to be successful and let you wear the clothes that I designed.

44
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,870
Yes.

45
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,900
What brought you here today?

46
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,140
Are you going out?

47
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,290
This is squash jeon. It came out great.
 [T/N: Jeon is a Korean pancake.]

48
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,490
Thank you for the food.

49
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,510
Okay.

50
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,340
If you need someone to watch Dan Dan, I'll babysit her.

51
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:29,770
My Dae Beom is a calm baby. So please feel free and let me know.

52
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,460
Thank you.

53
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,980
I have somewhere to go right now.

54
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,570
Oh, yes. Then have a good day.

55
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,560
Don't worry, Dan Dan.

56
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,570
We'll be able to see your mom.

57
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:54,270
Let's tell mom not to worry about us and study hard.

58
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,920
Goodness!

59
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:50,360
Have a safe trip, Ji Young.

60
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,520
I'm sorry I can't support you well financially when you're going far away.

61
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,360
I'll work hard and send you more money.

62
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,050
Come back when you've achieved your dream to become successful.

63
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,340
Dan Dan and I will be waiting for you.

64
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:22,270
I love you, Ji Young.

65
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,390
Hey!

66
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,940
Are you crazy? Are you trying to screw me over?

67
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,360
How can you bring an infant here!

68
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,770
I'm sorry.

69
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,840
Give the baby to him now.

70
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,880
You should just stay home and raise the child. Starting from tomorrow, don't come to work!

71
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,690
Let's go back to work.

72
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,600
What do you mean you can't register her birth when the baby is right here?

73
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,600
I'm this child's father. Her father.

74
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,720
According to the law, birth outside of a marriage

75
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,670
can only be registered by the mother. How many times do I have to tell you this?

76
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,380
Doesn't the child have a mom?

77
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,830
I'm telling you that the mother is dead.

78
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,460
The mom is no longer here!

79
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,430
Are you telling me I can't register my child because she doesn't have a mom?

80
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,950
What kind of absurd law is this! Do you think this makes any sense?

81
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,960
I'm Dan Dan's father!

82
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,000
The mother should at least have a name and identification number.

83
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,170
It's the law! It's not something within my control!

84
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:42,450
Frankly speaking, where is your evidence that you're the father?

85
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,290
What?

86
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,740
Evidence?

87
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,660
What evidence do I need when she's my daughter, you bastard!

88
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,610
Damn it! Let go!

89
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,640
Say it again! Evidence? You bastard!

90
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,840
- Please calm down. Let's go out and speak.
- Don't touch me!

91
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,850
What did you just say? Evidence?

92
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,300
Dan Dan's my daughter! She is my daughter!

93
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,150
- Seriously can't believe there is a person like that.
- Please calm down.

94
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,170
I'm telling you that Dan Dan's my daughter!

95
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:13,580
My daughter! She's my daughter, you bastard!

96
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,640
Let go. Let me go, you bastards! Let go! Let me go!

I...

117
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,330
How about we exchange a bite, Dan Dan?

118
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,850
No thanks. I won't eat something you ate.

119
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,410
What is that? It's Big Bang! Big Bang!

120

Big Bang! Where? Where?

00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,440
Where?

122
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,090
You...

123
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,570
I was just going to take a bite,

124
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,910
but I don't know what happened.

125
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,630
You should've just gave me a bite when I asked.

126
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,180
Then I would've eaten one bite.

127
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,900
Hey. You're dead! Come here.

128
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,120
Come here!

129
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,550
It hurts! It hurts! You better let go!

130
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,090
Don't you have a conscience, Mom?

131
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:37,870
The 10 million won you borrowed the other time. Your son-in-law took a loan for you!

132
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:42,240
But how can you ask him to be your guarantor when you didn't even pay that back yet?

133
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,100
It hasn't even been a year since we cleared the title on this house!

134
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,980
I'm in dire need. That's why I'm asking for.

135
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,630
Why do you want to open a business at your age, Mom?

136
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:57,740
Also, tell Cha Geon that he should quit soccer that he's not good at and get a part-time job!

137
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:02,820
You shouldn't say that just because he isn't your son.

138
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,860
He's your one and only younger brother!

139
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:11,650
You can't support him to become a national player, but how can you say he should quit it when he doesn't know anything but soccer?

140
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,030
How can you say that when you're his only older sister?

141
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,510
I don't know. Geon's your son, not mine.

142
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,950
You take care of it.

143
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:24,550
I wouldn't have to face this embarrassment if only my husband was still alive.

Dae Beom ate all my ice cream!

160
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:26,050
What? You beat your older brother this much all because of an ice cream?

161
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:31,050
Hey! How can you call your older brother by his first name?

162
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,730
How did you raise your children?

163
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:39,720
Don't you ever call your older brother by his first name ever again, Park Dan Dan!

164
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,240
What's wrong? What's going on?

165
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,550
I don't know. Just because he ate her ice cream,

166
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,940
she hit him and gave him a nose bleed.

167
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,970
What? Dan Dan!

168
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,980
Why is everyone taking it out on me?

169
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,960
Dan Dan! Park Dan Dan!

170
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,690
Why did you have to eat her ice cream and cause this ruckus?

171
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,490
Why would you eat hers when you're the older one?

172
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,890
Why are you giving him a flick when he's already upset with the nosebleed?

173
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:17,410
Noona. What's going on?

174
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:21,430
Did you get beat by Dan Dan, Park Dae Beom?

175
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:27,010
Mom always sides with Dae Beom.

176
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,420
So shouldn't you side with me?

177
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,520
But why do you always side with Dae Beom, not me?

178
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,670
You're saying nonsense again.

179
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,140
You're my Dad.

180
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,970
You're the one who earns the money. But Mom only gives the chicken drumsticks to Dae Beom.

181
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,810
I like drumsticks, too.

182
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,870
I got it.

183
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,730
I'll tell your Mom to be fair

184
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:00,860
and give the drumsticks to you as well from now on.

185
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,320
Is that good?

186
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,010
Dan Dan.

187
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:13,580
We are one family so there are no sides in a family.

188
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,570
Then your Mom will be sad.

189
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:22,130
You don't understand how I feel.

190
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,940
Is my Dan Dan going through puberty?

191
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,930
Why are you acting up?

192
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,700
Dad.

193
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:39,260
About my birth mom... Is she really dead?

194
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:47,120
By any chance, are you lying to me because you're scared I'll leave you for her?

195
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,930
Park Dan Dan. I told you so many times that she's dead.

196
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:55,140
Then at least show me a picture of her.

197
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,360
I want to at least know my mother's face.

198
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,330
I told you that our old house caught on fire and everything burned away.

199
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,400
You're lying to me! How does that make sense?

200
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,090
Are you okay, kiddo?

201
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,700
Did you get hurt?

202
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:02,020
I'm okay. I'm fine.

203
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,530
What the?

204
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:07,140
It's bleeding!

205
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,170
It's done. You'll be fine now.

206
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,860
It's a relief that this was all.

207
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:28,120
Hey, kiddo. How can you just run without looking at the front?

208
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,420
It would've been bad if it was a car.

209
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,220
I'm sorry.

210
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:38,650
I'm not a kiddo. I'm a 13-year-old lady.

211
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,680
Okay.

212
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,920
Excuse me, lady. Please look where you're going from now on.

213
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,960
Okay?

214
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,340
Where do you live?

215
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,420
Is it around here? I'll give you a ride since you're injured.

216
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:56,470
Don't worry about me. Just go on your own...

217
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,870
See... I told you it'll hurt.

218
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,620
Which side do you live?

219
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,100
This side or that?

220
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,860
I'm not going home. I ran away from it.

221
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:12,170
So stop mention home.

222
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:15,460
Hey, kiddo. Did you run away from home?

223
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,370
It's none of your business. Why do you want to know?

224
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:23,110
Also, why do you keep calling me a kiddo?

225
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,430
Hello? Is this the police station?

226
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,780
There is a runaway kid...

227
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,490
I mean, there is a runaway youth that I would like to report.

228
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,590
Don't. Please don't.

229
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,340
- Yes.
- Please, don't do it!

230
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,760
- Please come here quickly!
- I said don't do it!

231
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,610
Are you okay?

232
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,670
Does it hurt a lot?

233
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:50,810
I'm sorry. I was joking.

234
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:55,420
Joking? You didn't call the police station then?

235
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,010
It's because you didn't want to go home.

236
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,230
So tell me where you live.

237
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:03,900
If you don't, then I will really call the police station.

238
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,120
Seriously, who are you?

239
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,280
Me?

240
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,230
I'm a soldier protecting this country.

241
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,680
Is it here?

242
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,450
Is this the right place?

243
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,270
I thought it was here but I guess not.

244
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,410
I think it's that side.

245
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:48,800
That side...

246
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,880
So it's not here too?

247
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,490
Fine. Hold on tight.

248
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,330
Step on it.

249
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,870
Let's go fast!

250
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:11,490
So it's not here too?

251
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,490
You're doing this on purpose, right?

252
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,430
Do you know how many times we have circled this neighborhood?

253
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,070
Are you training a dog?

254
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,270
What am I suppose to do when I don't know?

255
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:27,990
That's why I told you to mind your own business and go your own way.

256
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,430
I guess we can't help it. It's time to call the police station for real.

257
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,560
Fine. Hold on.

258
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:41,280
I might be able to remember if I play a round of whack a mole.

259
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,700
You can just play it.

260
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,140
Look how I do it.

261
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,440
Like this?

262
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:19,840
Like this? Like this?

263
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,080
Like this? Like this?

264
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,090
It's pretty fun!

265
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,020
Stop!

266
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,560
Is it here? Are you sure?

267
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,780
Yes. It's here.

268
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,260
Thank you for today.

269
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:52,590
I'm feeling better because you gave me a ride on the bike and let me play rounds of whack a mole.

270
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:55,610
Go on in. Your parents must be worried.

271
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,650
Okay.

272
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,620
Oh, wait!

273
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,450
Ahjussi! Ahjussi!

274
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,980
- Yes?
- What's your name?

275
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,150
Why do you want to know?

276
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:26,300
You're so cheap. What's wrong with telling me your name?

277
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:31,470
But that ahjussi is so cool.

278
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:37,840
It's strange. Why do I get the feeling I'm going to see him again in the future?

279
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,350
I'm heading out for work!

280
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,470
You're going to leave without eating breakfast, Dad?

281
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,960
Yeah.

282
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,700
Just eat a bite, Honey. I made your favorite pollack soup.

283
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,180
I don't have time. I got an urgent call.

284
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,800
Urgent call? What's that?

285
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,940
I think an urgent meeting was scheduled.

286
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,890
Hold on, Dad.

287
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:46,650
At least eat an egg roll, Dad.

288
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:51,570
Thank you, my daughter. I'll head out now!

289
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,570
Bye.

290
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:02,040
I think Dad has too much work these days, Mom.

291
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,810
I know. Oh, my head.

292
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:10,660
What's wrong, Mom? Do you have a cold? Should I go out and get medicine?

293
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,860
What? It's nothing.

294
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,780
Hurry up and eat breakfast, so you can head out.

295
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,580
What about you?

296
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:22,260
I don't feel like eating right now, so go ahead and eat for yourself.

297
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:38,730
Goodness, my life. I can't believe you're snoring and sleeping so peacefully.

298
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:42,020
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

299
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,520
What now?

300
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,580
What now? What now? Are you seriously saying that?

301
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,450
What are you going to do? What are you going to do now?

302
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,120
Did you look into it?

303
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,070
Are you sure you can't get any back?

304
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,740
I don't know.

305
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:00,140
What are we suppose to do?

306
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,070
I must've been possessed by a ghost or something.

307
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:08,410
Those bastards. How can they scam people that there's a treasure ship under the ocean?

308
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,280
What are we going to do now?

309
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,310
If your father and Dan Dan find out we lost all the deposit for this house...

310
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,070
Do something.

311
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:21,330
Find a solution! How can you be sleeping like this!

312
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,660
I don't have a solution as well!

313
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,480
They already arrested the treasure ship guy for fraud.

314
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,820
We need to fill this house's deposit back before your father figures it out.

315
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,670
Do something!

316
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:37,020
What am I suppose to do when there is no solution?

317
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,190
Should I sell my organs or something?

318
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:43,720
You crazy bastard. I told you something was off in the first place!

00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,490
Mom.You should get your words straight.

320
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:51,460
I said, let's just invest ten million won that we have,

321
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:57,930
but you're the one who said we should take this house's deposit out and turn it into paying rent monthly.

322
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:06,740
You and I should go to the Han River and die.

323
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,580
My goodness!

324
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,160
- Aigo...
- You...

325
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,680
Did you cause another trouble, Park Dae Beom?

326
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,570
What trouble?

327
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:20,520
I think I heard something about dying in the Han River.

328
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,610
Why would you want to go die in the Han River?

329
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:29,280
By any chance, did you cause another money trouble?

330
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,350
Money trouble?

331
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:37,680
I just said let's die together because I was upset that he kept drinking.

332
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,560
You sure live life comfortably.

333
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:45,260
How can you just drink all the time in a world where you may or may not make it even when you work hard?

334
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:49,500
When our elderly Father is working without even having breakfast!

335
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,170
Mom, can you shut her mouth--

336
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:55,080
Did I say something wrong?

337
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,950
If I were you, I would at least do delivery work.

338

Goodness, my head! My head!

341
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,150
Did you not hire a driver yet?

342
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:20,100
We interviewed some people, but since it'll be a live-in driver,

343
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,170
the Chairman didn't like them all.

344
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:26,720
I can interview people. This is so uncomfortable!

345
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,750
Hurry up and hire someone! Also, send Driver Kim to the department store.

346
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,690
What's wrong?

347
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:08,690
About your nose.

348
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:11,680
- My nose?
- You got your nose done, right?

349
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,000
Goodness. What's wrong with you?

350
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,740
No. Don't get me wrong. It's done so beautifully.

351
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,690
Where did you get your nose done?

Excuse me, patient. Ma'am!

Mom! Do you recognize me, Mom?

Do you?

361
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,620
Why are you here, Se Ryun?

362
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:10,120
- Let me take a look at the patient.
- Okay.

363
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,310
- How many are there?
- One.

364
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,400
What about this?

365
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,630
Three. What's wrong? Where am I?

You can leave now. It's all good.

- Wait.

Wait...

00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:30,220
Where am I?

370
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:33,990
You almost died because you couldn't wake up from the anesthesia for your nose job!

371
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,900
And this is an emergency room!

372
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:45,860
Did you call your brother?

373
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:51,250
Oppa. Oppa. Over here!

374
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:55,040
Why did you call your brother?

375
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:01,320
Why did you come here when you must be busy with the company?

376
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:07,070
It's nothing. I can't believe I'm in the emergency center. I would've woke up when it was time.

377
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,730
Mom.

378
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:12,820
Do you think the Doctors had nothing better to do to call an ambulance for you if it was nothing?

379
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,810
You almost died, Mom!

380
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:20,160
I just asked for a slight touch up for my nose.

381
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:26,050
I guess the anesthesia was too strong.

382
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:31,580
Since you seem fine, I'll get going since I have some work to do.

383
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:36,130
Sure, you should go, Oppa.

He wouldn't have left if I was his Mom!

386
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:48,210
He only thinks of me as his Father's second wife! That rude bastard.

387
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:51,860
He still came here because he was worried about you.

388
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,970
Do you really think he came here because he was worried about me?

389
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:57,210
He came to check if I was dead!

390
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:01,990
People are going to hear you, Mom!

391
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,100
He wasn't this cold when his wife was alive.

392
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,790
Why? Does it hurt?

393
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,870
It hurts.

Chief Jo, what should we do for dinner?

For dinner, we planned to do steamed abalone, salad, and abalone porridge.

The organic abalone that was supposed to arrive today

will come next week instead because the weather was bad.

Is that so?

Please prepare Se Jong's snack that I made earlier.

415

Se Jong said he wants to eat Ddukbokki.

Why don't we put some ramen and fishcakes in it--

Kids shouldn't eat something too salty like that.

Why? You don't like that I came?

I never said that.

Se Jong, we need to hold hands.

I am not a baby anymore.

432
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:37,200
So, we don't have to hold hands anymore.

433
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,800
Of course, Se Jong is no longer a baby.

434

Se Jong, be careful!

435

You have to be careful of the car!

436

I was already watching out.

437
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,680
I said, I'm not a baby!

438
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:21,910
Se Jong! Why don't you eat some more?

439
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:29,990
Se Jong, did you take out the carrots out of your sandwich?

440
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:32,960
I guess Se Jong didn't want to eat it today.

441
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,280
- Why don't you go upstairs?
- Can you stay out of this?

442
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,560
Se Jong, you can't toss away the carrots.

443
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,840
Carrots are very good for you.

444
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:48,580
But I don't like carrots.

445
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,780
Let's have a little bit at least.

446
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:56,690
Then you will have better immune system and good eyesight.

447
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:02,320
If it is that good, then you should eat a lot of it!

448
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,950
I said I don't want it!

449
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:06,240
Why do you keep telling me to eat it?

450
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,060
Why? I don't want to eat it!

451
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:15,800
The carrot soup smells like poop!

452
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,750
Oh, Se Jong!

453
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:24,820
Why did you make Se Jong cry?

454
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,300
Noona!

455
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:32,410
Chief Jo, explain it to me.

456
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:37,530
Se Jong said he didn't want carrots and was secretly getting rid of them.

457
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,870
He is being picky and not eating a variety of foods.

458
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:44,260
When I was young I also didn't eat carrots and hated broccoli.

459
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:47,080
But our Mom never forced me to eat it.

460
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,720
Even our Mom did not scold Se Jong,

461
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,960
but why are you punishing him?

462
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,330
Who do you think you are, Director Jo?

463
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:56,780
I didn't scold him.

464
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:02,440
To be healthy, you need to fix being picky eater.

465
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:07,750
Chief Jo! From now on, if Se Jong says he doesn't want to eat it, then don't force him to eat it.

466
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:10,770
Do you understand?

467
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,270
Jenny, eating habits are important as a child.

468
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:17,670
You just do what I say! Why is there so many nagging?

469
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:22,050
Please do what I say from now on, okay!

470
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:24,350
Lee Jenny!

471
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,860
Why are you so rude to Chief Jo?

472
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:33,480
She is still an adult!

473
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,670

00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,640

475
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,890
Who said a student can have that on your lips?

476
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:53,410
Is it good now?

477
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:56,150
Lee Jenny! Stop right there!

478
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,450

479
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:05,360
Noona these days is a poisonous snake, snake, bites whoever!
 [T/N: He is trying to rap.]

480
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,960
Se Chan, what's wrong with your clothes right now?

481
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,380
Wear something neat, okay?

482
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:21,470
I heard it from outside, but it's nothing! Why are you scolding your children?

483
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:27,700
They don't have their Mom, so they become discouraged and quiet these days.

484
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:32,290
That rude bastard!

485
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,430
Mom...I am leaving.

486
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,940
Why are you leaving when you just came here?

487
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,500
Why don't you sleep here tonight and have dinner as well?

488
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,490
I have a dinner plan.

489
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,990
Mrs. Yeoju, I'll get going.

490
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:46,680
Chief Jo, don't work too hard.

491
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,800
Okay, good bye.

492
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,200
- Mom, I'll get going!
- Hey!

493
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,980
Who are you having dinner with? Is it Ji Sup?

494
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,450
Mom! Ji Sup is from long ago.

495
00:38:56,450 --> 00:39:00,420
Hey, tell me!

496
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:32,630
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

497
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:36,170
I was just thinking of Se Jong's health.

498
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:39,110
But I was overreacting.

499
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:44,980
Chief Jo...Just let the kids alone for the time being.

500
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:48,810
Yes, I will.

501
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:52,360
I know you are working hard.

502
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:57,630
Please endure the difficulty a bit more until we get a new tutor.

503
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:00,860
I can continue to work like this.

504
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:07,270
That's not how it should be. You already have a lot of work.

505
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,870
You can leave now.

506
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,280
Okay.

507
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,130
[Bloom English]

508
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:37,150
- Are you going to another part-time job?
- Yes, I will see you tomorrow.

509
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:40,840
- Teacher Park!
- Yes, Director?

510
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,250
Nothing. I'll see you tomorrow.

511
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:47,340
Okay, take care, Director!

512
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,510
What should I do?

513
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,000
Look at the mirror. Do you like it?

514
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,300
Yes!

515
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,120
- Isn't it pretty?
- Yes!

516
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,520
For this friend...

517
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,900
- This is pretty!
- This looks good on you.

518
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,910
I think this is just right instead of adding more.

519
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:15,030
I added more since we got more regulars, thanks to you. It's a bonus.

520
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:17,390
Thank you!

521
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:04,590
Oh, my goodness!

522
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:07,730
Are you okay?

523
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:11,710
- Is he dead?
- I think he got hurt a lot!

524
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:15,040
He stood up! Thank goodness!

525
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,020
Thank goodness.

526
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,270
Oh my god! Oh my god!

527
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,400
What a relief. I don't think he is hurt.

528
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,890
You're right. His ancestor must've been watching out for him.

529
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:27,970
I know! I was so scared.

530
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:31,590
Motorcycles are so dangerous and scary.

531
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,850
That is really a relief.

532
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:37,570
Did the person really say he was okay?

533
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:41,570
Yes, I think he got some minor injuries, but thank goodness it wasn't a big accident.

534
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:44,950
- I am sorry.
 - What a relief!

535
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,620
Oh, that's a relief.

536
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,640
Wait! Open the door, please!

537
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:13,730
Dad!

538
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,720
Dad, it is you, right?

539
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,430
Dad!

540
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:25,750
It is you!

541
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,590
Dad, what are you doing here?

542
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:32,510
What is this motorcycle?

543
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,470
Dan Dan, it is...

544
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:36,710
Dad, what is all this?!

545
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:40,840
You just almost died, Dad!

546
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:46,040
I'm okay.

547
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,690
I'm fine! I didn't get hurt anywhere.

548
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:51,120
I'm not going to die.

549
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,070
Dad!

550
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:02,670
Dan Dan.

551
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:04,350
Take a sip of this honey water.

552
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,140
It is warm. Drink now.

553
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:22,670
If you quit the company, you should have told me.

554
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:26,360
Were you lying to us all and working like this for 6 months?

555
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:31,180
Why are you doing this dangerous job, Dad?

556
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:33,650
I need to pay back our house deposit loan...

557
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:37,400
Why are you paying that debt alone when there are so many people in the house?

558
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,050
Why are you suffering alone like this?

559
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:45,440
Anyway, don't tell Mom for the time being. She is going to worry.

560
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,510
Okay.

561
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:53,160
Anyway, you got to quit this work today.

562
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,820
Okay?

563
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:01,100
Okay, I will do that.

564
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:07,700
Promise me that you will never do dangerous work like this anymore.

565
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,560
Okay.

566
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:13,100
I promise. I swear it!

567
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:21,410
Dae Bem's mom.

568
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:28,130
- Hello.
- How come you don't answer my phone?

569
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:32,190
Do you want to see someone die out of impatience?

570
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:34,010
My cell phone is broken.

571
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:36,050
Oh my...
 [My love, my son]

572
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:38,880
What is wrong with this?

573
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:44,160
Mom, the house owner just came by.

574
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,020
Don't call me!

575
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,470
So what are you going to do?

576
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:57,250
Your security is all gone since you didn't pay any monthly rent!

577
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:58,850
Can you let it slide just for the time being?

578
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:03,920
I have a situation right now. I'll pay the monthly rent no matter what.

579
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,630
Are you the only one with a situation?

580
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:07,760
I am having a harder time!

581
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,500
I'm going to rent it to someone else as a long-term housing lease.

582
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,010
I wish you can leave within this month.

583
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:14,700
Ahjummonie, Ahjummonie, please!

584
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:18,140
Ahjummonie, Ahjummonie!

585
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:25,920
Mom...What is all of this?

586
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,610
Wasn't our house on a long-term housing lease?

587
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:34,040
What do you mean by monthly rent?

588
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:38,500
Did you...?

589
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:43,750
The thing is...

590
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:47,230
The things is...

591
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,170
Father, I'm so sorry.

592
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:58,230
Mom has no fault.

593
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:00,430
The treasure ship...

594
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:02,320
I told her we should invest in the treasure ship.

595
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,710
I persuaded Mom, so this is what happened.

596
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:06,770
This is all my fault.

597
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:09,540
That isn't it. It was all my fault.

598
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:12,770
Dae Beom said we should discuss with you.

599
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:15,440
I thought you would disagree, so I stopped him.

600
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,910
I'm the one who took out our house deposit. I did it all.

601
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:23,350
They said it'll be ten times the investment money if we just invest for two years.

602
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:26,930
The house that Dae Beom and Geon lost five years ago...

603
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:30,580
I was trying to buy for you.

604
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:33,220
And that's how...

605
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:38,940
Even if you're ignorant,

606
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:42,540
how can you fall for this ridiculous scam?

607
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,100
Treasure ship?

608
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,520
It is something even an elementary student would laugh at.

609
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:51,420
And you threw away the lease money on something so stupid?

610
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:57,070
What are you going to do now? What are you going to do!

611
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:59,730
Dan Dan, you should stop now.

612
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:04,980
It already happened. As long as everyone is healthy and unharmed, it's okay.

613
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,990
We can always make more money.

614
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:11,420
Dad, is that something to say right now?

615
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:14,250
Our whole family is about to be out on the streets.

616
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:16,850
We might have to rent basement apartment.

617
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:19,080
You can just make money again?

618
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:22,350
Is that why you were doing such dangerous work and bringing money to Mom?

619
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:26,380
When all the hard work money you make is taken away by a scam?

620
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,940
Dan Dan, stop now.

621
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:31,830
What does that mean? What do you mean dangerous work?

622
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:35,260
Do you know what Dad is doing to make money?

623
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:39,450
Dad almost died in a motorcycle accident during a delivery!

624
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:42,790
Honey, what is she saying?

625
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:45,270
Dad, how long are you going to live like this?

626
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:47,670
You should just...

627
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:50,590
You should divorce. Just divorce!

628
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:52,840
Park Dan Dan!

629
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:58,800
Divorce? Is that something a daughter should say?

630
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,860
Why can't I say it? I don't want to see you living like this anymore.

631
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:06,260
So just divorce! Just do it!

632
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:08,640
Park Dan Dan!

633
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:14,980
How can you be ungrateful to your Mom, who raised you until now?

634
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,700
Are you saying I'm ungrateful to her?

635
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:26,540
Are you going to die just looking after Mom's family?

636
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:32,100
Do you like her even if we go broke and are about to be on the streets?

637
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:35,990
Is that why you abandoned my Mom?

638
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:38,200
Because you guys had an affair,

639
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:42,570
you kicked out my biological mother! That's why she died! I knew it all along!

640
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:46,480
T-That's not true. I am not that kind of person.

641
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,230
- Your mom...
- Dan Dan's mom!

642
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:59,100
How much did you hate my Mom

643
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:02,840
that you don't even have one photo?

644
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:09,810
Do you know what something I cannot forgive you for, Dad?

645
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:15,280
How can you not remember where you spread Mom's ashes?

646
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,320
How can you be like that?

647
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:21,300
Did you hate my Mom that much?

648
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:24,770
Then you should've dumped me as well since I'm the child of the woman you hate!

649
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:27,900
How difficult must it have been to raise me forcibly?

650
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,570
Fine! I will leave now!

651
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:33,920
Yes, leave! Leave now!

652
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,510
Father! What is wrong? Please don't be like this.

653
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:41,050
Hey! Park Dan Dan!

654
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:49,030
Father, please stop her.

655
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:51,890
Just let her leave!

656
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:57,380
Father... I am so sorry...

657
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:04,620
Dan Dan! Park Dan Dan!

658
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,680
Park Dan Dan!

659
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,980
Dan Dan!

660
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:20,370
Dan Dan! Park Dan Dan!

661
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:22,410
Park Dan Dan!

662
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:36,580
Father, I will return after I succeed.

663
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:47,100
I will succeed and pay back everything I have received from you until now.

664
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:03,090
Father, please stay healthy.

665
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:05,040
Dae Beom, what are you saying right now?

666
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,010
Are you saying you are leaving home too?

667
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,330
Dae Beom! Are you really going to leave?

668
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,080
Why are you like this too?

669
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,970
Mom, I feel guilt too.

670
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:23,560
Dan Dan left, so how can I stay home?

671
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:29,620
Mom, I will return after I succeed.

672
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:32,250
Don't be sick.

673
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:35,300
Dae Beom, no!

674
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:38,630
You have nowhere to go!

675
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:52,480
Did something happen?

676
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:58,190
Nothing.

677
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:03,200
The emptiness of the children's Mom is big.

678
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:09,280
It is because they are still young.

679
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:17,220
But from my perspective, you're more of a problem.

680
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:20,140
I know it is hard but get over it soon.

681
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:23,640
That way the children can be better.

682
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:31,610
Why don't you recommend one of your students to me?

683
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:34,540
Someone who is trustworthy.

684
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:42,100
It's difficult to find a live-in-tutor.

685
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:52,300
It wouldn't be easy since you have three kids and want them to be live-in-tutor, but I'll look around.

686
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:17,050
This is so delicious! So tasty!

687
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:20,590
Our Gook Hee also loves the scallion kimchi that you make.

688
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,440
The one you just made it fresh like this one.

689
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,110
Gook Hee didn't come in yet?

690
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:29,940
Yes. I guess she is having a drink with Chairman Lee Young Gook.

691
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,780
With Chairman Lee Young Gook?

692
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:35,120
Yes. They seem to be seeing each other often these days.

693
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,790
I hope she does not just come in today.

694
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:41,340
Let the two build the Great Wall of China...

695
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:46,990
Chairman Lee Young Gook and Gook Hee are just friends.

696
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:49,970
They are friends, but they are a woman and a man.

697
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:54,350
If they just crossed a line, they'd become "honey, sweetheart."

698
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:57,710
But our Gook Hee is too old-fashioned to cross that line.

699
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:01,740
My dream is to see our Gook Hee

700
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:05,720
spending a night with Chairman Lee.

701
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,240
Hey.

702
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:10,840
Do you think that is possible when they have been friends for more than 20 years?

703
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,100
That's why I keep trying to make it happen.

704
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:16,860
Hoping for them to cross that line.

705
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,410
Where's your daughter?

706
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:20,150
She hasn't left work yet.

707
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,430
Their live-in-tutor quit,

708
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:27,600
so she's coming home late these days to put their youngest son, Se Jong, to bed.

709
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,110
I will tell Gook Hee

710
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:34,870
to tell Chairman Lee to give Sarah a big bonus.

711
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:37,800
She works so hard.

712
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,510
Hey, hey! Hey.

713
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:54,440
Why did you come home so early?

714
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,510
You said you were going to have a drink with Chairman Lee Young Gook!

715
00:55:57,510 --> 00:56:00,180
He has kids. He need to take care of them.

716
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:03,450
They have many helpers in that house!

717
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:07,740
You should have drunk a lot with him and slept with him tonight.

718
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:11,290
Unni. Don't talk like that.

719
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:14,270
I'm friends with Young Gook. Friends.

720
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:17,180
You shouldn't just ignore my words.

721
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:20,710
The moment when you turn 40, you wouldn't even get any arrangements for prospective marriage.

722
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,370
There are only divorcees and single fathers with children.

723
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:25,450
I do find it worrisome that he has three children,

724
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:29,020
but for you, there's no one better than Chairman Lee Young Gook.

725
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,720
Unni. Get out. I want to wash and sleep.

726
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:36,360
I mean, but why does he have not just one, nor two, but three kids?

727
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,120
Unni!

728
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:42,140
Alright! Fine, you brat.

729
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:44,220
Mom, you were here! I'm leaving now.

730
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,850
Auntie, take care of my Mom.

731
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:49,540
- Sure. When am I going to see you again? Visit often.
- Alright.

732
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:56,130
My handsome son. When are you going to finish the hard studying and becoming a doctor?

733
00:56:56,130 --> 00:57:02,450
Joon Oh. Should I rent an apartment in front of your school and live together?

734
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:05,160
Auntie! Can you please stop my Mom?

735
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,850
- Just go.
- I'll get going.

736
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:08,010
Go, hurry up and go.

737
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:11,770
Son! Son, my son!

738
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:18,470
Mom! You promised me that you were not going to set me up on blind dates anymore!

739
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:22,000
I said I'm going to be the wife of FT Group's Chairman.

740
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,470
Chairman Lee might be a single father with three kids,

741
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:30,900
but do you think a Chairman of a large company will even consider his worker at home for his partner?

742
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:35,820
Stop thinking about an unattainable dream. He's not even considering you!

743
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:39,280
I'll figure it out, Mom! Don't mind my business.

744
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:43,400
Gook Hee and Mi Sook are...

745
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,820
They're drooling over Chairman Lee right now!

746
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:50,430
Hey. She's a university professor. If she decided to throw herself at him,

747
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:52,930
do you think he'll even give a glance at you?

748
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:57,630
Mom. Gook Hee's still an orphan who got adopted anyways.

749
00:57:57,630 --> 00:57:59,620
Hey!

750
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:05,320
You! I told you not to say that!

751
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:10,590
Mi Sook raised Gook Hee more preciously than her own sibling she lost!

752
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:13,590
If you keep saying that around, then we'll get kicked out of this house!

753
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:17,590
What I'm saying is, I've got nothing less than Gook Hee.

754
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:20,950
Also, if there was anything between the Chairman and Gook Hee, it would've happened a long time ago.

755
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:23,290
You should hope for what you can attain!

756
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:26,800
You're basically mooching off this house because you don't have a place to live.

757
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,950
If you keep looking at a tree you can't climb up will tear your legs!

758
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:34,390
I'm going to climb up even if my legs do rip,

759
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:37,630
so don't say things like that again, okay?

760
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:43,610

I've been trying to tell you this couple of times.

I'll try my best to pay your unpaid paychecks in the future.
