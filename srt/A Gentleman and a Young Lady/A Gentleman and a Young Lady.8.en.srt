[Episode 8]

2
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,300
Well...

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,980
It's nothing much.

4
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,320
That surprised me! Jenny, run!

5
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:20,170
What...what happened?

6
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,350
Ms. Park, don't get me wrong.

7
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,340
I thought it was Jenny's hand.

8
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,600
I thought Jenny might be scared, so I definitely grabbed her hand, but...

9
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,720
How did this get changed?

10
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,360
No, I'm sorry, Chairman!

11
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,330
The ghost appeared out of nowhere, so I was surprised and grabbed it, thinking it was Jenny's hand.

12
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,670
I really didn't know it was your hand as well, Chairman.

13
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,360
I really didn't know.

14
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,330
Still, you weren't scared because I held your hand, right?

15
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,880
I'm sorry?

16
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,220
Yes, yes.

17
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,970
But, where's Jenny?

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,360
Oh, I think the children are outside.

19
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,920
Jenny!

20
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,130
But why did I ask her, "You weren't scared because I held your hand?"

21
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,370
What a useless question...

22
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,970
If you're tired, you can sleep.

23
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,760
You must be tired since we all played so much today.

24
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,580
No, I'm alright.

25
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,560
It was a really fun day with the kids for the first time in a long while.

26
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,140
It's all thanks to you, Ms. Park.

27
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,660
Thank you.

28
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,470
I didn't do much.

29
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,700
The kids prepared this today to cheer you up.

30
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,230
I just happened to come along.

31
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,400
Still, I'm very happy.

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,160
I had fun as well,

33
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,680
but I never imagined the kids would enjoy it so much too.

34
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,960
I think I should go more often with them before the kids grow up.

35
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,560
Ms. Park, let's all go again next time.

36
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:11,850
Okay. I had lots of fun too.

37
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:20,470
But, did you resolve your family's problem?

38
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,230
Yes!

39
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,480
That's a relief.

40
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:34,240
Se Jong worries a lot about you leaving, Ms. Park.

41
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,210
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,700
It's nothing to be sorry about.

43
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,640
My children seem to like you a lot, Ms. Park.

44
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,910
Since seeing them preparing such an event with their allowance, too.

45
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,020
Ms. Park.

46
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,400
I'm hoping you'll stay with us for a long time.

47
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,910
Yes. Thank you.

48
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:27,270
Children, we're home! Se Jong!

49
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:36,750
Is that girl really my daughter, Dan Dan?

50
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,460
Is she?

51
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,760
Hello?

52
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,990
The picture you sent me just now.

53
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:11,030
Is it really Park Dan Dan, daughter of Park Soo Chul?

54
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,000
Are you sure?

55
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,030
Yes, she's Park Dan Dan, daughter of Park Soo Chul.

56
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,470
Yes, I'm certain.

57
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes, okay.

58
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,810
Thank you. Thank you.

59
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,880
Dan Dan...Dan Dan...

60
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,530
This can't be true...

61
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:55,600
How can this happen? I can't believe it...

62
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,780
Who is she?

63
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,200
Ah, she's our teacher!

64
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,190
Hello! Nice to meet you.

65
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,490
No, it's okay. I can carry these alone.

66
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,990
I'll take this, at least.

67
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,570
Back then...

68
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,440
Back then, the two definitely acted like they didn't know each other.

69
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,040
As if they're strangers.

70
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,910
Why?

71
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,490
Why would they treat each other like strangers when they're definitely father and daughter?

72
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,080
Why would they do that?

73
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,580
What did you do to our daughter?

74
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,770
Why is she living like that?

75
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:18,580
Why did you leave Dan Dan in someone else's house alone? Why!

76
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,500
Did you abandon her because you hate me?

77
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,090
Is that what you did? Is that it?

78
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,930
I'm asking you if that's true!

79
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,370
Why!

80
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,410
You're the one who abandoned Dan Dan.

81
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,390
You abandoned her!

82
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,160
You're the one who ran away, leaving that infant behind.

83
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,810
How dare you come to this place!

84
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,100
Do you have the right to say that?

85
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,750
Do you? Do you!

86
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:13,430
Right, I'll figure out on my own why Dan Dan is living like that.

87
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,260
I'll do it on my own.

88
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,910
How are you all coming home together, Chairman?

89
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:30,380
Did you run into each other in front of the house?

90
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:37,530
Chairman, what's on your head?

91
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,600
I've just come back from the amusement park with the kids.

92
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,080
Apparently, everyone needs to wear these at amusement parks.

93
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,400
Amusement park? Did you go there, Chairman?

94
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,960
Yes! Today was so, so, so much fun!

95
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,100
Was it that fun? Se Jong, you're very excited.

96
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,310
I didn't know that and wondered if Ms. Park had taken the kids to see movies.

97
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:11,430
But Chairman, the headband suits you so well.

98
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,580
Everyone seemed to walk around with this on at the amusement park.

99
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,580
- Can I take this off now, kids?
- Yes!

100
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,550
Ms. Park, you must be tired. Go upstairs and have some rest.

101
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,060
Children, go upstairs, wash, and sleep. Alright?

102
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,010
Okay!

103
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,150
Let's go.

104
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,930
I'll go into my room as well.

105
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,590
Thank you, Chief Jo.

106
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:58,620
Chairman, the children look so much brighter.

107
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,410
I think it was a great idea for you to go to the amusement park today.

108
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,320
Right?

109
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,600
It's been some time since I saw them so happy as well.

110
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,790
Why didn't I think of taking them to the amusement park sooner?

111
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,500
You can go more often from now on.

112
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,120
But the amusement park...

113
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,910
Was it Ms. Park's idea?

114
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:25,750
It wasn't Ms. Park. It was the children's idea.

115
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,110
The children's idea?

116
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,630
Was it Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong's idea?

117
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,520
The children thought Ms. Park looked down these days,

118
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,430
so they gathered up their allowance to cheer her up, all in secret by themselves.

119
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,470
I happened to see them leaving to get on the subway and joined as a driver.

120
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,810
Ah, I see.

121
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,210
After what I saw today,

122
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,590
I feel like I can truly trust the kids with Ms. Park.

123
00:10:54,590 --> 00:11:01,300
I think the bond and trust between the children and Ms. Park are very strong.

124
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:06,110
Ah, I see.

125
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:10,050
But Chief Jo, were you unable to go home because of us?

126
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,250
It's very late. You can go home.

127
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,410
Yes, Chairman.

128
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:22,250
The flowers are pretty today. They smell good too.

129
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,760
Chief Jo, thank you always.

130
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,830
And next time, you should come with us, Chief Jo.

131
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,390
You've worked hard.

132
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,080
Okay, good night.

133
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:51,950
Today was so, so, so much fun!

134
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:57,030
Was it that fun? Se Jong, you're very excited.

135
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:02,290
But Chairman, the headband suits you so well.

136
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:06,640
Everyone seemed to walk around with this on at the amusement park.

137
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:11,370
The more I think about it, the more offending it is!

138
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:16,850
Ms. Park, why does she keep annoying me?

139
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,040
The flowers are pretty today.

140
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,050
They smell good too.

141
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,500
Chief Jo, thank you always.

142
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,630
And next time, you should come with us, Chief Jo.

143
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,120
You've worked hard.

144
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,610
Right. The Chairman knows I'm an important person,

145
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,570
and I can see my Se Jong every day.

146
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,980
Fine. I'll slowly become someone more important.

147
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,460
To the point, the house can't run without me.

148
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,060
My son...

149
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:13,120
How did I end up running holding the Chairman's hand?

150
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,490
I'm an idiot.

151
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,150
The Chairman wouldn't think weirdly of me, would he?

152
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:25,760
But the Chairman, the more I know him,

153
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,990
he's a gentleman and cool.

154
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,070
Everyone, come get your breakfast!

155
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:40,290
Hey, you. Get up and eat!

156
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,580
I'm not going to eat.

157
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,010
Why aren't you coming out?

158
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,820
The soup's getting cold!

159
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,620
Dae Beom doesn't want to eat.

160
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,860
- What?
- Let's go out, Mom.

161
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,370
Dae Beom, your mom made your favorite stir-fried pork and rolled omelet.

162
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,330
And, she also made beansprout soup for your hangover.

163
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,860
So why don't you come out? Come out and eat.

164
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,150
You must be hungry since you didn't eat last night as well. So come out soon, okay?

165
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:10,070
He says he doesn't want to eat. Leave him alone, Mom.

166
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:14,230
Right, he did embarrass himself as a man.

167
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:18,420
He would be so shameless if he could eat food.

168
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,180
Mom, think of how embarrassed Dae Beom is even to skip the meal.

169
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:28,310
He used to jump out of bed in sleep when he heard "stir-fried pork."

170
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:32,140
Aigoo, Dae Beom, so why did you do that?

171
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:36,980
As a man, you could've gone on Antarctic exploration on a raft.

172
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,140
But how could you stick to a rich, older woman for money?

173
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,780
Dae Beom, you shouldn't do that kind of thing ever again.

174
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,770
I'm begging you with my sincerity.

175
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,870
Okay?

176
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,980
Grandma, I'm not going to eat, so please leave now.

177
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,260
I'm begging you, please.

178
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,210
This is all my fault. It's all my fault!

179
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,280
If I were rich,

180
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,990
Dae Beom wouldn't have done that.

181
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:10,670
- It's all my fault!
- I said I'm not going to eat.

182
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,300
I'm not going to eat!

183
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,740
What is he doing?

184
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,480
- Is he gone mad?
- Let's go out, Mom!

185
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,670
I can't live because of him!

186
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,470
That crazy bastard.

187
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,120
What's going on?

188
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,800
Leave him alone. Dae Beom doesn't want to eat.

189
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,430
Hey! What did you do so great to skip the meal?

190
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:37,120
- If you're going to act this way, get out and die. Get out!
- Stop it, honey.

191
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,670
Just leave Dae Beom alone for now.

192
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,790
It's upsetting me so much.

193
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,440
I'm acting this way because it makes me rage inside!

194
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,200
Hey, you should just listen to your husband.

195
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,600
What are you going to do? I'll take care of Dae Beom's food later.

196
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,730
Let's eat. Please eat, Son-in-law Park.

197
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,070
Yes, please eat, mother-in-law.

198
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,380
Honey, I'm starting a new job today.

199
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,850
What? Already?

200
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,300
What kind of job did you get?

201
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,960
The Hyungnim who took care of our moving boxes asked me to look after his office for a bit.

202
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,540
So I've decided to work there until I get another job.

203
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,060
Oh, my gosh, that's such good news!

204
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,980
You're very talented!

205
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,340
You immediately got a job!

206
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,820
Yeon Sil, you have a great husband.

207
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,890
I'm going to work from this afternoon too!

208
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,320
Really? To where?

209
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,610
Where?

210
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,980
I'll say it's a food-related job.

211
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,660
I'll tell you the details later, Mom.

212
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,980
I'll work hard on my part-time job and study hard as well, Grandma.

213
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,460
Oh, yes.

214
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,090
Son-in-law Park will be working, and Geon will be working.

215
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:48,390
And Mi Rim is going to work while learning hairstylist skills.

216
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,330
It looks like we're going to be rich soon!

217
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,320
Alright, alright. Let's all eat well,

218
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,030
and work really hard

219
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,690
and become rich~!

220
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,040
Yes, yes!

221
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,280
- Enjoy the food, mother-in-law.
- Honey, try this!

222
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,980
- Thank you for the food!
- Have some stir-fried pork.

223
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,260
That's right. Wang Dae Ran.

224
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,030
That's right! She's the "Big Egg!"
 [T/N: Big Egg is a nickname derived from Wang Dae Ran's name sound.]

225
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,050
I knew I'd seen her somewhere.

226
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:34,280
She's the daughter of the woman who took my mom's private fund money, the one who lived in the blue-gated house!

227
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,550
Wow, what kind of coincidence is this?

228
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,890
What a coincidence!

229
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,620
That's right!

230
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
She's Gi Ja.

231
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,560
I knew I'd seen her somewhere.

232
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:59,130
When I was in middle school, she was the girl who lived in the red-gated house at the end of the street.

233
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,190
Chief Jo. The coffee smells nice.

234
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,360
Should I get you one, Madam?

235
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,880
I'm okay with coffee, but can you get me a hot date tea?

236
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,710
Okay.

237
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:21,420
Chief Jo. What is your mother's name?

238
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,360
My mother?

239
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,020
It's Lee. Gi. Ja. Lee Gi Ja.

240
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,450
Lee Gi Ja?

241
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:38,270
- Who is it?
 - It's me, Chief Jo's mom, Lee Gi Ja.

242
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,850
Chief Jo. It's your mom.

243
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:43,260
My mom?

244
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:47,200
Why is my mom here?

245
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,330
I'm tired, so I'm going to have some rest.

246
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:54,990
So tell your mom she doesn't need to say hello to me.

247
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:01,220
Chief Jo's mom is Gi Ja?!

248
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,010
What kind of coincidence is this?

249
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:07,950
She wouldn't recognize me, would she?

250
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:11,510
That's right. Even if I recognize her,

251
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,660
she won't recognize me.

252
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:17,610
That's right. Since then, I've had work on my eyes and nose.

253
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:23,120
Also, it's been a long time!

254
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:30,480
Oh my! Chief Jo's mother.

255
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,270
You didn't have to say hello to me. You can just go do what you are here for.

256
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:39,330
Wang Dae Ran! You're the Big Egg, right?

257
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:44,040
- I'm sorry?
- You are Wang Dae Ran! Hey!

258
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,460
It's me, Gi Ja! Lee Gi Ja!

259
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,800
Gi Ja? The one who lived in the red-gated house?

260
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,190
Yes! Lee Gi Ja from the red-gated house!

261
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:04,230
Your mom fled with the neighborhood's private fund money in the middle of the night!

262
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,720
- What?
- What I mean is...

263
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,510
I missed you so much when you suddenly disappeared!

264
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:17,040
Don't you remember coming over to my house and eating ramen together?

265
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,110
Dae Ran, how many years has it been?

266
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,570
It's been over forty years, right?

267
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:26,990
Wow, who knew you'd be doing this well.

268
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,710
It's so good to see you!

269
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:32,190
Do you want something to drink?

270
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:37,440
Sarah. Your Madam, Dae Ran, is my friend.

271
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,270
We lost touch in middle school.

272
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,940
We lost touch for so long,

273
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,140
so we didn't recognize each other.

274
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,480
Is that true, Madam?

275
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,360
Well... it seems like that...

276
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,200
Hey! Big Egg! How can you say it that way?

277
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,250
You lived in the blue-gated house! And I lived in the red-gated house!

278
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:05,170
Whenever we'd eat tteokbokki, you would eat two at a time, so I would only get one, you damn girl!

279
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:09,160
So we got in a big fight! Don't you remember that?

280
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:13,470
What? Yes, yes...

281
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:17,650
Look at you. You changed a lot.

282
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:21,570
You got pretty.

283
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:28,800
Wow, you became successful!

284
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,010
Oh, my goodness!

285
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,620
How could your mother and Madam be friends?

286
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,920
The world is so small!

287
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,850
I know. I was also surprised.

288
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:42,340
It sounds like Madam's nickname was Big Egg.

289
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,010
Whenever your mother called her "Egg,"

290
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:48,780
it was hard for me not to laugh!

291
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:56,480
Big Egg! It's so funny!

292
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:01,210
How's your mother? Is she still alive?

293
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,300
No. She passed away a while ago.

294
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,710
It's been over thirty years.

295
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,930
Really?

296
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,990
My mom also passed away a few years ago.

297
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:16,970
My mom used to talk a lot about the days of that red-gated house.

298
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,650
About your mom as well.

299
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,010
- Is that so?
- Yes.

300
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:25,120
She would say, "Egg's mom."

301
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,370
That's how I recognized you right away.

302
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:31,070
I was eating an egg this morning,

303
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,550
and then I remembered Big Egg!

304
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:38,290
Your childhood nickname popped in my head.

305
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:41,050
We used to say, "Egg is here!"

306
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:44,590
"Big and fresh, Big Egg is here!"

307
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,800
- Big Egg!
- This is driving me crazy.

308
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,100
I heard that I got into three years of misfortune this year. Now even a person like her is sticking to me!

309
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,130
Mrs. Yeo Ju! Are you still brewing the tea?

310
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:58,580
We can drink the tea slowly.

311
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,740
Hi, Hee Ju, what's going on?

312
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,540
You can't get ahold of Se Ryun?

313
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,910
Okay. I got it, thank you.

314
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,600
Chief Jo's Mom.

315
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,770
Why are you calling me like that?

316
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,990
Just call me by my name comfortably.

317
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,720
Okay. Gi Ja.

318
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,640
What are we going to do? It looks like I have to go see Se Ryun.

319
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,160
Why? Did something happen to your daughter?

320
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:35,210
Yes.

321
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,610
Okay. It's not like today's the only day we have to see each other.

322
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,670
We can see each other often like we used to.

323
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:44,050
I don't know what's going on but hurry and go.

324
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,260
Okay.

325
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,470
What is all this?

326
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:19,520
I think we can't see each other for a while.

327
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,910
To be honest, I need to earn money because my family got bankrupt,

328
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:26,680
so I don't have time to hang out with you.

329
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,440
I'll call you when I get a job.

330
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,540
That's right.

331
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:36,990
My Dae Beom isn't a playboy.

332
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,790
He's not a pretty player!

333
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:42,650
He's not a con man!

334
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,320
Hey! Lee Se Ryun! Why aren't you picking up your phone?

335
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,210
I thought something happened to you, and I almost got a heart attack--

336
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,450
Oh, my goodness. What is all this?

337
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,860
Did you drink all this alcohol by yourself?

338
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,540
Oh my goodness, you're crazy!

339
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,930
How long are you going to be like this?!

340
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:05,430
Mom! We were wrong.

341
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,070
It wasn't that.

342
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,880
What are you saying?

343
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,570
Are you still drunk?

344
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,910
You smell like alcohol. You're driving me crazy!

345
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:20,630
No, Mom. My Dae Beom is not a player.

346
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:24,000
He's not a con man. I thought about it again,

347
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,570
and I kissed him first! I did!

348
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,660
Oh my! What are you saying?

349
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,430
Get yourself together, Lee Se Ryun!

350
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,910
No, Mom.

351
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:38,100
It's really a coincidence about Driver Park.

352
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,000
My Dae Beom is not that kind of person.

353
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,710
To me...

354
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:47,860
He never lied to me once.

355
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:51,350
Oh my... you really...

356
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:56,540
You really must be crazy. You're driving me crazy.

357
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,760
This is nice.

358
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,650
Thank you.

359
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:06,320
It's good as I expected.

360
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:14,120
You said you have something to tell me.

361
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:17,130
What are you trying to scold me? Why are you hesitating?

362
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,830
What is it?

363
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:23,290
What's there for me to scold you about? You're doing more than great.

364
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:28,420
The thing is...

365
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,220
Living in a studio apartment by myself is a bit suffocating.

366
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,410
I also miss having home-cooked meals.

367
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:38,770
So I was wondering if I could stay at your house for some time.

368
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:41,150
Of course, you can.

369
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,480
I will tell Chief Jo,

370
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,580
so come to our place immediately today.

371
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:50,780
Okay. Thank you, Young Gook.

372
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,840
Are you that happy?

373
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,420
You always said no when I asked.

374
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,680
Anyway, I'm glad you decided to do that.

375
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:06,320
I thought someone younger in their fifties would come.

376
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,460
Yes, you're right. I'm in my fifties.

377
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:14,440
What? Are you really in your fifties?

378
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,130
I look old for my age,

379
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:23,200
And I was always out in the sun, so I've got a lot of wrinkles.

380
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,930
I am really good at making food as well.

381
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:32,890
The kimchi I make is so good that you might not know when one person dies while two people eat.

382
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:36,950
So, please just trust me.

383
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:41,090
I'm sorry. I want someone younger.

384
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:45,720
- Please leave.
- Someone younger?

385
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,920
Don't be like that, and just work with me for one month.

386
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,790
How can you turn me down without giving me a chance?

387
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,980
That's enough. Please leave.

388
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:59,580
- Please just give me a chance.
- Please, get going.

389
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,800
- Just give me one chance.
- I said, please leave!

390
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,960
You are only going to hire someone young?

391
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,060
You rude little wench! I hope you choke on a stocking!

392
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,060
Good for nothing, wench!

393
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,460
What's wrong with my age?!

394
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,720
Do we all have to die when we get old?

395
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,470
Aging is sad as it is...

396
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,420
Let's see if you don't get old!

397
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,350
What an evil little wench.

398
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,850
Chairman. Madam is here.

399
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:29,230
Who's here?

400
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:36,050
Chairman Lee, I'm here.

401
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:38,060
What brings you to my workplace?

402
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:42,550
Young Gook. I just came back from Se Ryun's place.

403
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:46,830
She's a total wreck!

404
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:52,460
I think what happened recently shocked her badly.

405
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:59,210
So I was thinking of taking Se Ryun around Europe.

406
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:04,630
If she gets a change of scenery then she might get better.

407
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:07,590
Do what you want to do.

408
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:11,500
Then give me 100 million won for the trip.

409
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,680
100 million won?

410
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:19,140
We need at least that much, the plane tickets are expensive and we have to shop.

411
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,140
You should take care of the money for vacations on your own.

412
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:26,230
And it's not like she deserves it.

413
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:30,110
Also, you said you wouldn't ask me for money anymore.

414
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,770
I give you enough every month.

415
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:35,390
I mean! Did I say I'm going to use it?

416
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:39,000
I'm talking about what your younger sister, Se Ryun, needs for the trip.

417
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,660
As you already know, I'm also giving Se Ryun enough money to use every month.

418
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:48,280
So, if you want to go on a trip, whether it's to Europe or wherever, you two take care of it on your own.

419
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,120
Are you really going to be like this?

420
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,670
After everything, your sister is going through?

421
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:57,100
It's not like I asked for 1 billion won or 10 billion won! It's only 100 million won!

422
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,580
If you are really going to be like this,

423
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:03,180
then give Se Ryun her shares right now!

424
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,080
You already know. It's in my father's will.

425
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,210
I can't control those shares as well.

426
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:17,790
But what gives you the right to ask for Se Ryun's shares?

427
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,290
Rights?

428
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,250
I have to go to a meeting.

429
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:27,750
From now on, don't come to the company for things like this.

430
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:34,220
Hey! Hey, Young Gook, you... Hey!

431
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,990
Rights?

432
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:40,460
So is he saying I have no rights?

433
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:45,330
Oh my, that jerk. How could he say that to me?

434
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:50,370
What a huge jerk.

435
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,250
Welcome back.

436
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:59,990
Chief Jo, what's with the car outside? It looks new. Did Chairman Lee buy you a new car?

437
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,750
No. It's...

438
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:06,550
It's CEO Anna Kim's car. She's going to be staying here from today.

439
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,610
What? From today?

440
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,190
Thank you, Mrs. Yeoju.

441
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:14,330
It's nothing. The Chairman especially order to do it.

442
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,840
He said I should make sure there is nothing uncomfortable for you while you are here.

443
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,200
- Please let me know if you need anything.
- Okay.

444
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,810
Madam, you're back?

445
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:25,930
Hello. I will be staying here starting from today.

446
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:30,420
How come so suddenly? We have a lot of children here, so it'll be crowded for you.

447
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,900
I'll be all right.

448
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:38,190
I think it would be nice living with a lot of people since I have been living alone for so long.

449
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:41,720
Thank you for having me.

450
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,910
But... what about the children and Ms. Park?

451
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:51,410
The kids went to school and kindergarten, and Ms. Park went to the stationery store to buy kids' school supplies.

452
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,590
I see.

453
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:58,080
I have some work to do so I will be out for a bit.

454
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:09,370
How could he decide this without telling me? What does he think of me?

455
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:36,830
CEO. How have you been?

456
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,610
Have you been well, Ms. Park?

457
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,830
Yes.

458
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:44,450
Oh, but why aren't you going in?

459
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:47,590
Oh, I'm going to be staying here from today.

460
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:51,520
So I dropped off all my stuff, and I'm going back to work.

461
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,830
I look forward to living together, Ms. Park.

462
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:58,270
Yes, I look forward to it as well.

463
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:06,390
Go on in. I'll see you at dinner later.

464
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:09,320
Yes, have a good day.

465
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,260
Why don't you go ahead first?

466
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,140
No, you go in first.

467
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:19,310
All right, then. Have a safe drive.

468
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:31,650
Her clothes and shoes...

469
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:37,590
She's at the age to care about fashion, but what is she doing working at someone else's house?

470
00:34:54,830 --> 00:35:00,410
How do I give this all to her? What do I tell her?

471
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:10,890
This dress would look really nice on Dan Dan.

472
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:19,090
So, that car outside earlier is CEO Anna's car, and Chairman Lee bought it for her, right?

473
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:21,060
Yes, that's what I heard.

474
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,870
I mean!

475
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:26,300
He didn't even want to give me 100 million won for I and Se Ryun to go on a trip!

476
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,630
What? But he bought a car for that woman?

477
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:33,420
Who is that woman? Who the hell is that woman to him?

478
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,870
Madam.

479
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:38,470
Also! Even the way he brought her in to stay is annoying.

480
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:43,140
Shouldn't he at least asked me before he brought her in?

481
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,510
What do you think about this, Chief Jo? Am I wrong?

482
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,720
The Chairman is home.

483
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,620
Is that so?

484
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,330
I'm not going to stand by this time.

485
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:56,350
My pride is hurt, and I'm enraged.

486
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:59,150
I can't hold it in this time!

487
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,120
What should I do?

488
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,510
How can you do this to me?

489
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:14,420
Do you think I'm a joke? Am I invisible to this family?

490
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,610
What are you suddenly saying without giving me any context?

491
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:19,550
I lived with your father for over twenty years!

492
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:22,210
That makes me an elder in this house!

493
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:26,410
I don't know about anything else, but shouldn't you have asked me first about bringing someone into the house?

494
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:29,430
But how could you do that without a word to me?

495
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:33,740
Who is that woman, CEO Anna, to be living in our house?!

496
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:37,700
Anna stayed at our home whenever she came to Korea.

497
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:42,630
This isn't the first time, so why would I need to ask you?

498
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,820
What?

499
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:49,880
To me, Anna is like family and an important business partner.

500
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,890
So please don't be rude to her.

501
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:57,380
I can't do that. I don't want to!

502
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,510
It makes me uncomfortable so that won't work.

503
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:03,430
So tell that woman to stay in her studio.

504
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,180
Then there's nothing I can do about it.

505
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,450
If Anna makes you that uncomfortable,

506
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,900
then you should live with Se Ryun for now.

507
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,760
I need to wash up.

508
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:18,180
What? Are you telling me to leave?

509
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:24,530
Okay! Fine! I will leave! If that's what you want!

510
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:27,000
I'm leaving!

511
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,300
I'm really leaving...

512
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,600
Madam. Don't do this. Please calm down a little bit.

513
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:38,030
Let go. Chief Jo, you saw how Young Gook treated me.

514
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:41,810
Madam...

515
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,410
He didn't stop me while I carried my luggage out.

516
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:49,850
Shouldn't he at least pretend to hold me back? But he's nowhere to be seen!

517
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,500
I'm leaving! Can you drive me?

518
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,370
I'm going to Se Ryun's place.

519
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:09,490
But how can I go to Se Ryun in this state?

520
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:12,110
Madam...

521
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:20,360
Then... come to my place.

522
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:25,440
Chief Jo's house?

523
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:32,900
Did you rest well, Dae Ran? Come, sit.

524
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:38,290
- Where's Chief Jo?
- Sarah? She went back to your place.

525
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,300
She said she needed to finish her work.

526
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,950
Then you made this much food when only you and I will be eating it?

527
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,490
Why did you prepare so much food?

528
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:50,160
My friend came to my place after 50 years! This is the least I could do.

529
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,770
Eat as much as you want. This is kimchi jeon that you used to love,

530
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,910
and I even made Gochujang Tteokbokki!

531
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:59,330
Eat it together with the seasoned vegetable. Eat up, Dae Ran.

532
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:03,200
I'm so touched, Gi Ja...

533
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,240
Thank you...

534
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:09,580
Oh, come on! Why is a madam from a rich family getting touched by this crap?

535
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:13,660
What do you mean by a madam from a rich family?

536
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:19,910
I lived such a foolish life, Gi Ja, you have no idea...

537
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:24,340
I'm seriously such a fool.

538
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:29,580
I'm a fool... A fool.

539
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,170
- A fool...
- Hey, hey.

540
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,970
Dae-Dae-Dae-Dae Ran...

541
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:37,550
What's wrong?

542
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,210
You know, that geezer!

543
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:44,980
He left me nothing when he died.

544
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:49,750
After living with me for more than 20 years...

545
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,160
- Not a dime?
- No!

546
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,720
At least to my daughter, Se Ryun,

547
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,880
he left her a tiny amount of the company's share.

548
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,430
But even that is under the condition that she'll receive it if she marries.

549
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:05,530
- But that girl won't get married!
- Oh, boy.

550
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:10,020
You really have nothing.

551
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,850
Do you know what's worse?

552
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:18,330
As he was dying, he left a will to bury him next to his first wife!

553
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:22,840
Then, did you bury him next to his first wife?

554
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,740
Yes!

555
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:28,120
I wish that I could just dig up that geezer's grave,

556
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:32,510
and grab him by his hairs and pull them out!

557
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,840
Hey...

558
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,450
He called me "pretty girl, pretty girl" all the time!

559
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:46,240
But he completely stabbed me in the back as he died.

560
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:53,960
All of my memories got stolen as well!

561
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,250
That's why I said to Se Ryun,

562
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:04,740
when I die, just cremate me and sprinkle my ashes into the river.

563
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:10,140
Dae Ran... Aigoo, Dae Ran...

564
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:13,100
I... I...

565
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:17,020
I'm upset that people have called me mistress for my entire life.

566
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:22,730
But Young Gook, that punk has never once called me 'mother' either!

567
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,530
I'm still his little sister's mom,

568
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:30,130
and I lived with his dad for over 20 years!

569
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:33,710
How heartless of him!

570
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:37,960
- What's so difficult to call you 'mother?'
- Hey.

571
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,170
Do you think that's it?

572
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:44,630
He treats his old nanny's daughter better than me!

573
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:48,640
He told me that if I'm uncomfortable with her, I can move out!

574
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,090
What a joke... Hey!

575
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:54,390
I'm moving out! I'm moving out tomorrow!

576
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:58,140
I'm taking my safe with me!

577
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,440
A safe?

578
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:07,420
If only my daughter-in-law were alive...

579
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:13,350
I wouldn't have been shamed and been treated this way.

580
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:19,500
I guess the dead daughter-in-law was good to you?

581
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,330
She was kind.

582
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:27,510
She used to give me a lot of allowance behind Young Gook's back.

583
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:30,510
Dae Ran...

584
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:36,010
You know, if you get a new, kind daughter-in-law who's on your side,

585
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:38,740
your life might just go back to being good again.

586
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,350
You've endured until now,

587
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,210
so try hanging in there a little more.

588
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:46,680
Here, let me pour you a glass.

589
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,110
D-Do you think so, Gi Ja?

590
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:54,650
Of course. You'll get a new daughter-in-law who's kind very soon.

591
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:57,420
Drink up, drink up!

592
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:07,440
Hey! I told you to knock and enter with my permission.

593
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,430
Oh, I forgot again!

594
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:13,040
Get lost if you're going to talk nonsense.

595
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,910
Oh? I even brought a present for you.

596
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:19,610
But you want me to get lost?

597
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:23,120
Present? What is it?

598
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,670
It's a snake!

599
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:31,440
You evil, perverted punk! You're dead meat today!

600
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,360
Stop right there!

601
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,000
Stop!

602
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,960
You're dead meat today! Hey!

603
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,620
Open the door!

604
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,700
Lee Se Chan! Open it now!

605
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,570
No! Do you think I'm stupid?

606
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:48,850
Why would I open the door? Too bad!

607
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:54,460
If you play another prank like this, I'm really going to kill you!

608
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,820
Ajumeoni... What was that sound just now?

609
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,530
It was the sound of kids screaming, right?

610
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:16,280
Maybe... Are the kids fighting?

611
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,210
Ajumeoni. What sound was that?

612
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:27,470
I'm not sure. I think something big happened upstairs.

613
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:37,500
What's wrong? What is it?

614
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:40,430
There's a snake, Chairman!

615
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:43,140
A snake? Where?

616
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,390
Where?

617
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:53,320
This is a toy. A toy snake.

618
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:09,820
Is it really a toy snake?

619
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:13,700
It looks like a real snake...

620
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,730
It really is a toy snake.

621
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:19,970
But why does it look so real?

622
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,300
Toys these days are so realistic.

623
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,070
Would you like to touch it too, Chairman?

624
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:26,580
No, thank you.

625
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:31,180
This, this! Whose is this?

626
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:33,540
You little... Se Chan!

627
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,920
Dad, Se Chan did this.

628
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:41,160
I'm sorry. Noona was being a super annoying show-off,

629
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,770
so I wanted to get revenge...

630
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:46,030
Lee Se Chan. You scared everyone.

631
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:49,090
Don't ever play with something like this again, you understand?

632
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:50,480
Okay...

633
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,270
Wow, the snake is cute.

634
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:56,310
Can you give that to me, please?

635
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:59,140
No. It's too hideous to look at,

636
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:02,090
and Ms. Park is scared of it too.

637
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:04,520
Please throw it away, Ajumeoni.

638
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,540
Gosh... What's so scary about this?

639
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:09,390
Not even Se Jong is scared of it.

640
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:22,460
Noona... What's all this?

641
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,930
You didn't have to do this.

642
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:28,490
It's my way to show gratefulness to everyone since I'll be staying here for a while.

643
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:32,560
- Do you like the gifts, Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong?
- Yes!

644
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,490
After wearing these shoes,

645
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,450
I think I got a lot taller!

646
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:38,090
I love it so much!

647
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:41,070
Thank you for loving it!

648
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:45,200
Oh, CEO Kim... You didn't need to get me a present too. Thank you.

649
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:50,400
No worries. I'll probably need your help the most while I stay here.

650
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,190
Please try it out. I hope you like it.

651
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:57,430
This is such an expensive and nice cosmetic brand. Of course, it'll be good!

652
00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:00,920
I'll use mine well too. Thank you.

653
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:08,010
These are bribes so that we'll all get along. I hope we'll get along well.

654
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:10,590
Oh, right.

655
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:13,720
This is for you, Ms. Park.

656
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,310
Did you get something for me too?

657
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:21,950
Thank you.

658
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:26,180
Ms. Park. Why don't you open it?

659
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:28,560
Yes, open it.

660
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,780
It's a dress!

661
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:41,530
It's so pretty! It's perfect for you.

662
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:44,680
It looks like a princess dress!

663
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:47,720
Try wearing it now, Ms. Park.

664
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,170
I'll try it later.

665
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:52,140
Why don't you try wearing it now?

666
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:55,360
I'll have to exchange it if it doesn't fit.

667
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,060
Okay...

668
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:06,790
It's so pretty!

669
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:11,020
But this is a really expensive brand...

670
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:14,720
Is it okay for me to wear something like this?

671
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:25,260
You like melons, Se Chan.

672
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:31,970
You really look like a princess, Ms. Park!

673
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:40,860
Wow, you look awesome, Ms. Park!

674
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:43,720
Ms. Park... It looks perfect on you.

675
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,820
It suits you so well, Ms. Park.

676
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:48,150
I'm glad it fits well.

677
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:51,260
Ms. Park, when you take me to kindergarten tomorrow,

678
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,240
you should wear that.

679
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:57,930
Then the day after tomorrow, 10 times, and 20 more times!

680
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:00,680
All right, Se Jong.

681
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,590
Thank you, CEO Kim.

682
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:06,640
I'll wear it well.

683
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:11,830
All right. I'm also happy that it suits you well.

684
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:19,830
I cut the meat a little small so that it's easier for you ladies to eat. Is that all right?

685
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:21,420
It's great!

686
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,380
The service here is really good, don't you think so?

687
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:26,350
Thank you for the compliment.

688
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:29,780
I'm sorry but, if you don't mind, would it be okay for me to take this shirt off while I work?

689
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,360
It's because the fire is so hot.

690
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,970
Oh, of course! Go for it!

691
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,850
Oh, thank you... thank you.

692
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:41,690
He has a very good body.

693
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:46,320
Look at his arms.

694
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:56,310
He's also good-looking.

695
00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:57,850
Enjoy your meal then!

696
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:00,990
Hey, hold on! We'll order two more servings of meat.

697
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:02,100
You're all going to eat more, right?

698
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,860
I'm really craving meat today for some reason.

699
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:06,170
- Me too!
- Thank you.

700
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,910
Ma'am! They'd like two more servings of meat here!

701
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:10,150
Okay!

702
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:13,340
- Enjoy your meal.
- Okay.

703
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:15,310
Let me check on the meat for you.

704
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:19,400
- He's so good looking.
- He's really handsome.

705
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,050
Excuse me! We'd like two more servings of meat here, too, please.

706
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:23,750
Please grill it for us too.

707
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,800
Yes, ma'am!

708
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:30,930
No, not you... We want that young man to grill it.

709
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:33,210
He seems to be very skilled at grilling meat.

710
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:34,820
- That one!
- That young man.

711
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,730
Oh! Just a minute, please.

712
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:38,380
Mr. Cha Geon?

713
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,030
Yes?

714
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:41,610
Take care of this table's meat too, please.

715
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:44,540
Oh, okay. Just a minute, please.

716
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:54,420
I think the owner of the restaurant really likes me, Mother.

717
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,330
She asked me to work there for a long, long time.

718
00:50:56,330 --> 00:51:00,510
She said she'll give me a heft bonus later too.

719
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:02,660
- Is that so?
- Yes!

720
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:06,680
Oh, how grateful...

721
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,640
But where's Mi Rim and Dae Beom?

722
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,340
Mi Rim and Dae Beom!

723
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,540
Come on out quickly and eat some Galbi.

724
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:18,670
If you don't eat this Galbi too, I'm really going to kill you, Dae Beom!

725
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:22,860
- Dae Beom Oppa isn't here.
- What?

726
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:24,460
- What? He's not here?
- No.

727
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:26,280
Where did he go?

728
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,180
Is he drinking again?

729
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:33,450
He keeps upsetting me...

730
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:36,650
Why don't you start eating, mother-in-law?

731
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:40,180
All right, all right. All of you eat too.

732
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:44,360
It's really delicious!

733
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,280
It's delicious!

734
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,940
Here's a big piece for you. Eat a lot, dear Mi Rim!

735
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:56,700
Now that I see Galbi... I'm reminded of Dan Dan Unni.

736
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,060
Dan Dan Unni always really liked pork Galbi.

737
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:03,010
She eats way better there. She gets to eat all sorts of more delicious things.

738
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:06,120
But you know, nothing in this world can be kept a secret forever.

739
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:11,680
I mean, what if they find out that Dan Dan is Soo Chul Hyung's daughter, a member of our family?

740
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,550
Won't she get into big trouble then?

741
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:20,170
We saw for ourselves how merciless that family is!

742
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:24,810
Brother-in-law. Don't you think we should have Dan Dan quit now before it's too late?

743
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:28,640
I really think they're not going to let her off easy if they find out.

744
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,670
Dan Dan can't quit that job right now.

745
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:33,210
She got payment in advance--

746
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:37,140
Advance payment?

747
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,570
What are you talking about?

748
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:42,070
That's not what I said...

749
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:45,220
Did you receive money from Dan Dan?

750
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:50,480
Honey... It's not that I asked her for money--

751
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,200
I'm asking if you received money from Dan Dan!

752
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,480
Well...

753
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,440
Dan Dan brought me ten million won the day we moved,

754
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,590
for us to find a place and move.

755
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:04,940
But you had found a house already, so I couldn't tell you...

756
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:08,950
I barely touched the money she gave.

757
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:11,190
I only used ₩300,000...

758
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,200
How thoughtless can you be?

759
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:20,650
Gosh, Noona... How could you take that money?

760
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:25,870
That's right. You're completely thoughtless.

761
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:29,170
You shouldn't have received her money.

762
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:36,200
Brother-in-law.

763
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,540
Honey?

764
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,820
What should I do now?

765
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:42,970
Mom!

766
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:47,370
Just eat the meat. It's going to burn.

767
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:55,260
Dad! Did something happen?

768
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:58,310
Why did you call me out at this hour?

769
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:03,570
What is this?

770
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:08,390
This money you gave your mom... I heard you asked for your payment in advance.

771
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:12,020
What? Yes...

772
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:15,790
Did you come here because of this, Dad?

773
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:19,920
Did I ask you to do this? Why did you do something I didn't even ask you to do?

774
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:25,180
What then? All our family members got kicked out and went around motels.

775
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:26,540
How could I be comfortable with that?

776
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:31,270
I have that much money.

777
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:35,680
Also, your uncle and grandma got some money too.

778
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:38,600
We found a house with that.

779
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:43,500
So, I'll give you this back. Pay them back for the advance payment.

780
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,990
It's fine. I already gave it to you.

781
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:49,820
Just use it.

782
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:55,330
Listen to me.

783
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:58,610
Pay your advance payment back first.

784
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:02,500
It's because I'm worried about you working there.

785
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,800
Just quit your job there and come back home.

786
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:10,320
It'll be uncomfortable... But you can share a room with Mi Rim and your grandma.

787
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,690
No. I don't want to do that!

788
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:14,480
I'm not going to move into your place, Dad.

789
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,950
I never want to get involved with that family ever again. I'm so sick of them!

790
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:19,420
Dan Dan!

791
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:24,640
To be honest, I feel more comfortable and happy living here.

792
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:29,390
They're all nice to me, and the kids like me too.

793
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:37,710
So, I'd like for us to continue to live like strangers in the future too.

794
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:46,700
I'll take care of myself, so you go and live your life the way you want as well.

795
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:49,310
All right...

796
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:56,500
I'm just worried about you. What if--

797
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:00,090
If you're worried about me, then never come here to see me again.

798
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:05,120
Are you going to take responsibility if we get caught?

799
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:35,730
Ms. Park! Where have you been--

800
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,630
Did something happen?

801
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:45,490
No... I needed to buy something from the convenience store.

802
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:47,340
Why were you still awake?

803
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:51,080
I wanted to drink some water.

804
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:52,830
Would you like me to get you a glass of water?

805
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:56,040
No, no. It's all right.

806
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,690
Why don't you go upstairs and get some rest?

807
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:03,110
Okay, then... Good night.

808
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:16,660
Dan Dan... I'll be by your side from now on.

809
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:23,370
From now on, I, your mom, will protect you.

810
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:30,750
Dae Ran! Take this hangover medicine.

811
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,530
What?

812
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:36,190
Dae Ran, that girl... Did she leave without even telling me?

813
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:39,700
My gosh... that...

814
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:43,850
Oh, my babies.

815
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:56,050
Hey, you old geezer.

816
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:58,810
I'm never going to leave this house. Do you think I lost my mind?

817
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:01,290
I'm not going to move out of this house.

818
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:09,600
I'm going to die after I use up all of your wealth, all the money you didn't give me, you bastard.

819
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:13,310
Yes?

820
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:14,820
- Madam?
- Oh, my.

821
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:17,240
What brings you here, CEO Anna?

822
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:20,510
- Take a seat, take a seat.
- Okay.

823
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:28,010
I didn't see you yesterday, so I thought maybe you left because of me.

824
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:31,940
Oh, my! Why would I leave when this is my house?

825
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:36,190
I went to my old friend's house and slept over and chatted a bit.

826
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:39,230
Oh, is that so? Then you must've had a good time.

827
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:43,050
Here.

828
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,430
What is this?

829
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:52,550
It's the product I'll be launching this time. I brought it especially for you.

830
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:55,630
It's a sign of my gratefulness.

831
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:57,850
I'll take it since it's your gratefulness.

832
00:58:57,850 --> 00:58:59,890
I'll use it well.

833
00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:01,840
I hope that we'll get along.

834
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:06,040
- I'll get going to work now.
- Okay.

835
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:16,600
She's the nanny's daughter. How can she be so shameless?

836
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:20,950
Why isn't she staying at her place? What mischief is she up to?

837
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:24,170
Yes... Gi Ja's right...

838
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:27,920
I need to find a daughter-in-law who I like and will be on my side.

839
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:33,190
That's the only way I can survive in this household.

840
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,810
Excuse me...

841
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:41,200
Who are you?

842
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:46,770
I heard that you were looking for a housekeeper.

843
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:51,970
But, you don't seem like the person who was supposed to come.

844
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:54,190
Are you sure you came to the right place?

845
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:57,540
Someone young was supposed to come.

846
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:59,930
My apologies...

847
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:03,480
The truth is I wanted this job,

848
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:07,530
so I applied for it using my daughter Cha Yeon Sil's name.

849
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:12,750
I'm ten times more of a veteran than my daughter,

850
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:16,510
so I'd be grateful if you could trust me and give me the job.

851
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:19,570
What are you saying?

852
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:22,020
Oh, my. Look at all the dust that's piled up here.

853
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:24,530
If you have this much dust piled up,

854
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:29,180
- you'll get sick!
- Wait...

855
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:30,410
What are you doing--

856
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:33,090
Look at this dust.

857
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:35,310
Why are you doing this?

858
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:38,370
- Ah, the kitchen is over there.
- Oh, my gosh.

859
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:41,410
Grandma!

860
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:44,180
Grandma! Why are you doing this?

861
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:46,080
Please stop!

862
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:50,870
Try me out for just one day.

863
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:54,140
Let me work here for just one day, and if you still don't like me, you can tell me.

864
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:58,960
Then I'll give up right away and leave.

865
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:03,420
Seriously, what's wrong with her?

866
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:07,480
How can they send an old grandma like her?

867
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:22,110
Mr. Park! Bring the material up, please.

868
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,680
Okay!

869
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:40,040
All right.

870
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:51,360
Mr. Park!!

871
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,790
- Mr. Park!
- What happened?

872
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:54,430
Hey, Mr. Park!

873
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:56,110
Help him!

874
01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:58,340
Raise him up!

875
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:00,380
Call for help!

876
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:22,670
What is it?

877
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:24,210
Dan Dan! Come quickly!

878
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:27,250
Father... he...

879
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:30,520
What about him?

880
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:34,420
Tell me properly, Oppa! What about father?

881
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:43,880
Take me to the hospital, please.

882
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,940
Please hurry!

883
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:58,510
Mom? Grandma... Uncle?

884
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:00,490
What happened?

885
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:02,060
Why is my dad...

886
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:07,290
Dan Dan... What should I do with your dad?

887
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:13,300
Brother-in-law was working at a construction site without telling us.

888
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:16,130
That makes no sense...

889
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:17,590
Dan Dan!

890
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:19,270
It's because of me...

891
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:21,510
It's all because of me!

892
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,660
Son-in-law Park...

893
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:28,050
Son-in-law Park... What should we do?

894
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:30,110
Stop crying, Mom.

895
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:32,280
No, it can't be.

896
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:36,410
Dan Dan, your dad is going to be fine.

897
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:42,870
Your dad will never die leaving us behind.

898
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:57,940
Doctor! How is my husband?

899
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:01,460
The surgery went well, but we'll have to keep an eye on him.

900
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:03,950
What?

901
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:06,310
What does that mean?

902
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:11,440
The surgery went well, but then why do they have to keep an eye on him?

903
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:19,210
Then, doesn't that mean that he might die?

904
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:22,410
- Aunt!
- Oh, Dan Dan!

905
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:24,260
How did this happen?

906
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,790
Dad...

907
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,780
I'm sorry.

908
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:44,780
I'd like for us to continue to live like strangers in the future too.

909
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:47,620
I'll take care of myself...

910
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:52,510
so you go and live your life the way you want as well.

911
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:56,640
I'm just worried about you. What if--

912
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:00,220
If you're worried about me, then never come here to see me again.

913
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:05,150
Are you going to take responsibility if we get caught?

914
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,780
Dad...

915
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,410
I'm sorry.

916
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:16,190
I'm sorry...

917
01:05:16,190 --> 01:05:20,460
I'll never do that again.

918
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,480
So, please, Dad...

919
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:29,320
Wake up... Please wake up.

920
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:33,200
Please...

921
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,400
Dan Dan! Father woke up! Come on quickly!

922
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,390
What?

923
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:48,440
Father...

924
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,590
Brother-in-law?

925
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:55,600
He opened his eyes!

926
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:04,980
Honey, can you see me?

927
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:07,360
It's me!

928
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:15,070
Dad...

929
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:19,090
Dan Dan...

930
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:24,090
Dad... Thank you...

931
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:27,410
Thank you for waking up.

932
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:34,880
I'm sorry, Dad...

933
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:53,220
♫ When I walk this road, it makes me cry  ♫

934
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:59,780
♫ It reminds me of that person's touch ♫

935
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:07,490
♫ I couldn't hold her and just trembled my heart ♫

936
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:09,770
♫ My beautiful love ♫

937
01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:15,340
Ms. Park. Where did you go at this late hour?

938
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:19,650
The thing is...

939
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:24,540
I have a friend who lives by herself, and she called me saying she's sick.

940
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:30,350
I had to take her to the emergency room...

941
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:34,160
A friend who lives alone?

942
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,660
Yes...

943
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:40,360
I left the kids with Mrs. Yeoju.

944
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:43,740
She's probably sleeping in my room right now.

945
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:48,310
I couldn't tell you because it was so late.

946
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:53,000
I'm sorry.

947
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,850
If she was sick to the point that you needed to take her to the emergency room... I understand.

948
01:07:56,850 --> 01:07:59,690
Have some rest.

949
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,590
Okay.

950
01:08:01,590 --> 01:08:05,180
♫  But love always runs away, chased by longing  ♫

951
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:08,140
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

952
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:11,750
Chairman!

953
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:16,920
I'm sorry.

954
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:26,270
Chairman, I... I lied...

955
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:28,970
I'm sorry.

956
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:36,750
♫ Why do you run away, love. Like a shy child ♫

957
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:43,290
♫ In case I lose it, I hold it tight ♫

958
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:50,610
♫ But love always runs away, chased by longing ♫

959
01:08:50,610 --> 01:08:57,500
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

960
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:05,380
♫ I have to abandon the longing and the grieves ♫

961
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:11,200
♫ What am I looking for on this road wandering ♫

962
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,060
[Young Lady and Gentleman]

963
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:19,740
Both father and daughter came into this household without knowing? Get out of this house immediately.

964
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:21,450
Ms. Park? Ms. Park!

965
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:23,370
Se Jong... Ms. Park isn't here anymore.

966
01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:26,240
Did Ms. Park really leave?

967
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:29,900
I want your daughter, Chief Jo, to become my daughter-in-law. What should I do?

968
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:32,100
Really? Madam really said that?

969
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:35,270
It all worked out for you, Sarah!

970
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:36,920
I'm sorry, Dae Beom!

971
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,620
Our love was broken, Se Ryun.

972
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:41,360
Then let's go abroad together. Let's run away!

973
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:43,350
I'm going to do everything for you from now on.

974
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:45,480
What do you think about working with me, Ms. Park?

975
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:46,310
With me?

976
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:48,250
Chief Jo! Where's Se Jong?

977
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,290
He's not here! Se Jong's not here!

978
01:09:50,290 --> 01:09:52,240
What? Se Jong disappeared?
