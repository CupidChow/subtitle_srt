 [Episode 50]

00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:11,290
About me or my feeling,

3

you don't know anything about it.

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,820
Because of you acting like that,

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,900
it feels like my heart is getting ripped out.

6
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,090
You're the person who made me hurt like this,

7
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,070
and I don't like that person anymore.

8
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,650
Goodbye.

9
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,340
If we start dating again, the same situation will be repeated.

10
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,080
People's prejudice.

11
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,210
Your father's disapproval, Jenny's opposition.

12
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,930
There is nothing but wound for us.

13
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,160
Even so...

14
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,560

is no one else and nothing else...

18
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,900
but you, Chairman.

19
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:39,420
You don't know anything about me or my feelings.

20

What's the point of you saying all that now?

You disregarded my feelings and talked nonsense.

There's really no hope with you.

What? It's already over between my dad and your friend before it even started?

51
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,580
- Yes. They each had their reasons.
- What reasons?

52
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,660
Your dad still isn't over the person he likes.

53
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:54,510
He said he thinks it's not right for him to meet someone when he still has feelings for another.

54
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,150
Did she say Dad said that?

55

He's talking about Ms. Park, right?

56
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:05,080
It seems like your dad really liked Ms. Park a lot.

Why of all the people...

58
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:13,230
Why is he causing trouble by liking Ms. Park, who's not even that older than me and everyone's against?

59
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,550
It's not just because of Ms. Park.

60
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:21,220
Your dad almost got turned down by my friend.

Why? What's wrong with my dad?

62
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,260
It's not because of him,

63
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,120
but because of you kids.

64
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,220
What did we do?

65
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,750
When we met up with your friend,

66
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,430
we didn't play around and behaved ourselves as we ate.

67
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,280
Even Se Chan and Se Jong were well-mannered and sat still.

68
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,210
My friend Ji Min likes your dad.

69
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,510
But once she saw the three of you sitting in a row,

70
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,230
she felt pressured,

71
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,730
and she said she didn't feel confident to become your mother.

72
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,290
Is that so?

73
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,620
Jenny, now that you're all grown up,

74
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,630
I'll be frank with you.

75
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:10,700
Your dad having three kids is the biggest factor that's holding him back from getting remarried.

76
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:17,390
I don't think it'll be easy for your dad to meet someone with no conditions.

77
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,570
It'll probably be with someone with an ulterior motive.

78
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,280
Ulterior motive?

79
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,430
What does that mean?

80
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,720
Your dad has a lot of money.

81
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,740
So that attracts women.

82
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,980
Aunt. So you're saying,

83
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,050
someone will marry our dad for money,

84
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,640
and they'll become our mom for that too?

85
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,380
I'm not saying that will definitely be the case.

86
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,710
I'm just saying, since your dad has three kids,

87
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:51,350
I think it will be hard for your dad to meet someone who likes him purely for himself.

88
00:05:51,350 --> 00:06:00,010
He needs to find someone who would like you, Se Chan, and Se Jong all sincerely.

89
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,260
- Your chicken is here.

00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:38,110
He's not really going to run 50 laps, right?

165
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,100
What if he faints?

166
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:57,020
He really must be mad.

167
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,490
Why is he doing that at this hour?

168
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:04,970
What if he faints?

169
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:09,380
Forget it. It's not my problem whether he faints or not.

170
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:21,910
♫ Even now, I remember your memories. Your name in my memory, ♫

171
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:26,370
♫ comes back to me in a smile, ♫

172
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:32,020
Ouch! Darn it.

173
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:38,500
I mean, after everything I did,

174
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,640
the old Ms. Park would've already forgiven me.

175
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,730
Is she really thinking of breaking up with me?

176
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:52,560
♫ I want to take you out on this cozy day ♫

177
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,610
♫ It gets deeper at the end of the day ♫

178
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:01,410
♫ I think of you a lot more ♫

179
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:06,350
That man. He saw some stuff from somewhere.

180
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,410
I just feel terrible towards you.

181
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:14,830
I prepared it as a sincere apology.
[Park Dan Dan! Please accept my love!]

182
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,300
Then as punishment for hurting you,

183
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,920
I'll reflect on my mistakes and run 50 laps on this field.

184
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,470
Will you forgive me then?

185
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:30,180
Did he faint after running all the 50 laps?

186
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:35,990
No. Running 50 laps is a piece of cake for him.

187
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,670
Hey, Park Dan Dan. What nonsense are you saying?

188
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:45,850
Hey. Whether he has a midnight jog session or not is none of your business.

189
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,840
Why is there nothing to eat?

190
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:14,120
She didn't even stock my favorite melon. Is Mrs. Yeoju even working?

191
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,960
Gosh! There's apple mango.

192
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,180
Mrs. Yeoju. Please give me apple mango.

193
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,050
Aigoo, Se Jong. Would you like to eat apple mango?

194
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:47,500
Yes. It was super delicious yesterday.

195
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,060
All right. I'll hurry up and get it for you, Se Jong.

196
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:59,130
That's strange. I'm sure there were four left.

197
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,280
Where did they all go?

198
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:07,380
Jenny and Se Chan. Did you maybe eat the apple mangos?

199
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,760
No.

200
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,530
I didn't eat it either. What's wrong?

201
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,710
N-no, it's nothing.

202
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:18,740
Jenny, Se Chan, Se Jong. Chairman is leaving for work. Go and say goodbye.

203
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,480
- Okay.
- Okay.

204
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,970
How strange.

205
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:29,390
Then the apple mangos disappeared this time?

206
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,610
Why do things keep disappearing?

207
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:46,660
Dad, are you sick? You look very tired.

208
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:50,440
I'm not. I just pushed myself too hard while working out yesterday.

209
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,130
I'll be back.

210
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,270
Dad looked so sad.

211
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:01,260
It must be because he broke up with Ms. Park.

212
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:10,490
Yes. Ms. Park liked us and our dad sincerely.

213
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,030
That's the truth.

214
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,020
Did something happen, Jenny?

215
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,710
What brings you all the way here?

216
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,920
I just had something to ask you.

217
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,920
Okay, what is it?

218
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:38,230
Am I also one of the reasons why you and my dad broke up?

219
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,860
Why are you suddenly asking about that?

220
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,000
If it is, I wanted to tell you I'm okay with it now.

221
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,520
I'm sorry for getting upset at you last time.

222
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,590
It's just because when I heard you two were dating,

223
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:55,390
I felt betrayed at first,

224
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:59,950
and I didn't like how we were so close in age.

225
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,340
Anyway, that was my reason before.

226
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,530
It seems like you and my dad really like each other.

227
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:12,320
So I decided not to be against it anymore.

228
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,570
If it was because of me, please date again.

229
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:22,770
Jenny. It's not because of you.

230
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,780
But thank you for saying this.

231
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,170
Sincerely.

232
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:31,110
Ms. Park. I'm sorry.

233
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:34,360
No, Jenny. It's fine.

234
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,330
Ms. Park.

235
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,970
I need you to go somewhere with me.

236
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,620
Where?

237
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,640
- You'll know once we get there.
- Wait.

238
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,210
I have nowhere to go with you.

239
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,520
We're broken up.

240
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,500
I'll explain to you there.

241
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,360
Don't talk back and just follow me.

242
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,800
Okay, I got it.

243
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,790
But let this hand go.

244
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:23,090
We're broken up, so why are we holding hands?

245
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:25,130
Let's hold hands just this day.

246
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:29,210
Are your hands going to rot from us holding hands?

247
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,930
W-What? I can't believe this!

248
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:42,700
Chairman. Why are we here?

249
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,180
Virgin Mary.

250
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,760
Ms. Park here.

251
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,940
I like her so very much.

252
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,870
I thought I was looking out for her,

253
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,920
but I only hurt her,

254
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,640
told her to break up,

255
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,740
and made her cry.

256
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,120
Virgin Mary.

257
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,780
I won't ever do that again.

258
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,660
No matter what happens,

259
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,060
I won't ever...

260
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,900
let go of Ms. Park's hands.

261
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,260
I swear.

262
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,910
Ms. Park.

263
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,800
Can you still not trust me after this?

264
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,920
No.

265
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,840
I trust you, Chairman.

266
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,060
I always...

267
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,350
trusted you at all times.

268
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,230
I'm hungry. Gosh, I'm starving.

269
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,880
Anyway, I wonder what they'll have today?

270
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,710
I'm craving galbi or some sort of meat so much.

271
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:52,020
What if I have to fill my stomach with greens like a cow again?

272
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,600
I'm thirsty.

273
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,120
It's a ghost! A ghost!!

274
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:14,560
Hey, hey! I'm not a ghost!

275
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,280
Me, me, me. It's me!

276
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,860
Mrs. Yeoju! What is it?

277
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:37,910
Mrs. Yeoju. What's going on?

278
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,930
- Why is that woman here?
- Well...

279
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:43,950
I don't know either.

280
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:52,130
Hold on. Who is it?

281
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,610
Who's calling me at this hour?

282
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,510
It's mom.

283
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:03,260
Hurry up and pick up. Something might've happened.

284
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,580
Mom. Why are you calling me at this hour?

285
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,190
Se Ryun. I was secretly living at your brother's house and got caught.

286
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:15,420
Come over immediately. Right now. Okay, Se Ryun?

287
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:20,820
What? You were secretly living at Oppa's house and got caught?

288
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:30,930
Mom! What is all this?

289
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,930
Are you a parasite?

290
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,670
Why would you secretly live here?

291
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,540
I had nowhere to go.

292
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:40,400
He froze all my credit cards too!

293
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,080
L-Look, Young Gook...

294
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:55,280
I'm not complaining about you freezing my credit cards. I'm really not.

295
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,310
I really had nowhere to go.

296
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:01,440
That's why... I sneaked back secretly.

297
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,480
Mom.

298
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,890
So why did you do it? Why?

299
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:09,210
Why did you steal Oppa's mother's ring?

300
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:13,090
I did it because I hated your father! That's why!

301
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,520
What?

302
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,130
The truth is, your father promised me...

303
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:24,160
that once Young Gook's mother died, he would give me that ring.

304
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,170
He said he would put me on the family registry too.

305
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:31,560
But he suddenly said he had to give that ring to Young Gook's wife.

306
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,440
So he took back the ring he gave to me.

307
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,510
He should've never given it to me, to begin with. Why would he give it and take it back?

308
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,830
Nor did he put me on the family registry.

309
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:44,250
So I got so upset.

310
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,450
That's why I stole that ring.

311
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:52,800
But I... I wasn't going to do anything to that ring.

312
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,460
I swear. I just hated your father so much.

313
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:03,980
He sweet-talked to me by calling me Pretty Girl.

314
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,410
Whenever I think about that time...

315
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:09,970
I seriously can't help but hate your father so much!

316
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:12,640
Also, when he was dying,

317
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,760
he only cared about and missed Young Gook's mom.

318
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,650
He didn't even put me on the family registry.

319
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:24,170
Seriously. Young Gook, I'm sure you had no idea, but that's what your father did to me!

320
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,790
He really did.

321
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,910
The truth is...

322
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:34,720
I was just an empty shell.

323
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,140
Then...

324
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,620
Why didn't you just tell Oppa later?

That you did it because you hated Dad?

You're right. I...

Can't you just let her live here?

Cut my allowance down by 50 percent?

486
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,130
You need to build up your strength.

487
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:46,110
I'll call you before I arrive, so get ready.

488
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:49,140
Okay.

489
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:51,460
I'll get going now.

490
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:14,880
Is it you, Soo Chul?

491
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,090
Where is my husband?!

492
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:20,390
I'm asking you, where is Dan Dan's dad!

493
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:23,750
He just left. Just now.

494
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,540
What?

495
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,900
He just left?

496
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,030
Come here, you evil wench.

497
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,950
How dare you call my husband over here?

498
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:36,230
How can you bring him in your place, you evil wench!

499
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:38,910
I knew you'd do this. This was your goal, wasn't it?

500
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:42,610
You thieving scummy wench!

501
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:46,620
You!

502
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:49,820
Do you think you are better than me?

503
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:56,270
Just because you have some money, you thought I was a joke and stole my husband? You evil wench!

504
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,280
It's not someone else but you.

505
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,130
How could you do this to me?

506
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,920
Out of so many other men...

507
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,690
Why my husband? Why?

508
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:35,030
I'm sorry.

509
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:38,720
I did terribly wrong.

510
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,740
But it's a misunderstanding.

511
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:48,030
How dare would I even dream of that?

512
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:53,690
Soo Chul was just helping me because I had something going on.

513
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:56,610
I won't let this happen again.

514
00:41:56,610 --> 00:42:03,030
There was nothing going on between Soo Chul and me.

515
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,550
I...

516
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:09,020
I did become greedy over Soo Chul and Dan Dan before.

517
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:12,870
Now I'm not. Trust me.

518
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:18,410
But why?

519
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:23,440
Why were you going around like a married couple with my husband?

520
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,660
Why is Soo Chul coming here again? Why?

521
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:30,360
Why??

522
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,750
Mom, stand up.

523
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:42,170
Don't cry. Why are you here like this, Mom?

524
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:44,060
Mom, let's go home.

525
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,670
Why? Why?

526
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:49,690
How can you hurt my mom like this?

527
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:54,000
Are you still a human being after doing this?

528
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,160
Dan Dan.

529
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,340
Please don't make such a misunderstanding.

530
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,090
It's not like that.

531
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:11,120
I did have that intention for a bit before.

532
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:15,660
I wanted to take you and your dad to the US with me.

533
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,720
So...

534
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,620
I'm getting punished for that now.

535
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:25,110
But now it's not like what you think.

536
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:30,590
If it's not, then why are you seeing my dad?

537
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:33,980
Now I'm really sick of you.

538
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:36,530
Don't ever show in front of me again and get lost.

539
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:41,850
Get away from us and from this world!

540
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:46,060
I don't want to see you ever again.

541
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,170
My mom...

542
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:55,080
She's my grateful mom who raised me that you abandoned.

543
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,420
You should be thankful to her.

544
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:00,560
But how can you do this to her?

545
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:07,610
Mom.

546
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:10,460
Let's stand up.

547
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,700
Don't cry because of that kind of woman.

548
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,920
Mom, let's go. Let's go.

549
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:44,400
Mom, please don't be sad.

550
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,480
I'm here with you.

551
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,980
Thank you, Dan Dan.

552
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,440
For taking my side.

553
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,840
What are you saying? Of course, I am on your side.

554
00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:00,370
The person who raised me until now is you.

555
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:05,280
To me, you are my only mom.

556
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,340
Dan Dan...

557
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:13,310
Mom, I'll split that woman from my dad.

558
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:16,210
So don't worry.

559
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:21,860
And my dad is not a person who would do something like that.

560
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:26,340
I think there would be a misunderstanding.

561
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:31,280
It wouldn't be something that you thought.

562
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:39,290
So, can you believe my dad one more time, please?

563
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:43,510
Thank you.

564
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:46,630
But, Dan Dan.

565
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:51,720
How am I supposed to believe him when that happened? I'm really sad and upset.

566
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:57,780
Mom, if my dad really cheated on you, I'm the first person not to forgive him.

567
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,660
So, calm down.

568
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:02,370
Mom. Mom, don't cry.

569
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:05,430
Dan Dan.

570
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,030
Don't cry.

571
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:29,140
I really like your Soondoobu jjigae.

572
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:32,480
Really? I think the egg roll you made is more delicious.

573
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,750
It's soft and filled with a lot of vegetables.

574
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,370
It is soft.

575
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:39,640
I'm going to be late for my job. Please do the dishes.

576
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,470
Okay.

577
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:45,340
Call me when your work is over. I'll pick you up.

578
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:47,570
Okay.

579
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:57,880
- Mom!
- Hello...

580
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,480
Oh, my goodness...

581
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,930
Are you guys really going to do this to me?

582
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:10,770
Mi Rim, you'll be late for your work. Go ahead and go.

583
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:12,780
Okay.

584
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:21,450
You, pack your stuff now and come with me home.

585
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:23,200
I don't want to.

586
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,620
I'll keep living with Mi Rim here like now.

587
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:30,250
And I don't want to see you until you apologize.

588
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,920
Please go now.

589
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,470
Apologize?

590
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:36,710
What apologizes? You are the one who did wrong.

591
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:39,440
Wrong? What wrong did I do?

592
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,210
You are the one who did wrong, Mom.

593
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:43,430
You said it's dirty to Mi Rim and me.

594
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:47,450
Why are we dirty? What's wrong with me living with Mi Rim?

595
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:51,850
Did we commit a crime or what?

596
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:58,100
I don't want to talk with you anymore since you said stuff like that to me.

597
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:01,740
Are you really going to do this?

598
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,410
Okay, fine.

599
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:09,010
I'm not going to give you any allowance money from now on.

600
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:12,120
It's fine. I can do a part-time job.

601
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:15,770
Joon Oh.

602
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:19,950
How could you really do that to your mom?

603
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:23,610
Are you really my son?

604
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:27,570
So can't you just accept us?

605
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:31,350
If you do so, there's no reason for us to fight.

606
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:33,790
Okay, I get it.

607
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:37,460
From this day, let's cut our ties.

608
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:39,630
Goodbye for real.

609
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:42,090
Bye-bye.

610
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:46,330
Mom! What's wrong with you?

611
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:49,690
- Younger-sister-in-law!
- Aunt!

612
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:51,400
Senior-in-law!

613
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,390
How can you not do anything about it?

614
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:58,520
Younger-sister-in-law! Can you persuade Mi Rim?

615
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:02,550
Are you going to leave Joon Oh and Mi Rim to be together?

616
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:05,730
Can't you do something about it with Mi Rim?

617
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:09,180
Older-sister-in-law! That's not the problem right now!

618
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:12,340
What? Younger-sister-in-law.

619
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:15,670
How can you yell at me?

620
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:20,490
If this is not the problem, what's the issue?

621
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:25,840
My son fell for the wrong girl, and now he lost his mind like this.

622
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,570
How am I supposed not to go crazy?!

623
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:30,820
Older-sister-in-law.

624
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:34,310
Your younger brother is having an affair right now. He's cheating on me!

625
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:36,910
He's having an affair with Anna Kim!

626
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:39,800
W-What did you just say?

627
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:47,080
My Soo Chul did what with whom?

628
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,230
Older-sister-in-law.

629
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:57,470
Joon Oh and Mi Rim are not trying to get married right now.

630
00:49:57,470 --> 00:49:59,730
You do what you want to do about with them.

631
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:02,990
Right now...

632
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:08,100
I can't care anything about Joon Oh and Mi Rim.

633
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,990
Soo Chul can't do this to me.

634
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:15,570
How can he do this to me? How?

635
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:18,970
How can he do this to me at all..?

636
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:22,810
Younger-sister-in-law...

637
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,010
What's going on right now?

638
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,700
Ajussi.

639
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:50,810
What are you doing?

640
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:53,780
Did I ask for stuff like this?

641
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:59,340
I saw you on the street by chance.

642
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,880
That's how I found out you lived here.

643
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,420
That's what I mean. Why are you bringing stuff like this?

644
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:07,530
Please take them all back.

645
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:09,130
And don't ever come back again.

646
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:10,880
Sarah.

647
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,130
I said take it back. I'm not a beggar.

648
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:20,290
If you keep doing this, I can't live here anymore.

649
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:26,310
Even if you saw me, you should've ignored me. Why are you coming here and making me more pitiful?

650
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:30,700
Why are you being nice to someone like me?

651
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:31,810
Why?

652
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:34,590
You are pregnant right now, Sarah.

653
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:39,170
So you should focus on your health and nothing else.

654
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:45,040
Whenever bad memories come up, look at the flowers and think only nice things.

655
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:49,780
I will only go this far.

656
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,350
I will just do this.

657
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:57,340
I don't want to receive things like these from you.

658
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:00,710
Sarah.

659
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:04,500
If you have any feelings of regret toward me,

660
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:11,910
if you feel any sympathy for the baby, please let me do so.

661
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:14,280
Please stay well as I've asked.

662
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:19,810
If you disappear again without a word,

663
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:23,170
I will never forgive you.

664
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:27,390
Okay?

665
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:35,370
What do you want me to do?

666
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:58,420
- Noona.
- Come sit here, Soo Chul.

667
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:00,690
What's going on?

668
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:05,410
Oh my world, are you having an affair with that woman, Anna Kim?

669
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:07,530
Is that really true?

670
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:10,630
What are you talking about it?

671
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:12,070
An affair?

672
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:14,380
Is it not true?

673
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:17,850
Then why are you shopping at a market with her?

674
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:20,050
And go in and out of her home?

675
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:24,830
Your wife is bedridden right now.

676
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:27,210
What?

677
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:32,310
Please tell me the truth.

678
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:35,590
Are you having an affair with her?

679
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:37,500
No, it's not that.

680
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:43,110
If not, why are you shopping for paprikas, carrots, and cucumbers with her at the grocery?

681
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:44,910
Why did you do that?

682
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:48,200
I saw it all myself.

683
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:56,970
It's true I went to the market with her but not for the reasons you think.

684
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:06,710
Did you go and harass her again?

685
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:09,170
Yes, I did.

686
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:11,760
Do you think I would have left her alone after seeing all that?

687
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,740
I pulled all her hair out. Why? What are you going to do?

688
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:20,160
What did you do to that sick woman!

689
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:24,500
She has pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer!!

690
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:32,100
Pancreatic cancer?

691
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:36,580
Are you saying Anna Kim has pancreatic cancer?

692
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:42,120
Yes. It's stage 3 pancreatic cancer.

693
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:47,420
She had an operation for stomach cancer before, but I think it's spread.

694
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:52,710
If she doesn't get the operation right away, she will have less than six months to live.

695
00:54:55,600 --> 00:55:01,720
Is that really true?

696
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,030
Yes.

697
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:09,850
But, she wants to die without having the operation.

698
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:14,090
I've been running around trying to save her.

699
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:19,140
Honey, don't we have to keep people alive?

700
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:25,090
Maybe because of the overwhelming guilt she feels about abandoning Dan Dan.

701
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:26,990
She wants to die without an operation.

702
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,810
I told her I'd help her to stay alive.

703
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:31,990
That's all.

704
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:35,120
Oh, my goodness. What is going on with all this?

705
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,370
Yes.

706
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:42,370
That makes sense. He's not someone who would cheat.

707
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:45,350
But why are you doing that?

708
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:49,160
She has enough money to hire a nurse.

709
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:52,330
If your intention was so pure, you should have told us first.

710
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:54,800
And go about it in broad daylight. What is all this?

711
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:59,440
Why were you lying about it and doing it behind our back?

712
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,860
You and she are strangers.

713
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:04,860
Why do you care if she died or not?

714
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:08,060
Why are you concerned about her so much?

715
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:10,680
How can I not?

716
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:16,100
She is the mother who gave birth to Dan Dan!

717
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:22,220
See? Did you see that?

718
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:25,230
He's acting so strange.

719
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:28,690
If you see her again,

720
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:32,250
I will not leave you alone! Ever!

721
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:40,610
My goodness. What is going on?

722
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:54,040
Now I'm really sick of you.

723
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,520
Don't ever show in front of me again and get lost.

724
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:00,720
Get away from us and from this world!

725
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:06,940
I don't ever want to see you again.

726
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:18,170
Why did I do that? Why?

727
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:26,940
I can't leave it like this.

728
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:12,250
The person you are trying to reach has turned off the phone.

729
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:15,200
After the beep, please leave a message.

730
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:27,410
Dan Dan. What are you doing here?

731
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:29,680
What about CEO Anna? Is she okay?

732
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,430
I can't get hold of her.

733
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:38,040
She's disappeared, and her phone is off.

734
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:40,420
Disappeared?

735
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:47,170
What should I do? I think it's because of me.

736
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:51,750
I came by here earlier and told her to disappear.

737
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:55,930
I yelled at her to disappear from this earth.

738
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:58,370
It's my fault, Dad.

739
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:01,270
No, it's not.

740
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:04,570
I'm sure she will be in touch. So don't worry about it, and let's go home.

741
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:12,290
If she doesn't get in touch and doesn't get her operation, she might be in trouble.

742
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:19,200
Why did she disappear and make us worry like this?

743
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,810
Why did she come here and make our lives miserable?

744
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:27,600
I hate CEO Anna so much.

745
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:34,250
Dan Dan.

746
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:39,540
Please stop...

747
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:44,040
hating your mom.

748
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:49,250
Stop hating her?

749
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:51,540
But I hate her. How can I stop?

750
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:55,240
I hate her. I hate her so much!

751
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:05,960
You hating someone who gave birth to you makes me feel like it's all my fault.

752
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:10,280
It's all my fault.

753
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:14,590
Dad. Why is it your fault?

754
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:17,350
She's the one who abandoned us.

755
01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:25,140
It's because I feel like I taught you to hate her.

756
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:31,560
If I didn't hate her,

757
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:35,700
you would not have either.

758
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:44,210
Dan Dan. If I was more sympathetic to her,

759
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:46,820
why would she have left us?

760
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:51,580
If you want to hate someone, hate me.

761
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:56,290
Please stop hating your mom.

762
01:00:56,290 --> 01:01:02,850
I don't want you to suffer and regret later for hating her like this.

763
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:06,840
Dad, what are you saying right now?

764
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:11,460
I don't think I could ever forgive her.

765
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:39,130
Why are you accusing her recklessly? Ms. Park said she didn't do it.

766
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:40,970
Listen here, CEO Anna.

767
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:44,800
I found this lost necklace in her drawer.

768
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:50,080
Why are you interfering in something that has nothing to do with you?

769
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,940
But you can't accuse someone just with that!

770
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:56,260
Ms. Park would never do something like that.

771
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:05,510
CEO Anna, what's wrong?

772
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:14,160
I just thought of my old times.

773
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,680
Ms. Park.

774
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:22,090
Is it okay if I hug you for once?

775
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:26,130
Yes.

776
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:36,920
Thank you, Ms. Park.

777
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:49,820
[Chairman]

778
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:53,790
Yes, it's me.

779
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:58,250
Ms. Park, I'm calling to say goodnight.

780
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:02,490
Ms. Park, please dream of me tonight.

781
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:06,760
Chairman.

782
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,200
What should I do?

783
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:14,120
Ms. Park. What's wrong?

784
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:16,380
What happened?

785
01:03:24,850 --> 01:03:31,360
CEO Anna has pancreatic cancer?

786
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:33,670
Really?

787
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:35,420
Yes.

788
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:42,850
If she doesn't get an operation, she has less than six months to live.

789
01:03:42,850 --> 01:03:45,460
But what should I do, Chairman?

790
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:52,250
I didn't know that, and I told her to disappear from this world.

791
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:55,050
I hurt her with those terrible words.

792
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:58,300
What if something bad happens to her because of me?

793
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,410
What do I do?

794
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:03,450
I really don't know what to do.

795
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:07,140
I hate her, and then I pity her.

796
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:14,260
I can't tell if I should hate her or pity her.

797
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:20,490
If you want to hate her, hate her. Pity her if you want to.

798
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:24,060
You do whatever you feel like it.

799
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:26,700
It's all okay.

800
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,100
It's okay.

801
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:57,640
What are you doing?

802
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:01,180
Are you worried about her because she disappeared?

803
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:07,830
You can't sleep because you worry that she might have died somewhere?

804
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:12,420
Why are you acting like this? Why are you yelling when everyone's asleep?

805
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:15,790
Does it break your heart that much that she's ill?

806
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:20,420
Why don't you go and live with her then? Why are you living with me!

807
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:25,350
If you are going to be like this, just divorce me. You bastard!

808
01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:28,190
Aigo, Yeon Sil!

809
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:32,500
What are you doing at the crack of dawn?

810
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:40,800
Mom. He can't sleep because he's worried about that woman.

811
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,600
I can't live with him anymore.

812
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:47,980
Have you ever worried for me like that, ever?

813
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:54,750
When I left home after losing the house, he never even looked for me.

814
01:05:54,750 --> 01:06:00,090
But now, he's so worried that that woman might have died somewhere.

815
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:02,860
How can I live with him after seeing this?

816
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:05,560
Let's get divorced! Divorced!

817
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:08,290
Please stop, Yeon Sil.

818
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:13,640
What are you doing at this hour? Please stop it!

819
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:25,400
Who raised Dan Dan when she abandoned her?

820
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:31,330
Who saved you and Dan Dan when you tried to drown to death in the river?

821
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:36,390
How can you do this to me? How?

822
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:42,360
I want to die... I really want to die!

823
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:47,180
If you're going to act like this, get out of here. Go live with her!

824
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:11,230
Yes, hello?

825
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:15,350
Hello? A woman came to my accommodation.

826
01:07:15,350 --> 01:07:18,210
And she looks like she's very ill, so I'm calling you.

827
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:21,870
Do you know the owner of this phone very well?

828
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:24,150
Yes, I'm her family.

829
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:26,570
Then please come and get her right away.

830
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:31,430
I called you because she won't go to the hospital, and I'm worried something will happen.

831
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:35,710
I turned her phone on in secret to her.

832
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:38,300
Thank you very much.

833
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:40,890
Where are you located?

834
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:47,320
Where are you going this early? Are you going to that woman again?

835
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:50,290
Honey, they found CEO Anna.

836
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:52,830
She's in bad shape. I will be right back.

837
01:07:52,830 --> 01:07:57,930
Why are you going there? What are you to her?

838
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:00,520
Please calm down.

839
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:06,030
She only has six months to live. What can they do together?

840
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:09,900
Soo Chul.

841
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:13,430
How did you find me here?

842
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:18,850
What are you doing here when you are getting surgery next week?

843
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:20,920
Let's go back to Seoul together.

844
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:25,580
I came here to be alone.

845
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:30,060
Don't mind me and go home.

846
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:32,910
You can't stay here like that.

847
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:35,260
Let's go.

848
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:46,890
Please don't mind whether I live or die.

849
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:50,200
I won't go with you.

850
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:57,470
Is that because of what my wife did?

851
01:09:57,470 --> 01:10:00,610
She misunderstood because she didn't know you were sick.

852
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:01,920
So--

853
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:06,280
Your wife has every right to act that way.

854
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:11,460
I don't want to create trouble in your home.

855
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:17,030
Because you are acting like this, I came here so that I can't see you.

856
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:21,780
Ji Young.

857
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:24,390
Why are you being stubborn?

858
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:27,630
If you do this, you'll make Dan Dan sad.

859
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:30,960
Do you know how much she cried?

860
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:35,230
Did Dan Dan cry?

861
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:37,680
Because of me?

862
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:39,660
Yes.

863
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:46,930
So, let's go back.

864
01:10:46,930 --> 01:10:49,650
Let me take you home.

865
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:55,140
Please, I beg you.

866
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:04,370
Yeon Sil.

867
01:11:06,990 --> 01:11:12,100
Please forgive me just once.

868
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:23,490
Please let me go to her.

869
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:31,480
Just while she's getting her surgery, please allow me to be with her.

870
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:34,920
Please.

871
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:38,450
I beg you.

872
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:48,050
Are you saying... you want to abandon me?

873
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:53,170
Do you want to end it with me?

874
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:12,740
♫ Why do you run away, love, like a shy child ♫

875
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:19,530
♫  In case I lose it I hold it tight ♫

876
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:26,710
♫  But love always runs away, chased by longing  ♫

877
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:33,410
♫ It would be nice to take a break  ♫

878
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:41,530
♫ I have to abandon the longing and the grieves  ♫

879
01:12:41,530 --> 01:12:42,880
♫  What am I looking  ♫

880
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,580
[Young Lady and Gentleman]

881
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:48,010
Chairman, where are we going today?

882
01:12:48,010 --> 01:12:49,170
We are going for lunch.

883
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:50,850
- Dan Dan.
- Two of you, enjoy your lunch.

884
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:55,010
Please don't misunderstand. I didn't ask Young Gook to do it.

885
01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:57,150
Where did he go in the middle of the night?

886
01:12:57,150 --> 01:12:59,180
Mi Sook, I can't get hold of Sarah.

887
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:00,860
Can you find my Sarah for me?

888
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:03,370
How can I know where Sarah is?

889
01:13:03,370 --> 01:13:05,750
It's been a long time since she left my house.

890
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:07,660
Let's go to Vietnam together.

891
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:10,500
I can take care of you and our baby.

892
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:13,420
We can start afresh without anyone knowing.

893
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:16,260
Of all the people, I thought you would understand my feelings.

894
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:17,380
I'm sorry, Mom.

895
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:20,490
Did you think I'd stop you from coming here if you told me?

896
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:23,990
I hate CEO Anna very much, but I pity her too.

897
01:13:23,990 --> 01:13:25,850
Can't you understand me just once?

898
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:27,120
Mom!

899
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,600
♫ It would be nice to take a break  ♫
