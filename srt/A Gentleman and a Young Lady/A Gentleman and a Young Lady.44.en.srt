[Episode 44]

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,930
What is this?

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,170
Our baby's ultrasound photo.

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,430
What?

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,060
I... am pregnant with your child.

6
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,490
Oh, my God!

7
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,540
Chief Jo,

8
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,920
what are you saying?

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,160
As you can see, I am pregnant with your child.

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,930
I'm twelve weeks along.

11
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,810
When you regained your memory, you called off our engagement

12
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,000
because you said you didn't remember us.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,640
But I still believe that we are engaged.

14
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,080
I want to have our child in this house.

15
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,350
Dad, what is she talking about?

16
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,370
Jenny, Se Chan. Go upstairs.

17
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,910
Chief Jo.

18
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,660
Let's talk inside.

19
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,420
Oh my, oh my. What is going on?

20
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,190
Mrs. Yeoju, get me some iced water.

21
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,360
Get me some cold water quickly.

22
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,660
Oh, my head.

23
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:26,710
Chief Jo. Is that child really mine?

24
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:33,620
Chairman, are you trying to say that this child is not yours?

25
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:39,610
Just because you don't remember, are you going to deny this child as well?

26
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:44,400
All this time, I have been abandoned and hurt by you.

27
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,890
The humiliation I have had to bear until now was more than enough.

28
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:54,150
However, don't do that to this child.

29
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,640
Don't make me suffer that pain.

30
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,700
The baby will hear everything.

31
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,570
All right.

32
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,390
I understand it for now.

33
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:19,050
Chairman, please prepare my room here.

34
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:23,760
I want to have our child here.

35
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,050
Chief Jo.

36
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:42,570
Chief Jo. Are you really pregnant with Chairman Lee's child?

37
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,810
Yes, Madam.

38
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:51,440
You didn't show any signs until now. But it's all happening so suddenly, and it startled me.

39
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,370
Why haven't you said anything about it until now?

40
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,060
I also only found out yesterday.

41
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,350
It was something unimaginable.

42
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,620
That can happen. One of my friends back in the days

43
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,820
didn't know that she was pregnant until the last month, even though her belly was getting bigger.

44
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,140
She thought she had cancer and went to the doctor crying,

45
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,530
and that's when she found out that she was pregnant.

46
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,390
But why wouldn't our smart Chief Jo know that?

47
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,860
I will have this child here.

48
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,970
I just talked with the Chairman,

49
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,580
so please prepare the room I will stay in.

50
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,960
Are you going to stay in this house?

51
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,550
Yes.

52
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,050
Chief Kim and Mrs. Yeoju, please take care of it.

53
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,060
I will come tomorrow, with my things.

54
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,770
Then, I'll be leaving for today.

55
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,220
Oh, my... Wait...

56
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,860
Oh my, what is going on?

57
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,300
Then our house will have four kids?

58
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,690
Se Jong, you sing really well.

59
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,080
Hi, Se Jong.

60
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,650
Hello, Chief Jo.

61
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,420
Where are you coming from?

62
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,110
I just went to my girlfriend's birthday party.

63
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,230
Really? It must have been fun.

64
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:38,220
Se Jong, starting tomorrow I'm going to live in this house with you again.

65
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,290
Let's get along well.

66
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,860
Chief Jo. Did you say you're going to live here?

67
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:56,230
Are you going to be working for the Chairman again?

68
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,820
You should hear it directly from the Chairman.

69
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,970
When you go in, he will have something to tell you.

70
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,580
Then, I'll be going.

71
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,500
Se Jong, see you tomorrow.

72
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,310
Are you trying to say that this child is not yours?

73
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:03,490
Just because you don't remember, are you going to deny this child as well?

74
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,800
Chief Jo.

75
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,530
Let's meet right now.

76
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,920
[Obstetrician-Gynecologists]

77
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,060
She is pregnant.

78
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,400
Due to your age, you have to be careful.

79
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,630
Because this is a crucial time, try not to get too stressed.

80
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:37,050
And watch your intake of salty foods.

81
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,940
Take care of your nutrition, and come back in a month.

82
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,140
Yes, I will.

83
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,570
As the father, make her comfortable.

84
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,880
Right now, her emotional stability is crucial.

85
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,720
Chairman. Now that you've confirmed that I'm pregnant with your child,

86
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,590
I will move in tomorrow.

87
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,260
Chief Jo.

88
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:23,360
Rather than my house, I think it would be best to stay at yours.

89
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,360
I will support all the preparations you want for giving birth.

90
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,590
Chairman, I want to have a healthy baby.

91
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:39,180
The doctor even said that my emotional stability is the most important.

92
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,460
I think being beside the father is the best prenatal care.

93
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:48,110
Chairman. I want to stay at your house.

94
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,040
Please let me, for this child.

95
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:57,640
I'm sorry. I have to think of Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong.

96
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,900
You living in the house will confuse them.

97
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,660
So I ask for your understanding.

98
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:09,550
If you need me for anything, we can always meet outside like this.

99
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,540
Let's go. I'll drive you home.

100
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,840
"We'll meet outside?"

101
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:37,120
Se Jong, starting tomorrow I'm going to live in this house with you again.

102
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,440
You should hear it directly from the Chairman.

103
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,860
When you go in, he will have something to tell you.

104
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,490
I think something is strange.

105
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,740
I'll have to ask the Chairman.

106
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,590
Ms. Park.

107
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,410
Madam. What brings you to my room?

108
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,840
Well...

109
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,920
I came because I have something I have to tell you.

110
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,090
But now that I'm here, my mouth won't open.

111
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,850
What is it you have to say?

112
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,730
Well, that's...

113
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:25,230
I think it would be best to pack your stuff and leave today.

114
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,040
What?

115
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,980
What are you saying all of a sudden?

116
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,770
Chief Jo is pregnant. With Young Gook's child.

117
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,740
Pregnant?

118
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,840
What are you...

119
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,170
Do I really have to spell it out?

120
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:52,140
As I said, Chief Jo is pregnant with Young Gook's child!

121
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,220
What?

122
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,370
From what I think,

123
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,940
when Young Gook lost his memory and was 22 or whatever,

124
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:08,380
Young Gook and Chief Jo really liked each other and went around to the vacation house and an island.

125
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,090
I think that's when she got pregnant.

126
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,020
There's no way. That's not it.

127
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,720
I know. You might not want to believe it, but it's true.

128
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,650
Chief Jo came by earlier, and she announced that she's pregnant with Young Gook's child and left.

129
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:27,980
She said she wants to have the child in this house that she'll move in here tomorrow.

130
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,870
So what should we do?

131
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:34,100
So you leaving this house today would be good for you as well.

132
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,950
If you're here when Chief Jo comes tomorrow, won't you both feel awkward?

133
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,500
What about the Chairman? What did he say?

134
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:48,000
What could he say? What could he say when Chief Jo said she was pregnant with his child?

135
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,520
I heard that and had such a shock.

136
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,530
I almost fainted.

137
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:58,900
Ms. Park, you understand what I'm trying to say, right?

138
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:04,270
You leaving this house today will be best for everyone.

139
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,090
I have a headache, so I have to go downstairs now.

140
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,590
My head hurts too much.

141
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,360
Oh, my head.

142
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,260
No. No.

143
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,430
The Chairman wouldn't do that.

144
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,840
It's not true. It's not.

145
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,650
It's not true.

146
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:50,530
Chairman. Where are you right now?
[Mountain Bunny]

147
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,640
I have something I want to ask you.

148
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,640
Chairman. Did you have to wait long?

149
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,830
I'm sorry, there was traffic.

150
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,350
There was something...

151
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:14,380
I wanted to hear from you directly.

152
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,160
It's about...

153
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:25,840
You want to ask me about Chief Jo, right?

154
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:31,050
I don't know how much you heard.

155
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,090
Is it true?

156
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:38,160
Is Chief Jo...

157
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,690
really pregnant with your child?

158
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,650
Is it all true?

159
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,810
Yes.

160
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,160
We confirmed everything at the hospital today.

161
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,630
She is pregnant.

162
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:06,160
I'm not sure why something like this happened.

163
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,770
But she's claiming it's my child.

164
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:13,860
So I've been thinking about what to do about it.

165
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,000
You said it's true that Chief Jo is pregnant.

166
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,270
Then what's there to think about?

167
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,690
Is thinking about it will change anything?

168
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:32,790
I heard that Chief Jo would move into your home tomorrow.

169
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:37,540
If I'm there, it'll only make things more hard and uncomfortable for everyone.

170
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,650
So I will leave.

171
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:43,170
It's the right thing to do.

172
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,740
- Ms. Park.
- No, Chairman.

173
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,850
Don't say anything.

174
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,480
Nothing.

175
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,750
Let's just...

176
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,610
breakup here.

177
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:08,860
I don't want you to watch me leave.

178
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,840
I'll go pack my stuff now and leave.

179
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,390
Please explain to the kids, so they can understand.

180
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,020
Ms. Park, wait.

181
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,480
Hold on a moment.

182
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,620
Let's think about this a little more.

183
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,830
What is there more to think about?

184
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,980
What do you want to think about?

185
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:39,290
I don't want to hear anything from you right now.

186
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,110
Especially not an apology from you.

187
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:46,030
Do you have any idea how I feel right now?

188
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,560
I feel like I've been struck by a hammer.

189
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,640
And this all feels like a dream.

190
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,170
So I can't even cry.

191
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:02,700
I'll get going.

192
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:08,160
I would like you to go home after I leave.

193
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,720
I'm asking as a favor.

194
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:16,120
We should just...

195
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,540
break up here.

196
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,710
Come in.

197
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,820
What are you doing, Ms. Park?

198
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,310
Why are you packing your bag?

199
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,900
Jenny.

200
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:07,480
I can no longer stay here anymore.

201
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,810
Why not?

202
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,740
I can't tell you that now.

203
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,690
Your dad will explain it to you later.

204
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:18,280
Jenny. I'm really sorry.

205
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,410
Seriously, why are you doing this, Ms. Park?

206
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,750
You always pack your bag and say you're going to leave.

207
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:28,330
How could you think to leave without telling us again when you only just got back?

208
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:31,990
I'm so disappointed in you, Ms. Park!

209
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,900
Stop it. You don't know anything!

210
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,890
I will explain everything to you later.

211
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,390
Ms. Park. I'm really sorry.

212
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,960
I will apologize instead of Noona.

213
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,690
I'm really sorry.

214
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,190
Gosh, it's fine. Don't cry.

215
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:54,770
Se Chan, I'm sorry.

216
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,670
What's going on, Lee Se Chan?

217
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:00,260
There's something going on that I don't know about, right?

218
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,990
You better tell me!

219
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,090
Lee Se Chan!

220
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,030
Dad and Ms. Park like each other.

221
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,830
But Chief Jo Ajumma is pregnant with Dad's child.

222
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,870
That's why Ms. Park is leaving.

223
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,810
Because all of them can't live together!

224
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:23,320
So stop yelling at Ms. Park! Just stop!

225
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,670
What?

226
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:52,930
Sarah. What is this?

227
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,240
Mom, I'm pregnant.

228
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,880
Pregnant? What?

229
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,660
Who's baby is this? Tell me.

230
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,610
Who else?

231
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,380
It's the Chairman's baby. I'm 12 weeks along.

232
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,380
What? 12 weeks?

233
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:17,010
So it happened during the time I nagged you for sleeping away from home?

234
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,650
Were you with Chairman Lee at that time then?

235
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,080
Is this really Chairman Lee's child?

236
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,560
Yes, of course, it's his child.

237
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,410
That's why I'll be moving into Chairman's house tomorrow.

238
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,140
Chairman Lee told you to move in?

239
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,870
Well, I'm pregnant with his child.

240
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,020
Of course, he said that.

241
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,480
This is great!

242
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,550
Father and Mother. Thank you.

243
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:43,030
This is great, Sarah.

244
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:46,080
I think I can breathe now.

245
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,620
This is great.

246
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,990
But Mom, what will you do about your injured leg without me?

247
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,940
It's fine. This is nothing.

248
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,320
How did that happen, though?

249
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,030
I twisted it slightly in front of the house.

250
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,370
But it turns out it was a fracture.

251
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,350
Don't worry about me.

252
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,050
You just take care of yourself there.

253
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:14,900
It finally feels like everything is working out.

254
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,450
I feel relieved now.

255
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,060
Gosh, Mom. Why are you crying?

256
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:26,540
It's because I feel sorry for you.

257
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:34,790
I wonder if all that emotional pain you went through was all because of my wrongdoings.

258
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:38,020
Gosh, Mom. You're being ridiculous.

259
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,620
You're right.

260
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,230
All I need is for you to have a good life.

261
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,740
That's all I need.

262
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:51,480
Gosh, Sarah. Congratulations.

263
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,880
My goodness. I can't believe it.

264
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:27,250
Dad. Is Chief Jo Ajumma really pregnant with your child?

265
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,020
Yes.

266
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,300
We went to the hospital together yesterday.

267
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:41,470
You have no memories of it at all. Why do you have to take responsibility for something you can't remember?

268
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Jenny, Se Chan, Se Jong.

269
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,400
Although this baby hasn't been born yet...

270
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,790
I have to love and take responsibility for that child,

271
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,510
just like how I do with you kids.

272
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,940
Because that child...

273
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,750
is also my child.

274
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:09,640
Honestly, I'm not excited about having another sibling this way.

275
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,380
I'm more heartbroken and sad that I can't be with Ms. Park anymore suddenly.

276
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,100
Me, too.

277
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:21,480
I really can't be without Ms. Park.

278
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,240
It's not something I intended,

279
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,000
and I can't even remember.

280
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,960
But I think that I have to take responsibility for what I did.

281
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,970
So although I didn't make any promises to Chief Jo Ajumma,

282
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:42,150
Ms. Park and I broke up

283
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:45,400
because Chief Jo Ajumma has my child.

284
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:54,400
I'm truly sorry that I separated you kids apart from your favorite, Ms. Park, because of me.

285
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:02,830
Dad. Did you and Ms. Park really have feelings for each other?

286
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,750
Ms. Park...

287
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,030
Ms. Park!

288
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:20,610
I miss Ms. Park!

289
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:23,770
Ms. Park!

290
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,100
Lee Se Jong! I have explained everything to you already!

291
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,390
Why are you crying again? Are you a crybaby?

292
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,120
You better stop crying!

293
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:54,110
Se Jong. I'm sorry.

294
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,990
I'm sorry, Se Jong.

295
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:10,240
Dae Beom is going to be here with Se Ryun in a bit.

296
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,700
We'll have to discuss when our families will meet.

297
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:21,100
They said they wanted to make an official introduction to you because they couldn't last time.

298
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,900
Come on, Soo Chul.

299
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,160
It is what it is now. You can't do anything about it.

300
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,620
They want to get married because they're head over heels for each other.

301
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:36,070
What are you going to do if he resents you later?

302
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,440
She's right, Son-in-law Park.

303
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,700
Just pretend to give in and allow it.

304
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,310
No parent in the world can go against their child.

305
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:51,750
- We're here.
- Grandmother, Mother-in-law, and Aunt. Hello.

306
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,690
You're here. Welcome!

307
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:56,030
You've gotten even prettier since I last saw you.

308
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,310
I guess it's because you're a bride-to-be?

309
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:01,230
Thank you.

310
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:04,790
Father-in-law. Hello.

311
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:08,850
- I'll go delivery.
- Wait...

312
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,830
- Se Ryun.
- Yes?

313
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:20,240
Would it be all right to set the meeting between families for this weekend?

314
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,210
O-okay. I will ask my family.

315
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:27,270
All right. Ask your Mother and Oppa if they're free this weekend.

316
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:30,900
If they're not, I'll have to change the reservation date for the Chinese restaurant.

317
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,960
- Let me know, okay?
- Okay.

318
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:40,970
- Everything is smooth sailing, now that you two decided to get married.
- You're right.

319
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,980
Chief Jo. Gosh, you really came.

320
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,830
Yes, Madam.

321
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,050
Which room did you prepare for me?

322
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:58,960
I didn't receive any orders from Chairman yet.

323
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,520
Gosh, what happened? She packed in a hurry to come.

324
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,910
Chief Kim. I clearly told you I'd be moving in today.

325
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,750
I'm a little hurt.

326
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:15,040
I will talk directly to Chairman. Is he here?

327
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:29,830
I'm here, Chairman. But I was told my room hadn't been prepared.

328
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,430
Chief Jo. I told you I would do my best for that child,

329
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:37,490
and that I'll fully support you financially until you give birth.

330
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:42,080
Did you have to come and make everyone uncomfortable? This isn't right.

331
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:48,760
Chairman. I will lay low while I'm here, so neither the kids nor other family members will feel uncomfortable.

332
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:53,080
The doctor said that having emotional stability was most important.

333
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,850
I want to stay here without any worries until this baby comes.

334
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:02,400
Please allow it, at least for the baby.

335
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,690
What's wrong, Chief Jo?

336
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:11,030
I'm dizzy all of a sudden.

337
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:15,200
At least let her stay in the guest room for now.

338
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,860
She's with a child.

339
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:22,290
All right, then.

340
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:28,400
- What are you doing? Clean up the guest room. Hurry!
- Oh, okay.

341
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,660
Are you okay? My gosh, Chief Jo.

342
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,560
Oh, goodness.

343
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,890
You can sleep in the Chairman's bedroom later.

344
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:45,250
Just use this room for now. It's not bad here.

345
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:48,980
Okay. I like this room.

346
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:53,070
Wait, do you know whether it's a boy or girl?

347
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,820
I didn't ask about the gender yet.

348
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,180
I guess it doesn't matter if it's a boy or girl.

349
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:02,130
The baby will a hundred percent be cute since it'll take after you and Young Gook.

350
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:05,530
I hope that will be the case.

351
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:09,840
If you were hurt by me in any way, just forget everything.

352
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,830
Regardless of everything else, I'm so happy that you're back here.

353
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:19,130
Madam. Thank you for welcoming me like this.

354
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,540
Sure.

355
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:27,400
But when did you hit the home base with Young Gook?

356
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,590
Pardon?

357
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:33,130
You always told me you failed.

358
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:36,910
How could I have talked about that with you?

359
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:41,310
I see. You couldn't tell me because you were shy.

360
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:45,090
I mean, you two went to the vacation house and an island.

361
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:51,150
It would've been more difficult for nothing to happen between a man and a woman there.

362
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:58,080
Oh, gosh. Of course!

363
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,960
Mom, I'm here.

364
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,840
- You have time this weekend, right?
- Oh, my.

365
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,990
Who are you to call me "Mom?"

366
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:13,870
- My gosh, how ridiculous.
- I'm going to have the families meet this weekend.

367
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,500
- Don't make any plans.
- Hey.

368
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:19,540
Why would I go there when I'm not even going to attend the wedding?

369
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,780
Do you think I'm in the mood to sit and have a meal with those beggars?

370
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:27,280
Mom! Don't ever use that rude term with Dae Beom's family again.

371
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,440
I'm really not going to see you then.

372
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,880
Gosh! Did I say I want to see you? You're no longer my daughter.

373
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,770
Ms. Se Ryun. You're here.

374
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:41,710
Chief Jo. Did you come to arrange flowers again?

375
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:44,420
You agreed not to come. You can't do this.

376
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:50,150
Ms. Se Ryun. Starting today, I will be staying here.

377
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:52,310
What do you mean?

378
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,880
- You, Chief Jo?
- Hey, hey.

379
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,980
Talk nicer. Chief Jo may be your new sister-in-law.

380
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:03,530
She's pregnant with your brother's child. She's three months along.

381
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:07,110
Wh-What did you say?

382
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,680
That's why Chief Jo ended up living in this house.

383
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,880
But Mom, can we believe what Chief Jo said?

384
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,790
Is the child really my brother's?

385
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,830
Oppa said he couldn't remember it.

386
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,800
What are you saying?

387
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,240
Are you saying that Chief Jo got the child with another man and pretending it's Young Gook's?

388
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,680
How can you say such a horrible thing?

389
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,710
Chief Jo didn't have a man.

390
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:37,930
Did you see if Chief Jo had a man or not?

391
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,620
If Oppa remembers that time, it's one thing.

392
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:45,050
Mom, don't we need to do the paternity test first?

393
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:50,070
Hey, Lee Se Ryun! It's illegal to do a paternity test on an embryo.

394
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,810
It's unethical.

395
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:58,050
Is it so? I think it's possible in America. Am I wrong?

396
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:01,240
The truth will be revealed when the child gets birthed in a few months.

397
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,690
Why would any woman lie about that?

398
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:06,450
Unless someone is a complete idiot.

399
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:10,170
Right, no woman would make such a lie.

400
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,540
Unless they are complete lunatics.

401
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:15,570
Yes, also Chief Jo that I know is not that bold.

402
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:18,180
She's very sweet and kind.

403
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:23,390
Then, what will happen to Oppa and Ms. Park?

404
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:27,330
What do you mean by that? Their relationship is broken now.

405
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:30,270
Ms. Park left this house yesterday.

406
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:33,370
What? Did she leave the house?

407
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:37,220
Then what will she do? Chief Jo is insisting on living here.

408
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:40,190
How can Ms. Park and Chief Jo live together?

409
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,080
It's like you can't have two suns under one sky.

410
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:48,340
But it seemed like Dae Beom's family didn't know about Ms. Park's situation.

411
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:52,510
Mom, did you hear where Ms. Park is going?

412
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,650
I bet she would've gone back to her home.

413
00:31:55,650 --> 00:32:00,740
Her home? Mom, I'll come back later.

414
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,480
Hey! I made it clear! You're not my daughter anymore!

415
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,720
I'm not going to anything, including your wedding--

416
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,050
I won't go... That girl, really...

417
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,680
You said you have something to talk about.

418
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,520
Father.

419
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:30,160
I know very well that Se Ryun's mother did wrong to you and our family.

420
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,620
Se Ryun also got hurt because of her mother's act,

421
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,240
and she suffered a lot.

422
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,260
She was very sorry to us.

423
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:44,820
Because of those reasons, we tried multiple times to break up.

424
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:48,620
But it was not possible.

425
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,100
Father,

426
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,300
if you allow us,

427
00:32:52,300 --> 00:33:00,580
the two of us will gain the courage to love each other and live well.

428
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,450
Dae Beom.

429
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:08,710
Do you love her that much?

430
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,450
Yes.

431
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,810
Okay, Dae Beom.

432
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,850
It's your choice,

433
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:25,070
and your mother likes it too, so I can't oppose it.

434
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,580
If you want to be with her that much,

435
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:31,810
go for it.

436
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:34,290
Father...

437
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:40,030
The reason why I opposed you two before was

438
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,980
that there's Dan Dan got involved,

439
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:47,470
and I was worried that you might get ill-treated by her family for the rest of your life.

440
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:51,270
I was afraid that you might be dispirited for your life.

441
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:56,060
But if you and Ms. Se Ryun can be happy together,

442
00:33:56,060 --> 00:34:02,720
I should congratulate and give my blessings to you.

443
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,110
Father...

444
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,640
Thank you.

445
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,650
Dan Dan? She didn't come here.

446
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:23,000
Why? Is she not at your family's house?

447
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,180
Why are you looking for Dan Dan here?

448
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,490
What's going on?

449
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:31,150
Did Ms. Park get shocked,

450
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,720
and did she..?

451
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:36,930
Why? Did something happen to our Dan Dan?

452
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,700
I'm home.

453
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,200
What about it with Dan Dan?

454
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,370
- I mean...
- She says Dan Dan is not at her family's house.

455
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:47,250
Where did she go?

456
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:51,660
Dan Dan is not at her family's house? What do you mean by that?

457
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:55,480
Se Ryun, did something happen to Dan Dan?

458
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,700
The thing is...

459
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:06,190
Ms. Se Ryun, did something happen to my Dan Dan?

460
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:09,140
Tell me what's going on right now.

461
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,220
The thing is...

462
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,480
Chief Jo moved back into our house,

463
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,890
so I heard that Ms. Park left the house yesterday.

464
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:24,930
Why would Dan Dan leave the house when Chief Jo moves in?

465
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:27,730
Well, that is...

466
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:34,960
Chief Jo said that she is pregnant with my brother's baby.

467
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,770
What did you just say?

468
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:49,320
Father.

469
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,880
- Father, wait.
- Let me go!

470
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,710
- Mom.
- Honey!

471
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:01,360
Tell me.

472
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:05,410
Is Chief Jo pregnant with your baby?

473
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:08,170
Is this really true?

474
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,460
I'm sorry.

475
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,900
You bastard...

476
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,960
I knew you would be like this!

477
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,300
I knew you would play around with my daughter and throw her away like this! You bastard!

478
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:24,450
- Father! Please don't do this!
- Honey, stop it.

479
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,370
I'm sorry.

480
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,480
Does apologizing make everything fine?

481
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,800
That's why I told you that you couldn't be with my Dan Dan!

482
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,100
How can a dirty person like you

485
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:43,400
- Father, please...
- Honey, why are you acting like this?

486
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,750
I knew you would do this, and that's why I opposed you!

487
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:51,250
You said you would take care of her, and now what are you going to do? You bastard!

488
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,120
Father, please calm down!

489
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,130
Where is Dan Dan?

490
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,620
If something happens to her, I'm not going to forgive you until I die!

491
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,280
You bastard!

492
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,280
Honey, let's go.

493
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:09,470
What happened to Ms. Park?

494
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,150
Yes, Se Ryun. It's me.

495
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:21,790
Did Ms. Park not go to her home?

496
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:25,620
No. So everybody went out to find Ms. Park.

497
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,360
Do you think something might have happened to her?

498
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:32,360
She's not picking up her phone or coming home.

499
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,220
Oppa, whatever it takes,

500
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,330
we have to find Ms. Park.

501
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:39,040
Hurry up, Oppa.

502
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,830
Okay, I'll look for her.

503
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:43,960
Se Ryun, if she calls you or comes home,

504
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,550
please let me know right away.

505
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,740
Where did Ms. Park go?

506
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,590
Honey, are you out of your mind?

507
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:02,240
You should've done it in words. Why did you grab the future in-law by his collar?

508
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,390
We have to do the families meeting for Dae Beom soon. Why don't you think of Dae Beom at all?

509
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:10,810
How am I supposed to stand still when that bastard broke my Dan Dan's heart like that?

510
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:14,020
Why are you acting like this when Dan Dan came out of his house as you wished?

511
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,510
Don't you need to thank Chairman Lee in a way?

512
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:20,620
What are you going to do with the pre-wedding gathering now?

513
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:26,270
Is the pre-wedding gathering the issue right now? Dan Dan is missing!

514
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:30,140
Mom, stop it! Father is upset about Dan Dan's situation.

515
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,400
- Father! Father!
- My goodness...

516
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,800
Aigo... Can't you choose your words wisely?

517
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,760
He's worried about Dan Dan, who's missing.

518
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:47,810
But how can you yell at him about the pre-wedding gathering?

519
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:50,250
Is that gathering the issue right now?

520
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:53,010
I'm very upset, too.

521
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:56,340
She liked Chairman Lee so much that she had a saga with her dad.

522
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:59,470
And this Chief Jo woman came out pregnant.

523
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,150
I feel like I can die, even in my perspective.

524
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:07,790
Mom, do you think Dan Dan is having bad thoughts right now?

525
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:11,160
Aigo, don't say such things!

526
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,800
Our Dan Dan won't do such a thing.

527
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,290
But does Chairman Lee really don't remember?

528
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,680
When Chairman Lee doesn't remember,

529
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,280
is that baby really his child?

530
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,770
Why would anyone make that kind of lie?

531
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:35,940
Yes, Lawyer Koh, please look for her. I'll go to that beach where she went, just in case.

532
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,470
Let me know right away when you find her.

533
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,110
Yes.

534
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,280
What brings you here?

535
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,490
I brought you some date tea that I made.

536
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:53,280
But are you going out at this hour?

537
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,450
I'll be back later.

Yes, it's me.

If I'm there, it'll only make things more hard and uncomfortable for everyone.

589
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,420
I'll do it.

Yes.

597
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:32,250
I think Dan Dan is really hurt, even though it happened while Chairman was 22 years old and he has no memory of it.

598
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:37,010

00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:35,850
Soo Chul.

646
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:40,200
Thank you.

647
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:56,840
What? You want to skip having the families meet and get married right away?

648
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,910
Oppa is currently having a mental breakdown.

649
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:04,570
I think it's going to be tough for him to see you or Father-in-law.

650
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:10,020
That's true. Now isn't the time to have the families meet.

651
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:14,350
We even thought about skipping the wedding, but it's a once-in-a-lifetime event.

652
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:20,730
So for the wedding, we decided to only invite close acquaintances and have a small, simple wedding.

653
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:25,380
Gosh, what is this? It's really upsetting.

654
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:29,170
The trend nowadays is to have a small wedding anyway.

655
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:32,610
They just need to have a wedding, that's it.

656
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:37,420
We are really okay with it. Just the people who want to congratulate us can come and do it.

657
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:42,550
Which is why I'm going to tell my mom and Oppa not to come if they don't want to.

658
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:45,600
- What?
- What? Gosh.

659
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,290
All right. Your generation is so easygoing.

660
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:53,860
That's the right mindset. Rather than forcing someone to come all upset,

661
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:57,820
it's better to only have people who are happy to come and congratulate you.

662
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:01,020
That's the right way to do it.

663
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:07,460
So, Grandmother, Mother-in-law, and Aunt. Don't worry at all.

664
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:11,750
Here. It's our wedding invitation.

665
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:13,100
You got them already.

666
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:17,660
Don't feel pressured. Only come if you want to.

667
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,000
It's pretty.

668
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,430
- It's pretty, right?
- It is.

669
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:24,930
Honey!

670
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:28,730
They're going to get married right away instead of having the families meet first.

671
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:31,580
Come look at their wedding invitation.

672
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:34,300
Is that so? All right then.

673
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:42,510
They said only to come if you want to. You don't have to go if you don't want to.

674
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:43,890
Come on.

675
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:48,470
He's already upset because of Dan Dan. That's enough.

676
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:53,950
At least he allowed Dae Beom to get married. That's good enough.

677
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:58,110
I'm a little worried about our families seeing each other at the wedding as well.

678
00:51:58,110 --> 00:52:01,720
Because of what happened with Dan Dan...

679
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:06,580
Should I really ask your dad not to come to the wedding?

680
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:08,690
Mom.

681
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:19,110
Hey. Your brother has been drinking every day since Ms. Park left.

682
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:23,200
Don't even dream about having your brother attend your wedding.

683
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,030
Ms. Park is sick in bed too.

684
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:32,040
Really? Gosh, the energy is really unsettling.

685
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:36,670
I mean, it'd be nice for him to like Chief Jo in times like this. I wonder why he can't do that?

686
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:39,120
She's even pregnant with his child.

687
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,000
It's not something he can control.

688
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,800
Gosh, god is really a prankster.

689
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,860
Why did he make love so hard?

690
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:51,670
If A likes B, then he should just make them like each other.

691
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:54,380
But B likes C and C likes D.

692
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:58,390
Seriously, god is such a perv--

693
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,940
Life is so difficult.

694
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:03,530
Mom. It's my wedding invitation.

695
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:05,330
You're going to come to my wedding, right?

696
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:07,080
Hey, hey, hey!

697
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:10,420
- Do you seriously think I'll go to your wedding?
- Gosh, Mom!

698
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,710
- Hey!
- Don't rip it.

699
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:19,290
Don't worry, Ms. Se Ryun.

700
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:24,360
I will take Madam with me to your wedding.

701
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:29,040
You're going to come to my wedding, Chief Jo?

702
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:33,250
I think that will make a lot of people uncomfortable.

703
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:35,780
Let's just agree for you not to come.

704
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,860
Jung Woo.

705
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:57,540
I guess this blood that runs through my body. I can't wash it away.

706
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:00,700
Darn genetics.

707
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:07,350
I at least had the confidence not to live like my father.

708
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:15,200
But I'm the same kind of person as my father, who I hated and despised so much.

709
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,830
Young Gook.

710
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:23,990
Even if I went back to being an immature 22-year-old, this shouldn't have happened.

711
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:27,760
I just can't understand myself.

712
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:33,860
I was told that I clearly liked Ms. Park even when I was 22 years old.

713
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:40,310
It's clear even when I look at the texts I sent her.

714
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:47,200
But apparently, I was two-timing her with Chief Jo.

715
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,870
What kind of bullshit is this?

716
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:54,890
You told me to ignore it because I can't remember, right?

717
00:54:54,890 --> 00:55:00,970
How can I ignore it? She's claiming to be pregnant with my child.

718
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,870
Ms. Park.

719
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:24,380
No matter what moment comes and happens.

720
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:27,430
Can you trust me?

721
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:30,830
Of course.

722
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,950
I trust you, Chairman.

723
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:43,930
That's right. It's not true.

724
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:46,640
It's not.

725
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,940
Chairman!

726
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:02,890
Chairman.

727
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:09,490
I thought I was hallucinating because I was drunk.

728
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:13,060
Why are you here, Ms. Park?

729
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:15,370
I wanted to apologize to you.

730
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:18,540
I'm really sorry, Chairman.

731
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,530
Ms. Park.

732
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:25,720
I'm the one who wronged you. Why are you sorry?

733
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:31,560
No matter if I apologize to you a hundred or a thousand times...

734
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:35,120
I can't erase the scar I gave you.

735
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:39,570
No, that's not true. I'm sorry.

736
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:45,530
I told you I would trust you no matter what happens. But I couldn't do that.

737
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:50,260
I trust you, Chairman.

738
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:53,460
I trust you.

739
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:54,530
Ms. Park.

740
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:58,190
You're not someone who would do that!

741
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:05,590
When you turned 22, you clearly told me you only liked me.

742
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:08,980
There's no way you would've done that with Chief Jo.

743
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:14,670
Something... something isn't right.

744
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:21,850
Ms. Park. Listen carefully.

745
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:26,470
I'm a jerk, and I'm trash.

746
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:32,450
So forget about a punk like me and don't even look this way.

747
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:35,910
Leave. Quickly.

748
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,300
No!

749
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,740
You are not that kind of person, Chairman!

750
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:48,310
You are not!

751
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:17,670
One, two, three.

752
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:20,410
One, two, three.

753
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:24,900
Dae Beom.

754
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,860
What's wrong, Dae Beom?

755
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,750
It's just...

756
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:34,940
Your beauty is so blinding that I can't see.

757
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:37,680
You. Why are you so pretty?

758
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,120
Gosh, stop it.

759
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:47,620
Se Ryun. No flower in this world can beat your beauty.

760
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:51,950
Gosh, I can't listen to this.

761
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:58,590
I'm seriously getting goosebumps. Don't you think you're being too cheesy?

762
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:01,450
Uncle. I learned a skill from you today.

763
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:03,650
Se Jong. Memorize that line, okay?

764
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:05,760
I'm sure a day will come when you'll use it.

765
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,450
Okay, Hyung.

766
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:09,250
It's blinding.

767
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,610
Jenny, Se Chan, Se Jong. Let's take a picture.

768
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:13,530
- Come here.
- Okay!

769
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:15,910
- All right, come here.
- I'll go here.

770
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:18,190
- All right.
- Okay, get into position.

771
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:21,110
I'll take the picture now. Smile.

772
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:24,070
One, two, three.

773
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:26,620
Put up a V sign. Everyone, say cheese!

774
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:29,150
- Cheese.
- Cheese!

775
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,640
I brought everyone's gift.

776
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,310
- It's enough to pay rent.
- Aigoo, thank you.

777
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:38,430
Your son is very handsome!

778
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:40,570
Thank you.

779
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:43,690
Can't you smile? You're not at a funeral home.

780
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:45,520
Hello.

781
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:57,130
Gosh, she looks like she's dying. It's understandable since she was robbed of her daughter by a family like ours.

782
00:59:57,130 --> 01:00:02,710
Will the golden calves come into our household once this wedding is over?

783
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:06,770
Look at her smiling ear to ear because she's so happy.

784
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:10,110
Oh, yes. Thank you.

785
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:14,030
Thank you.

786
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:22,220
I can't believe those beggars are my in-laws.

787
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:53,460
Dan Dan. Go on in.

788
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,650
Go with me.

789
01:00:58,150 --> 01:01:00,790
Hey, Dan Dan.

790
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:09,630
Look at this mess we're in because Se Ryun and Young Gook got involved with that parasitic family.

791
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:14,060
This is all because of that wench Mrs. Jang, the pillar of this parasitic family.

792
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:16,620
My life is all messed up because of that wench's evil scheme.

793
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:19,610
Hold on. That con woman, Mrs. Jang.

794
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:22,270
Why don't I see her?

795
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:32,410
Sit here, Dan Dan.

796
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:04,020
- The wedding will begin soon.
- Hasn't your sister arrived yet?

797
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:06,170
All the guests, please come in and get seated.

798
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:07,430
Older-sister-in-law! Hurry up.

799
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:09,340
You're here.

800
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:13,340
Younger-sister-in-law. The traffic was so bad when I left the salon.

801
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:14,850
The wedding didn't start yet, right?

802
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:17,140
Not yet. Hurry up and go in.

803
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,900
Younger-sister-in-law.

804
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:21,030
Congratulations, okay?

805
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:24,370
Thank you, Older-sister-in-law.

806
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:27,320
Hey. Jang Mi Sook.

807
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:32,990
You head con-woman. Are you happy things worked out your way?

808
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:35,230
Mrs. Wang.

809
01:02:35,230 --> 01:02:39,100
What did you just say?

810
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:41,160
Head con-woman?

811
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,270
That's right! That's who you are.

812
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:49,770
I guess you expected you'd rake some profit if you married him to Se Ryun.

813
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:52,160
Not in a million years!

814
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,420
- You beggars!
- Hey!

815
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:56,870
You! How dare you insult us?

816
01:02:56,870 --> 01:03:01,530
You're acting with no class, just like the class-less mistress you were.

817
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:03,570
What? Mistress?

818
01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:05,720
- Hey!
- Hey! Did you just call me a mistress?

819
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:08,650
How dare you call me that when you're the head con-woman.

820
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:10,310
Hey!!

821
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:11,720
- Hey!
- Gosh, let go of this.

822
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:14,390
- Use your words.
- You too!

823
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:15,920
- What are you doing?
- You!

824
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,920
You ruined my life by seducing my daughter!

825
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,230
You mistress!

826
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:30,050
- Hey!
- Mom!

827
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:32,260
Don't do this, Mom! Why are you doing this?

828
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:34,030
Don't do this, Mom.

829
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:36,650
Good, you're here.

830
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:40,570
- Madam!
- You can't! You can't marry him even in death!

831
01:03:40,570 --> 01:03:43,010
- Mom.
- Let's leave now. Run away with me!

832
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:45,540
Mom! Don't do this!

833
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:51,280
Se Ryun, no!

834
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,540
Dae Beom!

835
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:03,450
What are you doing!

836
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:19,270
We will now begin the wedding ceremony of the groom, Park Dae Beom, and bride Lee Se Ryun.

837
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:23,690
This wedding is the conclusion to their love that overcame many hardships.

838
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:27,300
So everyone, please welcome them with a big round of applause.

839
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:30,250

859
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:14,710
Families of the bride and groom come out to the front.

860
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:18,170
Please stand next to the bride and groom.

861
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:26,450
Jenny and Se Chan. Where is Se Jong?

862
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:31,170
He was here until just now.

863
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:33,870
Hurry up and look for Se Jong.

864
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:40,780

- Dad, I'll go this way.
- Me, too.

Lee Se Jong!

875
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:11,990
Did you find Se Jong?

876
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:14,430
Yes, Chairman. I found Se Jong.

877
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:17,850
He went to the bathroom by himself.

878
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:21,340
Okay. I'll go there now.

879
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:41,050
Going down.

880
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:50,970
Door closing.

881
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:56,920
Ms. Park. Get on.

882
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:23,030
What's going on?

883
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:27,440
Ms. Park. It's okay. Stay calm.

884
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:30,680
Hello?

885
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:33,040
The elevator stopped. Please hurry over.

886
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:36,540
Oh, okay. Hang in there for a moment.

887
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:38,230
You heard him, right?

888
01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:43,440
He'll be here soon, so don't worry. Nothing is going to happen.

889
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:45,860
Okay.

Chairman.

893
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,190
It's fine. You'll be fine.

894
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:13,950
Nothing is going to happen.

895

I'm sorry.

901
01:09:44,290 --> 01:09:46,780
No. Don't be sorry.

[Young Lady and Gentleman]

911
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:43,790
I trust you one hundred percent, Chairman. Why do we have to break up?

912
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:46,370
I think Chief Jo must be lying.

913
01:10:46,370 --> 01:10:48,190
What in the world are you saying?

914
01:10:48,190 --> 01:10:51,210
What kind of woman in this world would lie about her child?

915
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:52,300
Have some cake and milk.

916
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:54,080
Stop bothering me.

917
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:54,930
Ms. Park!

918
01:10:54,930 --> 01:10:56,340
Se Chan and Se Jong are here.

919
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:57,850
Let's go get Se Jong and Se Chan together.

920
01:10:57,850 --> 01:11:00,680
Ajumma! Se Jong is sick because of you!

921
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:02,350
Hey, Lee Jenny! Are you going to speak to me that way?

922
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:05,260
I'm pregnant with your sibling. If you can't call me Mom at the very least—

923
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:07,450
Mom? Do you think you're my mom?

924
01:11:07,450 --> 01:11:10,060
- Dan Dan.
- Hyun Bin Sunbae! When did you get back?

925
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:12,160
Just now. I brought you back a souvenir.

926
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:13,280
Thank you, Sunbae.

927
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:17,770
I trust you, Chairman. But why can't you trust yourself?

928
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:20,110
You are not someone who would do that, Chairman!

929
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:23,000
What is this memory?
