[Episode 37]

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,130
Chairman.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,710
Do you like it?

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,740
I put all my effort into choosing it.

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:20,100
Yes, it's so pretty.

6
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,220
Let me put it on you.

7
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,630
I was worried if it didn't fit,

8
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,220
but it fits perfectly.

9
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,000
But why are you giving me a ring all of a sudden?

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,600
Now I have the courage to tell everyone that you are the one I'm dating.

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,040
I want to date you officially now.

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,140
What do you think, Ms. Park?

13
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,260
Is it too fast to finish secret dating?

14
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,030
No, no.

15
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,260
I am always ready anytime.

16
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,560
I said I was waiting for you.

17
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,760
If you are good, I like everything too.

18
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,810
Ms. Park. Thank you for waiting,

19
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:41,370
and sorry for the trouble I've caused you until now.

20
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,720
It's enough that you know.

21
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,890
I'm going to give you a hard time as you've given me.

22
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,920
Prepare for it.

23
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,400
Sure.

24
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,360
I don't mind you giving me a hard time. But because you're dating me,

25
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,090
I worry you will go through an uncomfortable and difficult time like before.

26
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,420
I wouldn't have jumped into our relationship if I weren't prepared for it.

27
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,750
Please don't worry about me.

28
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,970
Then are we now

29
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:22,800
allowed to hold hands anywhere?

30
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,810
Yes. Let's hold hands until we get tired of it.

31
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,610
Yes.

32
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:33,080
♫ I think of it seriously about this sometimes ♫

33
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,210
♫ I'll always be by your side ♫

34
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,280
The ring is so, so pretty.

35
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,870
Do you like it that much?

36
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,630
Yes, I like it so much.

37
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,130
This ring shows your heart about me.

38
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,400
With no prompting from me,

39
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,070
you bought the ring on your initiative.

40
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,030
You know ten things when I tell you one thing.

41
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,310
Now you are qualified to become my boyfriend.

42
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,400
Thank you for complimenting me.

43
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,020
Ah, by the way, Chairman,

44
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,350
I don't care about anyone else.

45
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,720
But when it comes to Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong,

46
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,780
I worry about what they would think when they know we are dating.

47
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,710
So I thought we should all go to the vacation home tomorrow

48
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,440
for Se Jong's birthday and tell them after having a good time.

49
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,840
Is that okay?

50
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,520
Yes.

51
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,380
But I'm nervous.

52
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,030
Don't be.

53
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,400
You only have to trust and follow me from now on.

54
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,220
Ms. Park, what are you doing?

55
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,200
Why are you swinging hands so wildly?

56
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,810
People might look at us.

57
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,990
As long as we like it, who cares?

58
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,750
I want to do this today.

59
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,370
And I want to yell out into the world.

60
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:06,300
We are dating for real from today!

61
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,390
Ms. Park. Please don't do this. People are looking at us.

62
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,580
We are really in a relationship from today!

63
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,810
It's official now!

64
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:21,890
Everyone! The gentleman standing there is my boyfriend.

65
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,220
Please come quick, boyfriend!

66
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,720
Okay.

67
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,320
This is the new sauce Dae Beom developed.

68
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,440
Please give it a taste.

69
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,200
Right off, the color looks nice.

70
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,460
Yes, it does.

71
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,850
It tastes good, too. It's delicious!

72
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,930
It's good. I think this will be a hit.

73
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,970
Really? Are you saying that because we are a family?

74
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,830
No, no. She's not saying that because she's your mom.

75
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,790
It's delicious. It's very good.

76
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,600
Hey!!

77
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,640
Hey, you! Jang Mi Sook, were you a crook?

78
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,820
You crooks!

79
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,740
Hey, you've planned everything from the beginning with these people, haven't you?

80
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,740
That's why you ruined my Se Ryun's wedding, too!

81
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:16,710
Hey, what kind of grudge do you have on me for you to do that to my Se Ryun!

82
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,980
Please let go!

83
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,570
Let go of her!

84
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,100
Hey, you! I'm going to sue you!

85
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,060
Let me go! I will sue you!

86
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,720
- What the heck is wrong with her?
- Are you okay?

87
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,090
Are you alright, Sister-in-law?

88
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,090
- Water, please.
- Yes, water!

89
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,550
Hey, Driver Cha! Do you want to be fired?

90
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,590
Aigoo, aigoo, Geon.

91
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,280
You shouldn't do this.

92
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,410
Be gentle.

93
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,750
My god! You scoundrels!

94
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:54,100
I will sue all of you.

95
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,470
Yes, go for it.

96
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,290
No, I will call the police for you.

97
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,870
I will report the person throwing violence at someone else's business.

98
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,980
Yes, go ahead and report me. I will put you all in jail!

99
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,790
- Is this the police?
- Geon, stop it.

100
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,190
Someone is throwing violence at our business.

101
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,200
Please hurry and come.

102
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,520
This is ridiculous. I won't let you get out of this!

103
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,710
I'm sorry. She ran away when she heard me talking to you.

104
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,010
Yes, thank you.

105
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,950
What if you get fired acting like that with her?

106
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,640
You should have restrained yourself.

107
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,740
How could I when she disrupts our store?

108
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:38,190
But why does that woman comes here and act up like that?

109
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,270
Did she eat something wrong?

110
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:44,310
Why did she grab our innocent in-law's hair like that?

111
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,270
Madam Wang really went overboard.

112
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:49,300
How can a human being do that?

113
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,670
Mom, I'm going back to work.

114
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,440
My lunch break is almost over.

115
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,260
Okay.

116
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,300
Bye, Uncle.

117
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,710
Let's go inside, Grandma.

118
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:04,230
What if your uncle loses his job over this?

119
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,700
It wasn't easy for him to get that job.

120
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,720
It won't happen. Let's go inside.

121
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:17,280
What? This is not the first time?

122
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,940
No, Sister-in-law.

123
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,650
Because Dae Beom was dating her daughter, Se Ryun.

124
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,540
They truly loved each other by meeting accidentally.

125
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:31,610
But she thought we all conspired so that Dae Beom could snag her.

126
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,010
Don't even let me start on this.

127
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,720
She thumped into our house with her shoes on,

128
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,460
and she told us to take her money and get lost.

129
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,440
She threw bundles of cash on Son-in-law Park.

130
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,640
Oh, my world.

131
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,510
And she repeatedly called us parasites, gigolo, and beggars.

132
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,090
No matter how great they think of themselves.

133
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,410
How could she condescend and stump on others like that?

134
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,470
I had no idea that was happening.

135
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:02,610
I never in my dream knew that our Dae Beom was dating Se Ryun.

136
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:10,090
If I knew, I wouldn't have arranged Se Ryun to Jinsa Group's son.

137
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,750
Sister-in-law, we are really fine.

138
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,850
Who cares if she's a daughter of a rich family?

139
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,990
We don't want them to get married when we are ill-treated like this.

140
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,980
But, that Madam.

141
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,720
Was she acting up like that

142
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:29,250
because you told her daughter the guy she almost got married to has a hidden child?

143
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,690
Yes.

144
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,250
She somehow found out that I'm Soo Chul's sister.

145
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,450
And she must be thinking that I intentionally screwed up Se Ryun's wedding.

146
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:41,430
Or she may be thinking I'm trying to reconnect Dae Beom and Se Ryun.

147
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,860
Oh, even so!

148
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,930
The guy was hiding a seven-year-old daughter.

149
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,840
How could she act like that over telling the truth?

150
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,970
I don't get it.

151
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:57,270
Because of the former Chairman's will, her daughter has to be married to get company shares.

152
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,630
She wanted to spend the money from the shares by getting her daughter married.

153
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,210
But since that's failed.

154
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,350
Oh my, no matter how much she loves money!

155
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,780
How can a mom think of selling her daughter?

156
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,460
Even though I have nothing,

157
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,770
I've never thought of selling my daughter, even a little bit.

158
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,790
Se Ryun, Se Ryun! Mrs. Jang deceived us from the beginning.

159
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:35,260
Mrs. Jang was that parasite family's Driver Park's sister. She was that gigolo's aunt!

160
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,990
They planned the whole thing from the beginning and approached us!

161
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:44,940
That's why she told you that Seung Ho has a child to break up your wedding!

162
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,420
Mom. Are you saying she lied about Seung Ho's hidden daughter when there was none?

163
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,600
- Is that it?
- No!

164
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,440
It could have been papered over.

165
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,160
- But she snitched it to you that he has a daughter!
- Mom!

166
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,130
Why are you doing this?

167
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:04,720
Are you saying you wanted me to marry Seung Ho without knowing that until the end?

168
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,260
All because of that some company's share?

169
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,770
Right. You don't even need your daughter.

170
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,380
All you need is my company shares.

171
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,280
No! That's not what I mean, Se Ryun.

172
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,070
Please tell your brother you made a mistake.

173
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,050
And ask for half of the shares at least.

174
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:25,150
Why do you give the money away? It's yours and ours!

175
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:29,860
Mom, we've lived fine without the shares.

176
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,760
Those shares were never ours.

177
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,890
What do you mean that weren't ours?

178
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:43,120
My dad did not want to give us those shares.

179
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,040
Mom, please admit it now.

180
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,750
Dad never, never--!

181
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,100
What are you trying to say?

182
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,060
Tell me. Finish your sentence!

183
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,660
Please give it all up and forget about it! Those are not ours.

184
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,150
How can I forget? How do I give up?

185
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,230
Why did you ever meet my dad?

186
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,490
You didn't even love him! Why!

187
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,880
What did you say?

188
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,460
My dad knew it.

189
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,320
He didn't love you as well.

190
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,340
He didn't trust you.

191
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,920
That's why all of this happened.

192
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:29,080
She's a part of the Lee clan too.

193
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,730
That heartless and cold Lee clan...

194
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,470
Chairman, the ring...

195
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,070
is so pretty!

196
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:49,420
Even when I look at it over and over, it's so pretty.

197
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,760
Were you still looking at the ring?

198
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,740
Yes. Because it's so nice and pretty.

199
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,780
If I had known you would have liked it this much, I would have bought it earlier.

200
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,660
Should I buy you another one?

201
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,340
Should I fill all ten of your fingers with them?

202
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,170
Chairman!

203
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:13,260
Right, silly me.

204
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:17,980
I called you to talk about what to do for Se Jong's birthday party tomorrow.

205
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,620
What should we do for the birthday party tomorrow?

206
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,650
I'll prepare all the food for the birthday party.

207
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,450
So don't worry about it.

208
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:29,550
I will be a "Yosaeknam" tomorrow.

209
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:33,820
Chairman, how do you know such a word?

210
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,570
Excuse me, Ms. Park. Who do you think I am?

211
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,770
It means a sexy(saek) man(nam) who cooks(yori).

212
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:44,170
I may not seem like it, but I am the Chairman of the FT Group that leads the trends of South Korea.

213
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:48,530
Did you think I would not know such a basic term like that?

214
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,970
All right.

215
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,610
Yosaeknam Chairman, I'll look forward to tomorrow.

216
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,750
Ms. Park...

217
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,210
Dream... of me tonight.

218
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:07,110
Let's... meet in our dreams.

219
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,060
Chairman!

220
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:17,480
Ms. Park, don't laugh. I warned you.

221
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,890
All right.

222
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:23,660
Because I appreciate your efforts,

223
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:28,060
I'll also give you a present.

224
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,730
Present? What present?

225
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,150
What did you say?

226
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:49,110
Ms. Park, what was that?

227
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,870
Never mind.

228
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,920
Chairman, what are you, really?

229
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,550
When I throw it, you should catch it. What good is a kiss?

230
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,910
You have a long way to go, Chairman.

231
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,870
You have a lot to learn. I'm hanging up!

232
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,470
Ms. Park, Ms. Park!

233
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,630
A kiss?

234
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:16,450
Was it for here?

235
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:21,660
Or here? She should have told me before hanging up.

236
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,110
Madam, Mrs. Jang is here to see you.

237
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,130
Who?

238
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,110
Mrs. Wang, I'm here.

239
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,780
I have something important to talk about with her.

240
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,380
I don't need tea.

241
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,480
Yes. I'll leave you two talk then.

242
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,060
What?

243
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,370
How dare you come here?

244
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,040
Leave, leave.

245
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,610
I came because it seems that you have a lot of misunderstandings about me.

246
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,260
We have to resolve them.

247
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:15,630
What are you doing at someone's house, even locking the door?

248
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,760
I have nothing to say to you.

249
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,070
Get lost, you crook.

250
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,620
That's right. I am Park Soo Chul's sister

251
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,030
and Park Dae Beom's aunt.

252
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:28,990
But, I only recently met my younger brother.

253
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,100
I told you before

254
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,590
that I lost my brother when I was young.

255
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:39,630
But, I reunited that brother after 50 years,

256
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,060
and that brother is Soo Chul.

257
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,960
So I only recently found out

258
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,180
about Dae Beom dating Se Ryun.

259
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:54,300
I have never intentionally deceived you.

260
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,580
Do you call that an excuse?

261
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,900
And my brother Soo Chul is not a parasite,

262
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,340
and Dae Beom is not a womanizer.

263
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:07,080
Even my brother did not know at first

264
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,290
that Dae Beom and Se Ryun were seeing each other.

265
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:12,610
Do I have to listen to this absurd excuse?

266
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,000
Leave right now!

267
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,200
- Hey, Wang Dae Ran!
- Oh my.

268
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,400
Is this woman crazy?

269
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,930
I explained everything to you.

270
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:26,260
If you believe me or not, that's up to you.

271
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,260
But Wang Dae Ran, you!

272
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,430
If you cause a scene at my brother's house or store ever again,

273
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:35,500
I will go to see Chairman Lee Young Gook.

274
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:40,110
If not that, you! I'm going to sue you.

275
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:43,580
It'd be much better if you didn't act in such a lowly way from now on.

276
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,860
Got it?

277
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,140
Big Egg.

278
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:57,230
Don't live your life like that.

279
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,280
Oh, my...

280
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,930
She's crazy.

281
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,500
How do I kill her? How can I kill her?

282
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,050
She's really crazy.

283
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,480
I'm so scared.

284
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:26,780
Woah, that feels good. I feel refreshed.

285
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,720
I dare you to try to bother

286
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,760
Soo Chul or Dae Beom again.

287
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,260
Oh my, look who it is! It's Chief Jo.

288
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,720
Have you been well, Mrs. Yeoju?

289
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,440
I've been curious about how you have been.

290
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,080
But what brings you here?

291
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,420
I've been well.

292
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,750
I was passing by somewhere near here.

293
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,730
And I remembered that today is Se Jong's birthday.

294
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,970
I've never forgotten the children's birthdays.

295
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:54,090
So I brought some presents for Se Jong.

296
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,510
He's back from kindergarten, right?

297
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,700
Oh, I see.

298
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,040
But what should I do?

299
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:09,150
Se Jong went to the vacation house with the Chairman, Ms. Park, Jenny, and Se Chan.

300
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:14,420
They all went to the vacation house with Ms. Park and the Chairman?

301
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:37,580
♫ A smile blooms in every step ♫

302
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:42,260
♫ It's a shiny day because of you ♫

303
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,730
♫  It's sunshine day  ♫

304
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:50,310
Se Jong, happy birthday!

305
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:53,970
Let's go, let's go!

306
00:19:53,970 --> 00:20:00,000
♫ You're the only one that I was looking for ♫

307
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,170
It's so delicious!

308
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,800
♫ Woo, you are always my love ♫

309
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,840
♫ I feel love, only you ♫

310
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,360
♫ It is definitely love ♫

311
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,910
♫ It is breezy wind ♫

312
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:27,620
♫ Woo, you are my love ♫

313
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,010
Se Jong, you did it great!

314
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,460
Since when have you two been together?

315
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,710
Well...

316
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,050
It hasn't been that long.

317
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,540
Dad, I'm a bit sad.

318
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:58,010
You know how much I've tried to get you two together.

319
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:02,800
You should have told Se Jong and me first.

320
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,460
Don't you think you should recognize our efforts?

321
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,170
What is he saying?

322
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,590
Actually, Se Chan and Se Jong knew that we liked each other

323
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,350
and made plans to bring us together.

324
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:21,200
When we met at the book store, we held hands on the street, and the fire in the warehouse.

325
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,880
All of that was because Se Chan and Se Jong tried to get us together.

326
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,870
Is that all true, Se Chan?

327
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:33,410
Yes. And I'm so happy that you are together now.

328
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,740
Dad! And Ms. Park.

329
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:41,100
I congratulate you sincerely on being a boyfriend and girlfriend.

330
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:49,650
But, when will you formally make your relationship public?

331
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,760
We were planning on telling you all tonight.

332
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,650
When your sister is in a good mood.

333
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:58,160
So, Se Chan, can you keep it a secret until then?

334
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,620
Yes. I understand what you are saying.

335
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,900
Noona is in puberty, so if you get on the wrong side of her, you will be in trouble.

336
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:09,830
If you need an alibi for your love story, please use me.

337
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:13,710
I will now excuse myself for you two.

338
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,430
What was that? I'm so embarrassed.

339
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:25,300
This is why I told you not to hold my hands at any time.

340
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:31,250
What? You held my hand first before we had the hot dog.

341
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,020
That is true...

342
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:41,760
We were going to tell the kids anyway. It's better this way.

343
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,300
I'm not okay with getting caught by Se Chan of us holding hands.

344
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,130
It's embarrassing.

345
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:53,130
Okay. I'm the guilty one for holding your hand.

346
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,500
No...

347
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,240
How am I going to look at Se Chan from now on?

348
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:15,140
I thought they were here, but why are all the lights out?

349
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,290
Did they go somewhere else?

350
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,280
- That was great!
- Yes, it was so much fun.

351
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:25,240
It was so much fun.

352
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,750
- It was so much fun!
- Let's go there again.

353
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,120
Yes.

354
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,640
- Dad, I'm hungry.
- Me, too!

355
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,480
Dad, what are we having for dinner?

356
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,250
Wait a little bit. I've prepared everything.

357
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,650
I will show you what a Yosaeknam is.

358
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:48,320
Yosaeknam? Dad, where did you learn that word from?

359
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,040
You are really funny these days.

360
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,930
What is Yosaeknam?

361
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:56,040
You don't have to know, Lee Se Jong.

362
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:01,160
I want to know. Please tell me!

363
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,520
Please tell me!

364
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,860
Tell me!

365
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,860
Dad, go get Lee Se Jong!

366
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,690
Please tell me!

367
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,220
Se Chan.

368
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:18,600
Don't be embarrassed. I didn't see anything.

369
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,650
- Se Jong!
- Should we go inside?

370
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:29,010
- Yes.
- Let's go!

371
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,230
What is going on here?

372
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:39,950
How can he bring just Ms. Park without Mrs. Yeoju?

373
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:57,660
Your dad grilled sweet potatoes, onions, asparagus,

374
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:02,110
- and mushrooms. So eat a little of everything, okay?
- Yes!

375
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,750
Chairman, please come and eat.

376
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:08,280
Yes, I will. Please sit down.

377
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,910
The way you look after us with the apron on

378
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:17,640
makes me feel like you've become our mom.

379
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:23,310
Se Jong. You can't say things like that even in jest.

380
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:26,450
That's not proper etiquette toward Ms. Park.

381
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,740
Se Jong, you are making Ms. Park feel uncomfortable by saying things like that.

382
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,510
I got it, Noona.

383
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:43,110
Dad, Ms. Park! Let's do cheers before we eat.

384
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:46,050
Shall we?

385
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:50,590
Let's stay happy and healthy like this throughout the year. Cheers!

386
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,860
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

387
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,910
It's delicious.

388
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:58,730
How do you like the food I prepared for you?

389
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:02,250
- They are very good.
- You are the best, Dad!

390
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:05,640
Dad, it tastes better than the food from a restaurant.

391
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,130
I admit that you are a Yosaeknam!

392
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,990
We admit it, too!

393
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,840
Thank you.

394
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,280
Dad, let's do cheers again.

395
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,830
Okay, let's do it.

396
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,350
Cheers!

397
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:25,620
- Please eat, Ms. Park.
- You, too.

398
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,020
Is it good?

399
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,360
Yes.

400
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,810
Can I have one more of this?

401
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:40,430
It's so good!

402
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:03,480
Is Jenny sleeping?

403
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:09,790
Yes, I think she got tired from having so much fun that she fell asleep quickly.

404
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,870
How about Se Chan and Se Jong?

405
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:18,710
They also fell asleep as soon as they laid down.

406
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:24,070
Ms. Park, do you want to go for a walk and star gazing?

407
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:30,170
Yes, that sounds good. I'll see you in five minutes.

408
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,260
Right.

409
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,970
I guess there was no need for Mrs. Yeoju to come too.

410
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,930
The children have grown up now.

411
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:51,220
Chairman must be sleeping with Se Jong and Se Chan.

412
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,290
And Ms. Park with Jenny.

413
00:27:55,290 --> 00:28:00,830
What could possibly happen when they are with the children?

414
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,020
Why did he come out?

415
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,020
What's going on?

416
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:31,660
Why is that wench coming out?

417
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,810
Aren't you cold?

418
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:49,180
I'm not cold.

419
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:53,250
- Look at the stars.
- They are gorgeous.

420
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:01,630
What did I...

421
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:05,350
What did I just see?

422
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:24,200
The stars are so pretty.

423
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:31,610
So he called off our wedding

424
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:35,770
because of that wench, Ms. Park?

425
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:39,060
He fell for a wench like her.

426
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:45,190
And that's why he dumped me? Out of all people...

427
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:49,320
Because of that crappy wench?

428
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,740
Actually, when I first saw you in my garden,

429
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,640
I fell for you at first sight.

430
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,690
You're totally my type.

431
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:34,910
You are sexy and pretty.

432
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,710
And a warm personality.

433
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,130
You're my ideal woman.

434
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:42,260
On this Christmas Eve,

435
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,990
let's just get married.

436
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:20,060
I have liked Chairman since I was twenty-four.

437
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:24,750
He turned away from someone like me.

438
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:28,840
He dumped me who was engaged to him.

439
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,310
And he's with that wench, Ms. Park?

440
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,660
How could this happen?

441
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,110
How?

442
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,580
How could it be..?

443
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,830
It's unfair. It's unfair!

444
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,400
It's all because of Jang Mi Sook and that gigolo.

445
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,120
If she hadn't met that gigolo...

446
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,230
Se Ryun would've already got married and got the shares.

447
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,140
Wait.

448
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,220
Is Ms. Park a spy?

449
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,890
Oh, my.

450
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:29,540
Oh, Chief Jo!

451
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,420
- Madam.
 - How have you been, Chief Jo?

452
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,510
I miss you so much.

453
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,870
Me, too.

454
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:40,090
Madam.

455
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:44,820
I'm calling you because I'm very upset.

456
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:48,370
Did you see the photo I sent you?

457
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:50,700
Photo? What photo?

458
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,890
Madam.

459
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,450
Chairman...

460
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:58,710
He has been dating Ms. Park in secret.

461
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,760
I wondered about it.

462
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,590
What?

463
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,900
Wait a minute.

464
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,050
What are these?

465
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:17,230
Chief Jo, what are these photos?

466
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,780
Madam.

467
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:24,920
Until now, I thought the Chairman broke up with me because I was harsh on Se Chan

468
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,260
by locking him down in the basement.

469
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:32,150
It is true that I was harsh on Se Chan.

470
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:35,650
So I couldn't say anything even though he called off our engagement abruptly.

471
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:40,220
But that was not the reason.

472
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,440
It's all because of that wench, Ms. Park.

473
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,400
Madam.

474
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,390
How can I live with this unfairness?

475
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:53,590
Really? Hang up, for now, Chief Jo.

476
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:58,430
Those people...

477
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,940
I'm home.

478
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,100
- Did Se Jong go to kindergarten on time?
- Yes.

479
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,870
I will go upstairs.

480
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:08,680
Hey! You parasite wench.

481
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,300
You came to our house with a plan from the beginning.

482
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,940
Jang Mi Sook set you up, didn't she?

483
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,980
Madam. What are you doing?

484
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,630
- Madam!
- Hey, you dirty wench.

485
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:20,690
Your gigolo brother failed, so now you're going after Young Gook?

486
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,380
Do you think I don't know what you are up to?

487
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,260
Please let go of her, ma'am!

488
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,580
- Why are you doing this?
- Let me go, Chief Kim!

489
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,270
Let go of me!

490
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,200
Let's go upstairs.

491
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,560
Hey, Mrs. Yeoju and Chief Kim.

492
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,210
Who's side are you on? Do you know what she's up to?

493
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:40,190
She's a total vixen!

494
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:43,580
She's seducing Chairman Lee to take over the madam position.

495
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:46,250
She's a gold digger! Let go of me!

496
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,660
With her father and brother, they are a fraudster family.

497
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,900
- Let me go! Let go!
- Please calm down, Madam!

498
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:56,880
I said, let go of me!

499
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,480
Yes, Ajumeoni.

500
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,350
What do you mean by big trouble?

501
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,260
What?

502
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,990
Alzheimer?

503
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:18,180
Does Madam have it?

504
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,230
She didn't seem like that at all.

505
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,620
It's been quiet for a while, so I thought she was fine.

506
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,690
Maybe it's come back.

507
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,640
She showed symptoms of a beginning stage.

508
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,050
You were shocked, weren't you?

509
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:33,370
Yes, a little.

510
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:36,360
My heart is thumping still.

511
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,930
Welcome home, Chairman.

512
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:46,800
That Ms. Park came into this house with a plan.

513
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,570
Ms. Park is seducing the Chairman to become the madam of the house.

514
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:56,260
That's what she said. Also, she used the words vixen, gigolo, gold digger, fraud, and parasite.

515
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,410
Anyhow, she grabbed Ms. Park by her hair

516
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,790
and was very violent.

517
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:06,150
Chairman, I think Madam's Alzheimer's symptoms are back.

518
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:10,200
- It's not Alzheimer's. She's not ill.
- Pardon?

519
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,050
Are you saying she doesn't have dementia?

520
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:15,010
That's not it for sure.

521
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:17,180
So if things like this happen again, please protect Ms. Park.

522
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,260
And Chief Kim, please report it to me right away.

523
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,560
Yes, sir.

524
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:32,750
If it's not dementia, has Madam gone crazy?

525
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,510
If it's not, does it make sense?

526
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,720
Why did you act like that toward Ms. Park?

527
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,220
Please explain.

528
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:53,900
Did you even stop working and run home because of that wench? My goodness.

529
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,480
You really are in a relationship with her.

530
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,040
Yes.

531
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,280
I like Ms. Park.

532
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,730
Ms. Park and I are in a relationship.

533
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,160
So to the innocent Ms. Park,

534
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,730
don't ill-treat her like that.

535
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:11,220
If you have a complaint, take it out on me.

536
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:16,380
Hey. Did you say she's done no wrong?

537
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,290
My goodness, you stupid boy.

538
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:22,110
Do you know who introduced the Jinsa Group family to Se Ryun?

539
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:26,570
It was Mrs. Jang. Someone you used to call Noonim.

540
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,820
Do you know what Mrs. Jang is?

541
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:32,200
She's Ms. Park's paternal aunt.

542
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,770
Driver Park's older sister.

543
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:37,760
- So what?
- What do you mean, so what?

544
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,340
Don't you get it?

545
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,700
You still can't read the situation?

546
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:46,800
That parasite family came in here with a plan from the very beginning.

547
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,110
Her gigolo brother tried to seduce Se Ryun, and since that didn't work,

548
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,130
now she's trying to seduce you.

549
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:56,180
What nonsense are you saying!

550
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,450
What?

551
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:59,530
I am going to make myself clear.

552
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:03,420
If you treat Ms. Park rudely like this again,

553
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,710
I will not let it slide.

554
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,320
Do you understand?

555
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:15,990
Wow, you totally lost your mind for that girl.

556
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:18,710
Is he going to make that gold digger his wife?

557
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,070
Did he take over Se Ryun's share of shares

558
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:23,150
so that he could give them to that vixen?

559
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:26,060
Oh my, that stupid idiot. How pathetic!

560
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,970
What a fool.

561
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:32,370
That stupid jerk.

562
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:37,730
Ms. Park, are you okay?

563
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,670
I heard everything.

564
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,380
You must have been shocked.

565
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,230
I am okay.

566
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,500
But what do we do?

567
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:52,900
Madam seems to have found out about our relationship.

568
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,630
Don't worry.

569
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:58,010
I just told her that we are seeing each other.

570
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:01,830
So she won't act like that toward you anymore.

571
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:05,490
Please don't worry.

572
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,450
I have to go back to the office.

573
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,820
Will you be okay?

574
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:19,100
Of course. I'm not a child.

575
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,980
Don't worry about me and go back to work.

576
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,860
If something happens,

577
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:27,410
please contact me right away. Okay?

578
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:30,100
I will.

579
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,210
Okay.

580
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,350
Chief Jo, let's call off our engagement.

581
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:55,280
No matter the reason,

582
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,300
I'm the one who's calling it off.

583
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,880
So I will ask Lawyer Koh to send you compensation.

584
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,700
The stars are so pretty.

585
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,160
Chairman.

586
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:38,630
What brings you here, Chief Jo?

587
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:43,820
I have something to ask you.

588
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,970
Do you still have something to say?

589
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:50,110
Chairman.

590
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:53,890
What is your relationship with Ms. Park?

591
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:56,620
Why should I be talking to you about that?

592
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,700
Why should you?

593
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:02,950
You used the children as an excuse to break up with me. But it's not.

594
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:06,700
The real reason you abandon me is Ms. Park, isn't it?

595
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:12,760
If it's because of her, I can't accept you are calling off our engagement.

596
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,790
Chief Jo.

597
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:17,630
We've already broken off.

598
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:20,140
Please do not come here for something like this.

599
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,530
I've liked you since I was twenty-four years old!

600
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:29,930
Also, I devoted all of my youth to you and your family.

601
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:32,660
But how can you do this to me?

602
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,380
When you reverted to 22-years-old because of the accident,

603
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:39,590
you took me everywhere, saying you only liked me.

604
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:43,280
But you're using the lack of memory as an excuse.

605
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,670
My memory with you is so vivid.

606
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:50,790
But if you say you don't remember, is that all?

607
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:53,590
How can you do this to me?

608
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:59,280
Am I someone you play with when you need it and throw it out?

609
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,000
Am I a toy to you?

610
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,370
Chief Jo.

611
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:10,140
I have nothing to discuss with you.

612
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,740
Oh, my!

613
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,950
Are you okay, honey? Are you hurt?

614
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:10,840
Oh, my. I'm sorry.

615
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,690
Excuse me, where were you looking?

616
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:16,080
What do I do? My expensive coat is ruined.

617
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:20,500
Ah, really. What are you going to do? It's all ruined.

618
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:24,090
We bought it 10 minutes ago.

619
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:26,250
You better compensate for us.

620
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:27,810
I'm sorry.

621
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:30,640
I will compensate for everything.

622
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,720
Why should you? They are the ones who did wrong.

623
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,530
Dae Beom.

624
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:42,740
Who are you?

625
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:45,830
Look here. I saw everything standing here.

626
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:48,690
How dare you dump it on her when you were the ones not looking?

627
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:52,740
You ran into her because you were distracted by each other.

628
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:56,050
Why are you interfering with someone else's business?

629
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,350
It's annoying.

630
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:00,490
Let's go.

631
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:13,060
You didn't do anything wrong. Why do you get intimidated?

632
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:17,690
You should pay attention and look in front of you when walking on the street.

633
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:22,470
Dae Beom, have you been well?

634
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:25,550
As you can see.

635
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:28,180
I'm going.

636
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:47,650
This fish roe soup is delicious. Did you make it?

637
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:51,600
No, I didn't. We ordered it from a restaurant near us.

638
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,740
- Please eat. It's good.
- Eat a lot.

639
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,200
It's good, isn't it, Mom?

640
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,790
Right, right, I've brought good news.

641
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:00,410
After we finish eating,

642
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:03,090
I will tell you over a cup of tea.

643
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:08,190
Good news? What is it?

644
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:10,890
I've been meaning to call you.

645
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:13,450
Look at this photo.

646
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:16,000
Sister-in-law, what is this?

647
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,060
What do you think of her as Dae Beom's partner?

648
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,220
For Dae Beom?

649
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:23,340
She's 26 years old and a kindergarten teacher.

650
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:26,550
Her parents live in Daejeon, and both of them are civil servants.

651
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:29,150
Also, she's very put it together,

652
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:32,450
that she already saved all the money to get married.

653
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:37,140
My goodness. She sounds very capable. I like it.

654
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:41,660
Do you think someone from such a good family would be interested in meeting our Dae Beom?

655
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:45,360
Of course. When I showed them Dae Beom's photo,

656
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:48,960
they were interested in meeting him because he looked earnest.

657
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,330
Oh, my.

658
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:54,190
She looks very pleasant and cute.

659
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:56,540
Yes, she does.

660
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:59,630
She's not overly pretty.

661
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:02,060
But she looks to be hardworking and kind.

662
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:05,030
Please take a look, honey.

663
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:09,020
I don't know how Dae Beom feels.

664
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:12,320
Dae Beom, take a look.

665
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,400
I have no interest.

666
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,020
Why, Oppa? She looks nice. Why don't you meet her?

667
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:19,560
Yes, why don't you?

668
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,730
No. How can I afford to meet a woman?

669
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:25,410
I'm going to do nothing but work for a while.

670
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:29,380
I won't meet a woman until I'm successful.

671
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,940
I will go in now.

672
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:38,750
I thought he was finished with her.

673
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:41,900
Maybe not yet.

674
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:46,560
You should have asked before bringing something like that.

675
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,760
I thought he should get over a person with another person.

676
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,660
I thought I could help.

677
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:57,170
Also, she's really a good catch.

678
00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:01,160
We are grateful for your effort.

679
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:07,370
But our Dae Beom was genuinely in love with Ms. Se Ryun.

680
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:10,100
I hope that lady doesn't go anywhere

681
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:13,620
until our Dae Beom gets over Se Ryun.

682
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:17,050
I really like her as well.

683
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:20,070
I like this young lady too.

684
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:24,460
Let me know when Dae Beom is ready.

685
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:26,360
There are lots of other young ladies.

686
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:29,050
- Really?
- Yes.

687
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:31,850
The couples I've matched are all happy.

688
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:34,820
So lots of people want me to do the match-up.

689
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:39,220
I will match up Dan Dan and Mi Rim too.

690
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:43,140
Mi Rim, don't go dating just anyone. Okay?

691
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,730
Yes. Yes...

692
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:51,780
Yes, please find someone good for Mi Rim.

693
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,350
Of course.

694
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:17,270
Is this the room you shared with your grandma?

695
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:20,760
What if someone sees us? How can you follow me?

696
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:25,600
It's okay. I told them I was touring the house.

697
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,260
But the room is a bit small.

698
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,770
Did you live here with your grandmother?

699
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:36,150
Yes. It's small, but it's nice and warm.

700
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,160
Is it?

701
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:44,230
[Seoul to New York]

702
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,410
[Registration Certificate]

703
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:45,090
It's me, let's meet.

704
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:47,980
I have something to say to you.

705
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:15,160
What are you doing? Where do you think this is?

706
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,580
I had to talk to you briefly.

707
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,620
Can we go to a cafe to talk?

708
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,790
Why would I go to a cafe with you?

709
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:24,960
It will only take a minute. Just a minute.

710
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:32,100
What is it?

711
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:36,200
I'm almost finished with my work.

712
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,710
So I will be leaving for the US next week.

713
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:42,250
Before I go, I wanted to hand this over to you.

714
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:45,320
Please take this.

715
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,770
What is it?

716
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:48,270
Please keep this.

717
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:52,420
And spend it when Dan Dan needs something.

718
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:54,890
If she wants to study more

719
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:59,800
or gets married, please use this.

720
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:04,910
It's the final thing I want to do for Dan Dan.

721
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:08,530
What?

722
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:10,950
What are you up to exactly?

723
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:14,130
Did you think I would take this?

724
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:16,900
How about if you pretend this is not from me,

725
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:20,840
but from someone else who cares about Dan Dan?

726
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:25,160
You don't exist to us. You are already dead to us.

727
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,730
Please leave now.

728
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:29,680
I am her mother.

729
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,870
Can't I do this much?

730
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:39,870
Her mom? How can you utter those words?

731
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:44,450
You are... Go away, now!

732
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:50,450
It's that woman, right there.

733
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:54,090
The one who was walking arm in arm with Mr. Park.

734
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:55,760
Really?

735
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,270
Now I see them again, I don't think she's his younger or older sister.

736
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:02,560
Right?

737
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,950
I think so, too.

738
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:13,260
The way he is so angry with her, something is strange.

739
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:17,430
What is it between them that he is so angry?

740
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:21,600
That's strange. They were so close the last time.

741
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,580
But not this time.

742
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:27,090
What kind of a relationship is it?

743
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:32,090
What relationship, you punk!

744
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:34,190
It looks like nothing.

745
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:36,810
No. I have a feeling.

746
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:38,710
It's a love-hate relationship.

747
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:40,940
Hey, you!

748
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:48,270
Be careful with your mouth. Big trouble might follow.

749
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:50,880
Got it?

750
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:59,010
We will need some more vegetables on this day.

751
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:01,610
- On Tuesday.
- Yes, yes.

752
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:05,490
Ms. Park, are you alright?

753
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:07,990
Why did you come down? You should be resting.

754
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:09,230
I came down for some water.

755
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:11,520
Do you? Hang on. I'll get it for you.

756
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,170
Okay.

757
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:17,330
Mrs. Yeoju, is she the madam? Why are you serving her water?

758
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:20,190
Hey, why are you still in this house?

759
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:22,510
If you have a conscience, get out of this house.

760
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:26,130
How dare you young thing try to seduce Chairman Lee, who's way older than you?

761
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:27,630
You are after his money, aren't you?

762
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:29,410
That's what you are really after, isn't it?

763
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:31,000
Don't you think I don't know it?

764
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,200
No, Madam. That's a misunderstanding.

765
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,210
Misunderstanding, my foot. Are you saying you are not leaving?

766
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:39,520
Why? Do you dare think you can take over the primary bedroom?

767
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,480
Do you think I will stand aside and watch you do it?

768
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,620
You terrible wench!

769
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:45,810
Please, stop it.

770
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:48,720
If you keep doing this, you leave me no choice.

771
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,450
Let me go! Let go of me!

772
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:54,300
If you keep doing this, I have to call the Chairman again.

773
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,200
- Please come with me.
- Are you crazy!

774
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,210
Just call him! Call him!

775
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:00,570
Hey, let me go!

776
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,090
Why is she doing that?

777
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:05,490
Ms. Park. I think you have to stay upstairs for a while.

778
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:08,740
It's better if you don't interact with Madam. Please go upstairs, hurry.

779
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:10,960
- Okay.
- Hurry.

780
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:24,560
Did something happen?

781
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:28,980
Yes, Madam poured water over Ms. Park.

782
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:31,990
And she created a noisy storm-like situation.

783
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:34,010
What did you say?

784
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:35,910
Did she pour water on Ms. Park?

785
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:40,620
Yes. And also...

786
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:43,000
"If you have a conscience, get out of this house."

787
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,120
"How dare you young thing try to seduce Chairman Lee, who's way older than you?"

788
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:53,010
"You are after his money, aren't you?" That's what Madam said.

789
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:59,360
I stopped her by force when she grabbed Ms. Park's hair again.

790
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:06,070
Chairman, if serious situations like this keep occurring, what actions should I take?

791
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:09,480
If you can give more detailed instructions, please.

792
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,650
I stopped Madam by force today.

793
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:16,280
But should I continue to do, I can't decide.

794
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,200
Yes, please continue.

795
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,820
- Well done, Chief Kim.
- Yes, sir.

796
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:32,900
What! What is it now this time?

797
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,530
I made it clear to you.

798
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:40,440
To the people who work here, Ms. Park, and the children!

799
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,940
I would not allow you to treat them carelessly.

800
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:46,990
If not, then what would you do?

801
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:51,900
Oh, that vixen squealed to you about me pouring water on her, did she?

802
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:56,830
And you skidded yourself over here right away to scream at me like this?

803
00:55:56,830 --> 00:55:58,740
You are pathetic!

804
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:01,120
You've got bitten badly by that gold digger.

805
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,490
Watch your words!

806
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:05,570
Are you going to be like this in front of the children?

807
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:09,680
Look, I say what I want out of my own mouth, what business is it of yours?

808
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:13,410
Go and do your work. Get out, out out.

809
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:19,120
I promised Se Ryun, and I've tried to take care of you here.

810
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:22,160
But if you continue this way, I cannot.

811
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,140
I will find a decent place for you. Please get out of my house.

812
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,350
Hey, do you think I am crazy? Why would I move out?

813
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,410
I won't leave this house ever!

814
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:31,550
I might have been afraid of you before,

815
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:36,160
but now I'm not scared of you since I have nothing to lose!

816
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,970
I am going to stick to you like a scab.

817
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:43,040
And make your life miserable every day.

818
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,880
That rude bastard.

819
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:54,330
Mrs. Yeoju.

820
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:58,350
I'm going out with Ms. Park. Can you look after the children, please?

821
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:00,460
Yes, Chairman.

822
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,090
What's going on?

823
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:11,900
There is a huge age gap between Ms. Park and the Chairman.

824
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,720
Does this make sense?

825
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,350
Chairman.

826
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:29,890
Ms. Park. Did anything happen while I was gone?

827
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,060
Nothing happened.

828
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:37,640
I know something happened. Why do you say nothing?

829
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,800
How did you know?

830
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:45,910
Did Mrs. Yeoju tell you?

831
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:49,140
I am fine now, that's why I didn't tell you.

832
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:51,600
I don't want you to be concerned about it.

833
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:59,580
And, now that I see you like this, everything is good.

834
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,310
Ms. Park.

835
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:05,050
Why don't we go on a date to make you feel better?

836
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:07,060
What about a late-night movie?

837
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:08,270
A late-night movie?

838
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:14,320
Wasn't that on your bucket list for when you have a boyfriend?

839
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,420
Let's knock off one on your bucket list today.

840
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:24,620
The movie was so good. I was touched.

841
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:26,950
Do you feel better now?

842
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:30,870
Yes. It's all back to normal.

843
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:36,970
Ms. Park. I've been thinking.

844
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:41,910
I was going to get Jenny's approval before coming out to others.

845
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:46,760
But I think we should let important people in our lives know about our relationship first.

846
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:52,980
Not doing it is causing misunderstanding resulting in a hard time for you.

847
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:56,040
What do you say?

848
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:58,210
I am okay with all of it.

849
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:03,900
As long as you are next to me, like this.

850
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:11,020
Thank you, Ms. Park.

851
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:47,850
Where are Dan Dan and Young Gook going at this hour all by themselves?

852
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,780
No way.

853
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:57,230
No way. What am I thinking?

854
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:59,970
That's right. I'm sure not.

855
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:08,890
Do you have feelings for Ms. Park?

856
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:10,790
What?

857
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:12,760
You don't, right?

858
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,610
Pardon?

859
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:18,620
No, I don't.

860
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:23,780
That's right. He said no back then.

861
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:34,410
Of course not. They have a big age gap.

862
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:37,670
They must be meeting about his children.

863
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:41,400
Because of work.

864
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:44,190
My Dan Dan.

865
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:59,920
The customer is not answering the call. After the beep...

866
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:11,020
Hello.

867
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:13,150
Oh, my goodness.

868
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:17,260
You're just waiting forever in front of our house now.

869
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:18,700
Why are you doing this?

870
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:22,540
I'm sorry, but did something happen to Sarah?

871
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:24,990
I can't get through to her on the phone.

872
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:31,090
It's not about getting through. Sarah's not answering the phone.

873
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:33,320
My goodness...

874
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:43,940
Come inside for a bit.

875
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:46,290
Me?

876
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:48,010
It's cold out.

877
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:51,640
Come inside and have some tea. Come in.

878
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,880
- Come inside!
- Okay...

879
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,680
Please drink.

880
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,680
Thank you.

881
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:07,890
What is your name?

882
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:12,680
Yes, I am Cha Geon.

883
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:14,640
Cha Geon.

884
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,970
If you can't get her on the phone, you should leave.

885
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:22,350
Why are you hanging outside of the house like this?

886
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:27,110
Are you interested in a relationship with Sarah?

887
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:29,330
Yes.

888
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:34,330
I like Sarah a lot.

889
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:39,340
I have so little to offer.

890
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:43,350
I was hesitant about getting close to Sarah.

891
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:47,760
But now, I want to find the courage to start.

892
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:54,450
I'm confident with everything as long as I'm with Sarah.

893
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:57,850
Do you like Sarah that much?

894
01:02:57,850 --> 01:02:59,680
Yes.

895
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:04,940
What do you like about Sarah?

896
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:08,220
Just everything.

897
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,650
I like everything.

898
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:12,940
From one to all of them.

899
01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:20,100
Ajussi, what are you doing here?

900
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,240
Mom.

901
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:24,020
That is, Sarah. I asked him to come inside.

902
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:29,130
It's freezing out, and he's been waiting for you forever.

903
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:33,090
Let's go out, Ajussi. Let's talk outside.

904
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:35,680
Sarah, it's cold outside. Why don't you talk here?

905
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:38,100
Sarah.

906
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:46,850
Ajussi, I told you.

907
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:49,860
I don't want to see you again.

908
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:52,850
But why do you do this? Why?

909
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:59,250
Sarah, I told you I was fine with what happened in your past.

910
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:06,950
I love you the way you are, including the wounds from your past.

911
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:09,090
I have a past, too.

912
01:04:09,090 --> 01:04:12,330
I've done wrong too.

913
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:16,650
I made mistakes, too.

914
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:20,570
So let's forget about everything that happened in the past.

915
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:25,100
And let's trust each other and start anew.

916
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:27,720
Ajussi.

917
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:30,660
Your mother seems nice, too.

918
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:36,800
Actually, I was most worried that your mother would oppose us.

919
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:41,880
But she even asked me my name, and I think she could support us.

920
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:47,820
As for my family, when they meet you, I'm sure they'd like you.

921
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:56,290
So, let's meet each other's families.

922
01:04:56,290 --> 01:05:01,570
And date each other formally.

923
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:04,290
Ajussi.

924
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:11,040
Actually, I am not over Chairman Lee yet.

925
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:19,380
- What did you say?
- That's why I decided to date you.

926
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:21,610
To forget the Chairman.

927
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:26,210
But it's not right to be seeing you for the reason to forget someone else.

928
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:30,450
So Ajussi, please do not linger on me.

929
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:34,070
Let's just end it here.

930
01:05:34,070 --> 01:05:38,890
♫ Show you to me ♫

931
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:41,200
That's not true.

932
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,350
That's not true.

933
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:47,310
I know you like me.

934
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:52,300
You also have feelings for me, right?

935
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:53,810
I just told you.

936
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:56,480
I dated you to forget the Chairman.

937
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,530
♫ The mysterious way you are is love to me ♫

938
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:04,510
He's given you nothing but pain.

939
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:07,000
He even broke up the engagement because he didn't love you.

940
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,460
But you still have feelings for him?

941
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:13,310
That...

942
01:06:13,310 --> 01:06:17,740
That kind of lies...

943
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:20,500
♫ You in the time that's stopping ♫

944
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:24,470
Are you asking me to believe it?

945
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:29,430
I don't want to hurt you anymore.

946
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:33,710
I don't want to feel sorry for you anymore.

947
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:36,160
That's my true feeling.

948
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:40,400
So, please, do not come back again.

949
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,650
♫ My love ♫

950
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:48,590
♫ I can feel all of you that I love ♫

951
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:56,020
♫ Like the light in the darkness ♫

952
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:15,210
Yes, Young Gook.

953
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:18,480
Lunch today? Sure, of course.

954
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,280
I wanted to have a meal with you before I go back to the US.

955
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:26,260
Okay, I will see you there.

956
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:37,500
You have something to tell me, don't you?

957
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:41,940
You look a little nervous today.

958
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:43,920
I can't keep anything from you.

959
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,900
What is it? Tell me.

960
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:53,530
Noona, after my parents passed away,

961
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:57,310
you know how much I've relied on you all this time.

962
01:07:57,310 --> 01:08:02,780
I've thought of you as my mom from time to time.

963
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:05,720
Of course, I know you have.

964
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:11,700
So when I get to have someone special to me, I wanted to introduce her to you first.

965
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:15,630
Young Gook. Are you dating someone?

966
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:18,170
Is that right?

967
01:08:19,630 --> 01:08:21,080
Yes.

968
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,630
That's really great.

969
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:26,730
My sincere congratulations to you. I'm so happy!

970
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:29,360
If I'd known, I would have put more effort before coming here.

971
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:32,040
You should have told me in advance.

972
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,730
I'm so curious what kind of person she would be.

973
01:08:34,730 --> 01:08:38,770
I don't know why I feel nervous.

974
01:08:41,230 --> 01:08:43,980
Is she here?

975
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:18,420
♫ Why do you run away, love
?
Like a shy child ♫

976
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:24,980
♫ In case I lose it, I hold it tight ♫

977
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:32,250
♫ But love always runs away, chased by longing ♫

978
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:39,070
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

979
01:09:39,070 --> 01:09:46,820
♫ I have to abandon the longing and the grieves ♫

980
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:51,560
♫ What am I looking for on this road wandering
 ♫

981
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:54,720
[Young Lady and Gentleman]

982
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:57,470
Ms. Park, is it because of money?

983
01:09:57,470 --> 01:10:00,010
I can't break up with Chairman.

984
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:02,570
- I'm sorry. I'll leave first.
- Ms. Park!

985
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:04,120
What did you say to my Dan Dan?

986
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:06,490
Soo Chul, our Dan Dan is in big trouble!

987
01:10:06,490 --> 01:10:10,890
She's seeing someone who's much older who has children as well.

988
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:12,170
Hello, I'm Lee Young Gook.

989
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:13,440
Let's go outside and talk.

990
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:16,540
- We are closed now.
- Boss, one spicy chicken, please.

991
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:18,400
- Our business is closed for the day, customer.
- Boss...

992
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,650
Lee Se Ryun, why are you doing this?

993
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:24,440
No matter what my dad says and how much he opposes, you shouldn't change your mind.

994
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:27,150
I won't. Let's get through this together.

995
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:28,530
Get in!

996
01:10:28,530 --> 01:10:30,770
Do you think I'd break up with Chairman if you do this?

997
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:31,810
Shut your mouth!

998
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:35,770
Even if I die, I will not break up no matter what.
