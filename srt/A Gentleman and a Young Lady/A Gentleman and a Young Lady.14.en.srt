00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:04,500
Chairman.
 [Episode 14]

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,460
Why are you acting like this to me?

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,660
Do you also...

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,700
have feelings for me?

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,810
That's it, isn't it?

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,410
It seems like you don't want to ride a bike today.

7
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,630
If you didn't want to ride, you could just tell me.

8
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,790
Why would you joke like that?

9
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,740
I'm not joking.

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,880
The way I see it, you do like me.

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,650
If not, why would you do all this? I'm not that important.

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:51,280
Well, Ms. Park, that is...

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,290
I just thought that

14
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,160
you are Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong's teacher,

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,740
and you are very good to the kids,

16
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,820
and the kids love you.

17
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,280
Also, even when some unfortunate things happened,

18
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,200
you worked your best, and I am thankful for that.

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,210
Anyway, that's why.

20
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:18,120
Because I would like you to stay in our home, that's why I am doing this.

21
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,300
No, I don't think you're doing this for that reason.

22
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:28,010
What Chairman would do all this just for someone that works for them?

23
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:32,170
You also...

24
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:38,120
like me, don't you?

25
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,860
Lawyer Koh.

26
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,700
What? Is our contract might get canceled?

27
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,320
That can't happen.

28
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,640
Okay, I'll be there right now.

29
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,110
Ms. Park, did you hear that?

30
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:09,960
Because a contract that our company's life depends on is at risk, so I have to go.

31
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,390
Ms. Park, go back home first. I'm sorry.

32
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,100
Lawyer Koh, you know...

33
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,940
This isn't my story, but it's my friend's.

34
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,980
What is it?

35
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:57,230
A woman with quite an age gap likes him.

36
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,890
Who cares about age these days?

37
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:06,130
That's true, but the woman is a lot younger.

38
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,440
How much younger?

39
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,370
About 14 years difference, he said.

40
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,740
14 years difference?

41
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,470
Yes. That's why at first, he was not interested in her

42
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,940
and didn't think anything of it.

43
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:30,760
But the more he spent time with her, she was cute and nice.

44
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,960
Also, she says she likes my friend,

45
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,100
so it seems like he's confused.

46
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:43,030
He asked me if it would be okay to be with someone with a big age gap,

47
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,400
but I didn't know what to say.

48
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:55,210
A 14 years difference is quite a gap.

49
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:59,480
Some would accuse him of robbing the cradle.

50
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,890
Right?

51
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,890
But,

52
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,500
what does the age difference matter?

53
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,400
Their feelings for each other are what matters.

54
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,150
There are many couples with more than a 20 years age difference who lives happily.

55
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:26,500
At our age, it's not easy to find a woman that sways your heart.

56
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,120
Tell him to have some courage and go for it.

57
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,860
I'm jealous of you, Lee Young Gook.

58
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,980
I said it's not me.

59
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,320
Okay, okay.

60
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,660
Have some courage. Good luck.

61
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,510
It's not my story!

62
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,310
- It's not me.
- Okay.

63
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,120
Thank you.

64
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:31,670
Ms. Park isn't awake at this time, is she?

65
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,980
Chairman.

66
00:05:52,390 --> 00:06:00,010
Ms. Park. It's quite late. What are you doing here, not sleeping?

67
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,440
I drank quite a lot today and got drunk a bit.

68
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,660
You should go inside and sleep.

69
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,450
You said you have to go because of a critical issue at the company.

70
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,290
But did you go drinking?

71
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:20,370
That's because... We handled the issue well, so I had a drink to celebrate.

72
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,600
But why am I this drunk?

73
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,460
I should go to bed now.

74
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,160
Chairman, wait a minute.

75
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,600
Why? What is it?

76
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,960
I know that you're not drunk.

77
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,950
What do you mean? I'm so drunk,

78
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,780
the sky seems to be spinning.

79
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,530
Don't pretend to be drunk and avoid it.

80
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,360
Let's finish what we were talking about before.

81
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,700
What were we talking about before?

82
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,090
Did we talk about something?

83
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,870
I can't seem to remember.

84
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:05,000
I asked you if you liked me too.

85
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,970
But why do you keep avoiding it?

86
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,960
Why are you acting like you don't know?

87
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:18,190
Do you think it was easy for me to tell you how I felt?

88
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,440
I thought about it many times

89
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,280
and even though it was difficult and embarrassing, I told you how I felt.

90
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,540
I didn't know you wouldn't have any courage.

91
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:36,280
If you don't like me, then you can just say no.

92
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,700
Ms. Park.

93
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:46,760
I am much older than you and have three children.

94
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,390
I know all that.

95
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,780
And I still like you.

96
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:57,940
So please tell me if you like me too or not.

97
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,270
Ms. Park.

98
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,740
I'm sorry.

99
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:19,370
You have your situation, but it seems that I was thinking only about my feelings.

100
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:23,440
You also need some time to think.

101
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,960
That's fine.

102
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,610
I'll give you one day to think.

103
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:39,640
Think about it, and if you like me too,

104
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:45,080
please tie the handkerchief on this tree by tomorrow.

105
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,940
If the handkerchief isn't there by midnight tomorrow,

106
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,030
I will put away my feelings and forget about you.

107
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,290
Tomorrow by midnight, on this tree, okay?

108
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:03,070
Then I will go in first.

109
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:14,160
♫  Even now, I remember your memories  ♫

110
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,870
♫  Your name in my memory comes back to me in a smile  ♫

111
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:26,430
At our age, it's not easy to find a woman that sways your heart.

112
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:34,320
♫  If I get to see you once again  ♫

113
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,890
♫  You, the one I put in my heart  ♫

114
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:47,380
♫  I want to take you out on this cozy day  ♫

115
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:52,290
♫  It gets deeper at the end of the day  ♫

116
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:57,460
♫  I think of my feelings toward you  ♫

117
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:02,490
♫  All night long, in my heart that has you in it, ♫

118
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,550
♫  I want to call your name  ♫

119
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:14,060
♫  Our time that was filled with excitements  ♫

120
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,990
♫  The memory that's shining like you  ♫

121
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,170
♫  The world seems to have stopped for a moment  ♫

122
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:25,050
No, this doesn't seem right.

123
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,790
Even if Ms. Park likes me,

124
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,300
think of my age.

125
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,640
I can't do this.

126
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,190
♫  You and I were smiling with joy  ♫

127
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:42,630
♫  I think of it seriously about this sometimes  ♫

128
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:49,780
♫  I want to be with you forever  ♫

129
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,260
I was hoping, but he didn't tie the handkerchief.

130
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,930
Park Dan Dan.

131
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,550
What were you thinking?

132
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,600
Chairman is not thinking about you at all.

133
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,100
But you were jumping to conclusions by yourself.

134
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:53,330
No, no.

135
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,900
He needs time to think too.

136
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,750
I said until midnight tonight.

137
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,830
There's a lot of time left still.

138
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:03,800
That's right.

139
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,290
Ms. Park.

140
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,780
Did you see Chairman leave for work this morning?

141
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,180
No, I didn't.

142
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,110
Has he gone to work already?

143
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:24,240
Yes. He left without telling anyone. He didn't even have his tea.

144
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,780
I think it's because of me.

145
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:32,300
He must have gone early to work because he didn't want to see me.

146
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,920
Oh! Ms. Park.

147
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,710
Yes?

148
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,840
Good morning, Madam.

149
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,510
Yes. Ms. Park.

150
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,170
Can I see you for a minute?

151
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,190
Me?

152
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,940
Don't be so startled. I'm fine today.

153
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:57,920
If you are worried, bring Mrs. Yeoju with you.

154
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,460
I will go with you and stand by at the door, don't worry.

155
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,470
If anything happens, bolt out of there, okay?

156
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,120
Ms. Park.

157
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,790
Take this necklace.

158
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,680
It's a gift from me.

159
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,820
Pardon?

160
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,020
No, Madam.

161
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,330
Don't worry.

162
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,830
I'm not going to pick on you after giving this to you.

163
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,640
I said it's a gift to you.

164
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,870
Look, there's a witness! Mrs. Yeoju is watching us.

165
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:54,880
But, why are you giving this to me?

166
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,530
What do you mean by why?

167
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:01,120
It's because I have a lot to apologize for you.

168
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,590
Madam.

169
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:08,730
Ms. Park, I'm sorry for giving you a hard time. I sincerely apologize.

170
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,640
I will keep my mind together from now on.

171
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,620
And not do anything like that again. I promise.

172
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,650
Madam.

173
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,760
Will you accept my apology, please?

174
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,660
Yes.

175
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,640
You don't have to do all this.

176
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,430
It's not like you did it on purpose.

177
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:33,350
No, no, Ms. Park.

178
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,780
And also, the fact that I apologized to you

179
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,940
and gave you this necklace as a token of my apology

180
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:47,150
can you please tell that to Chairman Lee?

181
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,950
Mrs. Yeoju, you saw this too, right?

182
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,790
Please say this to Chairman Lee!

183
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,530
Yes, Madam.

184
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,320
Madam,

185
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,580
how can you apologize to that girl, Ms. Park?

186
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,010
I am very upset.

187
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,100
Chief Jo!

188
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,960
Do you think I wanted to give her that expensive necklace?

189
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,870
But I had to do it!

190
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,570
This is all because of you, don't you know that?

191
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:24,600
Pardon?

192
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,950
It's because you couldn't do it yourself.

193
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:30,500
That's why I tried to help you, but it ended up at this point!

194
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,140
I even had to bow to that young girl.

195
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,920
What is all this?

196
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,640
Madam.

197
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:42,610
So you should stop relying on me and make an effort yourself.

198
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,630
When even that silly girl can seduce Chairman Lee,

199
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,090
what have you been doing all this time?

200
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,700
It's not like I can seduce him for you.

201
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,400
Until my Se Ryun gets married,

202
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,910
I'll stay quiet. I'm not going to get involved in this for now.

203
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,190
Okay, Chief Jo?

204
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,090
What is all this now?

205
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,300
What do I do now? What?

206
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,330
It's such gorgeous weather today.

207
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:41,360
It's a perfect day for drying the laundry outside today.

208
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,780
Driver Park.

209
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,930
Driver Park, what are you doing?

210
00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:00,380
Good morning. I was wiping a stain on your car.

211
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,090
Please don't do this. It's not your job.

212
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,530
You took care of our Dan Dan so much.

213
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,160
This is the least I could do.

214
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,990
If you need help with anything at all,

215
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,920
please feel free to call me any time.

216
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,290
You don't have to do this.

217
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,440
Thank you anyway.

218
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,780
If we keep interacting like this,

219
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,820
is he going to recognize me?

220
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,180
Excuse me.

221
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,610
What you talked to me about before,

222
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,680
I discussed it with Dan Dan.

223
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,320
She said she'd give it a serious thought.

224
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,960
Really?

225
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,850
I'm glad she'd think of it positively.

226
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,970
I'm sure she wants to work under you in the U.S.

227
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,990
It's a great opportunity for her.

228
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,160
Thank you very much for everything.

229
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,870
Thank you.

230
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,490
Have a good day!

231
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,210
Yes, drive safely, CEO Kim.

232
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:38,190
What am I thinking right now?

233
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:42,710
There are many people with moles on the back of their necks.

234
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,070
Yes, Noona.

235
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,400
What? Today?

236
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,890
I was hoping, but it's not.

237
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:05,470
To someone who doesn't have feelings for me,

238
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,110
I said I'll give time to you, tie the handkerchief on the tree.

239
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,700
I said such nonsense.

240
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,850
What is this?

241
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,900
It's like I begged him to like me.

242
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,270
Park Dan Dan, you fool.

243
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,190
I'm so stupid!

244
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,410
Yes, Dad.

245
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,200
Today?

246
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,900
I have time until the children come home. Why?

247
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,530
Did Aunt invite you and me?

248
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:51,990
Sarah, what are you doing here at this hour?

249
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:57,450
Mom, I'm home because I'm so stressed I feel like I could explode!

250
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,430
I think I can die from anger.

251
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:04,290
What's wrong? What happened?

252
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,590
Madam said she couldn't help me with kicking out that girl.

253
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:13,900
And she said how I could not be able to seduce the Chairman until now.

254
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,310
It's so humiliating and hurts my pride!

255
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,140
What? Dae Ran said that to you?

256
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,780
Yes!

257
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:27,330
What if she gives up wanting to have me as her daughter-in-law?

258
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,360
Give up? That shouldn't happen!

259
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,240
She's the one who got you all worked up in the first place!

260
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,470
No, you have to be nicer to Dae Ran at the time like this.

261
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,840
So she can't live without you.

262
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,700
How can I be nicer to her? How?

263
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:49,930
If it weren't for Se Jong, I would make her quit right now.

264
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:55,880
Dae Ran is hyper-sensitive right now because of her daughter's wedding.

265
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,510
Once the wedding's over, I'm sure she will find a way to kick out that girl.

266
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,140
So don't get too stressed about it.

267
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,790
The more I think about it, the more I can't understand it.

268
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,680
Even with Madam's help,

269
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,990
why haven't we been able to get that country bumpkin out?

270
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:16,460
I know.

271
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:21,030
But Sarah, there's no one in the world without a flaw.

272
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,560
Everyone has something when you shake them.

273
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,440
I'm sure there is a way to kick that girl out.

274
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,730
Right?

275
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:45,430
How can I get her kicked out of the house?

276
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,340
Dad!

277
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:55,140
Isn't that Driver Park?

278
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,970
Why is Ms. Park holding on to his arm?

279
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:02,710
What is their relationship?

280
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:12,440
It's good to walk arm in arm with my daughter in a while.

281
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,760
Of course.

282
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,020
I don't hold onto anyone's arm. I'm very picky.

283
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:22,540
Thank you for giving me the privilege, Ms. Park Dan Dan.

284
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:33,070
I got her now, finally.

285
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,320
I think you are very much like your aunt.

286
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,900
Me? Do you think so?

287
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:43,050
Yes. She's pretty inside and out too.

288
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,900
Hello. No, you have a seat!

289
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,520
Oh, I've lost them here.

290
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,890
I have to know what their relationship is.

291
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:28,157
Okay, this will be more than enough.

292
00:23:29,756 --> 00:23:31,660
Welcome, Soo Chul and Dan Dan.

293
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,140
What is this?

294
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,750
I got this on the way because they are so pretty.

295
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,000
Really?

296
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,860
They are very pretty.

297
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,470
Flowers are always best.

298
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:48,120
What do you have there, Soo Chul?

299
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,800
You seemed a bit tired lately, so I got this for you.

300
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,330
You got me such a precious thing! Let me see.

301
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,010
I have to try it now.

302
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,440
Yes.

303
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,570
Oh, my goodness.

304
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:03,950
I got such a precious present from my little brother.

305
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:11,830
Thank you very much, Soo Chul.

306
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:18,360
But please don't bring anything next time. This is your sister's house.

307
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,490
What about Dae Beom?

308
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:24,740
He's at work, so only Dan Dan and I could make it today.

309
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:29,220
Yes, we can see him next time.

310
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,450
He's right on time. This is my son, Joon Oh.

311
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:36,570
Joon Oh, say hello to your uncle.

312
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:40,450
- Hello, Uncle.
- You're Joon Oh.

313
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,710
Nice to meet you. How about a handshake?

314
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,710
Yes.

315
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,080
Why did you prepare so much food?

316
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,350
I wanted to cook so many things for you and Dan Dan.

317
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,790
But this is it for today.

318
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:58,950
I'll cook delicious food in the future as well, so take your time and eat as much as you want.

319
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:02,730
Soo Chul, try these ribs.

320
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,690
Yes.

321
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:09,570
And Dan Dan, have some ribs too.

322
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,650
It's delicious. Please eat a lot.

323
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,080
Yes, Aunt.

324
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,280
Thank you for the food.

325
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,860
Now I see you today, Dan Dan,

326
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,480
you look a lot like your grandmother.

327
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,230
- Really?
- Yes.

328
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:29,170
Dan Dan, please come and visit me often.

329
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:32,940
And get close to Joon Oh too.

330
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,830
Yes, Aunt.

331
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:41,520
Seeing Dan Dan makes me think of my mother.

332
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,270
Mom, it's a happy day today. You should be smiling.

333
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:49,820
Mom, let's smile.

334
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,350
Yes, you're right.

335
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:58,740
It's a happy day. So let's smile and eat.

336
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,860
- Let's eat.
- Thank you for the food!

337
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,480
- Joon Oh, enjoy your meal.
- You too, Noona.

338
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,250
Let's eat.

339
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:11,630
Dad, it's strange,

340
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:16,150
but even though I saw her for the first time,

341
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:18,780
I was not awkward

342
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,390
and felt like she was my Aunt the whole time.

343
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,450
It was very comfortable.

344
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:29,400
Right? I think she works hard to make us feel comfortable.

345
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,580
You found your older sister,

346
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:35,790
and I got myself an aunt. I'm very happy.

347
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,910
Dan Dan.

348
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:44,540
It's been a long time since we saw outside like this. Why don't we have shaved ice? I'll get one for you.

349
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,840
I'm sorry, Dad. I have something important today.

350
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,160
Can we have shaved ice next time?

351
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,230
Okay, I'll see you later then.

352
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,560
I'm sorry, Dad. I'll get going first.

353
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,660
Dan Dan, walk slowly! You might fall!

354
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,430
Yes!

355
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:08,540
What's so important for her to run like that?

356
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:23,940
I hoped for it again, but...

357
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,830
The Anna Kim line I'm introducing this time

358
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:37,040
can be worn as daily sports casual wear besides golf wear.

359
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,190
It has a great design but also has functionality.

360
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:43,030
If you like me too,

361
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:48,420
please tie the handkerchief on this tree by tomorrow.

362
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,340
If the handkerchief isn't there by midnight tomorrow,

363
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:58,490
I will put away my feelings and forget about you.

364
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,610
Chairman.

365
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,930
What is it?

366
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:15,660
Please tell us if it's okay to launch it like this or not.

367
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,930
Yes, it's good. Please go ahead as presented.

368
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,420
Good work, CEO Anna.

369
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:44,520
Oh, no!

370
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,770
How did this fall?

371
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,950
The dessert is already here.

372
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:09,770
I wonder what it is.

373
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,830
Would you open it, Se Ryun?

374
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,820
Me?

375
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,080
Because it's not a dessert, you must be surprised.

376
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:31,270
It's just unexpected.

377
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,870
I had been wondering how I should propose.

378
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:40,410
I thought a lot about it, but I'm not sure if you would like it.

379
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:43,040
By the way, my mom,

380
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,870
she's not very patient.

381
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,960
She picked out our wedding date already.

382
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,750
It's the second Saturday of next month.

383
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,470
Is that okay with you?

384
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,900
That's okay.

385
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,460
Is it?

386
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:10,140
Then, we're getting married on that day.

387
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,830
Yes.

388
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:18,500
Oh, that's right.

389
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,740
Se Ryun, give me your hand.

390
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:34,150
How is it? Do you like it?

391
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:36,260
Yes.

392
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:08,150
Let's live happily together.

393
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:17,990
Padak Padak! Hot! Young Men!

394
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,050
The delicious chicken skewer is here!

395
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:23,410
It's the kind of flavor two people eat together and die, yet still high-five each other in heaven!

396
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,380
Come and try it!

397
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,890
The delicious chicken skewer is here!

398
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,650
Hot!

399
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:34,140
It's good...

400
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:41,370
At least we managed to meet our goal for today with the deliveries,

401
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:46,260
but what are we going to do about the lack of customers?

402
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,790
I think it's like what your mom said,

403
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:52,290
nobody would come all the way here to eat this when it gets cold.

404
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:55,890
We'll have to move or come up with a solution-- Hey, hey!

405
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:58,170
It's burning!

406
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:00,570
Hey, Park Dae Beom. What's wrong with you?

407
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:02,930
Get yourself together!

408
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,840
Did something happen while you were out for delivery?

409
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,530
I'm sorry, Uncle. I need to go somewhere, for just a moment.

410
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:12,350
Hey, what's going on?

411
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,180
Something happened, right?

412
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:18,190
I think Se Ryun's going to marry that bastard from before.

413
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,730
I'll be back soon.

414
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:23,670
What? Hey, Dae Beom! Hey!

415
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:31,370
With that two-timing ostrich egg bastard?

416
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:35,020
Wow, why's she marrying that guy?

417
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:41,220
But what is Dae Beom going to do about it?

418
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,760
I was very happy today, Ms. Se Ryun.

419
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,030
Yes, me too.

420
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:50,480
Please, head in. I'll call you later.

421
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,590
Okay. Please, head in.

422
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,460
Oh, you first.

423
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:57,080
No, you first.

424
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,070
Why are you here?

425
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:23,370
That guy just now, he's the guy I saw last time, isn't he?

426
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:26,020
Are you going to marry him?

427
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,430
Yes.

428
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:30,380
Really? Are you going to marry him?

429
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:35,200
Why? Did you think I would still be holding onto your memories,

430
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,030
but surprised that I'm already getting married?

431
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,040
You said so yourself.

432
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,530
That we should end it as good memories.

433
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,490
That we should each go our way.

434
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,150
So you're going to marry that bastard?

435
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,670
Don't talk bad about him! He's someone I'm going to marry!

436
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,770
I can't let you marry him!

437
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:55,170
I'm fine with you getting married, but not to that guy.

438
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,030
Park Dae Beom.

439
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:00,130
You're ridiculous.

440
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:03,390
I mean, are you getting jealous now?

441
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:06,780
Are you regretting breaking up with me?

442
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,640
Why are you acting like this out of nowhere?

443
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:14,170
What does it matter to you who I marry or not?

444
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,870
Right.

445
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:19,030
I don't care who you marry.

446
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:22,950
But I'm saying this because I don't think he's an okay person!

447
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,430
So please, if you're going to marry him, please look into things further.

448
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:31,390
I came here to say this to you. Bye.

449
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:36,140
Hey. Why do you care?

450
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:41,030
Why do you care what happens to me?

451
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:45,390
Hey. Is that all you have to say to me?

452
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:49,200
Do you seriously have nothing more to say?

453
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,890
Who do you think you are?

454
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:59,870
Why do you care about me...

455
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,930
I can't let you marry him!

456
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:40,700
I'm fine with you getting married, but not to that guy.

457
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,880
If you're going to marry him, please look into things further.

458
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,610
I came here to say this to you.

459
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,180
What are we going to do about Dae Beom and Geon, Mom?

460
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:03,070
I'm seriously worried about them!

461
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,140
If they can't sell everything every day,

462
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:08,660
how will they manage their ingredients expenses, let alone their wages?

463
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,110
Imagine how frustrated they are.

464
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:14,680
Don't show your frustrations, and stay quiet for now.

465
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,590
At least today, they only have a few left.

466
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:20,540
Let's finish it all.

467
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:24,010
Still, Geon at least works part-time as a driver too,

468
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:27,420
but Dae Beom is only getting angry with everyone! What did he do well?

469
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:31,610
He's acting like that because he's upset and sorry for everything.

470
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,650
This is all because of you, Mom.

471
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,820
What? What are you saying?

472
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,990
You're the one who wanted to make Geon a soccer player!

473
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:41,210
If you hadn't made Geon play soccer, Dae Beom wouldn't be like this today!

474
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:46,780
He thought soccer-playing Geon was so cool, and Dae Beom ended up playing soccer too!

475
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:49,500
If he had studied without playing soccer,

476
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,280
my Dae Beom would have become an office worker!

477
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,440
You have to say things clearly.

478
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,160
I told you to follow around Dae Beom

479
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,890
and not make him play soccer!

480
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:05,170
Didn't I tell you for him to become a successful soccer player is harder

481
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:07,240
than a camel going through an eye of a needle?

482
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:13,900
I mean, honestly, Dae Beom was much better than Geon at soccer.

483
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,320
If he hadn't been injured in his freshman year of college,

484
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,970
Dae Beom would have been standing next to Son Heung Min or Park Ji Sung players!

485
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:24,410
Now that I think of it, God could be very frigid.

486
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:28,240
- God looks after some people, but not all.
 - Hey, Park Dae Beom! Come out here!

487
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,080
- Park Dae Beom! 
- What is that sound?

488
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,530
- Park Dae Beom, Come out! 
- I know.

489
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:36,920
- Dae Beom, come out here! 
- What is that sound?

490
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,720
- Hey, Park Dae Beom! Come out here! 
- It's the voice from before!

491
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,110
That girl from that house!

492
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:49,000
Oh, my goodness! She's here again!

493
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,180
What's going on?

494
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,150
Why is this lady acting up again?!

495
00:37:54,150 --> 00:38:00,850
Why do you always lie down like a log in our front yard whenever you drink?!

496
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,490
Why are you getting a blanket for her? Do you still think she's the lady where you work?

497
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:09,760
This is ridiculous!

498
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:16,060
Did he propose to her today?

499
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:19,580
It's romantic just hearing about it!

500
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,590
Yes, yes!

501
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:27,370
Oh, no, since you've set the wedding date, we'll prepare the meet-the-family day!

502
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:31,200
Oh, of course! Yes.

503
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,720
Then, have a good evening, lady-in-law!

504
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:41,330
This girl is calling me, finally.

505
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:44,360
Yes, it's your mom--

506
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,320
- Who is it?
- Have you already forgotten my voice?

507
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,630
I'm Park Dae Beom's mother.

508
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,620
Park Dae Beom? That player guy?

509
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,560
What? What did you just say?

510
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,680
I mean, why do you have Se Ryun's phone?

511
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:07,970
Why do you think? Why does a rich madam's head is so slow?

512
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,790
Your daughter

513
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:13,830
has fainted in our front yard after getting drunk again!

514
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:16,860
Wh-what?

515
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:25,370
Oh, no! I'm so sorry!

516
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:29,240
I'm so sorry. Why is she here? Hey!

517
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,390
Wake up! Hey, wake up!

518
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:35,350
Excuse me.

519
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:42,090
She's pretty old, and we don't really like this young lady as well.

520
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:45,710
But she seems to have a hard time getting over our Dae Beom,

521
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:48,890
so why don't we let them just get back together?

522
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:51,120
Mom, what are you talking about it right now?

523
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:55,050
Do you think you can say anything? How can you say that?

524
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:59,420
It's ridiculous! My Se Ryun's getting married next month!

525
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,890
- Is she getting married?
- Yes!

526
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:06,010
- Hey, wake up!
- Who the heck is hitting me!

527
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:08,500
I said, wake up!

528
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,420
Mom?

529
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,240
Why do you come here when you're going to marry someone else?

530
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,740
Oh, it's so embarrassing!

531
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:20,240
Let's go! Come out with me!

532
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:26,180
Oh, it's Park Dae Beom! Dae Beom!

533
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:30,800
Hey, Park Dae Beom. Why did you come to see me?

534
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,680
Who do you think you are to tell me not to marry?

535
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,820
What did you really want to say to me?

536
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:44,680
Park Dae Beom. You missed me, didn't you!

537
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,970
You were still regretting our breakup, weren't you?

538
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:56,550
But, why are you shaking my heart?

539
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:59,100
You bad bastard.

540
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,550
What is she talking about?

541
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:04,740
What? Is what Se Ryun just said correct?

542
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,850
Did you go see her?

543
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:09,500
Did you make her waver?

544
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,280
- That's...
- Park Dae Beom, you better tell the truth.

545
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,300
Did you really go see her?

546
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,150
Yes. I had something to tell her.

547
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:20,770
You bad bastard!

548
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,270
- You bastard!
- Do it with words!

549
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:25,900
Excuse me! Do you think I'm in a state to talk?!

550
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,350
If you go see my Se Ryun one more time

551
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,360
and make her waver one more time,

552
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:34,830
I'll explode your entire household, this damn house!

553
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:38,700
You bastard! Come out, Se Ryun.

554
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,830
- Come out, now!
- Hey, Park Dae Beom!

555
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:46,260
- Why are you such a coward?!
- Come out!

556
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,900
If you're going to say something, say it straight up!

557
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,090
- Just tell me you don't want me to marry!
- Come out with me!

558
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:54,680
Oh, okay, okay!

559
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,080
Put her in the car!

560
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,750
You are crazy! Why would you go looking for her when she's going to get married?

561
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:04,760
- I can't live because of you! 
- What?

562
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,650
Why is he acting like that?

563
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:10,120
I mean, why would he visit someone else's fiancé?

564
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,960
Oh, I'm so upset!

565
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,900
Get out and die, you bastard!

566
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,150
Why are you shouting that this late at night?

567
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:20,520
What's going on? Why was that young lady at our house so late at night?

568
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,170
Apparently, he visited the girl who's about to get married

569
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:27,920
- and shook her mind or something.
- What?

570
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,680
- Dae Beom didn't go to make her change her mind.
- What?

571
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,730
The man that lady's going to marry

572
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:38,440
is currently two-timing. That's what he was trying to tell her.

573
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:43,230
Of course! My Dae Beom's not the kind of person who'd do that!

574
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,700
But what? Two-timing?

575
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,610
Wait, two-timing means...

576
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:51,960
There's another woman to the man she's about to get married to?

577
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,910
Wait, is that true?

578
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:56,850
Yes. Dae Beom must have been worried she'd get hurt,

579
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:59,230
so he must have glossed over it.

580
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:01,420
Dae Beom and I just happened to know this,

581
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:04,190
but that bastard was...

582
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,430
He has a different woman.

583
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:09,660
Oh, of course. But it's kind of exhilarating!

584
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:14,310
It's hilarious. Good for them!

585
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:17,760
Oh, my goodness.

586
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:25,780
Why is he here?

587
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:28,790
Does he really live in our neighborhood?

588
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:31,270
No way...

589
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:35,500
It's my first time seeing him around here after seeing him at the convenience store.

590
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:47,610
What? Why does he keep following me?

591
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:51,020
Why is he here out of all the other streets?

592
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,270
Maybe he's really a stalker?

593
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:59,430
I think he is a stalker!

594
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:02,490
What are you doing right now!

595
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:04,260
You're a stalker, right?

596
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:07,750
If you keep following me, I'll report you to the police!

597
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:09,300
If I scream right now,

598
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,710
my cousin and two uncles will all come out!

599
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:14,530
If you take another step, I'm seriously going to scream!

600
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:16,410
Do so then!

601
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:21,000
I know misunderstandings can be a mental illness, but what a condition!

602
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,060
I'm in a rush to go to the bathroom.

603
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,260
What?

604
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:39,200
Is that rooftop house his house?

605
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,840
Did I accuse him of nothing?

606
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,610
Chairman, I don't have the courage to face you anymore.

607
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,890
And I can't stay here any longer.

608
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:05,450
Thank you for everything until now. Goodbye.

609
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,960
What do I do?

610
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:43,000
♫  When I walk this road, it makes me cry  ♫

611
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:49,950
♫  It reminds me of that person's touch  ♫

612
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:57,550
♫  I couldn't hold her and just trembled my heart  ♫

613
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:04,270
♫ My beautiful love ♫

614
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:09,060
♫  It seems like love is bitter  ♫

615
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,460
What are you doing here, Ms. Park?

616
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:15,320
Chairman.

617
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:18,910
Ms. Park, it's alright.

618
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:22,430
I am here now, so it will be fine.

619
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:28,620
How is it? Do you feel better now?

620
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:32,000
You told me this before. Drinking this makes you feel better.

621
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,120
Please get on, Ms. Park.

622
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,540
How many times should we go around to make you feel better?

623
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:41,210
If it makes you feel better, we could ride around a hundred times.

624
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:47,520
♫  In case I lose it, I hold it tight  ♫

625
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,470
That's right.

626
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:54,210
That was all because he's a warm and gentle person.

627
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:58,010
He was just being nice to me.

628
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:01,610
But I misunderstood him.

629
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,200
Park Dan Dan.

630
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,710
Let's forget him.

631
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:10,360
Let's have a drink

632
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,800
and forget it all.

633
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:20,580
♫ Why do you run away, love ♫

634
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:24,760
♫ Like a shy child ♫

635
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:31,580
♫ In case I lose it, I hold it tight  ♫

636
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:38,510
♫  But love always runs away, chased by longing  ♫

637
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:45,740
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

638
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:55,220
♫  It would be nice to take a break  ♫

639
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:56,950
What?

640
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:00,490
Did I not bring my handkerchief today?

641
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:02,850
Oh, no!

642
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:14,440
I want to use the one Ms. Park gave me as a gift.

643
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,150
Where did it go?

644
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,860
What should I do?

645
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:42,770
No, this is not right.

646
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,700
How could I date Ms. Park?

647
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:52,230
No, it can't be.

648
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,320
What?

649
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,660
Where did that handkerchief come from?

650
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:16,700
No, it's not right.

651
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,900
I have to think of my age.

652
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:23,120
I also have three children!

653
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:29,530
Chairman!

654
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,410
Ms. Park.

655
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:55,330
I knew it.

656
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:59,640
I knew you would tie the handkerchief.

657
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:04,300
Ms. Park, it's not like that.

658
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:09,410
The handkerchief was brought there by the wind.

659
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:13,120
Chairman, that doesn't make any sense.

660
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:17,420
I know you are saying that because you are shy.

661
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:22,710
It was very embarrassing for me to tell you how I felt too.

662
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:25,290
You don't have to say anything now.

663
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:28,540
Since you tied the handkerchief.

664
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,950
Oh, no.

665
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:43,000
What is that?

666
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,080
The truth was when I came here earlier,

667
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,590
and there was no handkerchief.

668
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:52,020
So I thought you had rejected me,

669
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:55,070
so I was going to have a drink and forget about it all.

670
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,790
Did you not eat dinner?

671
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:04,220
It's not like I didn't eat,

672
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:07,180
but I couldn't get anything down.

673
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:18,710
I guess you didn't eat either.

674
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:25,590
Chairman, it's 12:01 AM now.

675
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:32,350
This is the first day of our relationship, right?

676
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:34,570
First day?

677
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:36,720
Let's celebrate our first day

678
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,050
with a date.

679
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:42,280
A date?

680
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,480
Yes.

681
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,370
It will be sad to end the first day of our relationship like this.

682
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:50,900
Let's go get something to eat since we are both hungry.

683
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,160
Hurry.

684
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:58,790
♫  If I get to see you once again  ♫

685
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:03,920
♫  You, the one I put in my heart  ♫

686
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,410
In celebration of the first day of you and me! Cheers!

687
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:13,820
Okay, let's do that. The first day.

688
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:16,790
Cheers!

689
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:21,910
♫  My feelings toward you  ♫

690
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,940
I can't believe you're my boyfriend from today.

691
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:30,830
♫  I want to call your name  ♫

692
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:38,580
♫  Looking at each other with excitement and forgot about sleep  ♫

693
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,580
Please eat. You must be hungry.

694
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,850
Thank you.

695
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:45,070
Should we do cheers with ramyun as well?

696
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:46,690
To celebrate our first day!

697
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:48,630
Cheers!

698
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:54,800
♫ I want to be with you forever  ♫

699
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:08,830
What's so difficult to find out the relationship between Driver Park and Ms. Park?

700
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:12,050
Why are they still not reporting to me?

701
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:19,460
Should I spread this photo first?

702
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:23,720
No, no.

703
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:28,290
I have to be patient until something firm comes up.

704
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:31,070
They really look good together.

705
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:33,800
What is their relationship?

706
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,000
Have a great day, Dad.

707
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,930
Please do your best today as well.

708
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:47,320
Jenny, Se Chan, Se Jong, I have lots of time today, do you want me to drive you to school?

709
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:50,010
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah!

710
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:52,470
Did something good happen to you today, Chairman?

711
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:56,190
You look very young, like a bachelor.

712
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:59,710
No, nothing good happened.

713
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,570
Should we go, children?

714
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:04,580
Yes.

715
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,300
Have a good day.

716
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:17,520
Oh, this vixen.

717
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,340
Look at her wagging her tail from the morning.

718
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,670
Sure, flirt as much as you want.

719
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:26,110
It won't be for long.

720
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:29,830
Oh, my head hurts so much, Mom.

721
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:32,470
What should I do with my head?

722
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:35,600
I'm getting honey water to a hung-over daughter.

723
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,760
My life is so hard.

724
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,450
My head is splitting.

725
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:44,250
Are you going to be okay without any sobering medication?

726
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:51,830
Se Ryun, if you don't want to marry him, you don't have to. We can just call off the wedding.

727
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:55,320
You are making me nervous.

728
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,030
Why are you nervous?

729
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:59,140
Are you going to see that bastard even after you get married?

730
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:02,030
If you see someone else while married, that's an affair.

731
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:04,310
Do you know how hard that is?

732
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:07,550
You will be fingered at and talked about by people all your life.

733
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:09,490
You fall into wrong love like that,

734
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:12,730
and you will end up being blamed for everything. That's how the affair ends.

735
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:15,250
Haven't you seen the life I've lived?

736
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:18,190
So please, if you don't want to marry him,

737
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:21,220
just call off the wedding.

738
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:28,850
Mom, don't worry.

739
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:33,700
I will never see that cheap bastard again.

740
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:40,420
I'm sorry for making you upset yesterday, Mom.

741
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:48,530
Are you really sure you won't see him again?

742
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:53,660
No. It'll never happen again.

743
00:55:53,660 --> 00:56:00,020
Then I'm going to tell your brother that you're getting married.

744
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:18,910
Your mom came by my office a little earlier.

745
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:23,710
Is it true that you are getting married?

746
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:25,710
Yes.

747
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:29,270
Have you given it serious consideration before deciding?

748
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:31,880
How can you marry him when you just met him?

749
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,610
You never talked about this with me once.

750
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:37,620
Mom has approved.

751
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:41,150
If she approves, isn't that enough?

752
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:47,820
I'm wondering if you are getting into an unwanted marriage for your mom.

753
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:50,000
"Your mom, your mom."

754
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,410
Why do you always say not "our mom," but "your mom?"

755
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:57,340
- What?
- Oppa.

756
00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:00,410
How can you do that?

757
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:05,700
Never mind. As soon as I get married,

758
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:09,980
please do not delay handing over the company shares I'm entitled to.

759
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:12,960
I want to receive my rights and entitlements as soon as possible.

760
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:19,110
Are you saying you're getting married to get your company's share?

761
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:23,000
To get married and to get the shares.

762
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:26,220
There's nothing bad about it.

763
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:29,190
Okay.

764
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:32,550
If that's the case, get married.

765
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:35,120
Do it as you wish.

766
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:38,020
Congratulations on your marriage.

767
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:53,120
Ms. Park.

768
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,430
CEO Anna, have you waited for long?

769
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:57,530
No, I just got here.

770
00:57:57,530 --> 00:58:02,910
CEO Anna, what's the occasion for you to want to see me in a fancy place like this?

771
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:05,350
I've been busy working on the new launch.

772
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:08,460
So I haven't been able to even have coffee with you.

773
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:11,580
Now that we are here together let's eat great food,

774
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:14,840
and drink coffee and chat for a while.

775
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:19,250
And I have something to give you too.

776
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:24,840
- Here.
- What is this?

777
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:27,430
I got you some clothes.

778
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:31,750
Can you wear these at my launch party tomorrow?

779
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:35,380
Will you come to my party, Ms. Park?

780
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:39,470
CEO Anna, are you sure I can come?

781
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:42,720
Of course! I'm inviting you.

782
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,910
Please come and see the new collection.

783
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:49,350
It could help you if you decide to work for me.

784
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:51,230
Thank you, CEO Anna.

785
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:54,240
In that case, let me buy this meal.

786
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,210
No, it doesn't matter who pays for it.

787
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:59,630
I've already ordered for us.

788
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:01,490
Do you like pasta?

789
00:59:01,490 --> 00:59:04,760
Yes, I love it.

790
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:09,200
How is Madam doing?

791
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,380
Did she give you a hard time again when I'm not around?

792
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:17,910
No. She even gave me a necklace yesterday.

793
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:20,080
She apologized to me.

794
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:24,080
And she promised not to act like that again.

795
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:29,560
Good. As you said, it's because Madam's not well.

796
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:33,720
If she acts like that again, just avoid the situation and run away.

797
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:38,300
And call me any time if you need my help.

798
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:40,420
CEO Anna.

799
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:44,800
Thank you very, very much.

800
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:48,750
Whenever I'm having a tough time,

801
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:53,530
you look after me like you're my mom.

802
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:59,290
Really? Did I?

803
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:04,350
I must really want to hire you.

804
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:13,590
Please give serious consideration to working with me in the U.S.

805
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:15,690
