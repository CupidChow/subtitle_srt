Yeon Sil.
 [Episode 51]

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:11,590
Please forgive me once.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,800
Let me go to her.

4
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,480
While she's getting her surgery,

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,830
please allow me to be with her.

6
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,200
Please.

7
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,710
I beg you.

8
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:43,460
Are you saying...

9
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,330
Are you saying you want to abandon me?

10
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:52,560
Are you breaking up with me?

11
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,750
Why would I break up with you?

12
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,950
That's not what I mean.

13
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:09,340
We can't leave her to die like that.

14
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,400
We have to save her first.

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,290
If I let her go like this,

16
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,090
I will regret it for the rest of my life.

17
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,910
Honey.

18
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:26,030
Please let it go, just once.

19
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,050
Please.

20
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,250
Please don't make it harder for her.

21
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,940
I...

22
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,130
I'm not saying I'll do something with her.

23
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,170
I just want to keep her alive and send her to the US.

24
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,200
That's all I want.

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,850
So, for the sake of Dan Dan, please.

26
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,890
I beg you, Honey.

27
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,530
If you want to go, go.

28
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,810
But sign the divorce papers before you go.

29
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,430
You can go after breaking up with me.

30
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,840
What?

31
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,250
If you want to live with her that much,

32
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,710
write a paper that you'll divorce me first!

33
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,430
How can you do this to me? How!

34
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,070
Think about it from my position.

35
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,580
Think about it from my position!

36
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,020
Father. Aren't you going too overboard?

37
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,700
How can you say such things to Mom?

38
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,950
You can't be acting like this toward Mom!

39
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,450
Dae Beom, please.

40
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,650
Please stay out of it.

41
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:48,960
Okay, go. Go!

42
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,860
I don't need you anymore.

43
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,520
What is she to you to be acting like this to me?

44
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,740
How can you do this to me!

45
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,990
How?

46
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,840
- Mom. Mom.
- Dae Beom!

47
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,560
Don't cry, Mom.

48
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,190
How can he do this to me?

49
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,690
How? How?

50
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,200
Dad.

51
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,410
Yes, Dan Dan.

52
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,450
What's wrong with you?

53
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,920
I can't understand why you are doing this. So I came to ask you.

54
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,260
How can you say those things to Mom?

55
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,190
Do you think that makes sense?

56
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,040
Dan Dan.

57
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,860
CEO Anna Kim,

58
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,760
she's very sick.

59
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,490
But she has no one by her side.

60
00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:00,120
How can she endure and survive such a scary disease alone? That's why.

61
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:07,530
So I'm saying, what's your relationship with her to say it like that?

62
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:13,610
She's the mother who gave birth to you, Dan Dan.

63
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,170
Dad.

64
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:22,620
You hated her so much, have you forgotten?

65
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,170
Okay, I see how that could happen.

66
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,060
You could forgive her. But...

67
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,710
You can't be like that toward Mom.

68
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,050
She's the one who's been by your side all this time.

69
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:38,840
But how can you say such ruthless things to Mom?

70
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,200
If you want to go to CEO Anna,

71
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,980
divorce my mom as she requested.

72
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,560
Okay.

73
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,310
I understand.

74
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,150
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,830
I know I've done wrong.

76
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,370
If you know, then go and apologize to Mom.

77
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,780
Ask her for forgiveness. Okay?

78
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,730
Okay.

79
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,050
But Dan Dan.

80
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,720
CEO Anna Kim has to get surgery soon.

81
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,680
If something goes wrong while she's alone, I thought it might hurt your feelings.

82
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,800
What's it to us if she dies or not?

83
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,240
And why would I be hurt?

84
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,570
Honey.

85
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,960
I've done wrong.

86
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,590
I'm really sorry.

87
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,800
I must have lost my senses.

88
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:30,470
I will not say such a thing again.

89
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:36,740
I will not pay attention to whether she lives or dies from now on.

90
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,900
So please don't be upset anymore.

91
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,750
I've heard about it.

92
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,810
That you've been very sick.

93
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,490
But I didn't know.

94
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,800
If there is anything I can help you with,

95
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,030
please tell me anything.

96
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,230
It's okay.

97
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,420
No one can help me.

98
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,830
This is something I have to endure on my own.

99
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,960
Let's not talk about it.

100
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,310
I have so much to tell you.

101
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,820
Really?

102
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:36,650
I've been feeling terribly sorry toward you.

103
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:44,340
I've wanted to say this for so long, and finally, here I am.

104
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,280
You don't have to.

105
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,050
Don't worry about it, I'm fine.

106
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,380
You've always been a great support to me.

107
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:02,610
Whenever I came to Korea, you welcomed me like family.

108
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,610
So I always said in words

109
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:09,630
that we are a family, you are my brother.

110
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,940
But I've hurt you a lot.

111
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,240
Noona.

112
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:24,200
It wasn't because I didn't like you.

113
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,640
Nor because you did something wrong.

114
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:36,790
It was all because my guilt and regret of abandoning Dan Dan were too big.

115
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:39,520
I wanted to take her with me.

116
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,460
And give her everything I couldn't do until now.

117
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:48,250
I was being greedy and acted wrong again.

118
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:54,830
I didn't think of you but only Dan Dan.

119
00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:02,600
And I also thought my Dan Dan was too young to be with you.

120
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,670
And precious to give her to you.

121
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,530
I didn't think of your feelings at all.

122
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:14,640
I'm sorry, Young Gook.

123
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,840
Noona.

124
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,600
You don't have to say all that.

125
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,140
I'm all right.

126
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,770
Young Gook.

127
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:39,090
You still do have feelings for my Dan Dan, don't you?

128
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,710
I do.

129
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,670
We are seeing each other again.

130
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,960
We will not break up again.

131
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:55,750
Yes, I'm glad it's you who my Dan Dan loves.

132
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:01,950
I know you'll be able to make her happy.

133
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,700
Young Gook.

134
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,660
Please take good care of her.

135
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,690
Please make my Dan Dan happy.

136
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,600
Don't worry about Ms. Park.

137
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,820
You have to overcome this.

138
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:37,670
And watch Ms. Park and me being happy together.

139
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,150
Yes.

140
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,590
Yes, I will.

141
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,630
Thank you, Young Gook.

142
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,690
Chairman, where are we going today?

143
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,050
- We are going for lunch.
- Lunch?

144
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,270
There is a really good bulgogi restaurant nearby.

145
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,740
I know you like bulgogi.

146
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,450
But why do you look so serious when we are going for lunch?

147
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,580
You look like you are going on a battle.

148
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,430
- Do I?
- Yes.

149
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:22,280
You look like someone with a big task ahead.

150
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,470
Ms. Park, Ji Young Noona seemed like she wanted to see you.

151
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,410
But she seemed to have trouble initiating.

152
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,840
So I arranged this today.

153
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,210
I'm sorry for not telling you first.

154
00:11:53,210 --> 00:12:00,310
But don't you also want to see Ji Young Noona as well?

155
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,890
Chairman.

156
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:08,610
Just think of it as having lunch together.

157
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,060
Young Gook.

158
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,880
Dan Dan.

159
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,790
Noona, I wanted to have lunch with you.

160
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,500
But I have to leave due to an urgent matter.

161
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,900
Why don't you two eat together?

162
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,590
Ms. Park, please sit.

163
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,230
I've already ordered everything and paid for it.

164
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,910
So please enjoy and eat as much as you want.

165
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,900
Noona. I will get going.

166
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:04,870
Dan Dan, please don't misunderstand.

167
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,420
I didn't ask him to do this.

168
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,430
Young Gook asked me to have lunch together.

169
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:15,150
So I thought it would be just two of us and didn't know you would come.

170
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,930
Please don't misunderstand.

171
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,260
Please sit.

172
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:40,300
Have you been well?

173
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,320
Yes.

174
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:55,930
I would have paid more attention if I knew I would see you.

175
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:59,140
I look terrible, don't I?

176
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:04,690
Young Gook should've said something.

177
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,630
Here.

178
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:26,850
Eat as much as you want. You like bulgogi.

179
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,960
Please eat. You have to eat well.

180
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,680
Okay, thank you. Let's eat.

181
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,030
Please take care. Goodbye.

182
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,650
Wait, Dan Dan.

183
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:20,760
Can we go for coffee together?

184
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,660
Are you okay to drink coffee?

185
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,100
I heard you are getting surgery next week.

186
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:34,700
Well, I just thought...

187
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,240
I just want to sit in front of you, at least.

188
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,110
I just want to see your face for a little longer.

189
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,750
When you want to be with me this much,

190
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:03,310
and you want to see my face a little longer,

191
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,280
why?

192
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,180
Why did you deceive me all this time?

193
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,350
If you had told me who you were from the beginning.

194
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:19,950
Then we could have spent more time together.

195
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:27,550
After all this time, what do you want me to do?

196
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,700
Why do you hurt my heart this bad? Why?

197
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,250
Dan Dan.

198
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,820
Don't cry.

199
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,870
I'm sorry, Dan Dan.

200
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,080
Dan Dan...

201
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,150
Mom... Mom, I'm sorry.

202
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,970
Mom. Mom, I'm sorry.

203
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:01,330
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mom.

204
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:05,450
- Mom.
- No, I'm the one who's sorry.

205
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:08,790
Mom, I'm so sorry.

206
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,540
Please don't be sick. Please don't die, Mom.

207
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:17,210
Mom, I'm so sorry.

208
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,570
Mom.

209
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,280
Joon Oh, what are you doing?

210
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:35,290
You are not selling your major's books, are you?

211
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,510
Are you selling all these books because I cut off your allowances?

212
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,670
No, I'm not.

213
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,730
I'm going back to school.

214
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:49,830
Oh my, Joon Oh, my son!

215
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,410
My son.

216
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:57,320
My son is finally listening to me!

217
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:02,180
Please stop. I'm not a child.

218
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,120
Mi Rim said I should go back to school.

219
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,380
That's why.

220
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,090
What?

221
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,410
What did you say?

222
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,440
You are going back to school because Mi Rim told you to?

223
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,550
Yes. Mi Rim said I would make a great doctor.

224
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,590
So I decided to start again.

225
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,590
Oh my, you crazy punk.

226
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,620
What are you saying?

227
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,420
I've fed you, clothed you, provided lodging.

228
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,800
And I paid for your school and allowances.

229
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:38,180
When I, the mother who gave my life to you, asked you to go back to school, you didn't listen at all. But what?

230
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,640
"Mi Rim said I should go back to school?"

231
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,030
Are you really going to be like this?

232
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,780
Are you going to keep dating her?

233
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:51,640
Yes, I will never break up with Mi Rim.

234
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,730
Fine. Let's see how that goes.

235
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,440
Okay, let's sever our relationship as mother and son.

236
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,930
I will never accept her.

237
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,890
Mom. Are you being serious?

238
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,360
Then I will never see you again.

239
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,440
I will really end our relationship.

240
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,280
You don't have to take it that seriously...

241
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,150
So please don't speak like that again.

242
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,340
I'll be back later.

243
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,470
What was that?

244
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:34,000
That terrible boy is a traitor. A traitor.

245
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,890
You and my Joon Oh's relationship,

246
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,870
fine, I'll approve it.

247
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,880
Really?

248
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,990
I heard that Joon Oh going back to school is all thanks to you.

249
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:58,780
So how can I blindly disapprove of you two?

250
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,270
You made my wish come true.

251
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,350
I'm grateful for that.

252
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,210
Thank you.

253
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,650
But it's not just because of me.

254
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,530
Joon Oh decided for himself.

255
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:15,350
Anyway, if you two are serious about each other,

256
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:19,170
I'll buy an apartment near Joon Oh's school.

257
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:24,290
So can you move in there and look after my Joon Oh?

258
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,200
Pardon?

259
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,870
What do you mean by that?

260
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,090
It's not like we are getting married right now.

261
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:36,930
There is no reason for me to move down there and look after Joon Oh.

262
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,380
I don't like that idea.

263
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,190
What? You don't like it?

264
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:46,510
Haven't you been living together?

265
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:49,070
All this time?

266
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:53,890
Doesn't that mean you are planning to marry each other?

267
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,470
Even so, we are just seeing each other.

268
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,770
We've never talked about marriage.

269
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:04,360
And I have a dream of my own.

270
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:09,010
Now that I got the certificate, I need to build my career working in a hair salon.

271
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:12,730
I can't throw away my dream just to support Joon Oh.

272
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,190
What is it then?

273
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,900
Are you going to break up when Joon Oh goes back to school?

274
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:23,940
No, we will see each other once in a week or so, as the time allows.

275
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,880
That makes no sense.

276
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:33,210
Mi Rim, I'll open a hair salon for you.

277
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,350
If your dream is to become a hairdresser.

278
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,930
No, that's not right.

279
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:44,900
What? That's not it, either?

280
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,440
I'm a beginner with a lot to learn.

281
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,430
How can I open a salon without experience or qualification?

282
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:59,620
And my plan is to work under great hair designers and open my salon with my own efforts.

283
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:04,060
I'll ask for help if I need it in the future.

284
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:14,720
She's stubborn for someone who has nothing.

285
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,130
Actually, she's right.

286
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,040
Kids these days are better than me.

287
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,740
That Mi Rim has it together.

288
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,820
I don't know this number.

289
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,030
Who could it be?

290
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,980
Hello?

291
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,100
Gi Ja, aren't you in jail?

292
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,110
Can you make calls from jail?

293
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,050
You look great.

294
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:56,710
Maybe because I'm sleeping well.

295
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:00,140
I've been sleeping well since I've come here.

296
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,010
I feel more peaceful, if nothing else.

297
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:09,020
But, Mi Sook.

298
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,790
I can't get hold of my Sarah.

299
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:16,350
She doesn't come to see me.

300
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:20,100
Do you know her whereabouts, by chance?

301
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:25,820
Did you call me here because of Sarah?

302
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,690
Yes, Mi Sook.

303
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:34,650
Can you find my Sarah? Where is she, and how she's doing?

304
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:40,260
I don't know if she's alive or dead.

305
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,110
I'm worrying to death about her.

306
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:47,650
Gi Ja, how can I find out where Sarah is?

307
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:51,500
It's been a long time since she left my house.

308
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,370
Mi Sook.

309
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:56,030
Nothing would've happened to my Sarah, right?

310
00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:00,310
Lee Gi Ja. If you wanted to live without any trouble in your life,

311
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:05,020
you and your daughter should've not done such horrible things.

312
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,290
Don't you agree?

313
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:14,110
To be honest, I didn't want to come here despite your begging.

314
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:17,990
But I came here for the last time since we've been friends for a long time.

315
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:23,450
So please, do not contact me ever again.

316
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:28,840
I would like to end our relationship right here.

317
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:33,410
I'm here to say that to you.

318
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:37,020
- Mi Sook...
- Oh, that's right.

319
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:42,240
I put some money in for you.

320
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,920
I will go now.

321
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,390
To make it easier for you to eat.

322
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:13,640
I picked out the meat for you.

323
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,860
Eat with the hot broth.

324
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,790
Ajussi...

325
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,950
You have to eat everything well for the baby's health.

326
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,650
Please eat.

327
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:41,120
You know the potato is the highlight of the bone soup.

328
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,230
Crush the potato and eat it with rice.

329
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,330
Isn't it good?

330
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:12,930
Yes, it's good.

331
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:17,310
I knew you would like it.

332
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:24,820
The reason is, this is what my mom liked eating when she was pregnant with me.

333
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,730
Please eat some more. Here.

334
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,750
Eat some more meat.

335
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,220
I peeled some pears.

336
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,700
There is date ginger tea in the thermal too.

337
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,660
Drink it slowly.

338
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,590
Okay, thank you.

339
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:05,630
I've made some salad and rice in the fridge, so have some when you get hungry.

340
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:10,770
Please eat well. So you can get through this.

341
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,930
I will get going now.

342
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:17,440
Okay, I will eat well.

343
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,080
Can we see each other again?

344
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:26,810
Yes. I'll come by again.

345
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:29,930
Okay. Bye--

346
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,940
Oh, no!

347
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,110
What do we do?

348
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:44,720
Are you okay? What do we do?

349
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,210
What should I do?

350
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,930
Where did he go in the middle of the night?

351
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:17,450
It's been a long time since you made old squash soup. It looks delicious.

352
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:23,740
Yes, Mom. You can eat together when Se Ryun gets up.

353
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,750
By the way, I didn't see Dan Dan when I got up.

354
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,180
I don't think she came home last night.

355
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:34,010
She texted me to say she would sleepover at a friend's house.

356
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:36,100
Is that right?

357
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,620
I will get going.

358
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:42,220
Where are you taking this?

359
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,030
I thought I would take it to her.

360
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,850
What did you say?

361
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:51,990
- Are you bring it to Anna Kim?
- Yes.

362
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:59,950
I'm going there to say have this, get surgery well, and please live healthily.

363
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:04,880
If she dies like that, Soo Chul will never forgive me.

364
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,530
Same with Dan Dan.

365
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:10,140
Yes, you've thought it right.

366
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,850
You have to save people first.

367
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:18,090
And there is never a downside to doing good.

368
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:21,620
All of it will come back as a fortune.

369
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:26,090
Soo Chul will be grateful to you for the rest of his life too.

370
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:28,270
Please get going.

371
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,560
Okay.

372
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:38,690
My poor daughter.

373
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:43,750
Now she's taking care of her husband's sick ex-wife, who abandoned their daughter.

374
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:47,840
It's making me upset.

375
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,750
Dan Dan!

376
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,110
Mom...

377
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,510
Why are you here?

378
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:19,200
You told me you were sleeping at a friend's house yesterday, didn't you?

379
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,910
Did you sleep here? In this house?

380
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:24,490
Is this place your friend's house?!

381
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:27,130
Mom, that is, that is...

382
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,120
Were you taking care of your mother here?

383
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,630
Instead of your dad?

384
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:32,800
Did your dad ask you to do this?

385
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,690
No, Mom. I did it alone. Dad doesn't know anything.

386
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:40,230
Yesterday, CEO Anna was very sick, that's why.

387
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,670
I am sorry.

388
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,730
I should've not let Dan Dan sleep over here.

389
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:48,880
I should have sent her to go home, but everything was my fault.

390
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,480
You shouldn't do this.

391
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,020
Was it not enough for you to take my husband away from me?

392
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,890
Are you even trying to steal Dan Dan from me?

393
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:00,030
Don't you think you are going overboard?

394
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:02,060
I'm really sorry.

395
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,140
Dan Dan, please go. Go with your mom.

396
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,510
Dan Dan, you.

397
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,620
You don't have to come home now.

398
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:12,150
Live here from now on with your mom!

399
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,270
Mom! Mom!

400
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:18,840
Dan Dan, go. Go follow her.

401
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:28,010
I should have sent her back earlier, but what did I do again?

402
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:31,540
Am I being greedy again? Am I?

403
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,790
Mom, I am sorry. I am really sorry.

404
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:42,790
I lied to you about sleeping at my friend's house.

405
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,920
You said you'd take my side.

406
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:51,690
So I thought at least you would understand me.

407
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:55,280
But how can you do this to me too?

408
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,630
You even lied to me that you'd be sleeping at your friend's house.

409
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:02,340
If you told me you wanted to come here, did you think I'd prevent you from coming?

410
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,720
I...

411
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,130
I feel like I got betrayed.

412
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:11,350
How could you even do this to me?

413
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:15,350
Mom, I am very sorry. I was wrong.

414
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:20,240
Yesterday, CEO Anna was throwing up and very sick, so I couldn't leave her alone.

415
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,540
If I told you the truth, I thought you would be sad and upset.

416
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:29,430
So I lied that I'd sleep at a friend's house. Mom, I'm really sorry.

417
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:34,100
I really hate CEO Anna, but...

418
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:38,770
I also pity her.

419
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:41,770
Mom, I am very sorry, but...

420
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:48,290
Can you understand me just once?

421
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:54,120
Let me go.

422
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,620
Mom...

423
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,590
Mom!

424
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,190
Yeon Sil.

425
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:21,280
Please forgive me once.

426
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:30,900
Let me go to her.

427
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,400
While she's getting her surgery,

428
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:40,810
please allow me to be with her. Please.

429
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,640
I beg you.

430
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:55,140
I really hate CEO Anna, but I also pity her.

431
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,140
Mom, I am very sorry, but...

432
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:02,670
Can you understand me just once?

433
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,090
Are you back now?

434
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,620
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

435
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,990
Mom, you are back.

436
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:46,490
You can go. Go and save that woman.

437
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:49,930
Your body is here, but your mind is there right now.

438
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:51,740
You are only worried about that woman.

439
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:56,970
So don't pretend to work and go.

440
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:01,800
Honey, I'm not.

441
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,940
Why are you saying that?

442
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:07,040
That woman is Dan Dan's mom.

443
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,410
That's why I wanted to save her for Dan Dan's sake. I don't have any other intentions.

444
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:13,900
So please don't waste your time and go.

445
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,930
Go and do whatever you can to save her.

446
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:22,350
That way, you won't resent me later.

447
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,970
When you feel comfortable,

448
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:27,220
I would feel at ease as well.

449
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,860
So please go.

450
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,460
Honey.

451
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:42,260
Thank you, really thank you.

452
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:55,660
That bad guy... How can you really go even I say so?

453
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:59,740
How can you go without looking back at me?

454
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,350
Yes, Dan Dan's mother.

455
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,940
CEO Anna.

456
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:30,300
My husband will go there.

457
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,010
I gave him permission to go.

458
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,490
So ask him to do anything you need.

459
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:39,150
Please get surgery and stay alive,

460
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,670
and I hope you'll recover soon.

461
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:46,050
That way, I'd feel at ease.

462
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:52,350
Dan Dan's mother, Dan Dan's mother!!

463
00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:00,670
What is going on right now?

464
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:05,550
Ji Young, Ji Young!

465
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:09,440
Soo Chul, why did you come here again?

466
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,250
I told you not to come back.

467
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,900
My wife permitted me.

468
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:20,640
Until you get the surgery and get better, I'll stay by your side.

469
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:25,640
Soo Chul, how could you come here even though your wife told you to come?

470
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,100
Do you think you are helping me by doing this?

471
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,390
Do you think it's for me?

472
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,240
It's not.

473
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,740
It makes me more exhausting,

474
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,920
and it makes my life harder.

475
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,250
You are making me into a worse person.

476
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,220
Ji Young.

477
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:48,090
So please, Soo Chul.

478
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:53,690
Please don't come here again. I don't want to hurt your wife anymore.

479
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:57,520
- Ji Young.
- All the wrongs I did until now are more than enough.

480
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,630
I don't want to do that again.

481
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:03,550
So please go home, Soo Chul. Right now. I beg you.

482
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:06,430
You are not helping me by doing this!

483
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:08,470
How can you do it alone?

484
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:14,860
How can you handle that big surgery? Let me stay by your side until you finish the surgery.

485
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,500
Soo Chul.

486
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:24,720
If you insist on acting like this, I'll really disappear and die at the place where there's nobody.

487
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,590
I mean it. I won't get the surgery as well.

488
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:34,570
I get it.

489
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:36,830
I understand.

490
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:42,460
I understand what you are saying.

491
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:46,040
So please don't disappear and stay here.

492
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,080
Stay here and get the surgery.

493
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:56,720
I hope you can get through this on your own.

494
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:14,630
I came to apologize. I'm truly sorry.

495
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,350
I should be punished to death.

496
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,740
Why are you doing this?

497
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,560
I told you to use my husband.

498
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,080
I mean it, but why are you saying no?

499
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,680
Isn't that what you wanted?

500
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:33,490
No, it's not. Really.

501
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:40,110
It's true that I had bad intentions before.

502
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,470
I knew it was wrong,

503
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:48,520
but I tried to take Soo Chul and Dan Dan to America by luring them with money.

504
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:53,190
I guess that's why...

505
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:57,150
I'm being punished now.

506
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:04,410
Don't worry about Soo Chul and Dan Dan.

507
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:10,110
I'll go to America, and nobody will know about it.

508
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:13,330
I'll disappear quietly.

509
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,800
I'm truly sorry.

510
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,580
What did you say?

511
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,820
You're going to America?

512
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:25,090
And you'll disappear quietly?

513
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:27,420
I can't believe this.

514
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,880
How could you be so selfish until the very end?

515
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,760
Did you ever think how others would feel if you disappeared in that condition?

516
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,690
What about me? Did you think about it?

517
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,290
Are you trying to peg me as the bad person?

518
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:44,640
No, I'm not doing that at all.

519
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,960
It's because I've done too many wrongs to you.

520
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:53,530
Then what should I do?

521
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:59,490
Please tell me what you want. I'll do whatever you say so.

522
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,340
Get the surgery.

523
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:12,660
Become healthy and then go to America.

524
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:16,760
That's what everyone wants from you.

525
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,450
So don't think you're doing everyone a favor by disappearing.

526
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:24,650
Don't tantalize people by doing that.

527
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,630
I'm sorry.

528
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:38,030
I'm truly sorry.

529
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:47,880
I will never forget your graciousness and the gratitude I feel even after I die.

530
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:05,840
Thank you so much for raising Dan Dan so well.

531
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,610
I'm sorry.

532
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:16,400
Don't be like this. You're driving me crazy.

533
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:33,930
CEO Anna said she'll never receive your help.

534
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:38,470
Dan Dan, you should go stay

535
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:43,680
and care of your mom, CEO Anna until she fully recovers from the surgery.

536
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,340
H-Honey.

537
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:50,490
Mom. Can I really do that?

538
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:53,900
Yes. Do that.

539
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:58,340
That way, both your father and I will feel better about it.

540
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,760
Aigoo, good.

541
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,320
Now a load has been lifted off my chest, too.

542
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,360
Yeon Sil. You made the right decision.

543
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,710
My daughter is the best.

544
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:14,610
H-Honey. Thank you so much.

545
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:16,570
Thank you.

546
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:19,620
Take your hands off of me.

547
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:23,920
- Yeon Sil!
- Mother-in-law! Please stop, Honey!

548
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,930
Oh, gosh! She's going to kill me!

549
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,370
Mom!

550
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:34,520
What? Is that really true?

551
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:41,120
Yes. My mom allowed me to stay here with you.

552
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:51,680
No, Dan Dan. You can't do that.

553
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,680
I feel too much guilt towards you.

554
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:59,720
And also to your mom who raised you.

555
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:02,480
If you feel sorry towards me,

556
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,350
please get the surgery and survive it.

557
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:10,180
Be healthy again.

558
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,720
Dan Dan.

559
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:17,010
Mom.

560
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:21,770
Please...

561
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:27,350
Please don't die, okay?

562
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:35,780
Okay. I won't die.

563
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:41,790
I will be healthy again.

564
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:10,410
Sarah. Let's forget everything that happened until now.

565
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,680
Let's start over again.

566
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,980
I...

567
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:20,890
I want to live as our child's dad.

568
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,830
Yes?

569
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,070
Guess who I am.

570
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:39,300
Come on, Ajussi. You're so lame.

571
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:49,100
Will it kill you to play along just once? Here.

572
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,760
Sarah.

573
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,060
Take a look at this.

574
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:57,320
What is this?

575
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,360
Just try opening it.

576
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:03,320
I'm not sure if I picked it out well.

577
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:26,510
It's so pretty and cute.

578
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,650
I'm glad you think that.

579
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:36,140
Oh, I bought a mobile too.

580
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,880
Do you want to take a look?

581
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:43,250
Look.

582
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:45,830
Where should we hang this?

583
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:48,840
Where do you want it?

584
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,500
Ajussi. You're so stubborn.

585
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,510
What did you say?

586
00:48:57,510 --> 00:49:03,840
I'm so worried that I'll give birth to a stubborn child like you.

587
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:09,860
Don't worry. I'll scold them good if the child ever upsets you.

588
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:15,340
Anyway, where should I hang this? The house is small,

589
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:19,320
but why is the ceiling so high? Hold on.

590
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:26,880
This place is expensive.

591
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,820
I heard this place is really delicious.

592
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:34,310
So, order what you want to eat.

593
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:37,080
Don't regret it later.

594
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,250
Hurry up and choose. Whatever you want on the menu.

595
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:58,520
How is it?

596
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,540
Everything is so delicious here.

597
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:05,080
I ate in such a hurry, right?

598
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,620
It's fine. I'm glad you did.

599
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:11,560
What do you say, shall we get one more steak?

600
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,010
No, I'm full.

601
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:18,700
But why aren't you eating, Ajussi? Hurry up and eat too.

602
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:22,110
Well, you're eating so deliciously.

603
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:24,970
I think that might've filled me up. Gosh.

604
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:27,310
What are you saying? Don't be ridiculous.

605
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:29,980
Hurry up and eat, Ajussi.

606
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:34,800
Shall I try a bite then?

607
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:41,800
It's good.

608
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,510
Amazing.

609
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:45,800
It's really delicious.

610
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,990
I'm holding your hand because of the baby.

611
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:59,580
It'll be terrible if you fall.

612
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:02,790
I really don't have any other intention behind it.

613
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:07,600
Why? Is it too obvious that I'm lying?

614
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:12,440
Yes, it's so obvious.

615
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,800
Fine.

616
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:19,750
To be honest, I have other intentions too.

617
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:23,200
Sarah.

618
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:27,940
Let's go to Vietnam with me.

619
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,270
Vietnam?

620
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:34,650
Let's leave to a place where no one knows us.

621
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:39,610
From there, we can start everything over again.

622
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:48,720
I lived in Vietnam for over five years. I'm familiar with that place.

623
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:55,650
I'm confident I can take care of the baby and you, Sarah.

624
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:58,640
We'll settle in quickly.

625
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:04,610
So let's leave together.

626
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:07,770
How could I?

627
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:18,950
It's okay.

628
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:23,930
Sarah. You can start over.

629
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:27,080
We have our baby.

630
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:33,200
Also, I'm sure that my mom will understand.

631
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:39,830
So let's not tell anyone...

632
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:43,260
and leave together.

I'll take you to your front door.

I'm basically home. I'm not a little kid.

All right. I'll see you tomorrow.

00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:04,040
My apologies.

658
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:09,190
Unfortunately, the baby didn't survive.

659
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,760
We'll take you to the recovery room now.

660
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,740
Nothing happened, right?

661
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,850
It can't be.

662
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:23,950
It can't...

663
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:26,900
No, my baby.

664
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:30,000
My poor baby!

665
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:24,760
I did something unforgivable to you.

666
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:31,880
I committed a sin...

667
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:36,450
that can't be washed like a disgusting stain.

668
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:49,370
I shamelessly and without any conscience...

669
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:54,840
dreamed of happiness with you again.

670
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:58,200
It was wrong to do that.

671
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:06,520
I think that's why the heavens punished me.

672
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:17,290
I lost the baby that was our last remaining hope.

673
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:20,020
I...

674
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:30,710
I don't even have the right to apologize to you.

675
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:38,840
I think this is as far as our relationship goes.

676
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:49,550
Don't forgive me.

677
00:57:56,220 --> 00:58:04,920
I never regretted loving you, Sarah.

678
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:11,310
I fell short in many ways for you.

679
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:15,530
But I loved you with all my heart.

680
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:21,400
So I don't regret anything.

681
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:30,470
I... I'm okay.

682
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:41,680
Sarah. I hope that you will always be healthy and happy.

683
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:49,870
I'll get going first.

684
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:11,330
Thank you until the very end. Truly.

685
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:17,190
Why did I do that?

686
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:22,050
Why did I leave a great person like you?

687
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:24,700
Why did I?

688
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:27,010
Why?

689
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,980
You didn't have to prepare so much.

690
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:58,480
Gosh, it's been a while since you came to our house.

691
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,830
This is the least I could do.

692
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:03,140
Please, enjoy the food.

693
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:04,920
Everybody, let's eat.

694
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,090
Okay, thank you.

695
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:08,920
Everyone, please eat.

696
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,990
Please eat a lot, Anna Ajumma.

697
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:14,420
I will. You too, Jenny.

698
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:20,220
Anna Ajumma, you've become even more beautiful than the last time I saw you.

699
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:24,360
Thank you, Se Chan. You've become even more handsome too.

700
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:27,790
Gosh, I'm sure you're very popular in school, Se Chan.

701
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:34,380
You're such a good sweet talker. The girls must fall head over heels for you.

702
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:38,710
I won't deny that I'm popular with the girls.

703
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:42,780
My Hyung is a genius in love.

704
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:49,680
All right, let's eat.

705
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:54,470
♫ Woo, it's a happy day like a dream, yeah ♫

706
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:57,370
Block him. Block!

707
01:00:57,370 --> 01:00:59,160
Block Dad!

708
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,360
Kick it, Se Jong.

709
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:04,420
Block him. Come on.

710
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:06,710
- Here!
- Get it, Se Chan.

711
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:08,090
Hurry up.

712
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:09,850
Se Jong!

713
01:01:09,850 --> 01:01:16,500
We have to block him.

714
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:21,270
♫ It's a shiny day because of you  ♫

715
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:22,730
♫ It's sunshine day ♫

716
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:26,350
Chairman. Don't you think this is too unfair?

717
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,590
How could you keep scoring by yourself?

718
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:31,610
Why are we playing together then? Just play by yourself.

719
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:34,200
Ms. Park. I clearly told you.

720
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:38,410
Competition is ruthless. There's no going easy with the competition.

721
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:41,460
Gosh, you're so annoying, Dad.

722
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:43,330
All right, let's go again.

723
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:45,190
Okay.

724
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:46,150
You're annoying!

725
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:47,230
- Here.
- Get him!

726
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:48,580
Go!

727
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:51,230
Let me go, I tell you!

728
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:57,090
Good job. He scored.

729
01:01:57,090 --> 01:01:59,240
No, no, no. This doesn't count. It was cheating.

730
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,210
- How is this cheating?
- It is.

731
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:06,150
- I just hugged you because I like you.
- It's cheating.

732
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:08,750
- Come on.
- Seriously?

733
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:11,830
Gosh, they're so funny.

734
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:16,110
Their relationship is so persistent.

735
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:18,870
They get together and then break up, then do it all over again.

736
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:21,810
I guess that's what people call fate, right?

737
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:26,810
Madam. Please look at my Dan Dan in a good light.

738
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:31,890
As you've seen, Dan Dan is a really good kid.

739
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:44,700
Madam. Please take good care of Dan Dan.

740
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:50,000
CEO Anna. Stop worrying about Ms. Park.

741
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,920
Just get through the surgery and make a full recovery.

742
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:56,930
I don't have a religion, but for you, CEO Anna,

743
01:02:56,930 --> 01:03:00,180
I will make sure to pray.

744
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:03,660
Thank you.

745
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:04,790
- Over here.
- What are you doing?

746
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:06,290
- I'm going to kick.
- Good!

747
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:08,010
Oh, no!

748
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:12,470
My gosh, look at him.

749
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:14,930
What are you doing?

750
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:17,850
Bring the ball, Lee Se Chan.

751
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,660
What's wrong? What's wrong with you, CEO Anna?

752
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:29,290
CEO Anna!

753
01:03:29,290 --> 01:03:31,060
What's going on?

754
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:32,900
Young Gook!

755
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:34,830
Y-Young Gook.

756
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:37,020
Noona!

757
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:43,000
Are you okay, Noona?

758
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,430
Noona.

759
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:26,410
Noona. Are you sure you don't need to go to the hospital?

760
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:29,480
No.

761
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:32,070
I want to be home.

762
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:34,860
It's more comfortable.

763
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,850
Mom, here's some water.

764
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:44,770
Thank you, Dan Dan.

765
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:49,400
Dan Dan.

766
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:53,240
Dad? What brings you here?

767
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:58,240
Your mom sent this over. It's mung bean porridge.

768
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:02,700
Hello.

769
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:07,020
Why are you here, Chairman?

770
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:12,860
I was invited over to Chairman Lee's house with Dan Dan.

771
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:15,840
Is that so?

772
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:19,960
It's very late, so why don't you get going now?

773
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:29,290
Noona. Call me whenever you need my help, okay?

774
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:32,820
Okay, Young Gook. Thank you.

775
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:46,290
I'll walk outside with Chairman.

776
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:49,730
Where are you going?

777
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:53,890
Dad. Chairman and I are dating again.

778
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:55,320
What?

779
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,760
Anyway, I'll go see him off.

780
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,200
Hey. Dan Dan!

781
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,830
Soo Chul.

782
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:07,870
My gosh.

783
01:06:07,870 --> 01:06:10,590
What is she thinking?

784
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:20,520
Soo Chul. Can't you approve of Dan Dan and Young Gook's relationship?

785
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:24,640
You can't stop them anymore.

786
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:28,320
Do you really mean that?

787
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:33,760
You should be thinking of recovering and taking Dan Dan to America instead.

788
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:39,150
Now that I'm sick like this,

789
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:45,840
I think the best thing is to live happily with the person you love.

790
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:51,200
Soo Chul. Dan Dan and Young Gook truly love each other.

791
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,870
Where else will they find that kind of love?

792
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:59,950
You should trust Dan Dan.

793
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:04,650
Let her find happiness on her own.

794
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:07,300
Please.

795
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:20,550
I'll leave a little later.

796
01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:22,560
Just ten more seconds.

797
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:25,810
10, 9, 20.

798
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:29,140
19... 30.

799
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:57,610
This feels like a dream.

800
01:07:57,610 --> 01:08:05,400
Now that I got to lie down next to you like this,

801
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:10,150
I think I can die...

802
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:13,130
without any regrets.

803
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:17,590
Why do you keep saying stuff like that?

804
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:19,950
I'm sorry.

805
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:23,760
What I mean is...

806
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:30,480
I'm so happy I could die.

807
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:34,470
The fact that I'm with you like this.

808
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:56,730
Dan Dan. I think your dad is opening up more.

809
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:59,210
Just wait a little more.

810
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:01,470
I think so too.

811
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:07,140
He's not yelling at me to break up with the Chairman like before.

812
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:09,540
Right?

813
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:15,700
I told your dad too.

814
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:18,620
I told him to approve of your relationship.

815
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:21,230
Did you?

816
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:23,040
Did you really say so?

817
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,960
Yes.

818
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:32,990
After watching you and Young Gook today,

819
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:37,360
I realized how happy you looked.

820
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:45,320
I don't know why I tried to separate you two all this time.

821
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:48,440
I was so stupid.

822
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:56,300
Thank you so much for finally understanding me.

823
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:08,040
Me, too. Thank you, Dan Dan.

824
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:12,930
Thank you for forgiving me.

825
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:17,480
I'm so happy and thankful.

826
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:21,050
I can't stop crying.

827
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:26,770
Mom.

828
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:39,450
Mom.

829
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:43,280
The surgery will go well.

830
01:10:46,230 --> 01:10:50,050
Then let's make sure we go to Jeju Island together.

831
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:52,070
Okay?

832
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:56,880
All right.

833
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,540
Let's do that.

834
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:07,110
Just the thought of it makes me so happy.

835
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:11,790
My Dan Dan. My daughter.

836
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:36,760
Mom?

837
01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:48,750
Where did she go?

838
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:57,270
How strange.

839
01:11:57,270 --> 01:11:59,320
Where did she go?

840
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:01,800
Did she go to the bathroom--

841
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:27,490
Mom? Are you inside?

842
01:12:27,490 --> 01:12:29,880
Mom?

843
01:12:58,450 --> 01:13:00,650
Mom! Mom!

844
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:02,470
Mom! Mom!

845
01:13:02,470 --> 01:13:04,190
Wake up, Mom!

846
01:13:04,190 --> 01:13:06,040
Mom! Mom!

847
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:08,020
Please wake up! Mom!

848
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:09,740
Wake up, Mom!

849
01:13:09,740 --> 01:13:12,450
Mom! Mom!

850
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:14,140
Wake up!

851
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:16,660
Mom! Oh, my gosh.

852
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:17,870
What do I do? Mom!

853
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:19,850
Please wake up.

854
01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:23,760
Mom! Please... Mom!

855
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:27,350
Wake up, Mom!

856
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:30,520
What do I do?

857
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:38,220
♫ Why do you run away, love like a shy child ♫

858
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:44,720
♫ In case I lose it, I hold it tight ♫

859
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:52,020
♫ But love always runs away, chased by longing ♫

860
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:58,820
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

861
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:07,650
♫ I have to abandon the longing and the grieves ♫

862
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:10,770
[Young Lady and Gentleman]

863
01:14:10,770 --> 01:14:14,510
I will allow Dan Dan to marry you, Chairman.

864
01:14:14,510 --> 01:14:18,050
I finally got approval to marry Ms. Park from her father.

865
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:19,890
How are you going to propose to Ms. Park?

866
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:25,360
I already bought the ring, but I've been deliberating very seriously about how to propose.

867
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,260
What? What's going on?

868
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:30,950
Why isn't he taking the ring out? He must want to propose at a quiet place.

869
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:32,310
What did you say, Oppa?

870
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:33,960
Like I said, your share is left untouched.

871
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:36,230
Se Ryun's share has been untouched?

872
01:14:36,230 --> 01:14:42,560
I'm not going to return to Korea again. I think this is the best I can do for everyone.

873
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,050
What's up with Chairman?

874
01:14:44,050 --> 01:14:47,580
Is he thinking of skipping the proposal?

875
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:49,870
I'm not going to marry you, Chairman!

876
01:14:49,870 --> 01:14:53,140
Ms. Park! What? She's not going to marry me?

877
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:54,300
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫
