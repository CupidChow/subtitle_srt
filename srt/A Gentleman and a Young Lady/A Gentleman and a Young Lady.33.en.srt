[Episode 33]

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:08,940
Dad! I heard my birth mother is still alive.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,610
Then why did you lie to me that she was dead? Why?

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,020
What?

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,630
Dan Dan, what are you saying now?

6
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,890
Your mother is dead. Who says that?

7
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,260
I met our old neighbor Ajumma.

8
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,520
She told me that.

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,140
That my mother came looking for me when I was 5 years old.

10
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,680
She said she saw my mom!

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,800
- What?
- How can you do this to me?

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,920
You split up with my mom by cheating with my step-mom.

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,860
How can you not let me see my mom as well?

14
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,020
Dan Dan, calm down. And listen to me.

15
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:05,460
No. Just tell me if my mom is alive or dead.

16
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,200
Is my mom alive? Is that right?

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,560
No. That lady got something wrong.

18
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,480
Your mother is a dead person. Think that she is dead.

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,130
What?

20
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:27,060
Did you just say I should think that she is dead?

21
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:34,620
How can I think my mom is dead when she is alive?

22
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:42,760
Dad. How can you separate me from my mom like this? Do you hate her that much?

23
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,720
Yes! I hate her! So just think she's dead.

24
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,730
No, that woman is dead!

25
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,600
No matter how much you hate my birth mother,

26
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,630
how can you say that she is dead when she's not?

27
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,530
I will never forgive you, Dad.

28
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:18,960
I cannot forgive you until death. I'll never see you again. I am not your daughter anymore!

29
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,370
Dan Dan. Dan Dan!

30
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:26,180
How can you say that to your dad?

31
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,550
What is all this?

32
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:35,310
How did that old neighbor woman meet Dan Dan?

33
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:41,650
Honey. Shall I see Dan Dan and tell her everything?

34
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,660
Please stay out of this.

35
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,910
I should meet that Ajumeoni again.

36
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,100
That way, I will know what happened to my mom.

37
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,030
But where is she?

38
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:13,340
Dan Dan. Dan Dan!

39
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,070
Dan Dan!

40
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,470
The woman who lived here 15 years ago?

41
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,130
Yes. That Ajumeoni.

42
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,370
Can I get her contact information?

43
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,280
Well...

44
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,830
When I came here 6 years ago, the owner was a grandmother. Is it her?

45
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,720
She's not an old lady but a middle-aged woman.

46
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,840
I don't know then.

47
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:51,000
Then, can I get that grandmother's contact information?

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,790
I have to meet that Ajumeoni from 15 years ago.

49
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,530
It's to search for my mom.

50
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,350
Alright. I will look for her and let you know.

51
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,240
Don't worry too much.

52
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,070
Thank you. Thank you so much!

53
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,680
Please help me. Please.

54
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,020
Okay, okay.

55
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,530
Thank you!

56
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,370
I should have asked for that Ajumeoni's phone number.

57
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,320
What do I do now?

58
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,690
How do I search for my mother?

59
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,980
Driver Park. What brings you here?

60
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,300
Hello.

61
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,570
Actually, I couldn't contact Dan Dan.

62
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,300
Is she inside?

63
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,290
No. Ms. Park is not home right now.

64
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,010
Is she not home?

65
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,980
No. She asked me to look after the kids as she has some sudden issue.

66
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,560
I was wondering what's going on as well.

67
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,560
Did something happen to her?

68
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,230
No, it's nothing.

69
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,560
Ajumeoni, I am sorry,

70
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,780
but can you ask her to call me once she's back? Please.

71
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,690
Yes. I will.

72
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,540
Then, goodbye.

73
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,670
Chairman. Welcome home.

74
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,080
Yes.

75
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,120
But isn't that person Driver Park?

76
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,070
Yes. It is him.

77
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,950
Ms. Park stepped out for some important work.

78
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,040
Driver Park came as he couldn't contact her.

79
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,720
I think something happened to Ms. Park.

80
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,440
Looking at Driver Park's face, it seems like big trouble.

81
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,760
Big trouble?

82
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,460
Yes! I hate her! So just think she's dead.

83
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,650
No, that woman is dead.

84
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,640
Why does he hate my mom so much?

85
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:29,130
Even so, how can he say she's dead when she's not?

86
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:34,690
I will find her, at least now.

87
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,250
No matter what.

88
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,710
Oh my, Dan Dan!

89
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,700
Why are you not picking up your father's calls? Do you know how worried he was?

90
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,370
Aigo... My Dan Dan's hands are frozen.

91
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,390
I guess you wandered around a lot.

92
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:58,790
Where is my dad? I have to say something to him.

93
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,670
Honey! Dan Dan is here.

94
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,960
Dan Dan.

95
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,710
Where were you?

96
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,140
Dad. I have to tell you something.

97
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,430
Yes, yes. Sit down first.

98
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,660
You should tell him if you have something to say to him.

99
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:33,250
Mom and Dad, thank you for raising me well until now.

100
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,990
And you both love each other.

101
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,050
People who love each other should live together.

102
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,320
I understand you both now.

103
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,120
When I was young, I rudely said that you two had an affair and abandoned my birth mom.

104
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,720
I'm sorry about saying it thoughtlessly.

105
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,350
I apologize.

106
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:05,230
I will not say anything to you both anymore,

107
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:12,100
so please tell me my birth mom's name.

108
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,660
I want to find my mother, at least now. I beg of you.

109
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,990
What?

110
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:23,420
Dad, tell me everything you know about my mom.

111
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,620
How old is she? Where is her hometown?

112
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,310
Which school did she go to?

113
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,650
If you don't know her resident number, just...

114
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:38,190
just tell me her age. I will not resent you two anymore.

115
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:42,310
I will be grateful to you for the rest of my life.

116
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:47,820
The neighbor Ajumma told me that my mom had gone to the US. Is that true?

117
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,260
Do you know where in the US?

118
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,060
Dan Dan, why are you acting like this?

119
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,150
Mom, Grandmother, please tell me.

120
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,480
Please.

121
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:06,710
Dan Dan, your mother is dead.

122
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,620
That Ajumma is wrong.

123
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,790
She told you the wrong thing.

124
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:17,430
That Ajumma told me that my mom came to see me when I was five years old!

125
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:22,710
Then why are you lying to me!

126
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,780
I said she's dead!

127
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,320
Why don't you believe your dad but trust a stranger's words?

128
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,250
That woman is dead!

129
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,740
Okay. I get it.

130
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,850
Please tell me my mom's name, at least.

131
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,280
Tell me her age, at least.

132
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,090
I don't know anything about her. I erased everything.

133
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,160
Dad.

134
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,570
Why are you acting like this?

135
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:59,050
If my mother is dead, why don't you tell me her name?

136
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:04,440
Is she a criminal? Is she in prison?

137
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,580
Dad, even if my mom is in prison,

138
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,690
I want to see her face.

139
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:16,270
I want to see how she looks, even if it's her shadow! So, please, Dad!

140
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,300
She is a dead woman!

141
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,720
So don't talk about her anymore.

142
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,700
Will you not tell me even if we cut our ties?

143
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:31,180
If you don't tell me about my mom, I will cut ties with you.

144
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,680
What?

145
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,570
Still? Will you not tell me?

146
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,220
Sure! Let's cut ties.

147
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,790
Even if that happens, I will never tell you!

148
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,130
Okay! I get it!

149
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:51,470
I'm not your daughter anymore from today!

150
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,260
Aigoo...

151
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,340
What is all this?

152
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,210
I cannot forgive him. I will not forgive him.

153
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:05,190
I will not see him ever again.

154
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:12,790
But how do I find my mom now? My mom...

155
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,880
You grew up just like your mom.

156
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,210
Do you see your biological mother often?

157
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:22,230
- My birth mom?
- Yes. She came to see you once.

158
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,300
Didn't you see her after that?

159
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,870
Well, she went to America, so she can't come often.

160
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,660
America...

161
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,660
That's right. She told me my mom is in the US.

162
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,880
CEO. CEO Anna.

163
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,550
Ms. Park, why are you here at this time?

164
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,850

170
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:34,160
Oh... I just fell down and hurt myself.

171
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,170
It's healed now.

172
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,680
Oh, okay...

173
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,630
But, what is the matter?

174
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,940
I told you I would not be in Seoul for a while.

175
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,480
Why did you come without notice? You could've missed me.

176
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,150
CEO.

177
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,720
I'm sorry for coming this late at night.

178
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:03,340
But you are the only person I have.

179
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,260
Actually...

180
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:11,080
I heard that my mother is alive.

181
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,370
What?

182
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:17,600
Until now, I thought my birth mother was dead.

183
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,630
But, she is in the US. I want to search for her from now on.

184
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,150
But I don't know anyone in the US.

185
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:28,700
With the feeling of clutching at a straw, I came to see you.

186
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:33,810
I heard we can search through the Korean Association.

Who lived in Sanggye-dong.

189
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,180
June 30th is her daughter's birthday.

190
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:49,820
Would it be hard to find her with these?

191
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:56,550
Well, I don't know what you're saying suddenly.

192
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,270
I don't think we can find her with that.

193
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:07,920
My dad won't even tell me my mom's name or not even a thing.

194
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,250
He had an affair with my step-mom, and he abandoned my birth mother.

195
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,690
And he lied to me that my birth mom was dead.

196
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:23,050
I don't understand him and cannot forgive him also.

197
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:28,220
I will cut my ties with my dad. I hate him.

198
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:32,950

199
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:38,050
Ms. Park, I am sorry. I don't know anyone from the Korean Association.

200
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:43,330
I don't think I can help you with these things. Then excuse me, I have work.

How am I going to find my mom?

204
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,090
What is all this?

205
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:19,620
Why is she resenting her dad when I'm the one who abandoned her?

206
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,940
Dan Dan, that's not right...

What will you do finding this bad mom?

Soo Chul, can you see me for a moment?

00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,310
Dan Dan came looking for me.

212
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:33,330
She wants to search for her mom in the US.

213
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,380
What?

214
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,350
What did you say to her?

215
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,570
I didn't tell her anything.

216
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,990
To me...

217
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:52,890
She told me her mom is alive in the US.

218
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:57,900
And she asked me to look for her mom through Korean Association.

219
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,570
But I rejected her, saying I couldn't do that.

220
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,320
Nobody knows that I am Kim Ji Young.

221
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,920
Nobody other than Chairman Lee knows that.

222
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,900
Dan Dan will never find me.

223
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:23,020
So, don't worry, Soo Chul.

224
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:28,100
At least now, tell her the truth.

225
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,750
It's me who abandoned her.

226
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,870
I'm the one who committed the sin.

227
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:38,400
But why are you being resented by Dan Dan?

228
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,890
I am the one who did wrong. But why do you have to be hated by her?

229
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,090
You did nothing wrong.

230
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,720
So, tell everything to Dan Dan. Everything.

231
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,390
That way, she won't look for this bad mom.

232
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:07,160
Are you saying I should tell Dan Dan that her mom abandoned her?

233
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:13,890
Do you still not know why I didn't tell her that?

234
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:20,110
Do you want to see her heart bleed?

235
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:26,030
Now, do you understand what you have done?

236
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:29,470
I did wrong...

237

I was wrong. I made a mistake.

329
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,600
What is it?

330
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,960
Everything that I planned to do in Korea,

331
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,220
I know I have to wrap it up well until the end.

332
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,090
Young Gook, what should I do?

333
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:04,760
I am sorry, but I have to go back to the US.

334
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,410
As soon as possible, within this week.

335
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:14,000
I've got an urgent business in the US.

336
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,950
What are you saying?

337
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,900
Then what about the fashion show?

338
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:26,370
Can't we cancel that?

339
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:31,320
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

340
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:37,960
If so, the risk is high not just for you but also for us.

341
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,820
What is going on?

342
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,570
Why are you doing this?

343
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:48,220
It's something that I can't tell you right now.

344
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,920
Noona.

345
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,620
Then, I will try to finish the other tasks somehow.

346
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:02,170
I hope you wrap up the fashion show and leave.

347
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,670
I do want to leave fast as tomorrow,

348
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:15,300
but then many people will have trouble because of me.

349
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:19,570
As soon as I finish the work in Korea, I'll quietly disappear.

350
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:22,730
There's no more reason for me to see Dan Dan.

351
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:27,140
And I won't disturb you anymore as well.

352
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:54,630
Why doesn't my dad tells me about my mom when she's alive?

353
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:02,020
Why doesn't he tell me? Why?

354
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,120
Hello?

355
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,000
You had come here before.

356
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,650
I am the Sanggye-dong Ajumma.

357
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,730
Yes. Hello.

358
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:25,530
I found out the phone number of the owner from 15 years ago.

359
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,080
Do you want to know?

360
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,850
Yes. Yes, please.

361
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:42,640
Wha-what are you saying?

362
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,450
My mom abandoned me and ran away?

363
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:54,860
I heard that my dad and my step-mom had an affair, and they kicked out my mom.

364
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,260
That's what I heard from Ajummas in the old neighborhood.

365
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:01,240
What? Who told you that?

366
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,030
That's not it, Dan Dan.

367
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:05,340
You knew everything wrong.

368
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,240
How can you get everything wrong?

369
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,360
Is your dad a person who'll have an affair?

370
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,260
I could tell that your birth mother was not an ordinary woman.

371
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,180
She had big dreams and ambitions.

372
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,850
She was not someone who'd live as a housewife and raise the child.

373
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:24,700
That's why she abandoned her child and her husband and ran away.

374
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:36,160
Is that true?

375
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,970
That's right.

376
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,690
Do you know how pitiful your dad was?

377
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:43,470
He had begged for mother's milk to feed you.

378
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:46,800
He had to work to support you,

379
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,820
but he has no family.

380
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,500
He had no one to babysit you.

381
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,660
He almost died at a construction job, with you on his back.

382
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:58,120
His living condition was almost sub-human.

383
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,410
He had to work day and night.

384
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:02,530
And look after you.

385
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:06,950
He didn't get one proper meal.

386
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:11,630
I get teary thinking of that time.

387
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:16,750
Are you saying my dad wasn't having an affair,

388
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:24,070
but my birth mom... abandoned me?

389
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,440
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

390
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,870
When your birth mother ran away, abandoning you,

391
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:35,350
your dad was crying with you in his arms and tried very hard to stop her.

392
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:38,240
But your mom didn't even look back and left.

393
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,010
Ruthless beyond anything I've ever seen.

394
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:47,310
Why would you want to find a mother like that?

395
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:53,490
How could that be?

396
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:56,340
Dan Dan, are you okay?

397
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:00,570
Ajumma, I'm sorry.

398
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:05,450
Excuse me, first.

399
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:08,120
Dan Dan!

400
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:38,720
How could she abandon her child?

401
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:47,530
It's not easy for me to leave even because of Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong.

402
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:53,670
But how could she, the birth mother,

403
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:58,300
abandon a child she gave birth to and run away?

404
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:02,350
How? How?

405
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,940
What? Who did you say?

406
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:22,640
Aren't you the neighbor from Sanggye-dong?

407
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,550
- Yes.
- Is that the Sanggye-dong lady?

408
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:26,270
The Ajumma who Dan Dan met?

409
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,850
What? Is it the neighbor lady calling?

410
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:30,040
She's calling about Dan Dan.

411
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,800
I will take the call.

412
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,670
What?

413
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:37,030
Yes, this is Dan Dan's father.

414
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:39,080
Dan Dan's father,

415
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,040
I'm calling because something was strange.

416
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,810
Dan Dan came to see me.

417
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:47,470
Asking me all kinds of questions, so I told her.

418
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:51,120
But I feel bad since she left crying.

419
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,320
That's why I'm calling you.

420
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,180
Did you meet up with Dan Dan?

421
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,230
What did you two talk about?

422
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:02,570
Dan Dan mistakenly believed that you had an affair and kicked out her birth mom.

423
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,050
But that's not true.

424
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,140
I told her all the truth.

425
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,390
That Dan Dan's mother abandoned you.

426
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:13,070
Did you tell her all that?

427
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,010
How can you do that?

428
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,630
Please go see Dan Dan.

429
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:19,390
She seemed very shocked.

430
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,460
Okay.

431
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,990
I will hang up now.

432
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:26,390
Oh, dear.

433
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,900
Dan Dan, where are you now?

434
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,340
Tell me where you are now.

435
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:44,100
Do you know how pitiful your father was?

436
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,130
He had begged for mother's milk to feed you.

437
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:50,170
He had to work to support you.

438
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:53,780
But he has no family. He had no one to babysit you.

439
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:58,020
He almost died at a construction job, with you on his back.

440
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:02,220
His condition at the time was sub-human.

441
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:06,110
Dad.

442
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:09,100
Dan Dan.

443
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,300
Dad.

444
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:17,400
Dad, why didn't you tell me all this time?

445
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,650
That my mom abandoned me.

446
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,360
Why didn't you tell me?

447
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,840
I had been resenting you so much all this time.

448
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,700
I hated my step-mom, who raised me.

449
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:35,040
I would not have thought about that bad mom if you had told me.

450
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,400
Why did you let me long for such a horrible mother?

451
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,670
Dan Dan, I'm sorry.

452
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:48,290
I'm sorry.

453
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:51,430
It's all my fault.

454
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:55,540
No, it isn't. I'm sorry, I've done wrong.

455
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,210
I'm sorry, Dad.

456
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:02,090
My Dan Dan...

457
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:06,150
As long as you're okay,

458
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:10,140
I'm okay with everything.

459
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:15,570
From now on, I'll really think that my mom is dead.

460
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,960
She's dead.

461
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:24,980
I will not hurt your feelings anymore.

462
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:31,330
Dan Dan. I'm sorry, my daughter...

463
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:34,790
I'm sorry.

464
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,240
Ms. Park.

465
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,860
What's going on? Did something happen?

466
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:02,160
Chairman, have you already looked into finding my mom?

467
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,760
Yes, I have. Of course.

468
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,500
Chairman, I'm so sorry.

469
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,420
But please drop the search.

470
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:19,680
I don't want to look for her anymore.

471
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,940
Why?

472
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:35,100
I found out that my mom abandoned me and ran away when I wasn't even a hundred days old.

473
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:43,600
For me, even Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong make me hard to leave.

474
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:52,400
I don't know how she could abandon her own baby.

475
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,050
Can you understand that?

476
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,940
Ms. Park.

477
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:03,740
I don't want to find the woman who abandoned me.

478
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:09,800
So please stop searching for my mom.

479
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,350
I have to pick up Se Jong now.

480
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:17,840
So I'll get going first. I'm sorry.

481
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,420
[Fantom]

482
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,540
Hello.

483
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,440
Hello. So Mi is here now.

484
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,460
So get ready quickly, young lady-in-law.

485
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,880
We have to go to an event.

486
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,160
Am I going, too? Where?

487
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,870
The Headquarters is hosting a One Point lesson.

488
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:51,320
Once you see it, it will help you with your work here.

489
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,360
Get ready to go.

490
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,160
- Yes, I will.
- Okay.

491
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:00,700
Mom.

492
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,080
Are you going somewhere?

493
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,170
Why are you here again?

494
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:08,310
Why do you come here so often, lately?

495
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:11,950
What do you mean? I came here because I miss you.

496
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,660
I don't miss you.

497
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:17,070
I have work to do, so you go on home.

498
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:19,290
Where are you going?

499
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:23,180
There's an event at the Headquarters, so I'm going there with the young lady-in-law.

500
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,220
Really?

501
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,320
I want to go, too.

502
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,430
Why?

503
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:32,710
I have to experience everything while on a break.

504
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,610
There is no need.

505
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,500
Please go.

506
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,490
- Did you watch it closely?
- Yes.

507
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:52,700
I'm looking for someone who could model the posture we just learned.

508
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,360
I'll do it!

509
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,120
Okay.

510
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:00,100
Let's do it together, Ms. Mi Rim.

511
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,890
Yes, it will be good for you to do it together.

512
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,040
- I'll do it, too.
- Okay, great.

513
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,160
This is the best part of our event today.

514
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,140
I'd like to invite Pro Im Jae Deok to the floor.

515
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,840
Hello!

516
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,130
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

517
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:25,540
The two of you who just raised your hands, please get changed and come out.

518
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,500
Please come forward.

519
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,010
And try hitting a ball.

520
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,690
Try it from right here.

521
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,240
You saw the demonstration, right?

522
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,180
Yes.

523
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,750
Your arms should be like this.

524
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:39,920
Yes, like that. Very good.

525
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,050
Your pose is very good right now.

526
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:48,580
Good shot!

527
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,540
Very good. You did it very well.

528
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,260
That was a good shot.

529
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,850
A golf swing has to be fluid.

530
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,660
You have to do a lot of stretches.

531
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:05,500
The golf clothing should be comfortable when you are swinging.

532
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,250
That's very important as well.

533
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,590
- I think you will do well.
- Thank you.

534
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:13,140
You did it so well.

535
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,830
The lady should try it also.

536
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:18,470
- Right, please come forward.
- Okay.

537
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,730
That's right.

538
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:28,900
You were very good.

539
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,710
You two look very good together.

540
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:35,010
They look like a couple.

541
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:37,260
- They look like a perfect couple.
- Wait, wait.

542
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,390
They are not a couple.

543
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:41,620
They're not, Pro Im.

544
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,120
They are in-laws. In-laws.

545
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,800
In-laws? But they look very good together.

546
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,210
I thought they were a couple.

547
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:50,480
No, they are in-laws.

548
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,210
What do you mean by a couple?

549
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:56,440
No way.

550
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:04,610
Aren't you Ms. Kim from the Secretary's office, a long time ago?

551
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:07,250
How have you been, Madam?

552
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,510
It's been a long time!

553
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:12,530
What brings you to our house?

554
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,980
The Chairman sent her here to replace Chief Jo.

555
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:20,520
Are you here to be our butler?

556
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,900
No, no. You are married with two kids now.

557
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:29,250
- Mrs...?
- Please call me Chief Kim.

558
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,580
Ah, Chief Kim.

559
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,930
The children and Ms. Park are here too.

560
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:36,130
- Yes, yes.
- Children and Ms. Park.

561
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:40,540
This is Chief Kim Sook, taking Chief Jo's place.

562
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:43,590
Hello. I'm Park Dan Dan.

563
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,130
I'm Chief Kim.

564
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:51,250
Then are you in charge of my allowances from now on, Chief Kim?

565
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:55,090
No, I'm not. The Chairman will make all the decisions regarding the household.

566
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:58,610
I'm simply a helper following his orders.

567
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:02,380
I understand. Please take good care of our household.

568
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,530
Yes, Mr. Lee Se Chan.

569
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:07,070
Please call me Se Chan.

570
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:10,830
Please call me Se Jong too.

571
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:14,350
Please take good care of us.

572
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:20,640
Noona, what do you think of Chief Kim?

573
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:27,910
Hyung, I think she'll be scarier than Chief Jo.

574
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:30,170
What do you think?

575
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:34,470
At least, she won't be getting engaged to our father.

576
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:35,700
Jeez!

577
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,830
No matter, I like Chief Kim.

578
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:40,130
- Why?
- Why?

579
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:43,810
She said our dad is the one who makes all the household decisions,

580
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:48,250
and she's just a helper who follows his orders.

581
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,950
She won't do as she please like Chief Jo did.

582
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:54,800
That's why.

583
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,350
Okay.

584
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:58,790
I like it.

585
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:05,230
Since Chief Jo left,

586
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:07,440
I couldn't ask the young Secretary Yoon

587
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,010
to do this and that all the time.

588
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:14,180
It's been so hard for me.

589
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,480
Now that Chief Kim is here,

590
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,940
I feel like I can live again.

591
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:21,660
Thank you for coming. Welcome.

592
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,410
Thank you for welcoming me like this.

593
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:28,900
Right. Let's be close and get along well.

594
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,470
I will do my best to support you.

595
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:33,630
Really?

596
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:39,680
Speaking of which, can you transfer 5 million won to my bank account immediately?

597
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,380
Pardon?

598
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,520
According to the documents I've been given,

599
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:51,020
your allowance of 10 million won for this month was deposited the day before yesterday.

600
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,670
That's the official allowance.

601
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:58,800
But isn't there an allowance you can give to me with your senses and ability?

602
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:04,010
If I say it bluntly, isn't that the point of you being here?

603
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:09,140
It sounds like you want me to have a word with the Chairman about your allowance.

604
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,960
Yes, I understand.

605
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,320
I will make a report to the Chairman sensibly.

606
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,340
And get approval.

607
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,450
No, no, Chief Kim.

608
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:22,050
What report are you talking about?

609
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,470
Deceased wife of Chairman did, and Chief Jo, too.

610
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:27,780
They gave me some more money without Chairman Lee knowing.

611
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,690
That's what I'm asking you to do.

612
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:35,140
It's a tradition that's gone on all along.

613
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,270
What you are saying now is

614
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:40,620
that I should siphon off the funds?

615
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:44,530
Siphon off?

616
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:47,250
- How can you say that?
- I can't do that.

617
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:50,570
I can't siphon off even a penny.

618
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:56,660
Instead, if you want more allowance, I will sensibly report your wish to the Chairman.

619
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:02,400
No, that's okay. You can leave now.

620
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,220
Yes. I will go now.

621
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:17,210
She was a rigid person before,

622
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:22,290
but now she's even worse!

623
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:24,120
Is Chairman Lee crazy?

624
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:30,470
How can he bring someone that closed off as our butler?

625
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:36,460
My only hope is for Seung Ho from Jinsa Group and Se Ryun to get married.

626
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,380
Yes, that's it.

627
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,540
That's it.

628
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,580
Se Ryun.

629
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:49,380
Mom. What are you doing here?

630
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,510
I have a plan, so I'm about to leave.

631
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:53,800
Please sit down. I need to talk to you.

632
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,810
What is it? Get to the point.

633
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:00,700
What do you think of Seung Ho?

634
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:03,160
I really like Seung Ho.

635
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,300
I think he's charming and refined the more I see him.

636
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,570
Mom. He's just a friend.

637
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:12,690
Aren't you guys first love to each other?

638
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:15,400
You said you liked each other when you were studying in New York.

639
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,540
But how could you still be just friends?

640
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:20,980
Mom, that time and now is different.

641
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:23,180
I have no feelings for Seung Ho now.

642
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,430
If you are going to talk about this, please stop.

643
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:28,980
I have to wash up and get ready. Please go home.

644
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:32,450
Hey, Se Ryun!

645
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,610
Oh, that girl.

646
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:37,510
I thought they were seeing each other again.

647
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:40,830
But why is there no spark yet?

648
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:45,900
This is all because that gigolo is in the middle of it, isn't it?

649
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,960
Seriously, it's upsetting.

650
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,250
Who's that?

651
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:51,140
Who is it?

652
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,130
Se Ryun, I'm here.

653
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:54,890
Oh!

654
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:57,180
You little bastard. Hey!

655
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:00,510
How dare you freely come in here using the passcode?

656
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,200
How are you?

657
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,180
I'm not doing well because of you.

658
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:08,520
Until when are you going to be stuck to my Se Ryun?

659
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:11,850
For how long are you going to be holding on to my Se Ryun's ankles?

660
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:14,300
Se Ryun and I love each other.

661
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:18,110
Please wait a little longer. My father and I opened a chicken restaurant.

662
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:20,750
We will work hard and succeed.

663
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:23,430
I will show you a good result.

664
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:25,380
Love, my foot.

665
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:29,140
I don't care if you succeed or not.

666
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:32,780
Just get out. Now!

667
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:37,130
We don't need stuff like this.

668
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:40,690
Take this back with you!

669
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:52,060
Seriously...

670
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:59,120
Mom. What are you doing?

671
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,750
Dae Beom. When did you come?

672
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:04,390
Se Ryun. Your mother is here.

673
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:06,440
I will go first.

674
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,380
Dae Beom!

675
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:11,320
- Wait, Dae Beom!
- Hey!

676
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,700
Seriously, that gigolo.

677
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,860
Dae Beom.

678
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:19,750
Dae Beom.

679
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:22,950
Dae Beom.

680
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:25,410
Se Ryun, I'm okay. Please go inside.

681
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:29,690
Your mother is waiting for you.

682
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:32,490
Dae Beom.

683
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,610
What should we do?

684
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:44,080
It's so hard for us.

685
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:07,190
You seem like a very nice person.

686
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,050
You are a nice person too.

687
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,240
I mean it.

688
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:19,340
Chief Jo. Why don't you start over with me?

689
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:26,470
I will heal you and fill the hole in your heart.

690
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:09,020
Ajussi, like what you said...

691
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:13,070
Shall we date each other?

692
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:20,960
What are you... saying right now?

693
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,540
Is a woman like me okay for you?

694
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:27,690
You've seen the bottom of me.

695
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:31,320
Even after that, if you're okay with me,

696
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,520
I would like to date you.

697
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:40,190
I have no house or a car.

698
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:43,080
I don't have that much money as well.

699
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:48,090
Would that be okay still?

700
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:51,690
You told me I'm a good person when I'm not.

701
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:55,850
That's enough. I don't need any other things.

702
00:51:55,850 --> 00:52:00,330
Your feeling toward me is genuine.

703
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,960
Okay then.

704
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:12,080
Then let's officially be in a relationship from this very moment.

705
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,620
This is our first day. What should we do first?

706
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:27,450
What would you like to do?

707
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:30,510
No. Let's go eat first.

708
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:33,370
I know a great place nearby.

709
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:35,570
Let's go.

710
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,970
I heard that place is really good.

711
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:45,080
Is that so?

712
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:53,830
What should we do? The line is long.

713
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:57,080
I'm sorry. Let's go somewhere else.

714
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:03,920
No. It must be a good spot. Let's give it a try.

715
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,720
It's too bad to pass since we are already here.

716
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,740
Really?

717
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:12,750
I worry you will be cold, Sarah.

718
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:17,440
It's okay. It's fun waiting together like this.

719
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:23,360
I'll warm you up.

720
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:40,340
Oh, my!

721
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:42,240
Chairman.

722
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,660
I've only been looking at your all this time, no one else.

723
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:48,360
I'm being sincere, please.

724
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:52,150
Please, can't you look at me just once?

725
00:53:53,980 --> 00:54:01,230
♫ Even if I get a little bit closer, you go farther ♫

726
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:07,850
♫ My love, my dream ♫

727
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:13,520
Sarah, what's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

728
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:17,570
No, it's not that.

729
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:22,250
It's because I'm so grateful to you and moved.

730
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:25,570
You hold my hand so warmly.

731
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:28,760
This is nothing.

732
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:39,530
From now on, I will protect you from the wind.

733
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:43,250
So, be strong.

734
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,030
It's cold.

735
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:52,250
♫ Like a light in the darkness, My love ♫

736
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:57,470
- Aren't you cold?
- I am okay.

737
00:54:57,470 --> 00:54:59,890
Wait a minute, Sarah.

738
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:03,980
- Why?
- Welcome.

739
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:07,620
♫ It feels like a ray of light in the darkness ♫

740
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,940
♫ My love ♫

741
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:15,850
♫ My beautiful time waiting for you ♫

742
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:21,110
♫ I miss you at that time ♫

743
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:23,310
It's pretty on you.

744
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:25,130
- Is it warm?
- Yes.

745
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:26,890
Very very warm.

746
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:29,230
Take a look in the mirror.

747
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:37,270
Yes, I love it very much. It's pretty.

748
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,620
- How much is it?
- It's 20,000 won.

749
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:43,480
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

750
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,140
You look cute like a snowman. Let's go.

751
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:54,210
I had so much fun today.

752
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:59,450
We ate, drank coffee, and walked together.

753
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:04,510
And thank you for this gift too.

754
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:07,710
That cost 20,000 won altogether. Do you like it that much?

755
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:11,000
Yes, because you bought them for me.

756
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,730
I like it better than any of those luxury brands.

757
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:19,620
I'm more grateful to hear you say it like that.

758
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:22,550
Let's have an even better time together next time.

759
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:26,630
And the next and the one after that as well.

760
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:29,770
Yes. Let's do that.

761
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:36,710
Please go in. Sleep well with sweet dreams.

762
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:40,400
You, too. Bye!

763
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,420
- Jo Sarah.
- Mom!

764
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:04,620
Isn't he Driver Cha from Chairman's house?

765
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:06,960
What are you doing holding hands with him?

766
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,730
Are you crazy?

767
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:12,120
Hey, Jo Sarah.

768
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:15,830
Hey, you. When you stayed out the other night,

769
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:18,680
were you with that guy?

770
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:22,160
Is it for real? Are you crazy, Jo Sarah?

771
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,610
- How can you be with that kind of a guy?
- Mom!

772
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:27,870
Don't call my Teddy bear Ajussi like that.

773
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:29,880
What?

774
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,050
Even if you lost your mind,

775
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:39,550
how can you date a driver who works for Chairman Lee?

776
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:42,720
Is this why your engagement got called off?

777
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,410
Did you get caught seeing him?

778
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:49,090
Mom! There is no need to talk about the past.

779
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:53,290
Also, please don't pay attention to who I'm dating!

780
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:55,290
How can I not pay attention?

781
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:59,190
You were the FT Group Chairman Lee's fiancée!

782
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:01,050
But how can you go out with that jerk?

783
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:03,840
Mom. I beg you.

784
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:07,400
Please don't speak like that about my Teddy bear Ajussi.

785
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:12,350
Mom. It's someone I like. He's a really good man.

786
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:15,520
What did you say? A good man?

787
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,990
My goodness. What? A really good man?

788
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:21,580
She's gone crazy.

789
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:25,310
She's a goner. What do I do?

790
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:41,200
I found out that my mom abandoned me and ran away when I wasn't even a hundred days old.

791
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:48,680
For me, even Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong make me hard to leave.

792
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:56,150
I don't know how she could abandon her own baby.

793
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:01,100
I don't want to find the woman who abandoned me.

794
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:07,140
So please stop searching for my mom.

795
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,160
Ms. Park, where are you now?

796
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:22,260
Can we meet?

797
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,690
Ms. Park. Steaks are good here.

798
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:33,170
Please try some.

799
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:35,620
I can do it myself.

800
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:38,570
Who cares who cuts it? You just have to enjoy it.

801
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:40,540
Please, go ahead.

802
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:43,340
Thank you.

803
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:50,470
But Chairman. Why are you buying me things like this, suddenly?

804
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:57,100
You seem to be going through a hard time.

805
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,820
So I wanted to cheer you up with this food.

806
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:01,940
As someone who lives in the same house,

807
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:06,660
I can't ignore it when you're having a hard time.

808
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:13,300
So please eat this, and be the strong Ms. Park that you are.

809
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:24,460
Chairman, I'm sorry to show you that I am depressed due to a personal matter.

810
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:27,640
As you said, I will eat this

811
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:32,080
and show you my strong side starting tomorrow.

812
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:41,510
It's really delicious. Please eat, too.

813
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:43,700
Okay.

814
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:04,600
Chairman, where are we going now?

815
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:08,120
Our house is in the opposite direction.

816
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,720
Since we are out here,

817
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,720
why don't we go for some beer?

818
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,260
There is a great craft beer pub nearby.

819
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:17,730
Let's drink a glass of beer and become strong!

820
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:22,440
The steak you bought for me is more than enough.

821
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,330
I am really okay now.

822
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:28,430
I know you like beer.

823
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:30,450
I'm craving a nice cold beer myself.

824
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:33,500
It's right in front over there. Let's go.

825
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:47,440
What do you think? Isn't it good?

826
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,950
Yes, it's very smooth and delicious.

827
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:53,370
See? Aren't you glad you came?

828
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:04,160
Okay, we're about to throw a special event for the 5th anniversary of the store!

829
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:08,130
Hello, everyone. Thank you for coming to our store today.

830
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:12,830
The special event to mark the 5th anniversary of the store opening is

831
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:17,500
a contest of drinking 1000cc of our beer!

832
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:25,650
I'll show you the prize for the winner tonight.

833
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:30,820
The one who gets the first place will get this cute teddy bear

834
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:35,800
and 5 coupons for free beers!

835
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:48,750
From now on, please come to the front who wants to participate in the beer-drinking contest!

836

That teddy bear is so cute.

841
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:08,710
Ms. Park. Do you like that teddy bear?

842
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:10,920
Do you want it?

843
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,610
Yes, I do, but...

844
01:03:13,610 --> 01:03:16,990
Ms. Park. I will win that teddy bear for you.

845
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:19,730
No, it's okay. I was just saying.

846
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:23,600
Up until this gentleman! No more participation!

847
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,980
That's it!

848
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:32,600
When I say "fighting," you can start to drink. Please give us a round of applause!

849
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,630
The gentleman over there is too excited!

850
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:38,780
Get ready. The beer-drinking contest!

851
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:41,800
Fighting!

Number one and two drop out!

853
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:52,260
Okay, number three to five! You got this!

854
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:54,860
Fighting! Fighting!

855
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:56,940
Fighting!

856
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:58,850
Number four drops out!

857
01:03:58,850 --> 01:04:03,320
- It's number three or five!
- Chairman, fighting!

858
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:06,670
Number three! Number five!

859
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:17,440
Wow, you got the first place of the day!

860
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:21,270
Why don't you go up here?

861
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:33,590
He got the grand prize of the night!

862
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:42,720
Ms. Park. Do you like that teddy bear that much?

863
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:47,160
Yes, it's very cute.

864
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:49,810
But I should give this to Se Jong.

865
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:53,020
He will like it too.

866
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:54,890
Se Jong has lots of dolls.

867
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:57,960
And Se Jong likes robots more than teddy bears.

868
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,170
If he wants the teddy bear,

869
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:05,050
I will buy him separately. So please keep this one.

870
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:07,230
When you go through a hard time like now,

871
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:10,030
you can hug the teddy bear and get consoled.

872
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:12,610
Chairman.

873

Ms. Park.

874

I hope you don't think anything else from this.

875
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:28,320
Even between friends, when difficult things happen, they help each other.

876
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:33,800
So please don't put any special meaning to it.

877
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:37,240
Chairman. You don't have to worry about me anymore.

878
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:40,130
I am really okay.

879
01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:45,250
From tomorrow, I will go back to the strong Ms. Park.

880
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:14,770
Chairman. You don't have to worry about me anymore.

From tomorrow, I will go back to the strong Ms. Park.

882
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:23,770
Right.

883
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:28,170
Ms. Park will be really okay now, won't she?

884
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:34,460
Ms. Park--

885
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:36,380
What?

886
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:40,400
Where did she go at this early in the morning?

887
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:50,270
Ajumeoni, why were you upstairs at this hour?

888
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:52,870
I had to go home first thing this morning.

889
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:56,130
So I went to see Ms. Park to ask for help with the breakfast.

890
01:06:56,130 --> 01:06:59,360
But she's not there. And the room is all cleaned up.

891
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,090
At this early in the morning?

892
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:03,000
Why don't you call her?

893
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,710
She left her phone in the room.

894
01:07:05,710 --> 01:07:07,850
What?

895
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:12,700
She's never done this before. Where did she go?

904
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:15,020
Ms. Park. Where have you been this early in the morning?

905
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:17,510
I've been looking for you for a while.

906
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:23,050
Are you alright, Ms. Park?

907
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:25,310
Yes.

908
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:30,030
As you said, I was going to be the strong Ms. Park from today,

909
01:08:30,030 --> 01:08:33,100
so I went for a walk.

910
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:39,210
But Chairman, in this cold weather,

911
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:42,850
you didn't dress enough.

912
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:50,690
Were you looking for me because you were worried?

913
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:58,600
It's because you left without your phone at this hour.

Chairman.

915
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:07,190
You told me not to cross the line,

916
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:10,110
and why do you keep crossing it yourself?

917
01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:16,130
You've crossed the line just now.

918
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:20,150
What... What did you say?

919
