[Episode 48]

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,120
Hello, Chairman.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,010
Who are you? What are you doing here so late at night?

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:20,250
I'm Se Jong's father. His biological father.

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,720
What did you say?

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:31,160
What are you talking about? Se Jong is my son.

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,900
I knew you'd be like this,

8
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,470
so I prepared this beforehand.

9
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,230
This is proof that Se Jong is my son.

10
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:47,340
This paternity test shows a 99.999 percent match.

11
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,400
[16 out of 16 categories match. Probability: 99.999 percent]

12
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:11,960
Chairman, you took my son in and raised him, didn't you?

13
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,670
Why are you here like this

14
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,170
after all this time?

15
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,600
Hey, Jin Sang Goo!

16
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,880
Are you crazy? What are you doing here?

17
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,750
I'm so sorry, Chairman.

18
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,020
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,420
Let's go!

20
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,260
[16 out of 16 categories match. Probability: 99.999 percent]

21
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,150
Jo Sarah, why are you so strong? Let go and let's talk.

22
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,420
Why would you go to that house?

23
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,380
What right do you have to go there?

24
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,350
You promised me.

25
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:08,490
You promised you wouldn't show up in front of Se Jong.

26
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,540
That's why I gave you the money! I gave you 300 million won!

27
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,150
So why are you doing this?!

28
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,660
Why did you meet the Chairman?

29
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:25,860
Don't tell me that you're trying to use Se Jong as leverage!

30
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,850
If that's really what you're planning,

31
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,160
I won't let it slide.

32
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,620
I will kill you!

33
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,100
Okay, fine. I hear you, Sarah.

34
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,620
I didn't want to do this either.

35
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,050
But I'm hanging by a thread.

36
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,340
So tell that Chairman to give me 1 billion won.

37
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,300
As soon as possible, okay?

38
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,430
Then I'll leave both you and Se Jong alone.

39
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,860
No, you know what? I'll even leave the country.

40
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,670
I promise, Sarah.

41
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,320
Besides, that Chairman is pretty shameless.

42
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,550
How could he take someone else's child without paying up first?

43
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,740
I should be compensated, don't you think so?

44
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,820
Jo Sarah.

45
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,220
My Se Jong...

46
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,170
He is seven years old.

47
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,940
He's old enough to know what's going on.

48
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,150
You abandoned me,

49
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:32,810
and I abandoned Se Jong. You have no right to do this!

50
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:37,200
What if Se Jong finds out about this later?

51
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,540
Please, please don't do this!

52
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,090
Please just leave Se Jong out of this!

53
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,050
If death is at your doorstep, then just die on your own.

54
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:54,260
Just drown yourself in the Han river!

55
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,050
Anyway, I've laid out my terms.

56
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,690
Give me 1 billion won as soon as possible.

57
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,530
Then everything will be solved.

58
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,080
Got it, Jo Sarah?

59
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,880
You piece of trash!

60
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,620
[Chairman Lee]

61
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,870
Yes, Chairman?

62
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,820
Chief Jo.

63
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,870
Yes.

64
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,720
Can we meet right now?

65
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,660
Okay.

66
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,720
[Paternity Test Results]

67
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,270
That man, earlier.

68
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,810
He handed me this paternity test result and said he's Se Jong's biological father.

69
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:13,110
So I checked in with the lab, and they said it wasn't fabricated.

70
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,340
What's your relationship with that man?

71
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,310
How do you know him?

72
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,010
Chief Jo.

73
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,420
Tell me.

74
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:35,810
- Chairman Lee...
- You took him away earlier.

75
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:40,770
That can only mean you know him.

76
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,160
Answer me right now.

77
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,590
Chairman, actually...

78
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,090
I...

79
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,980
I'm Se Jong's mother.

80
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,790
What?

81
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,620
You're Se Jong's mother?

82
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,750
Are you?

83
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,720
Yes.

84
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:25,980
The one who left Se Jong in front of your house...

85
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,490
It's me.

86
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:35,370
So I got a job in your house to stay close to Se Jong.

87
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,950
I wanted to be with Se Jong.

88
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,860
I wanted to be Se Jong's mom.

89
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,300
That's why I gave you such a hard time.

90
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,790
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I was wrong.

91
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:05,210
So... when your plans didn't work out,

92
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,660
did you bring that man to do something to Se Jong?

93
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,310
No! I would never do that, Chairman!

94
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,970
He's doing this on his own all of a sudden.

95
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:20,420
I broke up with him a long time ago, I swear!

96
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:25,950
I'll never show up in front of Se Jong again.

97
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,130
And I'll make sure to stop him too.

98
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,280
So please,

99
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,610
take good care of Se Jong, Chairman.

100
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:37,010
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,800
Where should we move to?

102
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,380
Mom.

103
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,880
You said you have some money to spare, right?

104
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,460
I have a bit, but we'll need it for when we move.

105
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,320
Mi Sook, that wench, wants us to move. She doesn't want to live with us anymore.

106
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,280
Anyway, give me that money. I need it urgently.

107
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,270
What's going on?

108
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:25,270
What's so urgent that you need the money for our move?

109
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,780
What is it?

110
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:35,510
What's going on? Hey, you... What's with her?

111
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,880
Maybe...

112
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,220
No, it can't be.

113
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,420
Why are you calling me again?

114
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,200
Sarah, you're preparing my money, right?

115
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,690
Sang Goo, please don't be like this.

116
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,020
Were you really serious about the 1 billion won?

117
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,800
It's not even 10 million won. Where would I get that kind of money?

118
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,620
How could you ask for that much money?

119
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,380
I gave you all the money I had.

120
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,540
Gosh. Hey, just forget about it.

121
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,310
If you don't want to step up, then I'll do it myself.

122
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,070
What? What do you mean by that?

123
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,990
You don't need to know.

124
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,850
Just get over here with that 10 million won.

125
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,800
Don't wire it to me.

126
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,970
I have my reasons so bring it in cash.

127
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:33,670
Until you get here, I'll keep playing with Se Jong.

128
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,940
Hey, Jin Sang Goo! What did you just say?

129
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,750
Are you with Se Jong?

130
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,330
What are you so shocked about?

131
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,940
We're just hanging out as father and son.

132
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:52,010
If you don't show up, I'll take him somewhere you can't find us.

133
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,960
All right, I get it.

134
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,860
Just let me talk to Se Jong. Right now!

135
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,190
My goodness!

136
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,570
Hello, teacher?

137
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,360
Excuse me?

138
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,670
What did you just say?

139
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,520
Se Jong is missing?

140
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,390
What? Se Jong is missing?

141
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:23,610
Se Jong suddenly disappeared from the kindergarten playground.

142
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,840
His teachers and I are currently looking for him,

143
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,790
but he might go to your house like he did last time,

144
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,100
so call me immediately if he shows up.

145
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:35,800
All right, call me once you find him as well.

146
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,160
What is going on?

147
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,660
Why would Se Jong disappear?

148
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,580
Unni.

149
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,820
What's going on? Se Jong is missing?

150
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,430
Dan Dan, what do we do?

151
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,140
I just got a call from my brother,

152
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,750
and he said Se Jong disappeared from the kindergarten playground.

153
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,010
At the kindergarten?

154
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,210
I know where Se Jong used to go often.

155
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,770
I'll go and try to find him.

156
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,610
Why would he disappear from the kindergarten?

157
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,320
What's going on?

158
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,440
Why isn't she coming?

159
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,580
I really can't depend on Jo Sarah.

160
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,910
Hey kid, if you're done playing,

161
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,530
let's go to another arcade.

162
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,130
I don't want to.

163
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:34,180
Chief Jo Ajumma told me to stay here.

164
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,450
I'll tell Chief Jo Ajumma to meet you there, then.

165
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,710
There's a bigger arcade over there.

166
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,520
- Let's go.
- I don't want to go.

167
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,150
I want to stay here.

168
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,380
Chief Jo Ajumma already promised to meet us over there.

169
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,330
Kid, you should listen to me.

170
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,310
A good boy should do as I say.

171
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,100
No, I don't want to go.

172
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,780
This little kid.

173
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,190
Why are you so stubborn?

174
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,090
Who do you take after to be so stubborn?

175
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,740
Do you want to get in trouble?

176
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,080
Yes, Hyungnim.

177
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,260
Please wait just a bit longer.

178
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,440
I'll get you the money soon.

179
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,470
Just give me a week,

180
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,810
no, just 3 more days.

181
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,840
Hyungnim, I'm serious this time.

182
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,260
Seriously...

Se Jong.

193
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,740
Se Jong, are you okay?

194
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,680
I think Ms. Park is dead.

195
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,600
Ms. Park.

196
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,260
Her arm is bleeding.

197
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,460
Ms. Park! Ms. Park!

198
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,200
- Ms. Park!
- Ms. Park!

199
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,940
Ms. Park, please wake up.

200
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,250
Ms. Park!

201
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,890
Ms. Park.

202
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,540
Ms. Park!

203
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,090
Please wake up!

204
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,260
Ms. Park!

205
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,960

- Ms. Park!
- Ms. Park!

It's okay, it's okay.
[Surgery Center]

209
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,630
Ms. Park isn't seriously hurt.

210
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,970
She just hurt her arm a bit as she was trying to save you,

211
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:32,000
so she's getting treated. It's okay.

212
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:40,540
Se Jong, about that man Chief Jo knows.

213
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,290
What did he say to you?

214
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,830
He said that until Chief Jo Ajumma comes,

215
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,640
let's play some games.

216
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,240
He said Chief Jo Ajumma would come to pick me up.

217
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,520
Really? Is that all he said?

218
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:05,750
Yes. But, Chief Jo Ajumma wasn't coming,

219
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,370
and he told me to go somewhere else.

220
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,880
When I said I didn't want to,

221
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,070
he got mad that I wasn't listening to him.

222
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,750
So I got scared and ran away.

223
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,420
I'm sorry.

224
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,540
No, it's okay. It's okay.

225
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,150
It's not your fault.

226
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:33,640
Next time, Se Jong, you shouldn't follow a stranger.

227
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,670
- Even if they say, they'll take you to me, okay?
- Okay.

228
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,190
All right.

229
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,630
That's my boy.

230
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,440
Jenny, Se Chan, why did you come?

231
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,010
- We heard Se Jong got hurt. How could we not come?
- Se Jong is fine.

232
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:59,940
Thanks to Ms. Park, he's not hurt at all.

233
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,260
What about Ms. Park?

234
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,370
She hurt her arm while saving Se Jong, so she's getting surgery.

235
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,980
Oh my, Ms. Park.

236
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,560
She could've been badly hurt.

237
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,020
Yes. Se Ryun, can you take Se Jong home first?

238
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,920
I'll explain everything later.

239
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,810
Okay.

240
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:22,700
Se Jong, let's go home and have some chocolate cake

241
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,800
and play games with me, okay?

242
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,340
Yes...

243
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,400
Let's go.

244
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,160
See you later, Oppa.

[Surgery Center]

246
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:45,560
Doctor, how is Ms. Park Dan Dan?

247
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,000
We stitched her right arm just fine,

248
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,990
but we found a slight fracture on her right arm bone,

249
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,070
so we put a cast on it.

250
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,100
We'll see for any other side effects and progression

251
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,490
while she admits to the hospital.

252
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,870
She'll wake up soon from the anesthesia.

253
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,400
Thank you.

254
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,950
How dare you come here?

255
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:51,960
Chairman... I'm sorry.

256
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,350
Chief Jo, didn't you tell me yesterday

257
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:59,530
that you'd make sure he doesn't appear again?

258
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,940
But he dares to lay his hands on Se Jong?

259
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:09,890
Chairman, that man will definitely show up to you again.

260
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,190
He'll try to get money from you.

261
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:17,740
Chairman, you can't give him any money. That won't end anything.

262
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,030
He's...

263
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,600
He is that kind of person.

264
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,960
So please protect Se Jong from him.

265
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,360
The fact that a scumbag like him is his father,

266
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,850
and I'm his mother...

267
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:40,360
Please make sure that Se Jong won't find that out.

268
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,350
Come outside with me.

269
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,730
Let's go out and talk.

270
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,170
What was all that about?

271
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:04,820
Chief Jo is Se Jong's mother?

272
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,640
His biological mother?

273
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,540
Chief Jo,

274
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,180
you abandoned your child,

275
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,770
who was only a few weeks old.

276
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,110
You left him on the street.

277
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:34,900
On a cold street with rough stones everywhere.

278
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,170
Yet you dare call yourself his mother?

279
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:43,580
How dare can you say that you wanted to stay next to him?

280
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,450
You're right.

281
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:50,670
I'm not Se Jong's mom.

282
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,700
I was wrong.

283
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,550
After what you both did,

284
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:59,980
what are you scheming to gain by using Se Jong?

285
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,840
Is it money?

286
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,390
Is that what it is?

287
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,660
No.

288
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,940
I have nothing to do with him anymore. I swear.

289
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:21,210
Chairman, whatever you say, I have no excuse.

290
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,700
Whatever punishment you choose to give me,

291
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,400
I'll accept it willingly.

292
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,630
What I really want is just one thing.

293
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,680
I want Se Jong...

294
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,320
to live as your son...

295
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,990
as a happy child.

296
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,030
That's my one and only wish.

297
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,190
I'm serious, so please, Chairman.

298
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,420
Please help me.

299
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,560
Please keep that man away from Se Jong.

300
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,460
Please protect him.

301
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,900
Then, Se Jong's father...

302
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,580
Give me his phone number.

303
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,990
Really? You got a job?

304
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,790
Yes, at the Hoho Hair Salon in Gangnam.

305
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,420
I start next week.

306
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:43,610
So I told my current boss that I can only work until this week.

307
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,670
High five.

308
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:50,920
Wow! Kang Mi Rim, you're amazing. You found a job as soon as you got your license.

309
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,390
I'm still in the entry-level position.

310
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:57,560
I'll have to work really hard to gain experience and skills.

311
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:02,950
You'll definitely be the best hair designer. I believe in you.

312
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,140
Thank you.

313
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,500
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

314
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:13,260
Gwang Gyu! What's wrong, Gwang Gyu?

315
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,720
Gwang Gyu!

316
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,840
Excuse me for a minute.

317
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,890
- Please help me!
- What's going on?

318
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,530
Something seems to be stuck in his throat.

319
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,200
- Can you call 911?
- What should we do?

320
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,660
Can you stand up for me?

321
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,040
Hold on.

322
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:32,060
One, two, three, four, five.

323
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,640
Are you okay?

324
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,540
Gwang Gyu, are you okay?

325
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:45,700
Thank you. Thank you so much. You saved my son's life.

326
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,110
It's nothing, don't worry about it.

327
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,470
Bong Joon Oh!

328
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,570
What is it?

329
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:11,020
Why are you so cool today? I fell for you all over again.

330
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,700
Stop it.

331
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:18,780
Joon Oh, you just saved a life today. You were really cool.

332
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:23,480
You really are a med student. Have you always been this cool?

333
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,960
It's not because I am a med student. Anyone would have done it.

334
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,450
That's not true. To be able to save a child so calmly

335
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,030
was because you are in medical school.

336
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:41,440
You saved someone's life. Joon Oh, you really are amazing.

337
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,960
If you put it that way, I feel embarrassed.

338
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:52,660
But Joon Oh, do you think about going back to school at all?

339
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,350
Why do you ask?

340
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:57,630
Because I'm fine with you becoming an actor.

341
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:02,740
But if you were to become a doctor, you would be a great one.

342
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,850
Really?

343
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,620
Yes.

344
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:16,960
Are you saying this happened because of saving the Chairman's son Se Jong?

345
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,910
Yes.

346
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:21,600
For how long will you go on like this? You're very upsetting me.

347
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,270
Why can't you detach yourself from that household?

348
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:28,910
How could I do nothing when I heard Se Jong had disappeared?

349
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,740
So I went to look for him and then...

350
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,210
So why would you step up? They have plenty of people there.

351
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:40,370
Besides, you are not their live-in tutor anymore.

352
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:43,350
What is this? It could have turned out very badly.

353
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:47,400
Se Jong almost got into an accident in front of my eyes. Should I have done nothing about it?

354
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,740
Would you have done nothing, Dad?

355
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:55,790
Thank goodness that her injury is not that serious. Also, the cast is temporary.

356
00:24:55,790 --> 00:25:00,570
A crack on a bone heals quickly. Enough already, honey.

357
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:05,520
It's because Dan Dan is such a considerate person, like you.

358
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,190
Ah, really. What if you get a scar from the stitching?

359
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,380
It's so upsetting.

360
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,080
Where are you going, honey?

361
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,250
We will get going, Dan Dan. Call us if you need anything.

362
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:38,180
Chairman, that man will certainly appear before you again.

363
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,880
He will ask you for money.

364
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,060
Chairman, please do not give him money because he will never stop asking.

365
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,310
He is...

366
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,960
He is that kind of person. So please,

367
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,420
protect Se Jong from him.

368
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,750
Hello.

369
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,430
This is Se Jong's dad.

370
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:29,610
Se Jong's biological dad.

371
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:42,390
Please tell me what you want to say regarding Se Jong.

372
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:48,780
I need to be compensated for having my son taken away from me.

373
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,600
Compensation?

374
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,020
What kind of compensation?

375
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:58,440
It's not right to take someone's child for free.

376
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:04,050
So are you trying to sell Se Jong to me?

377
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:06,220
Oh, Chairman.

378
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:10,600
What do you mean sell? What a primitive description.

379
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,030
If you know what it's like to lose a child. How painful that is.

380
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,390
Don't you need to compensate with money at least?

381
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:24,480
After abandoning the baby at my front door, you are looking for compensation now?

382
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:31,890
I never abandoned my child. It was Jo Sarah who did it.

383
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:38,010
If you don't want to compensate me, I will take my son with me at least now.

384
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:40,420
So...

385
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:45,150
How much do you want?

386
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:53,460
If you consider the loss of a child, 10 billion won would not be enough.

387
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,450
But I would settle for 5 billion won. But, it should be all in cash.

388
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:04,740
Fine. I will contact you as soon as it's ready.

389
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,680
I guess since you're the FT Group Chairman, you are very decisive.

390
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,280
You didn't even bargain.

391
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,260
Please call me as soon as possible.

392
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:47,210
Chairman, Chairman! Chairman...

393
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,160
I promise you.

394
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,600
I am not Se Jong's father.

395
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,520
I'll never appear to you ever again in my life. Even if I die..!

396
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,930
I will never show up again. I promise in the name of my mother.

397
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:06,620
Thank you. Thank you, Chairman!

398
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:11,180
I swear to you! Thank you, Chairman.

399
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,460
That man, Jin Sang Goo.

400
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:29,520
He will never appear before you or Se Jong ever again.

401
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,220
- Pardon?
- I want you to promise me too, Chief Jo.

402
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:39,280
That you will never appear before my Se Jong again.

403
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,520
I promise you.

404
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,190
It will never happen, no matter what.

405
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,970
I will trust you for the last time.

406
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:50,510
But if by any chance,

407
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:54,500
if you appear before Se Jong and speak nonsense.

408
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,100
I will mobilize everything I have

409
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,060
and never forgive you.

410
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:06,860
So I hope your feelings toward Se Jong are sincere, at least.

411
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:17,390
Thank you, Chairman.

412
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,970
Thank you.

413
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,450
From a man like that,

414
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:36,840
please protect my Se Jong.

415
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,220
The fact that a scumbag like him is his father,

416
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,720
and I'm his mother...

417
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,430
Please make sure that Se Jong won't find that out.

418
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:53,740
Did I hear it wrong?

419
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,590
No, I didn't.

420
00:30:55,590 --> 00:31:00,540
Clearly, she said, she was Se Jong's mom.

421
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:09,650
Is that why Chief Jo has been taking care of Se Jong particularly?

422
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,430
Right.

423
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:15,580
It might be a good thing for Se Jong.

424
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,980
If Chief Jo and Chairman get married,

425
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,670
Se Jong can live with his real mother.

426
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:27,330
And it will be good for the baby to be born as well.

427
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,690
Right.

428
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:33,680
As long as I...

429
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,360
If I forget Chairman, that's all it takes.

430
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,960
As long as I...

431
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,450
Yes.

432
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:55,290
Ms. Park, are you feeling better?

433
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,690
I had to take care of important business today.

434
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:00,080
So I couldn't come to see you.

435
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,010
Even though you saved my Se Jong, I'm sorry.

436
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:05,950
No, I am okay now.

437
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,780
Nothing is broken or anything.

438
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:13,370
You didn't have to bother coming here.

439
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:16,810
Still, you got injured saving my Se Jong.

440
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,300
Is there anything you need?

441
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,800
No, I don't need anything.

442
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,440
I'm very sleepy, so I would like to rest.

443
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,730
You may go home.

444
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:34,610
Okay. Have some rest.

445
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:43,570
Ms. Park. If you need anything at all, contact me anytime.

446
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:47,180
No. I won't be needing anything.

447
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,300
Goodbye.

448
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,180
Gimbap? What occasion is this?

449
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,520
I thought you might be sick of hospital food, so I made some for you.

450
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,620
I put a lot of fried carrots.

451
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,830
So it tastes sweet and delicious.

452
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:38,220
Here, have some.

453
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,050
You didn't have to.

454
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,850
Why did you go through all this trouble?

455
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:45,150
I know you are busy with the restaurant and lots of other things to do.

456
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,710
Oh my, are you worried about me now?

457
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:51,670
You used to say my gimbap was the best in the world.

458
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:54,040
You said that your friends loved my gimbap,

459
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,340
so I used to make it until my arm got sore. Don't you remember that?

460
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,730
I do remember that.

461
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:02,900
Your gimbap was really delicious, Mom.

462
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,190
It's delicious.

463
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,570
What is it? Don't you feel like eating?

464
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:25,360
It tastes good, but I don't have an appetite.

465
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,590
I've made some soybean soup with naengi.

466
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:31,300
Wash it down with this soup.

467
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,840
Mom, thank you.

468
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:46,970
It's nothing.

469
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,260
Dan Dan.

470
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:56,270
It's because you haven't got over Chairman Lee, isn't it?

471
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:59,770
No, I've gotten over him.

472
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:02,350
I've gotten over him.

473
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,360
Oh my, Dan Dan.

474
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,120
You haven't forgotten him.

475
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,380
Oh, dear.

476
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,070
No, Mom. I will forget him.

477
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,680
I have to get over him.

478
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,990
Since Chief Jo is pregnant with Chairman's baby,

479
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,560
I can't be thinking about him anymore.

480
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,850
Oh dear, Dan Dan.

481
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:36,540
Did Chairman Lee say nothing to you?

482
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,410
What do you mean?

483
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:43,870
It turns out that Chief Jo pregnant with the Chairman's child was all lie.

484
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,680
Chairman Lee regained all of his memories.

485
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:51,660
So it all got revealed that Chief Jo's baby is not Chairman Lee's child!

486
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,940
What are you saying?

487
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:59,390
Mom, so Chief Jo's baby is not Chairman's child?

488
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:02,330
No! It was a complete lie.

489
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,450
Is that really true?

490
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,380
Yes.

491
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,710
Did no one say anything to you?

492
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,170
Not even Chairman Lee?

493
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,210
No.

494
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:21,810
If his memory came back, should he have told you first?

495
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:26,620
Why would he not tell you? Everyone but you know it now.

496
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:33,270
I mean, we've all been quiet because your dad told us to.

497
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:36,730
But shouldn't Chairman Lee have told you?

498
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:39,020
I know.

499
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,300
Maybe he's really trying to break up with you.

500
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,250
That would be the only reason for him not to tell you...

501
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:51,310
Oh my, what should I do?

502
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:54,570
But, Dan Dan.

503
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:58,910
If your dad found out I told you about this, he'd divorce me.

504
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:03,790
So, Dan Dan, please don't tell your dad I told you about this.

505
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,720
Okay.

506
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:10,970
But what's going on here?

507
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:32,120
Ms. Park, if you need anything at all, please call me anytime.

508
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,640
No.

509
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,820
I won't be needing anything.

510
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,670
Goodbye.

511
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:47,960
Ms. Park, how are you feeling?

512
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:51,060
[Incoming call: Ms. Park]

513
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:57,200
- It's me, Ms. Park.
 - Chairman.

514
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,220
Yesterday, you told me to contact you if I needed anything.

515
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,550
So can I tell you what I need?

516
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:08,350
Of course. Anything.

517
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:12,370
You definitely said I could ask for anything.

518
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:17,070
Then, a mango cake and a strawberry latte from my favorite cafe.

519
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,460
That's what I would like for now.

520
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:24,260
Once I eat them, I think I will recover faster.

521
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,550
Really? Okay.

522
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:31,310
I will go get them and bring them to you.

523
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,670
Are you here, Chairman?

524
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:49,200
Ms. Park. Here is the mango cake and the strawberry latte.

525
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:56,470
Do you need something else?

526
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,050
Chairman. I injured my right hand.

527
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:03,150
So how can I cut the cake?

528
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,950
Can you please cut it for me?

529
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:09,930
Right, I got it.

530
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,950
Okay, here you go.

531
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,150
You have to feed it to me.

532
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,120
Pardon?

533
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:41,880
Ms. Park. That is a bit...

534
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:47,990
Chairman. I hurt my right hand while saving Se Jong.

535
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,140
So it's very hard for me to eat.

536
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,020
But can't you help me with this?

537
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:59,950
But your left arm is not injured.

538
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:03,120
Chairman, I'm right-handed.

539
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,960
I can't really use my left arm.

540
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,040
Besides...

541
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,740
While I was falling, I think I bruised my left hand too.

542
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,600
It feels uncomfortable as well.

543
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,810
Can't you just feed me, Chairman?

544
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,860
Please.

545
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:22,120
Okay.

546
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,920
It's delicious.

547
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,180
It melts in my mouth.

548
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,530
Now that I've had it, I feel better.

549
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:48,030
Thank you, Chairman.

550
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,880
That's good.

551
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,160
Chairman, can I have some more?

552
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,720
Oh, yes, of course.

553
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:04,750
It's good.

554
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,460
Chairman, I'm thirsty.

555
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,000
Please give me the latte.

556
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,200
Strawberry latte...

557
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,880
No, this is okay.

558
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,790
I can hold it and drink it.

559
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:25,040
Okay.

560
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,940
Chairman. Cake, please.

561
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,080
Cake.

562
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,300
Hurry, hurry.

563
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,490
Hurry up.

564
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,270
It's so good.

565
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,900
Cake, please.

566
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:55,040
Wow, there are so many stars tonight as well.

567
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,560
You are right.

568
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:03,490
I bet you don't remember it, but when you turned 22-year-old,

569
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:07,710
you were calling me "Ms. Park Noona, Ms. Park Noona!"

570
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:11,240
and even if you had to ride a spaceship,

571
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,160
you would get all those stars if I wanted it.

572
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,320
I bet you don't remember any of these.

573
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:22,270
You also said you would weave all those stars into a crown

574
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:25,760
and put it on my head.

575
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,720
Ms. Park.

576
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,510
When did I say that?

577
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:34,550
I never said something like that.

578
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,870
Of course, you would say you didn't say it.

579
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:40,230
It's because you don't have the memory of when you turned 22-year-old.

580
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,560
You don't remember that time.

581
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:48,110
Or do you remember that time?

582
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,210
You're right. I don't remember that time.

583
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:58,940
How can you deny it so hard when you don't even recall it?

584
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:02,160
Do you think that's the only thing you said to me?

585
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,870
Actually, never mind.

586
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:08,900
I'll stop it here for today since you are having problems by not remembering that time.

587
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,380
Chairman, I want to go in now. It's cold outside.

588
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,060
Can you push the wheelchair for me?

589
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:19,670
Okay.

590
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:27,560
You were pushing it a bit harshly before. I want you to push it gently.

591
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:31,240
Please move it gently this time.

592
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:37,420
Yes, I'll push it gently.

593
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,920
There's a curve.

594
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,700
Yes, the curve matters. Move it slowly.

595
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:56,640
Chairman, thank you so much.

596
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,490
I was feeling suffocating since I was just sitting in the hospital room.

597
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:03,750
But thanks to you, I could go outside, so now I'm feeling much better.

598
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:06,420
You're welcome. I'm glad to hear that.

599
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:09,010
Ms. Park!

600
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:11,150
Thank you, Chairman.

601
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:15,640
I'm sorry, but can you help me walk to the bed?

602
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,320
I don't know what's going on with my legs.

603
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,090
It's not moving at all.

604
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,280
Ms. Park.

605
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:27,590
What should I do?

606
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,250
Ms. Park...

607
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:41,010
I can't breathe, Ms. Park.

608
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:53,940
I'm so sorry. I thought I would fall,

609
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,720
so I grabbed onto you too tight.

610
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:01,070
Ms. Park, I think you need to get thorough examinations again.

611
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:05,110
I think you hurt your legs as well.

612
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:08,380
The doctor said it's okay, so I'll be fine.

613
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,800
Don't worry about it too much.

614
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:16,560
Anyway, since it's late, I'll get going now. I'm worried about my children as well.

615
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,520
Okay. Thank you so much for today, Chairman.

616
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:24,860
Thanks to you, I feel much better.

617
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:27,080
That's good. I hope you recover soon.

618
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,030
Thank you.

619
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:39,360
That was so much fun!

620
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:46,270
But why can't he say his memory came back?

621
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:51,600
Does he really just going to break up with me now?

622
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:56,050
I know he still has feelings for me. It's so stupid.

623
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:19,760
Since Young Gook's memory came back, why doesn't he talk about my gold bars that were in my safe?

624
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:26,680
He would've recognized his mother's diamond ring that his father was desperately looking for before.

625
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,060
Wait, what does this mean?

626
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:33,860
Is he going to take my gold bars to take revenge on me?

627
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:37,780
This bad bastard...

628
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,710
Yes?

629
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,110
Oh, Young Gook.

630
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:49,520
I guess you are getting ready to go to work.

631
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:55,990
Can you give me a second? I have something to talk about with you.

632
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:58,470
What is it?

633
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:01,120
It's about your memory.

634
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:05,840
Do you remember every detail now? Are you sure there's no missing part?

635
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,200
There's nothing like that. I remember everything now.

636
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,690
Is that so?

637
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:15,350
Then, can you give me back my gold bars and cash that were in my safe?

638
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:16,610
Gold bars?

639
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:19,060
Yes, gold bars.

640
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:23,180
I accumulated that hard throughout my entire life.

641
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:26,760
By not spending the allowance money you gave me.

642
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:30,080
When you turned 22-year-old,

643
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,260
you took all of that from me.

644
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:37,700
You remember my safe's passcode- three, six, nine, three, six, nine, don't you?

645
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:41,300
What are you talking about it? I don't know any of this.

646
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,620
You don't know about this?

647
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:46,250
Hey, are you really going to do this to me?

648
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:50,710
Hey, Lee Young Gook. I know that you hate that I'm living in this house!

649
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:53,840
I'll get out of this house if you give back my gold bars.

650
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:57,850
So, give that back to me!

651
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:01,120
Then do you want me to show my safe to you again?

652
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,180
What?

653
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:04,590
I showed you my safe back then as well.

654
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,340
And you checked there was nothing.

655
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,270
But then why are you acting like this again?

656
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:12,460
Did you really have that gold bars in the first place?

657
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:17,310
Wait, is it really not you who took it?

658
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:20,830
Then who took it?

659
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:23,490
I'm going to work.

660
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,330
Then where did my gold bars and money go?

661
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:37,410
Should I report it to the police even now?

662
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:40,080
Did Young Gook really not take it?

663
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:46,290
That's right. He would've not stayed quiet if he had seen that ring.

664
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,670
Oh my, what should I do?

665
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:52,980
Seriously, what should I do about this?

666
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:55,180
Where am I going to find this?

667
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:08,120
Why are there so many reporters out here?

668
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:12,670
Excuse me, is there a celebrity who moved to this building?

669
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:14,080
Who is it?

670
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:18,490
It's not that. Someone who donated a lot to an orphanage anonymously lives in this building.

671
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:20,240
So we came out to cover that.

672
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,570
- Donation?
- Yes.

673
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,400
Hello!

674
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,270
I'm the reporter who called you before.

675
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:30,840
You are Ms. Lee Gi Ja, right?

676
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,880
Yes, she's Lee Gi Ja.

677
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,570
- Aren't you the one who donated to the Soo Jung Orphanage?
- N-No--

678
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:41,160
You donated a big lump sum of 500 million won. Is there a special reason?

679
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:46,070
Wait, did Lee Gi Ja donate 500 million won? 500 million won?

680
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:47,870
- Yes.
- Lee Gi Ja donated 500 million won?

681
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:51,920
It's not me. I didn't do that!

682
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,090
- It's not me!
- Ms. Lee Gi Ja!

683
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:01,880
Mom! What's going on?

684
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,870
Gi Ja. Did you really donate that lump sum?

685
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:08,420
Where did you get that money?

686
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:12,180
Did you really donate 500 million won?

687
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:16,010
What are you talking about? Donation? 500 million won?

688
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:18,550
No, it's not true, Sarah.

689
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:20,820
Mi Sook, that's all lie!

690
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:24,520
- It's not true. It's wrong!
- Hey, you!

691
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,810
But why are there so many reporters waiting out here?

692
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:30,890
Also, why are they pointing the camera towards you?

693
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:33,750
Oh, my goodness.

694
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:37,790
I didn't make the donation! You took me for the wrong person!

695
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:40,100
It's not me!

696
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:43,070
It's the police! Ms. Lee Gi Ja!

697
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:44,980
Open the door!

698
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:47,100
I know that you are in there.

699
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:50,040
What? P-Police?

700
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:54,360
Mom. Why are the police looking for you?

701
00:50:56,310 --> 00:51:00,030
Ms. Lee Gi Ja! Open the door!

702
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:02,260
Sarah, don't open it!

703
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:05,160
They came to the wrong place.

704
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,090
Let me open it.

705
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:09,580
Just stay calm.

706
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:13,010
What's going on here?

707
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:17,880
It's the police. Ms. Lee Gi Ja?

708
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,920
You have to come with me for the stolen diamond transactions.

709
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,840
- What?
- It's not me! I don't know anything about that!

710
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,780
I didn't do anything!

711
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:33,020
- Mom! Let her go and use your words!
- Sarah!

712
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:36,850
Gi Ja did what?

713
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:45,960
Ms. Lee Gi Ja, you know what will happen if you give us a false statement, right?

714
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:51,300
It's not me. I didn't do something like that.

715
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,720
What's going on here?

716
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,970
What stolen goods?

717
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:58,180
Also, where did you get 500 million won to donate to the orphanage?

718
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,710
I said it's not me!

719
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:05,170
Get in there! Go over there.

720
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:07,350
Good job.

721
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,710
Is it that woman?

722
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:24,240
Yes, it's her.

723
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:28,050
I-I'm not the one.

724
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:30,670
I don't know that people!

725
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:33,820
It's not me!

726
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:38,820
Ms. Lee Gi Ja! Stop trying to get out of this.

727
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:41,440
It's all recorded on the surveillance camera.

728
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,440
Gold bars and diamond ring, you stole those.

729
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,890
Mom...

730
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:52,520
The one who stole the stuff in the Madam's safe,

731
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,700
is that you?

732
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:58,340
It's not me... I said it's not me!

733
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,420
Mom...

734
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,350
Sarah. Oh, Sarah.

735
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:08,880
- What is going on here?
- How can you do that, Mom!

736
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,750
Oh, my...

737
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,930
Yes?

738
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:22,920
Chairman Lee.

739
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,620
Yes. What's going on?

740
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:29,330
Your mother's diamond ring that you and your father were looking for before.

741
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:32,450
They finally found it.

742
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:35,810
What? At where?

743
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:39,370
But it's too ridiculous that I'm speechless.

744
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:42,120
Don't be too surprised.

745
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,150
Where did they find it?

746
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:49,810
So it was in the Madam's safe, and Chief Jo's mother stole it.

747
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,730
She stole it with Madam's gold bars.

748
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,800
What?

749
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:59,970
Why don't you try these toasts and coffee that I made?

750
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:02,660
I didn't know our Se Ryun could make these!

751
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,690
- Mom, let's try this.
 - Se Ryun!

752
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:05,960
Se Ryun!

753
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,210
Yes, Aunt-in-law.

754
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:08,810
Oh, my goodness.

755
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:10,200
Welcome, Sister-in-law.

756
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,780
Oh, my world.

757
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:15,500
You know, people say the beacon does not shine on its own base.

758
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:20,480
Do you know who stole your mother's gold bars?

759
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,860
What?

760
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:25,830
Who was the robber? Who did it?

761
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:28,330
It was the mother of Jo Sarah.

762
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:32,430
The one who lives on my property, my friend Lee Gi Ja!

763
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:36,700
I'm still shivering from the shock.

764
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,310
It's hard for me to speak.

765
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:42,120
What?

766
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,620
Chief Jo's mother stole it?

767
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,280
Chief Jo is really...

768
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:59,990
What? Did Lee Gi Ja rob my safe?

769
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:01,770
Yes, Mom.

770
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:06,670
Oh my, people say you can sound water ten fathoms deep, but not the human heart a single fathom.

771
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:09,270
But how can Lee Gi Ja rob my safe?

772
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:13,790
But they found this all out because of that diamond ring.

773
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:18,640
What? Diamond ring?

774
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:24,140
Mom. Was that ring really in your safe?

775
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:28,310
You said you didn't know its whereabouts when my dad and Oppa were looking for it before.

776
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:32,950
But why was that ring in your safe?

777
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:36,020
Mom, did you...

778
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:39,780
Did you steal Oppa's mother's ring?

779
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:42,410
T-That is...

780
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:45,950
Se Ryun, the thing is...

781
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:48,830
Hey, hang up for now!

782
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:56,630
Young Gook...

783
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:59,940
My mother's ring.

784
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:06,470
The ring that my father was looking for it until he passed away. Why was it here?

785
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:10,900
Did you steal that ring, Ajumeoni?

786
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:14,970
The thing is...

787
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:18,100
Young Gook...

788
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:20,530
I'm so sorry.

789
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:22,490
Please forgive me once.

790
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:23,670
The thing is...

791
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:27,430
Young Gook... I must have lost my mind.

792
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:29,220
Young Gook... Young Gook!

793
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,760
Young Gook! Please spare me.

794
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,830
I can't leave this house.

795
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:36,170
No, please, I can't go, Young Gook!

796
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:37,870
Young Gook, please forgive me.

797
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:40,250
Young Gook...

798
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:41,830
Young Gook, please spare me.

799
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:44,240
Young Gook, I'll do my best!

800
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,630
I can't get out of this house.

801
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:49,500
Young Gook...

802
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:53,050
I'll do my best. Please forgive me...

803
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:05,940
Chief Kim. To Chairman Lee, Young Gook,

804
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:07,960
can you please talk to him once?

805
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,630
I really don't have a place to go.

806
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:17,730
But Chairman Lee listens to you, doesn't he?

807
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,300
I'm sorry, ma'am.

808
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:27,050
Chairman said this is the end for you, Madam.

809
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:31,800
Also, I only do things by his order.

810
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:35,580
Mrs. Yeoju, let's go inside.

811
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:40,270
Hey, you treacherous subject!

812
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:44,170
Mrs. Yeoju... Mrs. Yeoju.

813
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:47,440
So why did you do that?

814
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:52,170
Hey, Mrs. Yeoju! You can't do this to me!

815
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:54,460
All those people...

816
00:57:54,460 --> 00:58:01,150
How can they do this to me...

817
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:04,510
Seriously...

818
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:07,190
How can they...

819
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:11,180
Se Ryun, I think you have to come here.

820
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:14,690
I got kicked out of the house by your brother.

821
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:17,820
Mom, I can't do anything for you anymore!

822
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:20,420
You take care of yourself from now on!

823
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:22,410
Hey, Lee Se Ryun...

824
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:24,030
Se Ryun! Hey!

825
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:26,320
Hey, hey!

826
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:31,170
What should I do? This brat...

827
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:33,680
What should I do now?

828
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,920
What should I...

829
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:23,610
I don't want to say it long.

830
00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:27,980
I want you to move out of this house as soon as possible.

831
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:32,450
I already gave you the deposit since you said there was an urgent matter.

832
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:40,510
So please just move out of here as soon as possible.

833
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:43,730
Yes, I will.

834
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:53,240
Also, even just thinking about your baby in your stomach,

835
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:58,590
you shouldn't live like that anymore. Okay?

836
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:11,130
What should I do now?

837
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,370
Let's talk.

838
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:25,370
We have things to sort out.

839
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:41,020
About that child...

840
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:45,120
What do you plan to do with them?

841
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:50,460
Ajussi, this child is mine and has nothing to do with you.

842
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:56,780
So from now on, please don't come to see me anymore.

843
01:00:56,780 --> 01:01:01,090
How can you say that?

844
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:06,800
It would be a different case if I didn't know, but how can you say that to my face?

845
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:11,900
That child is my child too.

846
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:23,160
Sarah.

847
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:28,870
When you give birth, I'll raise the child.

848
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:30,570
Please let me do that.

849
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:33,180
What are you talking about it?

850
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:36,760
Are you saying that you'll take the child after it's born?

851
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:43,250
Then, are you saying I should pretend it doesn't exist when my child is living out there somewhere?

852
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:50,000
I can't do that.

853
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,380
I don't want to have this conversation with you.

854
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:58,180
I'll say this again. This child is my child.

855
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:00,560
Don't look for me again.

856
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:03,130
I'll get going now.

857
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:25,700
What are you doing here?

858
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:29,570
Your test results come out today.

859
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:32,610
Have you received it yet?

860
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:35,660
No, not yet.

861
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:40,200
Don't worry about me. I'll take care of my business.

862
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,990
Then why worry me by being sick?

863
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:46,330
What about Dan Dan?

864
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:49,650
Is she doing well? Is everything fine?

865
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:52,260
Dan Dan is...

866
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:57,980
She's fine. Nothing's going on.

867
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:00,490
That's a relief.

868
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:08,490
Doctor, has the test results come out?

869
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:12,010
How am I? Everything's fine, right?

870
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:13,950
I'm so sorry to say this.

871
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:18,590
It's stage three pancreatic cancer.

872
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:21,340
What?

873
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:24,480
Stage three pancreatic cancer?

874
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:30,030
Then, what should she do now?

875
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:34,750
As of right now, surgery is the only option.

876
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:39,320
We'll need to do some more tests to figure out of surgery is possible.

877
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:45,800
If surgery isn't possible... what happens then?

878
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,910
Yes, Ms. Park?

879
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:12,780
Chairman, there's something I need right now. Can I ask you again?

880
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:16,580
Sure, while you're in the hospital, I'll do whatever you need.

881
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:19,350
You're only there because you saved Se Jong.

882
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:25,520
I'm suddenly craving the tteokbokki and soondae I used to eat when I was in school.

883
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:29,150
Can you personally bring them to me?

884
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:31,920
I'll text you the shop address.

885
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,310
Tteokbokki and Soondae?

886
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:37,240
Sure,

887
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,570
is that all you need?

888
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:41,020
Yes.

889
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:43,410
All right.

890
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:50,570
She wants me to personally bring her tteokbokki and soondae?

891
01:04:57,150 --> 01:04:59,930
Maybe Ms. Park is...

892
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:07,320
Ms. Park, I brought the tteokbokki and soondae.

893
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,050
Thank you.

894
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:11,030
I'll eat it over there.

895
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:13,890
Okay.

896
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:22,030
Chairman... I can't walk very well. Could you lend me a hand?

897
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:24,310
Oh, sure.

898
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:28,340
Of course, I should help you when you can't walk.

899
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:41,580
Oh my gosh, why are my legs like this?

900
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,850
Ms. Park. I talked to your doctor earlier,

901
01:05:58,850 --> 01:06:05,070
and he said your legs are fine. Why don't we ask for another examination?

902
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:07,050
No, it's okay.

903
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:11,100
I said I'm fine. I'll do it later.

904
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,930
It looks delicious.

905
01:06:21,530 --> 01:06:23,230
Chairman.

906
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:25,200
What is it?

907
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,370
Can you tie my hair for me?

908
01:06:28,370 --> 01:06:31,630
Tie your hair?

909
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:37,670
Yes, I think my hair might get in the tteokbokki sauce.

910
01:07:02,390 --> 01:07:06,520
Chairman, can you walk me to my bed?

911
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:10,610
Oh, but it was a bit hard to balance while leaning on you before,

912
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:16,400
so can you carry me to the bed like you did yesterday?

913
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:20,980
Ah, okay. I'll do that.

914
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:26,810
There's a snake over there!

915
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:29,760
Where? Where is it?!

916
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:39,550
Ms. Park, you've been messing with me, haven't you? You jumped pretty high just now.

917
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:43,950
Excuse me?

918
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:55,830
Ms. Park. You know that I've regained my memories, right?

919
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:02,260
Yes. I knew everything.

920
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:05,490
I also heard that Chief Jo lied to everyone.

921
01:08:05,490 --> 01:08:10,610
I was waiting for you to tell me first.

922
01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:15,600
Ms. Park, I no longer have a reason to tell you these things.

923
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:20,150
We're not in a relationship anymore, so what is all this?

924
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:23,800
Chairman, we broke up because of Chief Jo.

925
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:28,110
But your memories are back, and it revealed that Chief Jo lied,

926
01:08:28,110 --> 01:08:31,460
so there's nothing stopping us now.

927
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:34,850
Why are you acting like this, Chairman Lee?

928
01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:43,080
Ms. Park, you know Chief Jo wasn't the only reason we broke up.

929
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:49,820
It wasn't easy for us to split up, so don't do this sort of thing again.

930
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:54,990
I told you to date someone that's blessed by everyone.

931
01:08:54,990 --> 01:08:57,200
That's not me.

Chairman, someone is here for the live-in tutor position interview.

01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:26,350
Really? I haven't received a resume yet.

About that, Chairman...

947
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:35,020
Hello, Chairman Lee.

948
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:39,240

I'm sorry, but the card has been suspended.

958
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:34,850
What did you say?

959
01:11:34,850 --> 01:11:39,220
Fine, I'll just sneak in. Even if I die, I'll die in this house.

960
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:43,480
Ms. Park, I will not hire you as a live-in tutor again, so don't wait for my call.

961
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,400
We can always get back together.

Let's not make the same mistake again.

963
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:48,900
Even still, I want to be with you.

964
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:50,450
I'm not coming to visit you again.

965
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:51,580
What are you saying?

966
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:54,570
You're ashamed of me, and I'm ashamed of you.

Hi, Oppa.

It's been such a long time. What's the occasion?

970
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:03,770
Since it's been a while, can you take me out for a meal?

971
01:12:03,770 --> 01:12:07,700
Dan Dan, I had liked you since when we were in college. Can we go on a date sometime?

972
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:12,940
I'm sorry, I liked Chairman Lee, and I'm still not over him.
