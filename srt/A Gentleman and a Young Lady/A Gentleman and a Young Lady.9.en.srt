[Episode 9]

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,530
Chairman.

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,910
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:19,100
Chairman, I... I lied.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,310
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:32,270
Ms. Park. What are you saying?

7
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:37,080
What do you mean by you lied? What lie?

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,730
Actually, it wasn't my friend.

9
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:45,100
I went because my dad was hurt in an accident.

10
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,000
Your dad?

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,320
But why did you say it was your friend?

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,340
That's...

13
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,880
To be honest...to be honest, my dad

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,350
is the Mr. Park who stopped working here.

15
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:08,020
So... I'm sorry.

16
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,800
What?

17
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,210
Mr. Park, who stopped working here last time,

18
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,050
is your father, Ms. Park?

19
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,210
Yes.

20
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:31,630
Ms. Park, what are you saying right now?

21
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,040
So what you're saying is,

22
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:43,320
Mr. Park and the people who hid out in the back house is your family?

23
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,940
Yes.

24
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,720
I'm really sorry I didn't tell you the truth from the beginning.

25
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:55,530
It might sound like an excuse, but I attempted to tell you several times all this while,

26
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,390
but I couldn't pick up the courage.

27
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,690
The children are very lovely,

28
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:05,000
and everyone was so nice to me,

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,110
so I wanted to stay here...

30
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,640
So, you've been fooling me,

31
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,930
and my children, and my family?

32
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,590
From the beginning!

33
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,520
No!

34
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,570
My dad and I never planned to come here together.

35
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,210
I can't tell you everything about my situation,

36
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,900
but by the time I got hired as an in-home tutor,

37
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,170
my dad was already working here!

38
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,770
It was truly a coincidence!

39
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,140
A dad and daughter worked at the same house without knowing?

40
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:47,860
Everything was a coincidence! I don't want to hear such ridiculous excuses anymore.

41
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,220
So get out of this house. Now.

42
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,130
Okay.

43
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,810
Okay. I will...

44
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,790
I'm really sorry.

45
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,720
And...

46
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:13,290
Thank you for everything until now.

47
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,320
Wait.

48
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,650
Yes, Chairman.

49
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:25,480
Not now. Tomorrow morning.

50
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:31,720
After the children go to their schools, leave quietly.

51
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,390
So the children aren't surprised.

52
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,220
Okay.

53
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,310
I will do that.

54
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:07,720
Oh, no... What should I do?

55
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:21,460
Noona. Why aren't you sleeping at this hour?

56
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,710
I came out earlier to drink some water,

57
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,270
and I accidentally overheard you and Ms. Park talking.

58
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,490
What is going on?

59
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:41,780
Ms. Park is apparently our previous driver, Mr. Park's daughter.

60
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:47,940
A daughter of that family, which came to our house to approach Se Ryun. You saw them too, Noona.

61
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,150
Do you think this makes sense?

62
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,200
I am surprised too.

63
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,360
But considering how Ms. Park told the truth now, perhaps there was a reason.

64
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,310
If she had had bad intentions, she wouldn't have revealed the truth herself.

65
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,210
No, Noona.

66
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:11,670
She's fooled all of us until now. I can't forgive this.

67
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:18,610
Then are you really going to fire Ms. Park?

68
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,480
The children seemed to love her.

69
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:27,070
If Ms. Park stops working here, won't the children be shocked?

70
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,490
Still, how can I have such a person in my house?

71
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:36,440
I can't have the daughter of a scammer's family near my children.

72
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,780
We just met. Why did you do that?

73
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,700
Why? You should have just stayed.

74
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,180
Still, don't worry.

75
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,710
Now you have me, your mom.

76
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,190
Why? Do you want to play a game?

77
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,200
But I know I can't.

78
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,280
We came out early today, so we have some time.

79
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,030
Do you want to play a round before we go?

80
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:33,870
Really? Can I really do that?

81
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:38,450
Is today a special day? It isn't my birthday!

82
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,110
Nice!

83
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,840
I'm so excited!

84
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,280
Se Jong! Lee Se Jong.

85
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,270
What is it, Ms. Park?

86
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,570
Ms. Park, what's wrong?

87
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,820
You're weird today.

88
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,930
Nothing's weird. Nothing's wrong.

89
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:19,220
I just think you're very handsome today, Se Jong.

90
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,540
I am handsome, aren't I?

91
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:30,580
Se Jong. Listen to your teacher, and be nice to your friends today too. Okay?

92
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,480
Of course!

93
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,170
Why don't you go in now?

94
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:39,820
Okay! Ms. Park, see you later!

95
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,540
Ms. Park.

96
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,820
CEO!

97
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:03,270
Ms. Park. Can we talk for a bit?

98
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,750
I'm sorry?

99
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:12,430
Actually, I accidentally overheard you and Chairman Lee talking last night.

100
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:19,970
I heard that the previous driver, Mr. Park is your father.

101
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,690
I'm sorry.

102
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,150
No. No.

103
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:28,050
You don't have to apologize to me.

104
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:33,950
I felt like you had a circumstance that you couldn't tell others.

105
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,820
Why don't you tell me?

106
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,280
It's okay.

107
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,300
I've decided to leave today.

108
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,670
- I'll go to the house and--
- Ms. Park.

109
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:54,040
Even if you're leaving, you need to resolve any misunderstandings before you go.

110
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,190
Ms. Park, you're not the kind of person to deceive others on purpose.

111
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:04,800
I might not have known you for a long time, but I know you're not that kind of person.

112
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,680
So why don't you tell me?

113
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,590
What happened?

114
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,550
To be honest, I ran out of the house after fighting with my mom and dad.

115
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,220
I was determined enough to cut ties with them, too.

116
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,900
Really?

117
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,840
Yes.

118
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:44,680
Dad suffered a lot because mom's side of the family tried to do business.

119
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,220
They lost our house that my dad bought after hard work,

120
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,950
but they lost our rented house again, which we barely got.

121
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,880
In the end, the whole family was bound to sit out on the streets,

122
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,740
so I got so upset and left the house.

123
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:08,090
Oh, my goodness. My poor daughter.

124
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,180
So I had nowhere to go,

125
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:17,980
but I found the live-in tutor job at Chairman's house, where food and room were provided. It was so nice.

126
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,940
The children are so lovely, too.

127
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,180
But then I found out that my dad

128
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:30,410
was already working as a live-in driver at the Chairman's house.

129
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,170
How did that happen..?

130
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:39,500
I should have told him the truth back then, but I got scared.

131
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,120
I was scared I'd be fired.

132
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,640
I had nowhere else to go if I got fired.

133
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,720
But my dad decided to stop working there

134
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:58,040
in case they find out about us later and have a weird misunderstanding.

135
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:03,090
But then my Oppa and Ms. Se Ryun's relationship got revealed!

136
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:09,110
CEO, my dad isn't that kind of person.

137
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,250
We really didn't know anything.

138
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,150
I'm telling you the truth!

139
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:19,480
I believe you, Ms. Park.

140
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,430
Thank you so much, CEO.

141
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,950
Thank you.

142
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:30,260
I'll talk to Chairman Lee for you.

143
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,390
Please don't.

144
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:37,320
I did wrong to the Chairman and the kids.

145
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:43,390
And even if I were the Chairman, I would've not understood this situation either.

146
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,730
CEO Anna.

147
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:53,590
Thank you for being so warm to me.

148
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,470
I hope you stay healthy.

149
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,320
Ms. Park. Ms. Park!

150
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:16,070
My daughter Dan Dan worked as a live-in tutor

151
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:20,420
because she had nowhere to live, nowhere to go?

152
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,680
Did she suffer so much throughout her life?

153
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,180
My daughter Dan Dan had to go through all that?

154
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,130
Ms. Park, what's going on? Are you really quitting?

155
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:45,780
Ajumeoni, thank you for everything. Take care.

156
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:51,650
Chief Jo, Ms. Park is getting kicked out, isn't she? She didn't do anything wrong to get kicked out.

157
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:54,520
Chief Jo, you must know. What's the reason?!

158
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,150
No, it's not that. It's all my fault.

159
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:02,190
That's why I'm quitting.

160
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,560
What is this? What? Ms. Park, are you quitting?

161
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,190
Madam...

162
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:14,050
Thank you for everything until now.

163
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:21,280
And, I'm so sorry. Goodbye then.

164
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,340
Oh, my!

165
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:29,530
Chief Jo, what's going on? Did something happen?

166
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:34,340
I don't know either. When I came to work, the Chairman said Ms. Park is going to quit.

167
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:38,840
He said to calculate her final paycheck as of today and didn't say anything else.

168
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:44,690
Ms. Park was nice and good at her job. What would be the reason?

169
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:48,710
I know, Madam. I'm so sad.

170
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,400
I wonder what the reason is?

171
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,200
We have to hire a new person, and we have to get used to them again!

172
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,850
I'm so sick of people coming and going!

173
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:06,760
That's so awful of the Chairman. How could he suddenly fire someone like this?

174
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,070
This is not okay!

175
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:13,170
The Chairman must have fired her with a reason.

176
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:18,170
Chief Jo, you're also an employee. You shouldn't act like this!

177
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,940
Since when were they that close for her to be so upset?

178
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:26,950
But for me, somehow, I feel very relieved.

179
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,860
I was so scared that something was going to happen to you.

180
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,600
If something happened to you, I was going to kill myself and follow you.

181
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,580
You're lying.

182
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:03,240
I'm not lying to you! I can't live without you.

183
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,950
I can't even sleep without you. How can I live without you?

184
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:14,300
So, don't do work like that from now on. You're too old to work on a construction site.

185
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,690
Even if we starve, I won't allow it. Do you understand?

186
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,430
Answer me, do you understand?

187
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,790
Okay, I got it.

188
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,630
Have another bite.

189
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,830
Dan Dan.

190
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:37,670
Dan Dan, you're here. What's that?

191
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,430
It's tangerines.

192
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:43,130
Oh, Dan Dan brought you tangerines that you like.

193
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:48,150
Dad, are you okay now? You're okay, right?

194
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:55,630
Don't worry. The doctor will do some tests, and if everything is good, he can go home today.

195
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,420
I'm glad to hear that.

196
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:03,850
Dad, don't ever do such dangerous work again, okay?

197
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:10,050
Don't worry. He promised me never to do that kind of work again.

198
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,420
Why? Is something going on?

199
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:20,640
No, nothing's going on with me. Don't worry about me.

200
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:26,640
Dad, you were upset because of me, weren't you?

201
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,130
I'm so sorry.

202
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:31,730
It's okay.

203
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:36,590
Honey, why don't you go get something for Dan Dan to drink?

204
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,160
Okay.

205
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,150
Dan Dan.

206
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,990
I'm okay, so don't worry.

207
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:05,670
I was worried that you might get in trouble in that house because of us, so that's why I said that.

208
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:11,940
Wherever you are, as long as you're doing well, I'm fine.

209
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:16,210
Do what you want to do.

210
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,710
Dad, I'm doing good. So don't worry about me and focus on getting better.

211
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:26,010
I'll get going now.

212
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:50,120
- What are you doing? Why are you out here?
- What? Oh...

213
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,370
Did you come out here in your state to see Dan Dan leave?

214
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:57,910
My goodness, it's so sentimental and heartbreaking.

215
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,250
I'm just checking if she's leaving without trouble.

216
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:06,790
By the way, how can she leave without saying bye to me? That naughty girl.

217
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:13,160
She's a house tutor, so she shouldn't be gone too long. I told her to go.

218
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:18,830
Be careful. Hold my arm. Be careful.

219
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,130
Chief Jo, what is this?

220
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:30,590
The Chairman gave it so you could go on a vacation to Jeju island at least.

221
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:38,010
Did Chairman Lee give this? Oh, my!

222
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,740
What? Did he give this much just for going to Jeju island?

223
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:45,100
Are you sure Chairman Lee gave this?

224
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:50,630
Yes. So, go to Jeju island or go shopping with Ms. Se Ryun,

225
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,860
and please don't be too upset with the Chairman.

226
00:18:53,860 --> 00:19:02,380
Chief Jo, tell me the truth. You got this from Chairman Lee by persuading him, didn't you?

227
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,630
How did you know that?

228
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,980
Of course, I knew that was the case.

229
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:17,410
I did persuade him, but in the end, the Chairman is the one who permitted it.

230
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,390
He must have felt bad too.

231
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,700
Chief Jo, you are the best. You're the only one I can count on.

232
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:32,930
Chief Jo, you know how much I like you, right?

233
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:39,400
Yes, of course. I also can only count on you, Madam.

234
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,430
Welcome!

235
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,990
Hello!

236
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,450
Welcome, Mrs. Wang.

237
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,790
The thing I ordered, is that ready?

238
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:57,260
Of course, Madam. This way.

239
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:02,870
[1 kg Gold Bar]

240
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:08,800
Great, I got another one. My beautiful babies.

241
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,180
My beautiful babies.

242
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:15,070
Yes, I should stay stuck to this house,

243
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:19,450
to bring me small fortunes like that, at least.

244
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:25,320
Wait, the only way for me to survive in this house!

245
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,390
It's Chief Jo. Chief Jo, Chief Jo!

246
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:35,380
Siblings who were adopted to the U.S. 32 years ago reunited dramatically.

247
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,970
Oh, my goodness!

248
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,850
These two are siblings that are five years apart.

249
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:43,960
In 1989, the younger brother Lee Young Chul who was five years old,
[Siblings adopted to the U.S. in 1989, reunited in 32 years]

250
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,380
was adopted to a family in Kingston, New York.

251
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:52,050
Older sister Lee Young Sook was adopted by a family in Virginia.

252
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:56,290
For decades, they did not know of each other's whereabouts--

253
00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:01,300
My dear Kyung Hoon, what if he was adopted by any chance?

254
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:05,090
Kyung Hoon, if you were adopted,

255
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:09,050
please look out for me now, at least.

256
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:13,840
Kyung Hoon, where are you?

257
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,650
Kyung Hoon...

258
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,520
Yes, son.

259
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,340
Mom, are you crying?

260
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,950
What's the matter?

261
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,470
No, I'm not crying.

262
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,070
Why did you call me?

263
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:40,280
What? Are you coming home this week?

264
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,330
Yes, Mom.

265
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:46,200
You mean it, right? You're not just saying it, are you?

266
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,430
It's not. This time, I really mean it as you like.

267
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,410
- See you on the weekend, Mom. 
- Okay.

268
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:56,860
Okay, I'll see you then, my son.

269
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:03,960
This week, I get to see Joon Oh as much as I want.

270
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,510
Who is that?

271
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:14,310
Oh, I told that grandma not to come back!

272
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,170
Grandma, sit over here.

273
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,510
Yes.

274
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:25,730
Don't call me grandma and just call me Ajumeonie, please.

275
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:28,390
I still feel young at heart.

276
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:32,680
Gran-- Ajumeonie.

277
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,800
I thought about it, but I don't think this will work.

278
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,480
Why?

279
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,700
Did my Namul and Geotjeori taste bad?

280
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,990
That's not it. It was delicious.

281
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:52,380
It's just that you are a bit too old, and it makes me uncomfortable.

282
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:57,920
If you break a bone or fall while working here, what would I do?

283
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,360
Why don't you try touch here?

284
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,790
I have thick bones. Thick bones.

285
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:07,070
I have no reason to fall,

286
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,870
and even if I do fall and break a bone,

287
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:14,770
I won't make it your problem. I swear.

288
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:18,640
I mean, even then...

289
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,360
I will do well. Please don't worry and let me work for you.

290
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,530
You said you could make Pho, right?

291
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,780
You told me you used to live in Vietnam.

292
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,300
Of course!

293
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,400
Vietnamese Pho is my specialty.

294
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,900
I can make it so deliciously,

295
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,740
so you can eat it well. Don't worry.

296
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,290
Then, this weekend, my son will be visiting.

297
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:47,700
So, Pho, please prepare that deliciously.

298
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,110
After that, I'll make my decision.

299
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:54,700
Excuse me? Are you going to decide then?

300
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:00,100
Gosh Darn fudge cake monster mash flipping eff. 
[T/N: She's using non-swearwords that sounds like swear words]

301
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,070
How many times is she going to make me jump through hoops?

302
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:06,590
I'm not trying to get into a big corporate.

303
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:09,920
If I made good food, she should just trust me and hire me.

304
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,650
What's all this nonsense?

305
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,760
Why?

306
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,290
You don't think you can do it?

307
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:19,650
No, no. Of course, I can do it.

308
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:31,027
I am probably the only housekeeper that makes the best Vietnamese Pho in South Korea.

309
00:24:31,526 --> 00:24:34,170
Dae Ran, what's going on?

310
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:37,300
Why did you ask me to meet up outside all of a sudden?

311
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:43,200
I have something to talk about with you quietly.

312
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,160
Something to talk about it quietly?

313
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,540
What is it?

314
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:53,620
You told me, get a good new daughter-in-law.

315
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,890
That's the way for me to survive.

316
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,910
That's right.

317
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,180
I was so sad when I heard about your life until now.

318
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,230
I felt like you really need to get a good daughter-in-law, at least.

319
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,730
- A daughter-in-law who will always take on your side.
- Right?

320
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:11,800
Imagine having a weird daughter-in-law at this point.

321
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:20,140
If that happens, it'll be just a matter of time for you to be left out completely.

322
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,570
That's why I said let's meet up today.

323
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:27,050
I'm going to talk to you openly.

324
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:29,130
Your daughter, Chief Jo.

325
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:34,690
- I want to make her my daughter-in-law, what do you think?
- What?

326
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:37,050
My daughter, Sarah?

327
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,440
Yes. Your daughter!

328
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,980
Can you give her to me, as my daughter-in-law?

329
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,140
Oh, no.

330
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,840
Are you shocked?

331
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,910
I guess you're upset. Of course, she's a young bachelorette.

332
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:01,840
Young Gook is a single father with three kids, so it's not that great, right?

333
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,690
No, it's not that I'm upset.

334
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,350
I just didn't expect to hear this, so...

335
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:16,450
Well, and as you said, he does have three kids.

336
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,660
Why? So you don't like the idea?

337
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,460
When did I say I didn't like it?

338
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:24,240
Hey, I'm not the one marrying.

339
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,520
First of all, let me ask Sarah.

340
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,440
Yes, Gi Ja, please talk to Chief Jo nicely.

341
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,420
And, if you leave out the fact that he has three kids, Young Gook is still young!

342
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,720
Also, he's a Chairman of a company, so what's stopping him from marrying a young woman?

343
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,740
But we need a nice daughter-in-law that suits our family.

344
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,350
Also, it's a waste to give this opportunity to someone else!

345
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:51,560
You're right. If Sarah says she'd like to,

346
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,710
I like it too.

347
00:26:53,710 --> 00:27:00,320
Gi Ja, if you and I become in-laws, it would be so nice, isn't it?

348
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,190
Is this a dream?

349
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:08,080
Sarah, you did it! You did it!

350
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,220
Sarah, over here.

351
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:22,990
Mom, what's going on?

352
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:26,020
- Dae Ran just got home, right?
- Yes.

353
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,420
Did you meet up with the Madam?

354
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,410
Didn't Dae Ran say something to you?

355
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,980
No, not really.

356
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,900
But, I talked to the Chairman and gave her a good amount of allowance separately.

357
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,760
Maybe it's because of that,

358
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,600
but she's so friendly to me and even held my hand like this.

359
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,860
Anyway, what is it?

360
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,420
Dae Ran asked for you.

361
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,510
What?

362
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:54,440
She wants you as a daughter-in-law. She doesn't want to give that position to a random person!

363
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,240
Really? Madam really said that?

364
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,270
Chairman Lee has three children,

365
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:07,340
so she felt bad talking to you herself,

366
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:11,820
so she asked me to speak with you.

367
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,580
So, what did you say?

368
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,730
You didn't tell her that I like Chairman Lee, did you?

369
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,590
Do you think I'm crazy?

370
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:23,560
This is the time to play hard to get. I'm not an idiot.

371
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:29,280
I just said I'll ask you. That's all I said.

372
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,190
Sarah, Sarah, Jo Sarah.

373
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:39,340
You will become the young madam of the FT Group,

374
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,040
and being the real mom to Se Jong is not far!

375
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,690
So let's endure a bit more and keep working hard. Okay?

376
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:49,420
Yes, don't worry!

377
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,450
One, two, three!

378
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,550
One, two, three!

379
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:25,530
Chairman and Madam, welcome back.

380
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,610
Mrs. Yeoju, is everything in order?

381
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,090
Yes, Madam.

382
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,880
Would you prepare the bath?

383
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,200
Yes, Madam.

384
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,140
Chief Jo. Chief Jo!

385
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:55,090
Chief Jo, what were you thinking about it? You didn't even notice me coming up.

386
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:57,530
It's nothing.

387
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:02,400
Did you daydream about winning a lottery? You were smiling like a crazy person.

388
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,490
Ajumma, please watch how you talk.

389
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:08,560
How can you call me a crazy woman?

390
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:14,080
She's so annoying. Annoying!

391
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:23,670
Oh, hello! Executive Director Kang!

392
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,800
Director Oh!

393
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:30,940
And Manager Jin, it's so good to see you in a while!

394
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,300
It's good to see you too, Oppa.

395
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:44,700
What are you talking about now? Are you going to date Mr. Park's son again?

396
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,150
Are you out of your mind?

397
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:53,310
At first, I believed what Mom said and thought Dae Beom intentionally got close to me,

398
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,150
but that wasn't it.

399
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:59,430
When I first met him at a club, I was the one who flirted with him first,

400
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:03,080
and I was the one to ask him out because I thought he was so cool.

401
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,570
He didn't approach me first.

402
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:09,670
Lee Se Ryun. Why are you still acting like a child?

403
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:12,380
Did he ask you to do this?

404
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,070
Oppa, I'm not an idiot.

405
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:19,580
I'm very rational state right now too.

406
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:24,350
Dae Beom even asked me to break up.

407
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,280
He said he had to make money because his family went bankrupt.

408
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,570
That he wasn't fit to be with me, so he asked me to let him go.

409
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:34,480
But I didn't let him go.

410
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,210
And I did everything for him because I liked him so much,

411
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:44,000
not because he asked me to buy or do stuff for him.

412
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,510
He's not a Casanova type.

413
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:49,650
He's not a fraud. He's a good person.

414
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:54,450
He's the son of Mr. Park. Don't you know what kind of people they are?

415
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:57,370
Those people--

416
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:04,250
Anyway, don't ever bring this up in front of me again.

417
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:07,410
I mean, Oppa.

418
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:13,940
This whole misunderstanding was started because Mr. Park is the father of Dae Beom.

419
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,390
This is all coincidental.

420
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:19,660
I mean, there are so many coincidences in the world.

421
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:24,970
I don't think it's right to call someone a fraud just because of that one coincidence.

422
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:27,510
Oppa, think carefully.

423
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:31,340
What bad deed did Mr. Park do to us?

424
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:36,260
Nothing. On the contrary, he was a good person and worked really hard.

425
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,340
What?

426
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,710
Why? Am I wrong?

427
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,390
Just because of the fact that I like Dae Beom,

428
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:46,950
why would you call innocent people frauds? Why?

429
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:49,800
That's not right.

430
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:56,660
Sure. Let's say what you said is all true. Even then, you can't be with him.

431
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,810
Why? Why not?!

432
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,870
Lee Se Ryun! Get it together!

433
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:06,750
Are you thinking of marrying him or something?

434
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:12,250
What is there to stop me? I like him!

435
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:16,370
So, please, Oppa.

436
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:20,810
I want to date him with you and Mom's affirmation.

437
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:27,880
So, please persuade Mom, please?

438
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,480
Get out if you are going to talk nonsense. I have a conference soon.

439
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,220
Okay.

440
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,090
I'll do whatever I want then.

441
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:45,350
I'm old enough, so I don't need permission.

442
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:50,140
But, if I get married, the stock shares my dad promised to give me,

443
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,560
make sure to give me that. Okay?

444
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:12,710
Hello? Chief Jo.

445
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:17,490
Chairman, Ms. Park left this morning.

446
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,750
Okay.

447
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:31,750
Dae Beom.

448
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,030
Dae Beom.

449
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:42,830
Why are you acting like you don't know me? It's me.

450
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,850
What's a rich young lady doing here in this dirty part of town?

451
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:52,350
Dae Beom. Why are you talking like that?

452
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,810
Dae Beom, let's get in the car first.

453
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:57,190
I have something to tell you.

454
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:05,120
If you let a trash fraud like me in your car, it might stink up your car.

455
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,090
Dae Beom, I'm sorry.

456
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:13,570
I misunderstood. I'm so sorry.

457
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:19,200
I came here to say I'm sorry, to apologize.

458
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,830
So, please don't scare me like this.

459
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:36,090
Dae Beom, let's get back together.

460
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:40,000
What? Get back together?

461
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,920
This is ridiculous.

462
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:48,820
Did you come all the way here because you don't remember why we broke up?

463
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,220
You threw me out like a piece of garbage.

464
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:56,320
Don't you remember how your family treated us? What makes your family so great?

465
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,940
Did you think I would say "yes" if you asked me to get back together? Is that why you're here?

466
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,610
Are you playing with my emotions?

467
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:06,320
Dae Beom, I said I'm sorry.

468
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,480
At the time, anyone would have misunderstood.

469
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,600
Your father was our family's driver.

470
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:20,340
I thought your love for me was all a lie.

471
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,980
That's why I was like that.

472
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:27,360
Se Ryun, our love is broken.

473
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:32,970
You broke it. You betrayed me, and I was hurt.

474
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:39,190
And I learned that you and I... Your family and my family cannot mix together as well.

475
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:42,770
Should I list more reasons why we can't be together?

476
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:47,650
Dae Beom, then, let's leave far away abroad.

477
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:48,880
Let's run away.

478
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,360
As long as I have you, I can go anywhere.

479
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:57,110
Why would I leave my parents and this country for you? How can I trust you?

480
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:04,190
Lee Se Ryun, don't come back to me ever again.

481
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:07,600
Did you understand?

482
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,910
Dae Beom. Why are you doing this?

483
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:15,930
I'm sorry. I am!

484
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,800
Don't do this.

485
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:31,230
Lee Se Ryun, don't do this.

486
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,290
And meet someone who is on your level.

487
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:37,600
I'll meet a woman on my level.

488
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:42,110
Dae Beom...

489
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,280
Dae Beom...

490
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,680
What do I do?

491
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:04,150
What a surprise? What brought you here?

492
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:08,980
I had something to talk about with you. I'm not stealing you away from other plans, am I?

493
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,970
It's okay.

494
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:14,950
CEO Anna, you're not here to complain, are you?

495
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,640
No, I'm not.

496
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:25,450
I came here because of Ms. Park. I thought I should share this with you.

497
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:32,600
About Ms. Park? What is it?

498
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:37,330
Ms. Park's family suddenly had a financial problem, so the family had to split up with no place to go.

499
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:43,290
In that process, there was a conflict with her parents, so she stopped talking to them and had a pretty hard time.

500
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:46,920
Luckily, she got the live-in job at your place and felt relieved,

501
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:51,810
but her father, Mr. Park, was already working there.

502
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:56,510
Then, she should've told me then.

503
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:00,220
The thing is...

504
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:05,650
It was such a ridiculous coincidence that Mr. Park nor Ms. Park could speak up about it.

505
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:08,140
They were worried both of them could get fired if they spoke up.

506
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,280
If they did get fired, they had nowhere to go.

507
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,970
When I heard this, I felt so bad for her.

508
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,190
So, they decided that Ms. Park would stay and her father would quit,

509
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:28,140
but Se Ryun's situation happened before that.

510
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:32,850
He didn't tell you why he was quitting?

511
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:37,530
No. He just said it's a personal reason.

512
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,160
It was wrong of them not to tell you, but I don't think they were trying to deceive you.

513
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:47,980
And after all, she was very good to the kids.

514
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:52,790
Why don't you give Ms. Park another chance?

515
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:57,440
I feel bad after hearing the story.

516
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,850
Even then, what's wrong is wrong.

517
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:03,040
And Ms. Park already quit and left.

518
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,720
Chief Jo reported to me earlier.

519
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,060
What? Already?

520
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:13,260
I can find another good live-in tutor.

521
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,940
Then the kids would soon forget about Ms. Park.

522
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:21,350
So don't worry. Thanks for your concern, Noona.

523
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:25,070
You're welcome.

524
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:37,270
I wanted to be beside Dan Dan.

525
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:40,860
I want to take care of her even if it's late.

526
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,910
What do I do now?

527
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:54,240
Hello, I'm calling about the job on a part-time job website. Did you already find a kitchen assistant?

528
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,020
Yes, of course! From today?

529
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:03,250
Yes, yes. I'll be there by five. Thank you so much.

530
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:12,870
What is this? I hope it's not a call canceling the part-time job.

531
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,590
Yes, hello?

532
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:19,610
Ms. Park. It's me, Anna Kim.

533
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:23,560
CEO, why did you call me?

534
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:27,190
Right now?

535
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,240
Were you surprised because I called you?

536
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,060
Yes. A little.

537
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:40,000
Ms. Park, do you know that I'll be opening a store in Seoul soon?

538
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,110
Yes, I know about that.

539
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:46,440
Then, let me speak straightforwardly.

540
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:52,420
Ms. Park, why don't you work with me?

541
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,460
Me?

542
00:41:55,910 --> 00:42:01,090
We'd have to decide the specific department later on, but it's a full-time position, not a temporary position.

543
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:05,390
So the salary will be competitive too. Oh, right.

544
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:08,800
Our company also provide housing for our employees.

545
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,660
Isn't it a pretty good deal?

546
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:17,760
Really? It's an amazing deal.

547
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:23,970
But, why would you give me such a good position?

548
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:29,270
I don't just hire anyone. I hire people who are passionate and have grit.

549
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:34,740
I thought you were a perfect candidate after watching you take care of Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong.

550
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:39,210
To be honest, seven, twelve, and fourteen years olds are quite far apart in age,

551
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:44,620
and they have such different personalities. Not everyone can take care of those kids.

552
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:53,250
Thank you for seeing me in such a good light and for the unexpected offer as well.

553
00:42:53,250 --> 00:43:00,210
But I feel like I only showed you my weak and bad side.

554
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,100
Ms. Park.

555
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:09,250
I also had a rough time growing up because I was poor.

556
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:14,940
I felt defeated, made mistakes, regretted many times.

557
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:18,130
I even...

558
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:26,090
I even did a wrong that would send me to hell when I die.

559
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:28,940
Did you?

560
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:34,530
Well, how about this then?

561
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:39,190
If you're still feeling down, take a day or two and let me know.

562
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:42,740
We still have some time until the opening.

563
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,840
Yes, I'll think about it.

564
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,160
Thank you so much.

565
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,130
Then, save my phone number.

566
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,120
Okay.

567
00:43:55,610 --> 00:44:02,010
By the way, where are you sleeping tonight? Are you going back home?

568
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:08,170
No, I'm staying at a friend's house for a while.

569
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:16,170
Why? Are you in a hurry? If you aren't, would you like to eat with me before you go?

570
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:21,380
I have to go to a part-time job. I'm sorry, but I have to head out first.

571
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,430
Okay, then. Go ahead.

572
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:26,900
I'm sorry.

573
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:37,020
I wanted to feed her something tasty with the excuse of having a meal together.

574
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:41,620
No, I can do everything for her now.

575
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:46,630
I'll do everything for her from now on.

576
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:53,180
I think this place is a bit tiny. Isn't there somewhere bigger and cleaner even if it's more expensive?

577
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:56,500
Well, a bigger place? Yes, of course.

578
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,140
Then, let me see a place where a person can move in even tomorrow.

579
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:02,220
Okay, let's go.

580
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:07,990
Goodbye.

581
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:12,060
Se Jong.

582
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,860
Why are you here?

583
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:19,350
Where's Ms. Park?

584
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:24,310
Se Jong, starting today, Ms. Park won't come.

585
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:26,460
Why?

586
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:31,160
Se Jong, let's sit over there for a moment.

587
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:39,550
Se Jong, Ms. Park got a better job somewhere else.

588
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:43,150
So, she decided not to work at our house anymore.

589
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:48,550
Don't lie to me. She promised to stay with me for a long, long time.

590
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:51,090
So please bring her back.

591
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:57,700
Se Jong, I'll always be with you from now on, so don't worry.

592
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:04,470
No. I like Ms. Park. I don't need you, Chief Jo.

593
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,940
Se Jong!

594
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:13,800
Ms. Park. Ms. Park!

595
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,140
Ms. Park! Ms. Park!

596
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:20,420
Poor Se Jong.

597
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:24,610
Se Jong! Se Jong!

598
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:27,400
Ms. Park. Ms. Park!

599
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,360
Se Jong!

600
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:34,090
Ms. Park! Ms. Park!

601
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:38,190
Se Jong, Ms. Park isn't here anymore.

602
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:41,920
Ajumma, is it true?

603
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,810
Is Ms. Park really gone?

604
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:49,720
Se Jong, there will be a better tutor soon.

605
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:55,260
No, I don't want that. I want Ms. Park to come back.

606
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,870
Get her back...

607
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:02,570
Poor boy. What should we do?

608
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:09,500
Ms. Park...

609
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,280
[Baby Gentleman Se Jong]

610
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,800
The Chairman said not to keep in touch with the kids.

611
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,030
He said not to answer even if they call you.

612
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:39,770
[Baby Gentleman Se Jong]

613
00:47:56,510 --> 00:48:01,140
The person you dialed is not available. Leave a message after--

614
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:40,270
Noona, I found a weird letter!

615
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:42,930
Did our teacher really resign?

616
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:45,210
Did you get the same letter?

617
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:49,160
What? Did our teacher really leave?

618
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:53,060
Does Se Jong know about this as well? Where's Se Jong?

619
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:59,450
Se Jong's not here!

620
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:02,630
Chief Jo, where's Se Jong?

621
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:04,450
Isn't Se Jong in his room?

622
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:07,110
He's not here! Se Jong's gone!

623
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,330
What?

624
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,710
It's me.

625
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,840
What? Se Jong disappeared?

626
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,630
- Se Jong!
- Lee Se Jong!

627
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:26,030
Se Jong!

628
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,710
Se Jong!

629
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:30,440
Lee Se Jong!

00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,220

631
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,050
Lee Se Jong!

632
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:37,520
- Where are you!
- Where did you go?

633
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,870

00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:42,830

00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:45,290
Lee Se Jong!

636
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,630
Yes, hello?

637
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:53,560
What? The police station?

638
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:01,420
Se Jong.

639
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,810
Se Jong.

640
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:14,820
Where did you go? Do you know how much I worried about you?

641
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:17,270
I'm sorry.

642
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:20,260
I'm okay, Dad.

643
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:29,980
Se Jong, are you really okay?

644
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:33,610
Did you get hurt anywhere? Are you not aching?

645
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:40,390
Are you his father?

646
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:41,750
Yes.

647
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:45,980
Thank you for finding our Se Jong.

648
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:51,280
We could find him quickly because someone reported that a child was crying in Bongcheon-dong.

649
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,500
Bongcheon-dong?

650
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:59,030
Se Jong. Why did you go there?

651
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:01,810
I went there to look for Ms. Park.

652
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:06,460
Ms. Park said she lives in Bongcheon-dong last time.

653
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:09,490
Hey, Lee Se Jong, you could have just called her!

654
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:13,030
Why would you go all the way there? Are you an idiot?

655
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:17,020
She's not picking up my calls.

656
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:24,780
You idiot. You thought you could meet Ms. Park by going there?

657
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:27,680
Is the entire Bongcheon-dong our teacher's house?

658
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:31,760
Dad. Is our teacher really not coming back?

659
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,180
Dad! Tell our teacher to come back!

660
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:39,800
Tell her to come back!

661
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:45,980
Tell her to come back!

662
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:53,410
Dad will explain everything to you when we get home.

663
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:57,470
It's good that you're okay, Se Jong.

664
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:12,550
She resigned because of personal matters.

665
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:16,030
I'll find a better teacher for you guys as quickly as possible,

666
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:18,350
so just wait. Okay?

667
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:22,390
Is that your explanation for why our teacher resigned?

668
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:25,140
I don't want another teacher!

669
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:30,990
She said she'd stay with me for a long, long time!

670
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:37,680
But how can she leave without telling me!

671
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:48,410
Dad, I think you were really unfair this time!

672
00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:00,200
Dad, I'm 14 now and in middle school.

673
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:06,720
You need to tell me an explanation I can accept, even if you can't say to Se Jong and Se Chan.

674
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:11,680
Our teacher isn't the kind of person to leave us irresponsibly.

675
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,070
What's the reason?

676
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:19,240
Jenny. This is an adult matter.

677
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:23,890
To adults, there are reasons that can't be explained sometimes.

678
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:28,380
She had an inexplicable personal reason, so just leave it at that.

679
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:34,160
An adults' matter? Is that why you fired her without telling us?

680
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,780
- Jenny.
- Then since you ignored me and did whatever you wanted to do,

681
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:41,490
I'll live however I want to, so you just leave it at that!

682
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:45,320
How can you fire the teacher that we all liked?

683
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:05,960
Thank you! Have a nice day!

684
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,060
Excuse me, Mr. Cha Geon.

685
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:10,540
- Yes?
- Let's talk for a moment.

686
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:12,360
- Me?
- Yes.

687
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,010
Come here.

688
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:15,870
What? Okay.

689
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:19,840
Mr. Cha Geon! Have another drink.

690
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,270
Oh, it's empty! Let me get another bottle--

691
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:27,750
Boss, boss! You're very drunk. Let's end it here today.

692
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:30,290
You need to work tomorrow.

693
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:35,520
Mr. Cha Geon, are you worrying about me?

694
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,030
In case I get drunk?

695
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:39,030
I'm sorry?

696
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:45,190
Yes! You might suffer from a hangover.

697
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:47,170
Sweetie.

698
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:51,420
I got divorced.

699
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:54,900
- I live by myself.
- Aigo...

700
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,630
You must have had a hard time.

701
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:01,340
You know my apartment back there, right?

702
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,150
Yes, I do.

703
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:07,320
I have a 50-pyung apartment there.

704
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:10,850
It's under my name.

705
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:12,920
Wow, that's amazing!

706
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,830
Boss, you've really succeeded at a young age.

707
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:21,910
That apartment... You and I...

708
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:25,650
We can own it together!

709
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:28,140
I usually don't feel hot.

710
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:30,390
But it's so hot today.

711
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:34,720
Just a moment. Oh, it's hot.

712
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,900
Oh, it's hot.

713
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:40,520
Boss! I'll get going first.

714
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,580
- Goodnight!
- Where are you going?

715
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:46,590
You promised to drink another bottle with me!

716
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:50,650
That's... that's, what was it?

717
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:52,540
I have an ancestral rite!

718
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:55,810
Why do you have an ancestral rite all of a sudden?

719
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,530
Those things just happen out of nowhere!

720
00:55:57,530 --> 00:56:00,130
Goodnight, I'm sorry!

721
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:01,550
Wait, oh my!

722
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:04,180
Wait, Mr. Cha Geon!

723
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:06,040
Wait!

724
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:13,030
It almost got out of hand!

725
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:17,360
I'm still a bachelor! A bachelor!

726
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:21,440
The world is so scary! What a minefield!

727
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,630
How can she touch me? It's crazy!

728
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:30,970
Yes, Dae Beom.

729
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,790
What? Where?

730
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,680
Welcome.

731
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:46,930
Hey, what are you doing here?

732
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:50,130
Have a drink, Uncle.

733
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:54,160
Sure. I need a drink today, too.

734
00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:01,660
Uncle. Let's start a business together.

735
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:05,280
What? Business?

736
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:10,960
How can you talk about doing business again after ruining it multiple times?

737
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,420
Uncle. I'm going to succeed.

738
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:17,060
I'm going to be rich, no matter what.

739
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:20,920
I don't think I can die in peace otherwise.

740
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,800
I can't just live like this.

741
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:31,710
I'm sick of running a business.

742
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:36,340
Even if it's small, I want to live on a wage now.

743
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:40,720
Uncle, are you serious? Has your life perspective changed?

744
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:45,900
But that's hard too.

745
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,780
Uncle, you said you were going to make money and buy my dad a house.

746
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:53,140
When are you going to buy him a house if you're getting paychecks? Do you think it'll be possible?

747
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,300
Hey, they say many drops make a shower.

748
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:58,650
You save the money from your paycheck and buy a house. Do you think the house will just drop out of the sky?

749
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:03,850
Uncle. Then work under me. I'll pay you wages.

750
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:12,780
You are very confident.

751
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,980
What is it? Do you have a good item?

752
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:18,930
Are you going to do it or not?

753
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,240
Sure. Fine.

754
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:31,270
I'd rather work under you than work under that weird ajumma.

755
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:34,320
I will kill you if you don't pay my wages.

756
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,830
Of course!

757
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:39,750
Then, let's try it, okay, Uncle?

758
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:44,270
Yes, Boss.

759
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:47,910
Ta-da!

760
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:52,070
It's disgusting!

761
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:54,640
Hey! Mi Rim, what are you doing here?

762
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,380
I came in because I thought you and Uncle would be here.

763
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,810
Hey, since you're here, join us.

764
00:58:59,810 --> 00:59:01,660
No, you hold a glass there since we're in a rush.

765
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:02,800
Wait, she shouldn't drink.

766
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,150
Excuse me! Please put her away.

767
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:08,040
- What are you saying?
- One more bottle here, please!

768
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:17,450
In a few days, he wouldn't think about Ms. Park, right?

769
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:20,730
He'll forget soon since he's young.

770
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:25,480
From now on, I won't get a live-in tutor, and I'll take care of everything.

771
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,880
I'll do everything on my own.

772
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:39,350
Why is he so feverish?

773
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:44,200
Chairman, there's a problem!

774
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,990
Se Jong has a fever. He's burning right now!

775
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:49,220
What?

776
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,840
He doesn't need to go to the emergency room.

777
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:59,230
I gave him a fever remedy just now, so his fever should come down soon.

778
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:03,390
If there are any other problems, call me right away.

779
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:07,630
Thank you, Dr. Kim.

780
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:11,590
Chief Jo, tell Driver Kang to be ready.

781
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:13,670
Yes, Chairman.

782
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,020
Mr. Kang, take good care of Dr. Kim.

783
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:19,990
Yes, sir.

784
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:34,200
How's his fever?

785
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,850
Yes. It's a lot lower now.

786
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:40,120
I think he'll be okay now.

787
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:44,090
His fever is gone. So go ahead and go home, Chief Jo.

788
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:46,070
Thank you for your hard work today.

789
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:50,730
It's okay, Chairman. You are the one who has to work tomorrow.

790
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:55,070
Why don't you go downstairs and rest? I'll keep him company today.

791
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:13,620
My child and the Chairman,

792
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:18,870
and me. I wish this moment would last forever.

793
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:26,020
Chief Jo. I will stay here tonight.

794
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:27,880
Okay, I understand.

795
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:31,520
I'll bring a cup of tea then.

796
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:39,140
Chief Jo, are you still here?

797
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:43,390
I think I have to stay over tonight, because of Se Jong.

798
01:01:43,390 --> 01:01:49,190
Chief Jo, you're working so hard without going home.

799
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:53,000
Are the kids not asleep yet?

800
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,040
No, I'm getting these for the Chairman.

801
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:01,700
He didn't even get to have dinner because of Se Jong.

802
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:05,710
Chief Jo, you are working so hard!

803
01:02:05,710 --> 01:02:08,260
Thank you so much.

804
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:11,210
No problem. It's my job.

805
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:16,520
No, it's not. This family would be lost without you since there's no young madam.

806
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:20,700
Go, go. The tea will get cold. Take it to Chairman Lee.

807
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:23,410
Madam, don't worry and you should go to bed.

808
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:25,270
Of course.

809
01:02:25,270 --> 01:02:27,960
Yes, there you go.

810
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:36,590
Chief Jo, maybe she's into Youg Gook.

811
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:43,210
Yes. If not, she wouldn't put her heart into it so much.

812
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:50,050
I think Chief Jo is perfect for this family. Perfect!

813
01:02:56,370 --> 01:03:02,010
It was such a ridiculous coincidence that Mr. Park nor Ms. Park could speak up about it.

814
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:04,480
They were worried both of them could get fired if they spoke up.

815
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,490
If they did get fired, they had nowhere to go.

816
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:11,970
When I heard this, I felt so bad for her.

817
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:17,180
I can't tell you everything about my situation, but by the time I got hired as an in-home tutor,

818
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:20,720
my dad was already working here.

819
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,420
It was truly a coincidence!

820
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:34,390
Dad.

821
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:39,780
Se Jong, are you okay?

822
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:44,880
Can't you tell Ms. Park to come back?

823
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:50,150
I miss her so much.

824
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:54,280
Se Jong, Ms. Park is now--

825
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:58,060
Ms. Park made a promise to me.

826
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:04,260
That until I grew up as much as my older brother, she would stay next to me.

827
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:09,120
I still have a long time to grow up as much as my older brother.

828
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:13,990
Dad, please bring Ms. Park back.

829
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:18,630
I don't even want Christmas presents anymore.

830
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:26,030
My wish is for Ms. Park to be here with me.

831
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:34,690
Ms. Park...

832
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:36,590
Okay, Se Jong.

833
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:39,930
I'll bring her back.

834
01:04:39,930 --> 01:04:43,460
Really?

835
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:47,610
Of course. I'll bring Ms. Park back,

836
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:51,070
so just close your eyes and go to sleep.

837
01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:55,690
If Ms. Park saw you sick, she'd be so sad.

838
01:04:55,690 --> 01:05:00,410
Dad, you promise me, right?

839
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:04,460
If I close my eyes and go to sleep,

840
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:08,460
you'll bring back Ms. Park, right?

841
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:12,230
Of course. I'll go get her.

842
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:15,470
Now, close your eyes and go to sleep.

843
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,090
Chairman, are you going somewhere?

844
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:36,680
Chief Jo, would you keep Se Jong company?

845
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:39,370
I have to go somewhere.

846
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:47,770
Where is he going in the middle of the night?

847
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:12,310
Hello?

848
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:16,290
Isn't this Park Dan Dan's phone?

849
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:19,230
Yes, it is. But she's working right now.

850
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:23,480
If she can't answer the phone, you could just leave it alone. Why are you calling so much? We are so busy!

851
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,120
Where is this?

852
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:46,290
My goodness! Is this all you washed until now?!

853
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,350
Pick up the pace!

854
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:50,420
Okay.

855
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:06,410
Chairman! Kids have their own pains and their own emotions!

856
01:07:06,410 --> 01:07:11,580
You might be an adult, but the kids have lost their mother!

857
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:14,180
But how could you act as you wish, Chairman?

858
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:19,100
I feel so bad for the kids and...

859
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:21,510
♫  I couldn't hold her and just trembled my heart  ♫

860
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:23,850
Lee Se Jong.

861

♫ My unforgettable love ♫

867
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:04,060
Welcome!

868
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:07,360
I'm the person who called earlier. Where is Park Dan Dan?

869
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:10,330
I came because you said she was here.

870
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:12,590
Ah, the part-timer?

871
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:17,230
Go over there, in the back.

872
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:24,400
♫ But love always runs away, chased by longing ♫

♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

874
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:45,660
Ms. Park, what are you doing here!

875
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:48,170
Chairman!

876
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:52,110
♫ Why do you run away, love ♫

877
01:08:52,110 --> 01:08:55,950
♫  Like a shy child  ♫

878
01:08:55,950 --> 01:09:02,550
♫ In case I lose it I hold it tight ♫

879
01:09:02,550 --> 01:09:09,810
♫ But love always runs away, chased by longing ♫

880
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:16,650
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

881
01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:24,940
♫ I have to abandon the longing and the grieves ♫

882
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:28,300
[Young Lady and Gentleman]

883
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:31,310
Ms. Park, where are you? Why aren't you coming back?

884
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:32,540
It's just... Se Jong.

885
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:34,670
Ms. Park, come back to my house.

886
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:37,410
Ms. Park, that little minx, came back!

887
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:38,540
Park Dae Beom!

888
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:40,870
How could you! How could you dump me?

889
01:09:40,870 --> 01:09:42,060
Se Ryun!

890
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:45,330
Your daughter is drunk and passed out at our house right now!

891
01:09:45,330 --> 01:09:48,440
Where do you think you are? Wake up!

892
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,840
Mr. Park, what are you doing here?

893
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:53,190
I'm starting work as a security guard here tomorrow.

894
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:56,500
When you go to the summer house, leave the kids to Ms. Park,

895
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:57,990
and you two make a history.

896
01:09:57,990 --> 01:09:59,390
Yes, Madam.

897
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:03,900
Dad, Ms. Park went to go find a phone, but she's still not back.

898
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:05,010
What are you talking about?

899
01:10:05,010 --> 01:10:07,270
Ms. Park! Park Dan Dan!

900
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:08,920
Chairman!
