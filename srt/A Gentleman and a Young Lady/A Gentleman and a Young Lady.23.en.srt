00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,620
[Episode 23]

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:06,610
I have to save my naive Ms. Park Noona.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:11,770
He definitely forced her in when she didn't want to go.

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,230
Chairman?

5
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,780
Do you know him?

6
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,330
Ah...

7
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,210
Is this not the place?

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,100
Ah, I must have gotten off on the wrong floor.

9
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,180
Ms. Park Noona, you must be having a gathering.

10
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,810
Then, have fun.

11
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,310
Where am I?

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,130
Who is that?

13
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:56,150
It's nothing. Excuse me for a second.

14
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:02,020
Chairman. Chairman!

15
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,520
Chairman! Chairman!

16
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,170
Chairman! Chairman!

17
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,140
Chairman!

18
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,710
What is it, Ms. Park Noona?

19
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,940
Chairman, what are you doing here?

20
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,970
That's, well, the reason I'm here is...

21
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,740
Ah! I have a plan with Lawyer Koh.

22
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,970
But I was thinking about something else, and I took a wrong turn,

23
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,490
and as I was going back thinking I came to the wrong place,

24
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,440
that's when I saw you.

25
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,530
It's a coincidence that I saw you. A coincidence.

26
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,180
How is it possible to see you here?

27
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,120
Isn't it strange?

28
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,500
Ah... yes.

29
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,960
But Chairman, what is that?

30
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,290
This?

31
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,780
This is... On my way here,

32
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,920
I saw people selling this on the street.

33
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,690
I thought Se Jong would like it, so I bought one.

34
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,070
Don't you think Se Jong will like this?

35
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,410
Yes...

36
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,920
Then, I'll get going to see Lawyer Koh.

37
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,240
I'll see you at the house later.

38
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,170
What's going on?

39
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,440
How is it possible to run into each other here?

40
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,220
Lee Young Gook, what are you doing?

41
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,520
I think I have feelings for Ms. Park Noona.

42
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,160
Hey, Lee Young Gook. Get a hold of yourself.

43
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,950
You have someone you're getting engaged in a few days. How could you like someone else?

44
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,130
You hated it so much when your father did it, and now you're going to do the same?

45
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,140
Get a hold of yourself, Lee Young Gook!

46
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:02,210
That's right. I will never become someone like that.

47
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:07,070
From now on, I won't pay any attention to Ms. Park Noona.

48
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,810
I won't even look at her.

49
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,780
Here.

50
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,170
What is all this?

51
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,770
Are you here to check on Sarah?

52
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:26,210
Yes. I heard Chief Jo Noona had an upset stomach

53
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,700
and couldn't come to work. So I was worried.

54
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,850
That's so sweet of you.

55
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,440
But Sarah doesn't just have an upset stomach,

56
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,910
but food poisoning.

57
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,320
Food poisoning?

58
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,770
But she went to the hospital and got medicine and a shot,

59
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,770
so she feels much better. Go on in.

60
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,570
Hey, Sarah! Chairman Lee is here!

61
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,000
Sarah!

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,490
- Why don't you go inside now?
- Yes.

63
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,100
The flowers are so pretty.

64
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,180
Thank you.

65
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,290
I thought you had an upset stomach.

66
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,230
But I heard it was food poisoning.

67
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,200
If you were in this much pain, you should have told me.

68
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,600
You had to attend Se Jong's sports day.

69
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,040
I felt that telling you would get in the way.

70
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,840
That's why. And I had no idea.

71
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,120
How are you now? Do you really feel better?

72
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,110
Chairman, did you worry about me?

73
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,460
Is that why you ran here?

74
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,390
Of course, I was worried.

75
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,900
It was bad enough for you not to come to work.

76
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:48,440
I'm fine now. I'll come to work tomorrow.

77
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,550
Okay. Then let's try to recover my memory back starting tomorrow.

78
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,150
Yes, Chairman.

79
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,370
Are you leaving?

80
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,350
Yes, I'll get going now.

81
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,840
Why don't you eat before you leave?

82
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,380
Lee Young Gook, you did well.

83
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,870
You should put your heart into trying to like Chief Jo Noona.

84
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,400
That way, your memories can return faster.

85
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:34,840
Hey! How dare you come here? Get out, now!

86
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,940
Ajumma, what are you doing to the person I've hired? Who do you think you are?

87
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,180
- It's not like that.
- Get into your room, now.

88
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,350
- You need to hear me, Young Gook--
- Get into your room, now!

89
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:53,850
Do I have to stay in this house putting up with this?

90
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,810
Fine, I'll leave this house.

91
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,670
I've lost all affection for this house as well.

92
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:04,750
It's not like I have nowhere to live beside this house.

93
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,520
Starting today, my connection with this household is over.

94
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,710
It's so humiliating--

95
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,590
Wait a minute.

96
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,480
I can't just leave.

97
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,520
My gold bars and money.

98
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,530
I have to take them with me. Of course!

99
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,700
It wasn't the old man's birthday the last time,

100
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,410
so it should be Young Gook's birthday.

101
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,360
It's not. Then, Jenny's mom.

102
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,930
Alright, then.

103
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,950
Is it the firstborn's birthday? Jenny's.

104
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,860
It's not that either.

105
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,420
That's right. The first son, Se Chan's, it is.

106
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,700
- Oh! What is it?
 - What's going on?

107
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,560
What's this noise?

108
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,540
Seriously!

109
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,660
Ajumma.

110
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,920
Ajumma, what are you doing right now?

111
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,810
Did you try to get into my safe?

112
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,260
It's good that you're here now.

113
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,550
Open your safe right now.

114
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,590
- What?
- You don't want to see me, right?

115
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:32,620
I hate you too. I don't want to see you as well.

116
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,840
Therefore I will leave, so open the safe.

117
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,780
My gold bars and money, give them back right now.

118
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,780
This Ajumma, seriously.

119
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,090
What are you keep talking about it?

120
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,350
You took my stuff and locked them in there!

121
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,320
So open the safe!

122
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,870
Fine, whatever. I'll open the safe.

123
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,790
But what will you do if it's not in there?

124
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,860
I said I would leave now.

125
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,190
I'll disappear forever from you.

126
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,540
So open it right now!

127
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,760
Okay. I got it.

128
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,450
You just promised me.

129
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,760
Yes, sure. I already packed everything.

130
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:16,650
I have no regret leaving this house at all!

131
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,280
Here, look.

132
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,380
My pretties, my babies—

133
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,760
What is this? What happened?

134
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,700
My pretties. My gold bars!

135
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,450
My money. Where did my money go?

136
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,910
Where did it all go?

137
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,210
Did you really not take them?

138
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:45,770
Ajumma, as you promised, leave right now. Right at this moment.

139
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:49,730
I can't live in the same house as you anymore.

140
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:58,760
My money, my diamonds. Where did they go?

141
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,220
Where did my money and diamonds go?

142
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,480
Madam, are you really leaving like this?

143
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,530
What are you going to do?

144
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:10,120
Are you the one that took my gold?

145
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,090
Madam, why are you being like this?

146
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:17,180
I didn't even know that you had those things in your safe.

147
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:22,080
Oh my. Did her dementia come back?

148
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,860
That's right. It must be Ms. Park. Right, Mrs. Yeoju?

149
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,480
Madam, get a hold of yourself!

150
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,460
I've been here for over eight years and didn't know what you had in your safe.

151
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,830
How would Ms. Park know?

152
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,530
Then what happened?

153
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,740
Where did it all go? What happened?

154
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,960
I'm getting chased out of this house.

155
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,800
Madam, you have all this luggage. Why don't you let Driver Cha drive for you?

156
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,140
Mrs. Yeoju!

157
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,900
Do you think I could get a ride with someone responsible for getting me kicked out of here today?

158
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,020
Call a taxi. A taxi!

159
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,800
My money...

160
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,110
- Hey!
- Gi Ja.

161
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,860
Chief Jo.

162
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,020
I just...

163
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,920
Oh, no! Dae Ran!

164
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,500
Mrs. Wang!

165
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,650
What should we do? Mrs. Wang!

166
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,570
Oh, no!

167
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,370
Madam.

168
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:21,200
Dae Ran, Dae Ran.

169
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,920
What should we do?

170
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,760
Are you saying those were not in the Chairman's safe?

171
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,980
No...

172
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,420
There was not a single gold bar.

173
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:39,780
It sounds like Chairman Lee didn't take your gold bars and money.

174
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,180
You should report to the police now.

175
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,180
Police?

176
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,220
Oh dear, what do I do?

177
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,210
I will call the police, Madam.

178
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,600
No, no. Wait, Cheif Jo!

179
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,640
No, no, don't call the police.

180
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,980
Why? If it was stolen, we have to catch the thief.

181
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,860
Yes, the technology is good these days, so they catch them quickly.

182
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,510
But I'm sure Young Gook took that away to torture me.

183
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:13,510
But if I call the police and find out that he hid it,

184
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:17,360
it will make the news, and how embarrassing would that be?

185
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,360
My daughter is not even married yet.

186
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,190
That's right.

187
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,320
We can't have the police come and go in front of the children.

188
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,390
That's not right.

189
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:34,940
Besides, the Chairman's memory loss has to stay secret too.

190
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,720
You've got the point there.

191
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,060
But, Mrs. Wang, do you really think Chairman Lee did it?

192
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,530
Yes.

193
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:48,600
I'm sure Young Gook did it to take revenge on me.

194
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,160
This is how the mistress's life ends.

195
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,680
She gets revenged by the wife's son.

196
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,940
So why did you break up a family?

197
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,000
Oh, thank goodness.

198
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,710
Mother and father, thank you!

199
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,910
The gold bar is one thing,

200
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,450
but I can't forgive Young Gook, that bastard.

201
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,870
In front of that driver from the parasite family,

202
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,560
how could he humiliate me like that?

203
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,980
I just want to die out of embarrassment!

204
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,540
Madam, don't worry.

205
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,020
I will ask the driver to resign as soon as I get to work tomorrow.

206
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:32,970
Also, I'll talk well to the Chairman and ask him to console you.

207
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,450
So why don't you rest tonight first?

208
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,220
My heart is beating like crazy.

209
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,860
And my hands are shaking, look!

210
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,780
It's so unfair and upsetting!

211
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,850
It's so unfair to me...

212
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,450
Mrs. Wang!

213
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,530
Gi Ja, do you have any Cheongsimhwan?

214
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,110
I will go and buy some.

215
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,940
Please, calm down.

216
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,400
- I'm shaking. Look at me.
- Please, calm down.

217
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,100
I see you here again, Sokcho Night Beach lady.

218
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,420
Why did you go to a pharmacy?

219
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,690
You don't look okay.

220
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,300
Are you not feeling well?

221
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,550
Ajussi.

222
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,750
I told you don't say hello to me.

223
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,500
Look here, Sokcho Night Beach lady.

224
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,630
You are really selfish.

225
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:38,000
You call me when you need me. Then you say to ignore you.

226
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,900
Okay.

227
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:44,100
I will not say hello to you from now on.

228
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,470
I will delete your phone number as well.

229
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,050
So don't ever call me again.

230
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,900
Father.

231
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,840
What brings you here?

232
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,730
Have you been staying at this hotel all this time?

233
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,510
Yes. But Se Ryun and I are moving into an apartment.

234
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,470
Did something happen at home?

235
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:36,650
Return this money to Ms. Se Ryun.

236
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:40,690
I gave that money to my mom to spend.

237
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,360
Just spend it, please.

238
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:48,530
Did you earn this money?

239
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,240
It's money you can spend.

240
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,840
Se Ryun's money is my money now.

241
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,890
What did you say?

242
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:02,430
Did you say that with a sane mind?

243
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,860
How can you say such a thing with a straight face?

244
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,960
Get yourself together!

245
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,780
If you don't want to spend that money, give it to me.

246
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,060
I will go now.

247
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,220
Why are you acting like this?

248
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,980
You are not this kind of person.

249
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:26,820
What kind of person am I?

250
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,110
Dae Beom.

251
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,960
I think you're acting like this

252
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,210
because you're disappointed with how the food truck business turned out.

253
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:46,230
But why don't you get yourself together and restart with me?

254
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,560
The chicken place is opening tomorrow. You, me, and your mom,

255
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,850
three of us, let's do our best.

256
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:57,210
Dae Beom. It's in a good spot, so if we work hard, we'll do well.

257
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,650
I don't want to live like that anymore, Father.

258
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,990
What?

259
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:06,360
You've made no progress no matter how hard you work.

260
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,740
There is no way for us to get out of the swamp of poverty.

261
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,740
And you want me to live like you?

262
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,510
I can wear nice things and live luxuriously without doing anything.

263
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:19,580
Why do I have to live the way you are?

264
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,320
Dae Beom.

265
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,410
All the things you have now are fake.

266
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,150
Even if you have a seat at the table,

267
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,880
eating in someone else's home is still not yours.

268
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,420
I can't tolerate you being ill-teated in someone else's house.

269
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,470
Father. Even so, I'm the one who'll tolerate it.

270
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,300
Please leave me alone to live like this.

271
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,440
What have you done for me to say these things?

272
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,580
Dae Beom.

273
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:53,200
Rather than living a pathetic life with you,

274
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,170
I'd rather eat a feast at a stranger's house even if I get ill-treated.

275
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,860
Who are you to stop me from living a life I want?

276
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,180
I'm not even your real son!

277
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,850
What did you say?

278
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,770
Dae Beom!

279
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,440
Still, please come home whenever you want to.

280
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,340
Did you hear me?

281
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,650
Baby, why did you come back already?

282
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,600
I thought you would have dinner with your father.

283
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,900
He just left.

284
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,830
Why? Did something happen?

285
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,190
What did he say?

286
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,760
Why did he come here?

287
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,140
He didn't want to accept the money.

288
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,500
Why? I gave it to him because I wanted to.

289
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:11,270
It's a lot of money out of nowhere, so I think he felt uncomfortable.

290
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,740
Right, I see how that could be.

291
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,330
It's not like we are married.

292
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:22,620
Maybe he's still angry about the way my mom treated him.

293
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,070
That's not it.

294
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,070
Baby. Things are a little awkward at the moment.

295
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:38,420
But when time passes, everything will feel more natural.

296
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,010
So don't worry.

297
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,210
- I will go wash up.
- Okay.

298
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,750
Oh, Honey. Did you see Dae Beom?

299
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,720
Did you really give him the money back?

300
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,530
I did.

301
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,360
Really?

302
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,200
Did you throw it to him even though he said he didn't want it?

303
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,090
I'm sure he didn't throw it but gave it back nicely.

304
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:48,080
What's wrong with us spending that money? Dae Beom gave it to us, thinking of us.

305
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,050
You must have upset him.

306
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,290
Do not feel attached to that money.

307
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:57,150
- It's not something we can spend.
- Who said I feel attached to it?

308
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:01,410
It's not right to reject the money your children give you in the thought of you.

309
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,810
That makes them feel terrible.

310
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:07,560
Listen to me, my dear. Money has eyes too.

311
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,040
Money is not all the same.

312
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,480
Accepting any money will get you into trouble later.

313
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,740
Don't you watch the news?

314
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,630
I don't know.

315
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:26,020
You did the right thing. But why didn't you bring Dae Beom home with you?

316
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:29,870
He will come back home soon, I am sure.

317
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:34,280
I'm worried. He should come home soon.

318
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,740
What if the girl changes her mind?

319
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,330
It'll be all over, overnight.

320
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:43,890
Why does Dae Beom not understand that?

321
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:48,940
If he were a woman, he could get pregnant and force the situation.

322
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,820
He can't be a mistress as a man either.

323
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,750
What are you saying, Mom?

324
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,180
Are you saying my Dae Beom is a mistress to that girl?

325
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:01,380
How can you say things like that?

326
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,860
I'm worried since tomorrow is the opening day.

327
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,630
You can fry the chicken, and I can do the side dishes.

328
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:15,790
Yeon Sil and Mi Rim can do the serving.

329
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:20,200
But if Mi Rim goes to her class, Yeon Sil has to do it all herself.

330
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,030
Wouldn't it be great to have Dae Beom too?

331
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:28,100
Geon can't be there too because of the live-in driver job.

332
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,030
Don't worry, Mother-in-law. We can do it when we face it.

333
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,200
It's not a big store as well.

334
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,300
I know it's Ms. Park Noona's day off, but it's getting late.

335
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,790
What is she doing at this hour at where?

336
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,270
Chairman..?

337
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,990
How could I've done such a dumb thing?

338
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,900
That's so embarrassing.

339
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:08,800
She won't ask me for details on why I went to that hotel, will she?

340
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:29,240
I'm home.

341
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,200
Okay. Please go in and rest.

342
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,500
Is that because I came home late?

343
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,740
It's not that late.

344
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:54,180
I think I can't live with her in the same house.

345
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,670
I wait for her without knowing.

346
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,900
I want to see her all the time.

347
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:04,280
It's not something I can control with my will at all.

348
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,720
Right, there is only one way.

349
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,490
I must ask her to quit her job.

350
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:16,470
Ms. Park Noona wanted to quit this job too.

351
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,880
Chairman.

352
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:44,410
Do you have something to tell me?

353
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:48,080
No. I had something to tell you,

354
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,650
but it's not anything important.

355
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:54,570
I can do it later. Excuse me.

356
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:59,490
Why is he acting like this today?

357
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:02,540
He's being strange.

358
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:15,050
Right. This is not the solution either.

359
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,760
If Ms. Park Noona leaves suddenly,

360
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,290
the kids will cry and wreak havoc again.

361
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:25,440
Right. Her contract ends in five months.

362
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,980
Let's hang on until then. You can do it, Lee Young Gook.

363
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,870
I have enough on my hands with Ms. Park.

364
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:48,390
Why do I have to deal with another family member of hers?

365
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:51,350
It's so annoying.

366
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:55,160
I have to kick Ms. Park's uncle out of here no matter what.

367
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,640
If Madam stays at my house forever,

368
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,240
it will make me exhausting.

369
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,160
Yes, come in.

370
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,120
I mean--

371
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:16,320
Ajussi!

372
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,410
Sokcho Night Beach.

373
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,800
How? Why?

374
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,190
Why are you here?

375
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,900
Me? I was sent here as a driver yesterday.

376
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,170
Why are you here?

377
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,090
No way.

378
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:36,120
You are here as a driver?

379
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,860
Yes.

380
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,480
Oh my, what?

381
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,250
You're just a driving service driver!

382
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,470
Did you come here because of me?

383
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:49,160
Did you dig up my back? Are you crazy?

384
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,250
Look here. How can you say such things?

385
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,710
I put in a resume and got hired in a regular process at FT Group.

386
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:59,970
And the company sent me here for two weeks as a temporary house driver.

387
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,920
I had no idea you were here.

388
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,570
But...

389
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,840
But still,

390
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:14,330
even so, you and I can't be in the same house.

391
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:17,730
Ajussi, please quit the job.

392
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:22,920
Pardon? Listen, aren't you going overboard, Sokcho Night Beach lady?

393
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,760
No matter what anyone says, I got hired fair and square.

394
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,450
Who do you think you are to tell me to quit or not?

395
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,580
You can't do that to me.

396
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,890
Are you saying we can be here together?

397
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:37,960
Does this make sense, Ajussi?

398
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,200
I know what you are worried about.

399
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:47,710
But young lady. Didn't we agree to be strangers?

400
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,290
There should not be any problem then.

401
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,350
How can I be with this guy in the same house?

402
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:57,370
Nonsense. No way.

403
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:03,060
Please don't pretend you know me, and leave now.

404
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,490
What the hell is going on?

405
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,360
Hello, Secretary Yoon?

406
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,620
It's me, Chief Jo.

407
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:35,210
The driver you sent us is not suitable for the Chairman's family.

408
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:38,520
Can you send us someone else?

409
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,690
Yes, thank you.

410
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:51,850
What's going on here? Is this really a coincidence?

411
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:56,350
There's some intention here.

412
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,920
Absolutely.

413
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,120
Telling me to come and then telling me to go. What the...

414
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:16,450
Who's Sokcho Night Beach? How can she kick me out just like that?

415
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:20,920
But is it okay for me not to say goodbye to the Chairman?

416
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,420
Driver Cha?

417
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:28,000
Hyung, where are you going?

418
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,280
I wanted to say goodbye to you.

419
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,070
I am going back to the company.

420
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,740
A new driver will come here.

421
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,790
What?

422
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,870
With who's permission?

423
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:56,180
Did that Ajussi come into this house to avenge me?

424
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,560
That surprised me. Oh?

425
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,260
Chief Jo Noona.

426
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:04,510
Did you call the Secretary's office and ask for a new driver?

427
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,540
That's what Secretary Yoon said. Is that true?

428
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,580
Yes, that is correct.

429
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,280
Why?

430
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,870
What's wrong with Driver Cha?

431
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:15,350
Why did you do it?

432
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:19,310
He lacks experience, and since he has to drive the children.

433
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:22,930
I didn't feel comfortable.

434
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,130
I saw his resume myself.

435
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:30,000
He has over 15 years of driving experience and worked as a driving service driver.

436
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,350
Do you think the company would have hired an inexperienced driver?

437
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,200
Even if that was the case,

438
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:40,300
how can you send away the person who decided to work at my house without asking me first?

439
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,320
Do you think I'm a joke?

440
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,610
No, I didn't.

441
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:50,070
If you replace someone I asked to stay, what does that make me?

442
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:52,650
Even if we are supposed to get engaged,

443
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:56,840
please do not do things without my permission first.

444
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:02,490
Even if we get married, I hope something like this doesn't happen.

445
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:06,420
Yes. I'm sorry, Chairman.

446
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:15,690
How can he act like that to me over a mere driver?

447
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:19,980
What am I going to do? What's the best way?

448
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,850
I can't leave nor feel right to stay.

449
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:31,210
How can something like this happen?

450
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:35,640
How do I run into her here?

451
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,790
Yes.

452
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,450
Did you get the contact from the Secretary's office?

453
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,970
Yes. They told me to stay.

454
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:49,840
By the way, that Sokcho Night Beach-- that's not it.

455
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:55,690
The young woman told me to go back to the company, but the Secretary's office and the Chairman told me to stay.

456
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,970
I don't know what to do.

457
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:00,030
There must have been some misunderstanding.

458
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:03,060
If the Chairman told you to stay, you could stay and work.

459
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,960
I will take care of your meals from now.

460
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,800
Thank you.

461
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,620
But who was that young woman?

462
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,510
Young woman? Do you mean Chief Jo?

463
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,880
She's the butler of the house.

464
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,730
Chief Jo Sarah is in charge of the running of the Chairman's house.

465
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:22,820
Ah, yes. Chief Jo Sarah.

466
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,590
But you have to be careful around her.

467
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:32,440
She will be engaged to the Chairman soon. She may become the madam of the house.

468
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,260
Is she Chairman's fiancée?

469
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,400
Yes, I see.

470
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,650
If you need anything call me on the intercom at any time.

471
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,030
Please don't hesitate.

472
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,610
Yes. Thank you.

473
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:55,810
So the man she said she'd get married was the Chairman?

474
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:58,970
What is going on?

475
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:09,410
It's me. Come out and see me for a second.

476
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:30,180
Please say what you want to say.

477
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:33,820
I'm sorry about earlier.

478
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,830
I apologize.

479
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,100
I was too surprised.

480
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,940
I never imagined that I would see you at the Chairman's house.

481
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:47,260
So I was startled and panicked.

482
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:51,960
Well, yes. I understand how that feels.

483
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,980
I also didn't expect to see you, Sokcho Night Beach--

484
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:01,480
No. I didn't expect to see you here, Chief Jo.

485
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:11,080
Ajussi, about that--

486
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,610
Don't worry.

487
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:19,230
You are someone I do not know.

488
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,210
What about Ms. Park?

489
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,460
Does she know about us?

490
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,250
No, she doesn't.

491
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,370
No one knows.

492
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:33,980
I've never told anyone about you and will not in the future as well.

493
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:39,940
So I want you to leave Dan Dan out of this.

494
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,420
Then how did you know that I'm Chief Jo?

495
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,940
I heard it from Mrs. Yeoju.

496
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:52,670
That you are the butler of the Chairman's household.

497
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:57,880
And that you will be engaged to the Chairman.

498
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:05,380
Yes, we will be engaged soon.

499
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:09,730
And will get married too.

500
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:12,440
That must be why you wanted to see me.

501
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,800
Chief Jo. Do not be concerned.

502
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,600
I will not do anything to you.

503
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:31,640
Excuse me first.

504
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,560
Family Chicken has opened. Please visit us!

505

00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,590
- Fighting!
- Yes! Thank you.

515
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,550
- Thank you for the food.
- You're welcome!

516
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:23,070
[Family Chicken]

517
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:25,990
- More beer here, please!
- Yes!

518
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:29,890
- Welcome!
- Oh, you are here!

519
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:33,090
The spicy sauce marinated chicken is good here!

520
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:38,540
- Thank you.
- Dan Dan!

521
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:42,020
Yes, wait a few minutes, please.

522
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:54,290
Table 3, Fried and spicy chicken, half and half, please.

523
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,810
Who could that be?

524
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:04,280
Who is it?

525
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,570
It's chicken delivery!

526
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,320
I didn't order a chicken.

527
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,780
This is the right address.

528
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,480
Aren't you CEO Anna Kim?

529
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,380
Ms. Park Dan Dan sent me here.

530
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,960
Dan Dan? Yes, that's right.

531
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:24,640
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

532
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,600
Right, Dan Dan said her dad's chicken place is opening soon.

533
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,640
It must have been today.

534
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:38,390
- Thank you for the food!
- Thank you!

535
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:48,170
- Hello, CEO Anna.
 - Ms. Park.

536
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:52,410
I enjoyed the chicken very much. It was really tasty.

537
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,920
Really? Thank you.

538
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,050
Please give my congratulations to your father on opening the restaurant.

539
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,700
Yes, I will.

540
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:06,090
And, I would like to order fifty chickens.

541
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,160
Is that possible?

542
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,010
Fifty chickens?

543
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:14,680
CEO Anna, that's not why I sent you the chicken.

544
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,870
It's not like that.

545
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:19,680
I sponsor an orphanage.

546
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,940
I send snacks there once a month.

547
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,840
So I want you to send chickens there.

548
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,810
Ah, yes, I get it.

549
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:33,530
Thank you, CEO Anna.

550
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,310
Yes.

551
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:41,370
Dad, CEO Anna ordered fifty chickens.

552
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,760
Fifty chickens?

553
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,740
Dan Dan, CEO Anna ordered fifty chickens?

554
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:48,440
Yes, she wants to send them as snacks to an orphanage.

555
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,610
She will text us the address.

556
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:58,380
Oh, how thankful! What was her name again? Annie?

557
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,790
Who is she to order fifty chickens?

558
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:05,590
She's the CEO of the company collaborates with the FT Group.

559
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:08,260
She's very close to our Chairman as well.

560
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,470
She is very kind to me too.

561
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:15,230
But how did a person like that know we are opening a chicken place today?

562
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:19,980
I sent her a chicken as an opening gift.

563
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,730
You sent her one, and she ordered fifty?

564
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:26,560
What a great person she is.

565
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,850
I guess she really likes you.

566
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:35,230
Yes, she is a very nice person.

567
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:39,990
- Okay, then.
- Right, then let's quickly get ready!

568
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,560
Let's get ready.

569
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,230
Thank you. And this is on us!

570
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,020
Please come again.

571
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,650
Is it for you two?

572
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:53,260
Please wait a few minutes.

573
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,910
Because Ms. Park Noona isn't here,

574
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:14,130
the house feels empty.

575
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,670
I don't even want to play games.

576
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,630
Yes?

577
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,700
Chairman.

578
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:35,840
You're not mad at me because of what happened earlier, are you?

579
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,630
What happened earlier? What is it?

580
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:43,090
I'm sorry for trying to replace Driver Cha.

581
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:47,730
I didn't want to bother you, so I tried to deal with it myself.

582
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:51,170
I'll be careful from now on.

583
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:57,140
If you understand, it's fine. Just don't do it from now on.

584
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:00,450
Since you're apologizing, I feel bad.

585
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:02,710
I feel like I said it too harshly.

586
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:09,630
Yes. To be honest, I was so upset I almost cried.

587
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:10,980
Really?

588
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,020
I was kidding.

589
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:16,990
Chairman, let's go have a date at the park.

590
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:20,860
I want to walk on fallen leaves like we did before.

591
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:25,190
Sure, let's go. Maybe my memories will come back.

592
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:30,060
Even for the sake of my company, I need to regain my memory.

593
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,890
Let's go.

594
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,960
Driver Cha!

595
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,130
Cha Hyung.

596
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:53,020
Thank you for your hard work.

597
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,970
It's nothing. Have a nice date, Chairman.

598
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,580
Today the weather is so good,

599
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:14,420
and the foliage looks beautiful.

600
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:18,480
But I suppose they will be gone once the rain falls.

601
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,120
That's a shame.

602
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,480
It feels good to be out.

603
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,660
Right? Let's take pictures.

604
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,600
Pictures?

605
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,910
Okay. Sounds good.

606
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,110
It came out nicely.

607
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,660
How can you miss that one?

608
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:26,800
Chairman, don't you love it now that you're with me out here?

609
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,910
Did a memory come up?

610
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:34,790
No, not yet.

611
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:39,130
We used to walk here often.

612
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,940
Is that so?

613
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:46,030
You used to cover me up with leaves like a blanket when I lie down here.

614
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,030
My goodness! What?

615
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:51,550
Did I do something that silly?

616
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:55,230
Pardon? Silly?

617
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:57,770
What I'm trying to say is...

618
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:03,170
The leaves would be full of dust and bird poop.

619
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:05,620
I still liked it.

620
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:08,770
It was romantic.

621
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:12,590
- Chairman!
- Oh, my god.

622
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:16,250
- Chief Jo Noona, we must go.
- Why?

623
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:18,430
Ms. Park Noona is off today.

624
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:22,540
So I promised to play a board game with the kids and read to Se Jong.

625
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:27,270
I have to keep the promise that I made with the kids.

626
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:29,260
Let's go.

627
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,290
Let's go together, Chairman!

628
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:40,170
Maybe because I haven't had it for a while, but the sweet potato is delicious.

629
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:41,970
Right?

630
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:47,140
It's crispy outside and moist inside.

631
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:49,600
That's it, exactly.

632
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,570
Gi Ja is good at cooking anything.

633
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:54,920
No matter what she makes,

634
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,700
it's like magic.

635
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,920
You wouldn't believe how good they are.

636
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,770
That's why she started a kimchi business.

637
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:10,130
But strangely,

638
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:13,780
that business went bankrupt.

639
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,400
Did it go bankrupt?

640
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,570
I guess you didn't know about this.

641
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:22,510
I guess cooking well and running a business are two different things.

642
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:26,140
That's why I heard that you let her live here.

643
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:29,940
What else could I have done? She was about to get out on the street.

644
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,790
I only got a small amount of deposit.

645
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:33,600
Oh my.

646
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,920
She would have been in deep trouble if it wasn't for you.

647
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,920
You must be her savior.

648
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,970
You don't have to say that.

649
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:45,750
Oh, my!

650
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:49,680
That pajeon looks so delicious. It's full of seafood.

651
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,670
Mrs. Wang, doesn't that pajeon look delicious?

652
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:55,440
Don't you want to eat it?

653
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,650
It really does look good.

654
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:03,390
Gi Ja! Gi Ja, Gi Ja!

655
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,290
What is it? Should I give you more sweet potatoes?

656
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:07,840
No, we're good with sweet potatoes.

657
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:12,780
Mrs. Wang wants some pajeon stuffed with seafood.

658
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:16,620
Yes. Gi Ja, it would be even better if there was some rice wine!

659
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:20,060
You just ate sweet potatoes. Why do you want pajeon?

660
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:21,700
You'll gain weight.

661
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:24,120
We'll just eat a little bit.

662
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,910
Do you have rice wine?

663
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:28,150
Yes, there is some.

664
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:31,400
That's great. Go prepare it.

665
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,140
Mrs. Wang was very stressed today,

666
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,370
and she should relieve it by eating, at least.

667
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:39,160
Right, Mrs. Wang?

668
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,190
I want to have some pajeon and rice wine

669
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:45,430
and just knock out.

670
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:47,650
That sounds great.

671
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:49,730
There is nothing to stop us.

672
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:54,800
Tonight let's have some pajeon and rice wine and pass out.

673
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,940
Let's do that!

674
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:00,970
What are you doing, Gi Ja? Go make the pajeon.

675
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:04,940
Mi Sook is getting more on my nerves than Dae Ran.

676
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:08,650
Seriously, I wish I could hit them...

677
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:11,380
- I'm home.
- Sarah, welcome home!

678
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:14,490
Chief Jo, you worked hard today.

679
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:16,990
The Madam is here.

680
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:20,530
Soon you will be the madam of FT Group.

681
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:23,470
You can't forget me then, Sarah.

682
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:25,200
Of course, not.

683
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,090
I will go change my clothes.

684
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:29,680
Oh my, Madam!

685
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:34,900
You must be very tired today. Thank you for your hard work.

686
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,140
Madam! It sounds fun!

687
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,410
- Yes, she'll be the madam soon!
- Madam!

688
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:43,560
It sounds so much fun!

689
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,210
Sarah.

690
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:47,680
I'm on the verge of going crazy.

691
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:51,570
Dae Ran has been glued to the couch all day

692
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:53,460
and tells me to do this and that.

693
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:58,090
Am I a servant or something? I haven't been able to sit all day.

694
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:01,300
She asks for water, coffee, fruits.

695
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:05,700
On top of that, Mi Sook has been glued to her side, ordering me around.

696
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,220
I'm going to go crazy.

697
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:09,900
What should I do?

698
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,340
Mom, deal with it for a few more days.

699
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,260
I want to rest, so please leave.

700
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:16,550
A few days? How long?

701
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:22,750
I was working as their servant, which made me ache all over my body!

702
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:26,040
Then what do you want me to do?

703
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,990
I'm also tired. I'll try to figure something out, so deal with it a little more.

704
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:37,130
It's going to kill me if I endure more!

705
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:45,190
I will see him every day from now on. What should I do?

706
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:47,360
Don't worry.

707
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:51,600
You are a stranger to me.

708
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,260
No one knows.

709
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:59,110
I've never told anyone about you and will not in the future as well.

710
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:02,220
That right. I should trust him.

711
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:05,450
He promised me, so he won't tell.

712
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:09,860
He's not a bad person.

713
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:16,390
Yes, thank you.

714
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:18,490
Welcome. Hello.

715
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:21,910
Honey, the owners of the jokbal place are here.

716
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:24,220
Hello, welcome.

717
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,130
Thank you for coming.

718
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:28,230
We just closed our shop for the day.

719
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:30,600
So now we have a chance to see you. Congratulations.

720
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,960
Congrats!

721
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,740
Thank you.

722
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,900
Congratulations on opening the business!

723
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:41,030
But I saw that flower pot that we sent was hidden in the back.

724
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:44,570
You should have placed it in the very front.

725
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:46,470
Really? I didn't realize.

726
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:47,860
Honey. Honey!

727
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:50,030
- I'll go move it.
- No, no.

728
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:52,820
You can do it later. Later.

729
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:58,690
They just opened and are so busy. Why would you say something like that?

730
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,130
By the way, where did Bin go?

731
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:05,410
Bin, Hyun Bin. Why aren't you coming in?

732
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:06,830
There you are.

733
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:11,040
Oh my, who is this handsome young man?

734
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,900
He's my son.

735
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:17,340
He is going to become a prosecutor or lawyer.

736
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:18,840
Dad, what are you saying?

737
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,420
Why?

738
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:21,910
Hello.

739
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:25,300
Nice to meet you.

740
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,550
Sunbae.

741
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:30,230
Dan Dan.

742
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:35,660
Do you two know each other?

743
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,410
I won!

744
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:45,600
Yay!

745
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,960
Let's go again.

746
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,650
That was nice.

747
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:51,230
- Here. One, two, three, four.
- I'm the best at this game.

748
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:54,070
Five. One, two, three, four.

749
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:58,580
Why is she still not coming home?

750
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:02,960
There's no way a store opening will go on until this late.

751
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,190
A teacher shouldn't be staying out so late.

752
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:14,620
Did something happen to her on the way here late?

753
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:33,980
What? Was she out this late with that punk

754
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:38,160
instead of attending her father's store opening?

755
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:43,110
Thank you, Sunbae. Go back safely.

756
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:45,150
Go on in.

757
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,470
What's wrong?

758
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:53,360
My eye... I think something went into my eye.

759
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,230
Let me see. I'll take a look for you.

760
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:09,850
W-what is that punk doing to our innocent Ms. Park Noona?

761
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:13,340
In front of our sacred house!

762
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,850
- What is this!
- Stop it!

763
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:28,960
What are you doing right now! It's me, Ms. Park! Park Dan Dan!

764
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,110
I didn't see you there.

765
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:36,750
Chairman! Why are you spraying water at this hour?

766
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:41,920
I forgot to water the trees today, so that's what I was doing.

767
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,170
I wonder why the water went all the way there.

768
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:49,010
You were watering the trees at this late hour?

769
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:52,650
Why? It's not as if there's a law to only water trees during the day.

770
00:51:52,650 --> 00:52:00,480
Besides, it's my choice whether I water my trees during the day or night.

771
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,160
The trees are all dead anyway.

772
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,550
Oh no, look at you.

773
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:08,600
Your clothes are all wet.

774
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,590
What should I do?

775
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:14,280
My goodness, she's so affectionate to him.

776
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,830
Why is she overreacting about some water on his clothes?

777
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:18,890
What do I do?

778
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:22,620
It's all right, Dan Dan. I can just go home and change.

779
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,780
You got really wet too. Why don't you go inside now?

780
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:26,750
I'll get going.

781
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:29,950
I'm sorry, Sunbae. Go home safely.

782
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:32,170
Go on in.

783
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:51,720
Chairman! Don't you think you crossed a line?

784
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:56,640
How so? Are you that upset because your boyfriend got a little wet?

785
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,470
He's not my boyfriend!

786
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:02,400
Gosh, I shouldn't even bother.

787
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,300
He's not her boyfriend?

788
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,230
That's what I thought.

789
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:09,780
Did you get wet, Ms. Park Noona?

790
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:14,600
How could I not get wet when you were spraying it all over? I'm going inside.

791
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:18,690
I made a mistake. Why did I do that?

792
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:20,910
At least put this on. You may catch a cold.

793
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:23,230
No, thank you.

794
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:28,630
So Ms. Park Noona doesn't have a boyfriend.

795
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:31,480
She's single.

796
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:37,600
Hey, Lee Young Gook! Get it together!

797
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,350
You said you wouldn't do this.

798
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:46,490
It's none of your business whether Ms. Park Noona is single or not.

799
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:58,270
How much did everything add up to?

800
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:02,840
The cash here totals ₩430,000.

801
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,900
We sold 90 chickens, beer, soju,

802
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:10,580
the Spicy Whelks you made, dried Pollack, fruits, and assorted grilled sausages.

803
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:15,880
Today's sales, including the cash, are 1.9 million won!

804
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,630
1.9 million won?!

805
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:20,080
Oh, gosh... 1.9 million won, you said?

806
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,550
Mom! Honey!

807
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:26,580
If we keep this up, even take out the cost of ingredients and rent,

808
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:30,530
we can probably earn over 10 million won in a month!

809
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:33,310
Is that true?

810
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:35,310
My heart is pounding!

811
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:39,830
Today, our sales came out like this thanks to CEO Anna ordering 50 chickens.

812
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:43,320
But I think we'll do well from now on as well.

813
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:46,820
Then what should we do after we make a lot of money?

814
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:51,480
What else? We should buy a house and payback for their generosity to Son-in-law Park's sister

815
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:56,230
and his military Sunbae, who handed over the store.

816
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:58,630
You're right, Mother-in-law. We have to.

817
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:03,270
Let's pay them back for their generosity after we buy a house.

818
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:06,920
Yes, yes! We'll do that!

819
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:10,310
- Hooray! I'm so happy.
- Wow!

820
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:20,590
How does it taste? Is it all right?

821
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:23,220
Tell me honestly.

822
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,630
Honestly?

823
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:30,670
Why? Is it not good?

824
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:35,860
That's not it. It's fried chicken, so of course, it's tasty.

825
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:39,570
- But?
- Yes, but...

826
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:41,820
I guess it's nothing special.

827
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:45,840
Like I can get it from anywhere. It tastes very generic.

828
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,470
That's what I think.

829
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:48,790
What did you say?!

830
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:52,810
Hey! How could you say that when we just opened!

831
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:58,580
You told me to tell you honestly... So that's what I did.

832
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:00,740
Forget about it! You don't have to eat anymore.

833
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:05,490
No, no! It's delicious! It's really delicious!

834
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:08,200
Mi Rim!

835
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:13,490
Fine...

836
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:19,170
A little...

837
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:32,800
Sarah!

838
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,830
Can you please take Dae Ran with you today?

839
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:37,910
I'm dying here!

840
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:42,970
Just look at this morning. As soon as she opened her eyes, she asked for water, coffee, and toast.

841
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:48,840
Gosh... Just the thought of serving her all day makes me feel daunting!

842
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:53,270
Take her with you, Sarah. Try to persuade her to go with you today.

843
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:56,840
How can I do that? I told you to bear with her for a few days.

844
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:00,370
Depending on the Chairman's mood, I'll take her back when I see an opportunity.

845
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:03,540
But I'm saying I'm dying here because of Dae Ran!

846
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:06,780
Why do you only think of yourself and not me?

847
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:09,500
- But I--
- Hey!!

848
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,240
Hey, Lee Gi Ja!

849
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:15,010
- Madam...
- How could you do this?

850
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:17,670
It's not like I was here for a month or even 10 days!

851
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:21,310
I was only here for a day. That was so tough for you?

852
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:22,870
I don't want to stay here anymore too!

853
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:27,230
I went through so much to make your daughter, Chief Jo, my daughter-in-law.

854
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:29,960
How could you! Goodness...

855
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:33,880
Fine. Let's end it here. It's over!

856
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:38,130
My gosh! Unbelievable!!

857
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:42,300
Mom! I told you to bear with her for just a few days! What are you going to do now?

858
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:45,430
Go and calm her down with whatever it takes!

859
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:49,110
My life... My poor life...

860
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:56,130
How can even Madam make my life so hard?

861
00:57:56,130 --> 00:58:00,240
It's really driving me crazy!

862
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,930
Dae Ran.

863
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:12,160
Dae Ran!

864
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:21,860
That mean wench. My sad life...

865
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:26,950
I can't even go back home because of that crazy punk, Young Gook.

866
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:31,810
How did my life turn out to this?

867
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:38,850
I don't have a choice.

868
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:48,390
[My pretty daughter, Se Ryun]

869
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:59,370
What do I do?

870
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:01,460
Yes, Mom?

871
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:03,840
Se Ryun!

872
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:08,710
Where are you right now? Are you still in New York?

873
00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:12,670
Are you crying? What's wrong, Mom?

874
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:18,790
Se Ryun... I have nowhere to go.

875
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:24,620
What are you saying, Mom? What do you mean you have nowhere to go?

876
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:31,940
I got kicked out by that punk, Young Gook!

877
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:35,150
What? Did you get kicked out by Oppa?

878
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:38,060
But you said you were doing well.

879
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,930
Why are you saying that now?

880
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:45,750
W-well, I didn't tell you because I didn't want to upset you.

881
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,450
But it's strange.

882
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:50,550
Oppa promised me he wouldn't kick you out.

883
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:53,350
He said he would be good to you.

884
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:56,760
Mom! Did you do something again?

885
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:01,670
No, no, that's not it, Se Ryun.

886
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:05,470
The truth is, your brother got into an accident.

887
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:08,270
He lost his memory.

888
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:13,970
So he went back to becoming a crazy delinquent!

889
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:16,400
What?!

890
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,120
Oppa lost his memory?

891
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:23,390
What are you saying, Mom?!

892
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:50,970
Are you saying I should come to the office once or twice a week?

893
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:56,520
Strange rumors are starting to spread since you're not coming to the office often.

894
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:01,530
Rumors like you got a fatal illness by accident, so you can't work anymore.

895
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:03,840
You know about this as well.

896
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:10,140
If this gets out of control, it will be difficult to hide your health situation.

897
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:12,930
And it will affect the company greatly in a negative way.

898
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:15,440
Okay then, I will come to work every day.

899
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,370
I don't think so.

900
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:20,640
It may be counterproductive for now.

901
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:25,690
Some employees might catch on to your situation.

902
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:30,570
How about if you come once or twice a week and do something simple?

903
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:33,530
Thanks to the way you prepared the projects prior to the accident,

904
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:38,490
the company is running well, without a problem.

905
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:40,920
I understand what you are saying.

906
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:44,950
I'm sure it's not easy, but I ask for your support a bit more.

907
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:49,890
I will try hard to regain my memory as quickly as I can.

908
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,780
What brings you here today, Ms. Park?

909
01:01:56,780 --> 01:02:01,640
Thank you so much for ordering fifty chickens yesterday.

910
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:06,860
I wanted to come yesterday, but we finished our work very late.

911
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:10,700
I didn't do much. You didn't have to concern yourself.

912
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:13,050
Still, we are so thankful.

913
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:15,120
But I'm glad you are here.

914
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:18,770
I was going to call you about something anyway.

915
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:20,900
To me?

916
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:22,980
What is it?

917
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,430
We are doing the photoshoot for the season today.

918
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:33,950
Since you are going to the US with me, you should know the work I do and what you will be doing in advance.

919
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:36,620
I'm sure it will help you get ready.

920
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:39,890
What do you say? Do you want to see it?

921
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:42,010
Of course. I'd love to.

922
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:44,830
Actually, I wanted to see it.

923
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:49,430
- Really? Then let's go together.
- Yes.

924
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:05,790
Please feel free to look around, Ms. Park.

925
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:07,820
Yes.

926
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:21,070
CEO Anna, we are in big trouble.

927
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:24,660
The main model got into an accident on the way here and can't come.

928
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:25,820
What do we do?

929
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:28,730
Oh, no.

930
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:32,790
If we don't shoot it now, we won't make the deadline.

931
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:41,830
CEO Anna, what about that lady over there?

932
01:03:41,830 --> 01:03:45,090
I think her look is suitable for our brand.

933
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:46,680
She looks good.

934
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:52,050
She looks lively and bright, so I think she'll fit our concept for the season.

935
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:55,740
We needed a new face anyway.

936
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:58,450
Do you think so?

937
01:03:58,450 --> 01:04:03,880
Yes, yes, why don't we hire her as our new model?

938
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:18,430
CEO Anna, do you really think I could do this?

939
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:20,330
What if I wreck everything?

940
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:22,880
No, you won't. I know you will do well.

941
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:28,000
Everyone here is a specialist. They wouldn't have asked you if they didn't think you could do it.

942
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:33,060
The director and the staff will tell you what to do, so don't worry.

943
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:37,010
You just have to relax and follow their lead.

944
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:38,930
Okay.

945
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:44,710
You are so pretty.

946
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:49,080
Let's start.

947
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:56,060
Ms. Park Dan Dan, can you give us a smile?

948
01:04:56,060 --> 01:05:00,610
Think of it like you are taking photos with friends.

949
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:03,380
Let's try it again.

950
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:11,420
Ms. Park, think as if you went out with Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong.

951
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:16,290
Think of the feeling when you are playing with them. Relax!

952
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:18,370
Yes.

953
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:21,200
Okay, let's do it again.

954
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:25,390
Okay.

955
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:27,850
It's good. Okay.

956
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:31,380
It's very good! Awesome!

957
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:36,790
You look great!

958
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:40,050
It's very good!

959
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:43,080
Amazing!

960
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:48,030
That's great! Awesome!

961
01:05:48,030 --> 01:05:52,430
Keep going. Okay.

962
01:05:52,430 --> 01:05:54,940
Ms. Park!

963
01:05:56,350 --> 01:06:00,350
Okay, one more time. There you go!

964
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:10,100
Is something going on today?

965
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:12,770
Yes, they are doing photoshoots today.

966
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:14,960
Do you want to go see it?

967
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:19,760
Why don't you do it? Go and encourage them.

968
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,560
Sure, let's go.

969
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:29,280
Okay, let's change the pose.

970
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,320
That's right! Great!

971
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,500
That's right!

972
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:46,500
Amazing!

973
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,770
She's good at it.

974
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:55,190
That's great! Give me another pose!

975
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:59,020
That's great! Stay like that!

976
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:02,080
Why is Ms. Park Noona so beautiful?

977
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,510
I can't hold back anymore.

978
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:06,710
That's great!

979
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:09,810
I will not hold back anymore.

980
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:17,010
I'm going to like Park Dan Dan from now on.

981
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:21,350
I won't call her Noona anymore.

982
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:24,460
I will call her "you."

983
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:53,960
♫  Only as a younger brother, you only see me like that  ♫

984
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:59,560
♫  You say I'm cute, but Noona, you're a woman to me  ♫

985
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:05,160

♫  Whoever you meet, and whatever you do with them  ♫

♫ I can only wait ♫

998

1004
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:04,250
[Young Lady and Gentleman]

1005
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:07,270
He will kick me out when he sees me. What are you going to do?

1006
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:09,650
Don't worry, Mom. I will take care of everything.

1007
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:11,020
Oppa, I'm home.

1008
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:12,540
I heard you are getting engaged to Chief Jo.

1009
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:15,280
You are doing it even though you don't remember because you feel like you have to?

1010
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,900
I've put as much as I could.

1011
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:18,490
- What is this?
- I'm getting engaged the day after tomorrow.

1012
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:19,890
Please leave the Chairman's house.

1013
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:21,000
Look here, Chief Jo!

1014
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,500
Is the main star of today not dressed yet?

1015
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,930
Shouldn't we tell the children now?

1016
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,330
I will tell them myself.

1017
01:10:27,330 --> 01:10:28,290
What are these clothes for?

1018
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:29,590
It's for you to wear on a very important day.

1019
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:30,650
What day is that?

1020
01:10:30,650 --> 01:10:32,080
That is, actually...

1021
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:36,210
My head, heart, and soul are only filled with Park Dan Dan.

1022
01:10:36,210 --> 01:10:39,250
I shouldn't deceive my feelings. I have to be honest.

1023
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:42,900
Park Dan Dan, meet me at Namsan at 8 pm tonight.

1024
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:46,960
I will be waiting for you.
