[Episode 30]

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,080
Chairman, why are you saying that all of a sudden? I'm not going to the US.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,250
I will be by your side.

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,540
I know you like me as well. Why are you acting this way again?

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,580
Let's stop giving a hard time to each other.

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,310
Ms. Park.

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,430
I think I made a mistake.

8
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,580
Even if someone as young and beautiful as you tells me she likes me,

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,050
I should have controlled my feelings.

10
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:38,880
But I let myself fall for you with no conscience.

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,320
If you were my sister or daughter,

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,540
I would've never allowed this.

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,790
Ms. Park.

14
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:57,710
You have many days ahead of you.

15
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,610
So don't lock up your youth,

16
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:07,960
and I want you to go out to the bigger world and challenge yourself.

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,300
I would like to see you do that.

18
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,900
I don't want to.

19
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:20,040
What about Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong? They need me by their side.

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,210
We can get another tutor.

21
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:27,700
Let's end it here.

22
00:01:54,250 --> 00:02:01,210
You startled me! Why are you standing there quietly?

23
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:07,580
Do you need anything? Coffee?

24
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:14,150
Do you really want me to go to the US?

25
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,180
What?

26
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,590
Yes, I want you to go.

27
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,800
I know it will be hard to live in a foreign country at your age.

28
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,070
Why wouldn't I know that?

29
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:31,610
But, when can we make money if not now?

30
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,750
We need to make money while we are not that old for us to plan our elder times.

31
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,050
What did you tell me when we were getting married?

32
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,250
You said you would not give me a hard life.

33
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,500
No more and no less than five years.

34
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,960
Just five years.

35
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,500
Are you really going to be okay without me?

36
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,060
Am I a child?

37
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,220
There are a ton of family members at home.

38
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:11,610
Of course, it will be difficult for me without you.

39
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,550
But if we work hard for five years, we can get a house.

40
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,000
Then we won't have to live in a leaky house like this.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,600
Also, you're going to the US, not a developing country.

42
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,940
Other people want to work in the US. So why would you lose that chance?

43
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,690
I got it.

44
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,240
I will go.

45
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,850
Really?

46
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,310
Really? Honey!

47
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:45,840
You made the right decision. You made a great choice!

48
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,820
Honey, thank you.

49
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,710
Thank you.

50
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,800
Who is it?

51
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,910
It's CEO Anna.

52
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,320
Why don't you answer it quickly?

53
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,110
Yes, CEO Anna.

54
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,970
Now?

55
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:24,320
Yes, I get it.

56
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,610
What did she say? What is it?

57
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,780
She wants to see me because she has something to talk about.

58
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,350
Really? Then you should get going.

59
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,110
Okay. I will go to the store right after.

60
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,150
Don't worry about the store.

61
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:45,020
Dae Beom can run the chicken store all by himself.

62
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,860
So hurry up and go, Honey.

63
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,210
Hurry up and go! See you later!

64
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,450
Oh, Lord, thank you!

65
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,950
It's wonderful!

66
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,360
Pardon?

67
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,510
Dan Dan said she wouldn't go to the States?

68
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:15,510
No. When you decided to go to the US,

69
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:20,400
I was so excited, so I met up with her and told her right away.

70
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,950
That you're coming with us for work.

71
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:28,790
I thought she would be thrilled to hear about it.

72
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,990
But she said she couldn't go with us.

73
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,620
What do you mean by that?

74
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:40,410
She even took English classes in preparation.

75
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:46,250
I think it's because she doesn't want to leave Chairman Lee's children behind.

76
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,430
Does that make sense?

77
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,180
How can she not go because of the kids?

78
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,950
I couldn't understand it either.

79
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,290
So I saw Chairman Lee

80
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:59,950
and asked him to persuade her to go to the US.

81
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:07,720
But I thought you should see Ms. Park and talk about it as well.

82
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,700
Yes. I will talk to her.

83
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:19,290
I want Ms. Park to come with us when we go to the US.

84
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,280
Thank you, CEO Anna.

85
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:30,040
For thinking of our Dan Dan that much.

86
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,660
It's for you too,

87
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:38,200
and because I feel like Ms. Park is my daughter now.

88
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:57,340
Dan Dan, did you really tell CEO Anna that you can't go to the US?

89
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,510
Because of Chairman Lee's children?

90
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:05,160
Is that true that you told her that?

91
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,880
Yes, Dad.

92
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:14,260
I want to work at the Chairman's longer instead of going to the States.

93
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:18,010
Dan Dan, do you think that makes sense?

94
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:21,500
I know you've grown close to their kids.

95
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,130
But how can you give up on your life because of them?

96
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,980
Is there something else?

97
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,820
No, it's not like that.

98
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:39,090
Are you saying it's entirely because of the children?

99
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,080
I really cannot understand that.

100
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:53,550
I made the difficult decision to go to the States because you were going.

101
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,520
Dad.

102
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,470
You should go and work there and not worry about me.

103
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,700
I feel the children still need me.

104
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:07,140
I just cannot go right now.

105
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:12,640
Can you please try to understand me?

106
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,910
Dan Dan. I think you're making a mistake.

107
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:21,120
Also, do you know how much CEO Anna thinks of you?

108
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,340
You can't act like this when she's given you such a precious opportunity.

109
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:29,150
For no other reasons, but concern for the children doesn't make any sense.

110
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,340
That's not right.

111
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,040
Please reconsider your decision.

112
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,560
And listen to your dad, okay?

113
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,520
[Today's Chef]

114
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,950
Mi Rim, what would you like to eat?

115
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,500
Take a look.

116
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,520
There are all kinds of stuff here.

117
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,590
What's this?

118
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:05,830
Joon Oh, why are you buying so much?

119
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,390
I don't want you to go hungry while I'm away.

120
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,100
I want to make sure you eat.

121
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,500
You worried a lot about me.

122
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,040
Of course, why wouldn't I?

123
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,160
You'd be eating ramyun for meals in my absence.

124
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,470
It's easy to prepare this.

125
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,270
So make sure to eat them, okay?

126
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,320
Bong Joon Oh.

127
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,060
Why?

128
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,430
I feel like you are my family.

129
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:34,120
My heart feels warm right now.

130
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,400
- What are you making?
- Stew.

131
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,300
Put all of the ingredients in the pot and bring them to a boil.

132
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,910
It's simple, isn't it?

133
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,870
Do you want to taste it?

134
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,480
It's delicious. It's so good!

135
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,500
Right?

136
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,610
I will have a good talk with my mom.

137
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,720
So stay well and take care of yourself.

138
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,940
I understand why your mom is upset about it.

139
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,810
If you want to quit medical school when it's hard to get in, of course, she's upset.

140
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,250
So, don't worry about me,

141
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,670
and take care of things with your mom.

142
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,530
I will be okay.

143
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,840
Okay.

144
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,950
Call me right away if anything happens.

145
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,650
I will.

146
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,070
- Shall we eat?
- Let's eat.

147
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,190
Thank you for the food!

148
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:39,380
Here, everything is out now.

149
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,450
We have a pretty long menu.

150
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,320
As we welcome the new year,

151
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,840
our family has something to celebrate.

152
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,330
At last,

153
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:52,000
my brother-in-law is heading for the US!

154
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,860
Let's all enjoy the chicken,

155
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,030
and wish my brother-in-law and our chicken restaurant a huge success.

156
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:02,380
- Cheers!
- Wait!

157
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,460
This chicken tastes delicious with this sauce.

158
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,520
- You know how to eat it well.
- Okay, one, two, three!

159
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,700
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

160
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,990
You are embarrassing me.

161
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,160
This is not a cause for a party, Honey.

162
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,540
When do we get to throw a party if not for this?

163
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,630
Isn't it an honor to our family that you've been scouted to an American company?

164
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,570
Who else gets recruited at your age with over $100,000 annual salaries?

165
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,670
I looked up, and even in America,

166
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,710
an annual salary of $100,000 is a big deal.

167
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,040
- Really?
- Yes!

168
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,010
An annual salary of $100,000 is huge.

169
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,820
Honey, my friends are all envious of me.

170
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,870
I've become a total star.

171
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,770
We haven't even started the process yet.

172
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,180
Why do you tell them?

173
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,750
Why not? It's worthy of a boast.

174
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,350
When you get settled there,

175
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,480
could you bring Geon along too?

176
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,320
That's right. Once you get on the good side of CEO Anna,

177
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,820
then ask her to scout Geon as well.

178
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,060
Maybe we will all end up living in the US.

179
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,560
Ah, honestly.

180
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,410
Thanks to Son-in-law Park, maybe I'll get to see the US before I die.

181
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,090
We've been to South East Asia.

182
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:25,150
How wonderful it'd be at my old age.

183
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,560
Okay, then in that spirit,

184
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,580
let's do cheers again!

185
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,060
- Cheer!
- If we go, are we drinking American beers?

186
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,850
Please give me some of that. I want to try.

187
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,510
Mom, you're dripping.

188
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,150
What sauce is it? This one?

189
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,450
Chairman.

190
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,600
Chairman, have you had dinner yet?

191
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,390
Of course, you would have, at this hour.

192
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,100
But can you buy me something delicious?

193
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,790
And let's play whack-a-mole, too.

194
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,950
I feel like catching some moles tonight.

195
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,750
I had a few stressful things happening today.

196
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,060
Ms. Park.

197
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,980
Did you not understand what I said earlier today?

198
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,620
Did you forget what I said?

199
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,900
Chairman. I'm not going to the US.

200
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,730
I have already told about it to CEO Anna.

201
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,990
I've already made the decision.

202
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,520
- So...
- Why are you telling me this?

203
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:48,290
I'll assume you'll leave my house after three months.

204
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,560
Whether you go to the US or not is up to you.

205
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,870
It's because of you that I'm not going.

206
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:59,120
Because I like you.

207
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,960
Ms. Park.

208
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,450
I'm engaged to another woman.

209
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:11,810
What are you saying to someone with a fiancée?

210
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:16,430
- Pardon?
- I'll say it again.

211
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,870
I've organized my feelings for you.

212
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:23,320
I'm not thinking of any future with you.

213
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,690
So please do not talk to me in this way again.

214
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:31,520
I will only treat you as my children's tutor from now on.

215
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:37,810
So please do not cross the line as well, Ms. Park.

216
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,860
Why is he acting like that toward me?

217
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,660
Oh my, what is all that, Mrs. Yeoju?

218
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,480
I think the Chairman drank in his study last night.

219
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,620
Did Young Gook drink in his study?

220
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,460
Yes. Without any food, I think he drank the whole bottle of this hard liquor.

221
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,020
He has never done this before.

222
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,250
This is the first time since I've been here.

223
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,480
That's right. I wonder what's going on.

224
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,290
He didn't even do that when his wife died.

225
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:55,860
He wouldn't even look at me and reject a date with me.

226
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,850
Is being engaged to me that difficult?

227
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,020
For him to drink this much by himself?

228
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,790
Seriously, what should I do with him?

229
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,430
After being cold to me last night,

230
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:09,450
Chairman's true feeling was feeling terrible.

231
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:13,230
Right. He still has feelings for me.

232
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,050
Chairman! Oh, I'm glad.

233
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:31,040
I worried that you might have gone to work already.

234
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,820
Chairman, have this.

235
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,200
I know you drank hard liquor on an empty stomach.

236
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,110
Chairman, you drank because of me, didn't you?

237
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,780
After telling me things you didn't mean,

238
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:55,140
you felt terrible, so you drank. I know it all.

239
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,750
This is a hangover cure drink.

240
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,950
Please drink it. It will sober you up.

241
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,480
Ms. Park.

242
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,270
Do you think I was joking yesterday?

243
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,840
Are you playing around now?

244
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,660
For now, your stomach is upset,

245
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,650
so please drink this first.

246
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:20,080
Ms. Park, why are you doing this?

247
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,320
- Chairman.
- I warned you clearly yesterday.

248
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,840
Don't cross the line.

249
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:31,290
Ms. Park, I will say it again since you don't seem to understand.

250
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:35,120
Please do not come to me in this way.

251
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,640
Hyung, my dad is scary.

252
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,020
Why is he acting like that all of a sudden?

253
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:14,280
I think he's trying to send Ms. Park to the US.

254
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,030
Why?

255
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,920
It's because he loves her.

256
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,710
Hyung. If he loves her,

257
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,690
why will he send her away?

258
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,680
You will understand when you grow up.

259
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,310
Soo Chul.

260
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,290
These will look good on you. Please try them on.

261
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,270
No, thank you. Why would I?

262
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:44,550
What do you mean why? Aren't you going to take a passport photo?

263
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,330
I just need to dress neatly for the photo.

264
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,750
These are over the top.

265
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:53,060
I want to use the occasion to gift you a nice outfit.

266
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,510
Also, you'll need a few of these kinds of clothes when you work in the US.

267
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,880
It's good to prepare in advance. Please try them on.

268
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,230
- Can he try these on?
- Yes, of course.

269
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,380
Please put them on and show me.

270
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:19,940
You look like someone totally different. You look great.

271
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,260
Oh, I'm not.

272
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,740
But I don't know if I could take this.

273
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,460
Of course, you can.

274
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:33,380
I've received so much from you. Surely I can give you this.

275
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,210
I want to do everything for you.

276
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,000
It really looks great. Really.

277
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,160
We've done shopping and took photos.

278
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,520
I am hungry from running around all day.

279
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,440
Why don't we go to your home? I'll make something delicious for you.

280
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,980
What do you want to eat?

281
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,150
No, I will do the cooking today.

282
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,590
Will you? What are you going to make?

283
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:10,890
I will prepare a secret weapon only I can make.

284
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,240
Please look forward to it.

285
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,440
I am looking forward to it.

286
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,050
What is that I just saw?

287
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,370
Isn't it Mr. Park?

288
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:39,240
Why is he walking arm in arm with a posh lady like that?

289
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,560
What kind of a relationship are they?

290
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,960
- Hello.
- Hello.

291
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,120
Hello.

292
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,180
Where is Mr. Park?

293
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:58,730
He will be here soon. He had to take care of something somewhere else first.

294
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,500
Dae Beom is looking after the store. Why?

295
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,210
Well, that is...

296
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,520
Does Mr. Park have a younger sister?

297
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,550
A younger sister?

298
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:12,380
No, he doesn't. Just an older sister.

299
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,620
The one who you met before.

300
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,040
R-Really?

301
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,740
Yes. Why?

302
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:24,520
- The thing is...
- Dong Pil!

303
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,580
I asked you to take out the jokbal from the pot, and why are you out here?

304
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,100
Well...

305
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,520
Our Dong Pil is always curious about things.

306
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,680
Then, have a great day.

307
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,100
Come inside, you.

308
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,810
Well, that is...

309
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:45,390
- Why are they acting like that?
- I don't know.

310
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:50,490
Why would he ask if Soo Chul has a younger sister?

311
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:55,350
Maybe he wants to be introduced if Soo Chul has a younger sister?

312
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:59,750
But not with that face, surely.

313
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,100
He seems like a nice person, though.

314
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,370
You have to look like Geon for something like that.

315
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,270
Right?

316
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:11,000
Just pretend we didn't hear that. Let's go inside.

317
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,400
Is this, by chance,

318
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,370
zucchini kimchi soup?

319
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:35,750
Yes, that's right—Zucchini kimchi soup.

320
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:40,680
This is something I tasted very long ago.

321
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,590
But I haven't had it since then.

322
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,120
Is that so? Why don't you try it?

323
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,920
Yes.

324
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,600
Oppa, how does it taste?

325
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,350
Ji Young, this is so delicious!

326
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:13,380
A bit spicy, sweet, and refreshing.

327
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,420
It's the first time tasting something like this.

328
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,420
Really?

329
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:22,490
True, it's my mom's specialty.

330
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:26,300
Other people don't really know about zucchini kimchi soup.

331
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:31,060
It really tastes great.

332
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:34,310
Eat as much as you want.

333
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:42,630
What's wrong? Don't you like it?

334
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,430
No, it's not that. It's delicious.

335
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:48,730
It tastes the way I had it back then.

336
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:51,380
I'm glad you like it.

337
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,160
But,

338
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,610
I've only had this once a long ago

339
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:03,320
and never saw it anywhere else.

340
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:08,390
How did you learn to cook this?

341
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,950
I learned it from someone I knew because it tasted good.

342
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,750
I see.

343
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,580
I cooked it without thinking because he enjoyed it back then.

344
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:28,650
I hope he doesn't become suspicious of me.

345
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,900
You worthless wench.

346
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,590
How can you steal, out of all things!

347
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:40,520
I'm about to fall into hell because of your doing.

348
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,050
You wench! You thieving wench!

349
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:46,030
You wench! Oh!

350
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,050
Gi Ja! Gi Ja!

351
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,180
Mom! Mom!

352
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,930
Please, save my mom!

353
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:59,760
- Gi Ja! Gi Ja!
- Mom! Mom!

354
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,040
Mom!

355
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,820
Mom. Mom...

356
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:11,190
Mom...

357
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:14,950
Mother...

358
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:19,120
I'm sorry, Mom.

359
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:25,180
Mom...

360
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,980
What do I do now?

361
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:33,660
Se Ryun will go berserk if I ask her to go on an arranged date.

362
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:38,320
All you have to do is to go there with Se Ryun.

363
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,950
Their second son has been very interested in Se Ryun since they were in the States.

364
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,270
Just pretend like you ran into them by accident,

365
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:49,490
and get them to see each other again.

366
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:53,510
I understand. I will do whatever it takes and take Se Ryun there with me.

367
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,270
But you have to make sure it looks like a coincidence.

368
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:00,860
Of course, I will!

369
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:04,780
I really hope the second son of Jinsa Group

370
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:12,820
will be able to get rid of that dirty goggles on my daughter's eyes.

371
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:17,230
I know. They've both been hurt.

372
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:20,550
I hope very much it will work out between the two.

373
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,130
Hey, Mi Sook.

374
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:29,660
How long have you been here?

375
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,030
Not long ago.

376
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,690
But what's wrong with your face?

377
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:40,150
You look terrible since I last saw you.

378
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:46,760
Yes, you do. You look years older.

379
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,150
What's going on? Are you worried about something?

380
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,390
What worries?

381
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:55,820
No, it's because I haven't been able to sleep lately.

382
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:58,020
Why can't you sleep?

383
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,890
Shouldn't you be sleeping soundly?

384
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:02,790
Sarah is engaged to Chairman Lee Young Gook.

385
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:06,990
Your face should be beautifully bright more than ever.

386
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,120
That's right. Oh, no!

387
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,730
It's not the time for me to idle. I'll wait for your call, Mrs. Jang.

388
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,570
Yes. I will give you a call.

389
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,990
You should hang out here more. I'm a bit busy.

390
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,630
What am I doing?

391
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:25,890
Why did Dae Ran come by?

392
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:29,670
You don't have to know.

393
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:35,320
These aged zucchini pancakes are scrumptious.

394
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:40,860
This annoying girl...

395
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,940
- Can I have some water, please?
- Yes!

396
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,770
Here is the water.

397
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,250
When will we get the spicy rice cakes?

398
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,030
Spicy rice cakes?

399
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:03,620
In a few minutes, they will be out.

400
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,570
Take these to Table #3.

401
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,520
Yes, Grandmother.

402
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,220
Here are...

403
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,770
Oh, my gosh!

404
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:18,990
What did you do to me?

405
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,360
These are new clothes!

406
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,120
I'm sorry, they slipped out of my fingers.

407
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,520
Oh my, what happened here?

408
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,880
I'm so sorry.

409
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,350
What are we going to do? They are all over her clothes.

410
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,710
We are very sorry.

411
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:37,490
Look here, young lady or Ajumma.

412
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,170
Where the heck are you looking while working?

413
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:42,830
What the heck did you do to me!

414
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:47,290
I'm sorry. I will compensate you for them. I will buy you a new one.

415
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,440
Of course, you should compensate.

416
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,530
But how am I going to get home?

417
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:54,070
With the red stuff all over me?

418
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:58,430
This is just so upsetting.

419
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:02,740
Do you think saying sorry is enough?

420
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,750
It's because our staff is new.

421
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,110
Please understand kindly.

422
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:13,350
I will make you more rice cakes for free.

423
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,490
Oh, dear.

424
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:18,590
I'm so sorry. Please don't be too upset.

425
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,630
I will give you a whole fried chicken for free.

426
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:25,820
I don't need it!

427
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,290
What do we do now?

428
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:33,090
What do I do?

429
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:37,900
Oh, no. How do I get home?

430
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,860
Young lady, I don't want to say this to you as well.

431
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,060
But I don't think this is working out.

432
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,610
Please don't come here anymore. I beg you.

433
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:02,230
Mother... Please don't say that to me.

434
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,020
Why do you not understand what I'm saying?

435
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,100
Young lady, the reason why we use part-time staff is

436
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,440
to get help. But you are no help.

437
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,400
You break cups, dishes and spill food at every turn.

438
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,440
You flirt with Dae Beom at every chance.

439
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,780
This business is our living. This is about life and death for us.

440
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,820
Are you here to date?

441
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,870
No, Mother. I'm here to work.

442
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:30,090
Please see Dae Beom outside of the store. I won't stop you from that.

443
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:32,590
Mother, I will try harder.

444
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,450
I don't want you to try harder!

445
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:37,220
Haven't you heard a word I said?

446
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,260
Mom.

447
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,990
It's not like Se Ryun did it on purpose.

448
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:45,900
- Things can happen while working. Why are you scolding her?
- What?

449
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,530
No one gets it right the first time.

450
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:51,340
She's trying hard because of me.

451
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,780
How can you scold her this much for that small mistake?

452
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,630
What? A mistake?

453
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:59,370
Is this the first or second time? How many times can we take?

454
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:02,910
Stop defending her and go inside and fry some chicken!

455
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:06,150
It's ridiculous.

456
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,880
Come here.

457
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,650
It's so annoying.

458
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,140
Did we ask her to work here?

459
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,130
When she comes from a family of money,

460
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,900
why doesn't she help us by bringing the money?

461
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,420
She has no senses whatsoever.

462
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,540
Mom, how can you say such things?

463
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,490
She's trying hard.

464
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:42,280
Mother, I'm sorry.

465
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,440
I will get off the shift early today.

466
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,900
- Se Ryun!
- Hey!

467
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,020
Don't get caught on love.

468
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,070
It's all a waste of time.

469
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,270
She will eventually go back to where she came from.

470
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,590
I don't want to see you crying the blues then.

471
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:00,570
Really, don't you know Se Ryun at all?

472
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:02,500
- Se Ryun!
- Dae Beom!

473
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,500
Lee Se Ryun!

474
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:20,140
Seriously, I'm crazy.

475
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:24,850
What are you doing, Lee Se Ryun?

476
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,270
Yes, Mom.

477
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,600
It's time for them to show up.

478
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,600
You look like you haven't eaten for a few days.

479
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,720
I've been craving this pasta.

480
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,180
Stop eating! You will get it all over your clothes.

481
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,580
Why aren't they coming?

482
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,350
Have they changed their minds?

483
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,140
But, Mom.

484
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:03,470
Didn't you say you wanted to tell me something?

485
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,730
Oh, that.

486
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:10,360
You know, we can't live estranged forever.

487
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:14,390
There are only you and me under the sky.

488
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:17,890
What do you mean there are only two of us?

489
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:21,380
There are my brother, Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong.

490
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,800
- This is why Oppa doesn't like you.
- Ah, honestly.

491
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,950
Are you going to pick on my wording when we haven't seen each other for a while?

492
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,460
Okay.

493
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,280
Let's just peacefully eat since it's been so long.

494
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,800
Instead of fighting, okay?

495
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,920
I'm saying this clearly

496
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,710
if you keep opposing Dae Beom and me,

497
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,400
I will live without contacting you like I am now.

498
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,560
So please do not nag me to stop seeing him.

499
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,880
I will take care of things myself.

500
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,640
Seriously, you're making me lose my appetite.

501
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,590
Is that Lee Se Ryun?

502
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:06,500
You are Se Ryun, right?

503
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,450
Oh Seung Ho?

504
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:12,200
Yes, it's me, Seung Ho. Oh Seung Ho.

505
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,200
Fancy running into you here.

506
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,300
I know.

507
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,740
- Hello.
- Yes.

508
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,260
It's been a long time.

509
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,600
Oh my, you must be my Se Ryun's friend and his mother.

510
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,810
- Hello.
- Hello.

511
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:35,140
Mom, this is Oh Seung Ho, who went to the same school as me when I was in New York.

512
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,680
Seung Ho, this is my mother.

513
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:44,110
- Hello.
- Ah, yes. Hello.

514
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,630
This is Seung Ho's mother.

515
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,270
Hello.

516
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:54,400
Since they are friends with each other, why don't you join us?

517
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,880
That sounds good to me, but will that be okay with you, Se Ryun?

518
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,000
Yes.

519
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,180
Good. Thank you.

520
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,360
So our Se Ryun and Seung Ho

521
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,580
almost went out together?

522
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,140
Yes.

523
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,680
I chased her a lot.

524
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,940
But I was too immature back then,

525
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:21,510
so I didn't have enough courage.

526
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,950
Se Ryun, I'm sorry about back then.

527
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:28,630
I want to apology even if it's this late.

528
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,630
It's all in the past.

529
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,710
I appreciate you being so cool about it.

530
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:37,790
I always wanted to apologize to you if I ran into you again.

531
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:42,120
And here we are meeting like this.

532
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:47,350
Perhaps there is a background story I'm not aware of.

533
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,790
Since we are back in Korea now,

534
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:53,180
let's see each other some times.

535
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,320
Sure.

536
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:12,110
Hyung, I can't think of anything.

537
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:15,430
I don't think I know love yet.

538
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:18,450
Se Jong, I just thought of a great idea.

539
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:20,730
Really? What is it?

540
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:24,780
Let's ask our dad to take us to the ski slopes next to the vacation house.

541
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,850
Ski slopes? Sure.

542
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:29,690
Then I will go on a sleigh ride.

543
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:33,760
Se Jong, that's not why we are going.

544
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,050
We are going there to be a love bridge.

545
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:41,410
I get it. Does that mean our whole family is going?

546
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,010
We can't do that.

547
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:46,570
Only you, me, our dad, and Ms. Park. Just four of us are going.

548
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:51,730
Then we will lock up our dad and Ms. Park in the vacation house's storage when we are there.

549
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:55,490
When you are with someone in a scary place, you become closer.

550
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,630
That's right.

551
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:00,060
You are a genius, Hyung.

552
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,400
A genius of love!

553
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,280
I know I am.

554
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:16,690
Why? What?

555
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:20,320
Lee Se Chan, I will kill you if you are joking around.

556
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,680
I'm not joking around this time.

557
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,250
Why are you here then?

558
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:31,500
This time, our dad, Se Jong, and I are going on a guys' bonding trip to ski slopes.

559
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,310
Since you're a girl, I want you to stay out of this.

560
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:38,620
We want to have a guys' talk together.

561
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,090
I'm not interested anyway.

562
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:43,420
I can't go because of the academy anyway.

563
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,420
So don't bother me to come with you.

564
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,600
Okay, that's for real.

565
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,170
Can you please leave?

566
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:53,250
I have a lot to study for an exam.

567
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:04,240
What are you guys up to, Se Chan and Se Jong?

568
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,770
We have something to tell you.

569
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:09,500
Can you give us a few minutes?

570
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,580
Time? As much as you like.

571
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:15,560
Dad, let's go skiing.

572
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,440
- Skiing?
- Yes, Dad.

573
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,990
I want to learn to ski.

574
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:23,450
I've only done sledding.

575
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:27,250
So I want to ski like Hyung.

576
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:31,280
Really? Should we ask Jenny to come with us?

577
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,450
She can't go because of her studies.

578
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:38,120
That being the case, let three of us go on a boys-unite trip.

579
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:43,410
Let's go skiing and do a barbecue at the vacation home.

580
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:46,710
Really? Should us three boys go on the trip then?

581
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,640
- Yes.
- Yes.

582
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:54,800
Chairman, after going ski with Se Jong and Se Chan,

583
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,750
I heard you are staying overnight at the vacation home.

584
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:00,140
I will come along and help out.

585
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,670
What should I prepare?

586
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:06,010
No, Chief Jo. Jenny is not coming on the trip either.

587
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:10,020
It's a boys' trip with Se Chan and Se Jong.

588
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,210
Oh, I see.

589
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:16,640
But still, if I went with you, we can make good memories together,

590
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:22,130
and it will be a chance for me to get closer to the children.

591
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:26,010
This is not the only day. We can go some other time.

592
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:29,290
Yes, I understand.

593
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:32,470
Let's go together next time for sure.

594
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,840
Chief Jo. Please don't do this.

595
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,750
Chairman, can't I even do this?

596
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,710
I'm your fiancée.

597
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:55,420
We've agreed to give each other time.

598
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:59,710
I would like to restart when my lost memory comes back.

599
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:06,040
I don't know my feelings towards you as of now.

600
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,730
Please understand my situation.

601
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:10,270
I will go now.

602
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,150
Se Chan, Se Jong, did you have fun today?

603
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,010
- Yes!
- It was so much fun.

604
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,310
Be careful of the stairs.

605
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:41,460
How did you get here, Ms. Park?

606
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,400
I took a taxi.

607
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,640
Not that. Why are you here?

608
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,930
That is...

609
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:55,260
Who said you could just come here because you wanted to?

610
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:59,020
Oh, Dad. I asked Ms. Park to come.

611
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,460
Did you, Se Chan? Why?

612
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,200
Oh, I forgot my cell phone at home.

613
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,120
So I asked Ms. Park to bring me my phone.

614
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,980
I really can't be without my cell phone.

615
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,550
Ms. Park, you can give me the phone and go.

616
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:18,990
I'll ask Mr. Kim to call you a cab.

617
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:22,260
Yes, I will.

618
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:30,630
Dad, Ms. Park came all the way out here because of me. It wouldn't be polite to just send her off like this.

619
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:33,920
Not to mention how scary and dangerous it is for a lady to travel alone at night.

620
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,390
Plus, Ms. Park probably hasn't even eaten yet.

621
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,830
She'll be so hungry when she gets home.

622
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,380
Ms. Park, you haven't had dinner yet, right?

623
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,910
No, Se Chan. I'm okay.

624
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,900
I have to go now.

625
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,530
No way.

626
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:52,800
Ms. Park, let's have a barbecue with us.

627
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:59,890
That's right, Ms. Park. If you go now, I would feel so bad.

628
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:04,410
Right. Let's just go.

629
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:06,350
Let's go.

630
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:17,010
Here's delicious meat. Enjoy!

631
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:20,180
- Thank you.
- Enjoy!

632
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:25,630
Ms. Park, try this.

633
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,760
Thank you.

634
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,850
Hurry and try it. It's so good.

635
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:32,850
Okay.

636
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:41,810
I'm done eating, and I have to make a work call.

637
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,320
You kids stay and finish your meal.

638
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,330
Okay.

639
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:03,190
Se Jong, we have to blow all the balloons in here.

640
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,880
- You know that, right?
- Yes.

641
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,960
So for starters, just blow ten of them.

642
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,990
Okay, Hyung.

643
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:15,880
Se Jong, we're going to lock our dad and Ms. Park in here. Then they can spend a romantic night together.

644
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:20,160
Then our dad and Ms. Park will get back together.

645
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,420
Yes. But Hyung, can I light the candles?

646
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:27,500
It's too dangerous for you, so I'll do it instead.

647
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:31,120
But you can arrange them pretty, into a heart shape.

648
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:35,230
Okay! I can do that really well.

649
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:55,900
Where are Se Chan and Se Jong?

650
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,150
They went inside the vacation house.

651
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:59,750
No, they didn't.

652
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:04,770
They came in and left right away. Weren't they with you, Ms. Park?

653
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:10,000
No, I thought they were with you.

654
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:22,390
[Dad]

655
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:24,470
What's going on?

656
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:25,880
I don't think we can just stand here.

657
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,030
I'll go look around the fishing hole, and you look for them around here.

658
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:32,650
- Contact me as soon as you find them.
- Yes.

Fire! Fire!

665
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:51,700
It's fire!

666
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,110
Fire!

667
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:55,930
Fire!

668
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:58,870
Se Chan, Se Jong!

669
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,230
Please help!

670
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:03,800
Fire! Fire!

671
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,300
Just wait a second. I'll come and get you!

672
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,140
We're stuck inside here!

673
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,160
Please save us!

674
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,230
Se Chan! Se Jong!

675
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:20,250
Hold on to me tight!

676
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:25,970
Se Chan, just wait a little bit.

677
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,930
Let's go!

678
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:41,810
Se Chan, you go first.

679
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:44,450
Hurry up and go out!

680
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,660
Ms. Park!!!

681
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:57,710
Ms. Park! Hurry up and come outside!

682
00:45:57,710 --> 00:45:59,540
Ms. Park!!

683
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:02,990
Se Chan! Se Jong!

684
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:06,130
Ms. Park!

685
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:10,400
Dad! What should we do with Ms. Park?!

686
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,600
Dad! Ms. Park saved us, and now she's stuck in there!

687
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,530
Se Chan, what are you talking about?

688
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:19,630
Is Ms. Park in there?

689
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:23,280
Dad! Please save Ms. Park! Please!

690
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,220
Dad, hurry up!

691
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,880
Hurry up!

692
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,190
You kids stay here.

693
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:30,920
Ms. Park!!

694
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,360
Ms. Park, come out here fast!

695
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,010
Ms. Park!

696
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:40,570
Dad!

697
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:47,170
Ms. Park!

698
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,570
- Are you okay?
- Chairman...

699
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:56,040
Ms. Park, wake up. Ms. Park!

700
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,170
Wake up, Ms. Park!

701
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:40,800
Chief Jo. Please don't do this.

702
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,350
[Sokcho Night Beach]

703
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:59,120
Yes, it's me. Is there something going on?

704
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,990
Ajussi.

705
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:04,980
Can you come here?

706
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:08,410
What's going on?

707
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:10,460
Okay, I'll go now.

708
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,760
I'm going now.

709
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:25,140
I thought that jerk came looking for you again.

710
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,410
Is that why you were worried and came over here running?

711
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:30,790
Isn't that right?

712
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:39,680
Since you were so scary, that dirtbag won't be coming around anymore.

713
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:44,600
You were so cool that night.

714
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,720
What? Me?

715
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:53,650
You're saying such a darnedest thing only after a glass of alcohol.

716
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:56,630
You were like my Black Knight.

717
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:03,420
In all my life, this is the first time I've ever been called a "Black Knight" (Heuk Gi-Sa). I'm Driver Cha (Cha Gi-Sa).

718
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,820
You know that joke is super corny, right?

719
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:16,920
When I'm with you, I laugh a lot and have so much fun.

720
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,450
But why are you drinking again?

721
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:23,300
Did something happen?

722
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,800
Yes. Something happened.

723
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,680
What can I hide from you at this point?

724
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:34,360
You've seen the very worst of me.

725
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:38,840
Yes, today was also pretty depressing.

726
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:43,150
I got hurt after being devoted,

727
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:50,250
and my pride got shot to bits. It was depressing.

728
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,610
That's why people say, rather than living with someone you have no feelings for,

729
00:49:56,610 --> 00:50:02,640
it's best to live happily with someone you love.

730
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:08,790
Then again, women do like men with lots of money.

731
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:21,650
"Live happily with someone you love."

732
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:26,440
Of course, I was like that in the past.

733
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:32,020
But Ajussi, the world is not like that.

734
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:36,510
Nothing has ever gone my way.

735
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:39,500
It may be hard for you to believe,

736
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:46,210
but I wasn't always this stupid.

737
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:54,620
There's a reason for me to be like this.

738
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,670
A reason for you to be like this?

739
00:50:57,670 --> 00:50:59,870
What's that?

740
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:07,210
Can't I resolve that for you?

741
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:18,290
There's absolutely no way you can help with that.

742
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:20,430
Absolutely none.

743
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:27,740
Your glass is empty.

744
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:30,730
Let's just drink.

745
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:34,070
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

746
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:47,600
I'm just saying we should have one more glass.

747
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,900
You can barely drink, and why do you always want "one more glass?"

748
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,880
I'm serious, just one more--

749
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,220
Are you okay?

750
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:16,830
♫ You're inside of fantasy that I can't reach ♫

751
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:24,090
♫ Show you to me ♫

752
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:31,400
♫ Even if I get a little bit closer, you go farther ♫

753

♫ Don't say ♫

755
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:44,240
We...

756
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,620
We shouldn't be doing this.

757
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:53,110
♫ I'm inviting you to me ♫

758
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:57,620
Let's go. I'll take you home.

Teddy bear Ajussi.

760
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:05,280
You seem like a really great person.

761
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,140
Really.

762
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:12,390
Sokcho night beach lady, you're a good person, too.

763
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:14,600
Really.

764
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:19,980
Ajussi.

765
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:24,490
Don't say such things to me. Why are you doing that to me?

766
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:28,770
I'm just going to go alone, don't follow me.

767
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:38,980

Se Chan, Se Jong.

769
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:01,300
The doctor says that Ms. Park is going to be okay.

770
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,030
So you don't have to worry.

771
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:11,750
Should we leave so Ms. Park can get her rest?

772
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:20,380
Se Chan, Se Jong, can you explain it to me now?

773
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:22,230
Why did a fire happen in the storage room?

774
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:25,060
We were lighting candles,

775
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:27,600
and then it caught on fire.

776
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,270
So why were you in the storage room lighting candles?

777
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,040
Se Chan, Se Jong.

778
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:46,300
You have to tell your dad, right?

779
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:52,170
The truth is, we thought you and Ms. Park liked each other,

780
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:54,370
so we wanted to help you two to get together.

781
00:54:54,370 --> 00:55:01,520
We decorated the storage room pretty with candles, balloons, and flowers to make it romantic.

782
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:07,050
Then we were going to lock you and Ms. Park in there.

783
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:12,730
- What?
- You and Ms. Park

784
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:16,040
looked like you were in a sad love.

785
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:23,270
So we thought we could help you to love each other.

786
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:31,680
Se Chan, Se Jong.

787
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,560
We're sorry, Dad!

788
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:40,870
We made a mistake...

789
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,300
Se Jong, it's okay.

790
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:47,300
It's okay, Se Chan.

791
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:51,000
Chairman, are you okay?

792
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:52,850
Yes, I'm fine.

793
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:55,880
Can you please take the kids and help wash and get to sleep?

794
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:58,530
I'll come when Ms. Park wakes up.

795
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:02,430
My apologies. If I hadn't left early today, it would've not happened.

796
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:05,280
It's not your fault. Please take care of the kids.

797
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,170
Yes, don't worry about it.

798
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:09,370
Let's go.

799
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:38,510
Ms. Park, are you alright?

800
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:40,760
Have you regained consciousness?

801
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,490
Se Chan...

802
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:44,420
Se Jong..!

803
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,890
Chairman, what about Se Chan and Se Jong?

804
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:52,590
Are the kids okay? Are they hurt anywhere?

805
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:55,330
Ms. Park, calm down.

806
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:58,650
Se Chan and Se Jong are safe, thanks to you.

807
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:01,150
They're not hurt anywhere.

808
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:07,150
That's such a relief.

809
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:10,570
Oh, it's such a relief.

810
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:13,650
Ms. Park, you inhaled a lot of smoke. Are you sure you're okay?

811
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:16,700
You were passed out for a few hours.

812
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:22,410
Chairman.

813
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:24,460
I'm not going to America.

814
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:28,990
I can't go to America. There's no way I'm going.

815
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:31,520
Ms. Park.

816
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,220
How can you say that in this circumstance?

817
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:36,890
I can't leave you and the kids. I won't go anywhere.

818
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:43,630
So, Chairman, please stop telling me to go to America.

819
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:49,000
Ms. Park, what is the matter with you?

820
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,750
Why are you doing this?

821
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:54,550
Chairman...

822
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:29,850
Ms. Park, are you feeling better?

823
00:58:29,850 --> 00:58:34,530
Yes. I'm fine now.

824
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:38,680
Ms. Park, thank you so much for yesterday.

825
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,830
I've been greatly obliged to you.

826
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:49,010
If it weren't for you, the kids, just thinking about it frightens me.

827
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:53,540
It's nothing. Saving the kids is what I should do.

828
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:57,890
Rather, I owe you my gratitude.

829
00:58:57,890 --> 00:59:00,540
You saved my life.

830
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:03,460
Thank you very much.

831
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:15,390
Ms. Park, I'm also very sorry.

832
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:18,690
I've been so rude to you.

833
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:20,300
♫ When I walk this road ♫

834
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:23,000
Chairman...

835
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,220
You're right. What you said was right.

836
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:29,470
I was being rude to you on purpose.

837
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:34,180
To send you off to America.

838
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,030
Chairman.

839
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:40,870
Ms. Park, stop being stubborn

840
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:43,870
and go to America with CEO Anna.

841
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:48,580
Unfurl your dreams in a brand new world.

842
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:54,820
I'm so much older, and I have three children.

843
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:59,190
You're too special to waste your life on me.

844
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:02,820
♫ the further it gets ♫

845
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:05,510
And Ms. Park,

846
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:09,960
I'm engaged to someone else.

847
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:14,240
I can't give you my heart, and I shouldn't be doing so.

848
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:18,660
So you and I

849
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:22,300
should just end things here.

850
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:31,090
♫ In case I lose it, I hold it tight ♫

851
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:38,090
♫ But love always runs away, chased by longing ♫

852
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:45,550
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

853
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:56,450
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

854
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:11,080
It's hot chocolate.

855
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,360
Take a sip.

856
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:26,800
Se Chan, Se Jong.

857
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:31,740
Please don't make any more situations like that to bring Ms. Park and me together.

858
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:35,190
But Dad, you and Ms. Park like each other.

859
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:37,330
That's why we did it.

860
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:40,660
Because we want you and Ms. Park to date.

861
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:48,890
You both know that I'm engaged to Chief Jo.

862
01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:54,360
To be engaged to someone and date another is foul play and wrong.

863
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:57,300
You both understand that as well, don't you?

864
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:05,830
And Se Chan and Se Jong, you both love Ms. Park, right?

865
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:12,200
If you love her, you should help her to be happy.

866
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:17,500
I've been married before and am older.

867
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,160
Plus, I have three children.

868
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:24,640
But Ms. Park is still a young and beautiful lady.

869
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:29,810
We should send her off so she can fulfill her dreams.

870
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:38,510
Hyung, why are you crying?

871
01:02:38,510 --> 01:02:41,620
I understand everything you've said, Dad.

872
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:45,680
But Chief Jo becoming our mother,

873
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,780
I really, really hate it, and it makes me scared.

874
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:53,300
If you're really going to get married to Chief Jo, just send me off to study abroad.

875
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:54,960
I'm scared too.

876
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,100
I'm going to follow Hyung and study abroad.

877
01:02:57,100 --> 01:03:07,620
If I don't, Chief Jo will put us in the dark storage room and lock us up again.

878
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:11,810
Se Chan, Se Jong.

879
01:03:11,810 --> 01:03:17,400
Chief Jo locked you both up in a dark storage room?

880
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,050
What are you talking about?

881
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:23,890
Are the short-rib-patties ready to eat?

882
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:25,540
Yes, they're done.

883
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:29,120
Don't grill the mushroom too long, or it will be too chewy.

884
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:32,210
I know better than you.

885
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:35,100
You put Se Jong's portion of clam soup separately, right?

886
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:38,090
Because of the spicy pepper, Se Jong can't have this.

887
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:41,730
I got it, I got it!

888
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:46,040
But why don't I see Ms. Park? Is she not coming down because the kids aren't here?

889
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:49,480
Oh, right. Ms. Park said she'd be coming back from the vacation home yesterday.

890
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:52,080
Has she not come home yet?

891
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,940
What did you say?

892
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:57,690
Ms. Park went to the vacation home yesterday?

893
01:03:57,690 --> 01:04:00,570
We're home.

894
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:04,480
You must have played really hard at the ski resort yesterday.

895
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,370
You all look so tired.

896
01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:11,740
But I thought this was supposed to be a "boy's only" trip. Why are you coming home with them, Ms. Park?

897
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:15,140
- Ah, it was--
- It was a boy's only trip.

898
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:17,080
But why did you go with them?

899
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:18,880
Did Chairman Lee call you?

900
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,410
Oh, I forgot my cell phone,

901
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:26,010
so Ms. Park brought it to the vacation house.

902
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:28,770
Ms. Park, go upstairs and get some rest.

903
01:04:28,770 --> 01:04:31,690
Yesterday must have scared you a lot.

904
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:33,190
Yes.

905
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:36,780
Kids, let's go upstairs.

906
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:52,050
Chairman, the meal is all prepared.

907
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:55,590
I have work at the company, so I'll be leaving.

908
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:03,420
Hey, now Ms. Park uses the kids as an excuse out in the open.

909
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:08,100
Wow, Ms. Park is so shameless. What do we do now?

910
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:16,730
I'm engaged to someone else.

911
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:20,420
I can't give you my heart, and I shouldn't be doing so.

912
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:24,890
So you and I should just end things here.

913
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:35,630
Ms. Park, we need to meet now.

914
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:51,930
Driver Kim, stop the car.

915
01:05:58,170 --> 01:06:01,380
Why did you want to see me?

916
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:09,190
Chief Jo...

917
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:10,650
Why are you doing this?

918
01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:12,770
Why did you go to the vacation house?

919
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:15,230
What were you thinking, going there?

920
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:20,340
I'm his fiancée, and even I didn't go there. Why did you go there? What were you scheming going over there?

921
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:24,100
You went there on purpose. You went there to seduce the Chairman, didn't you?

922
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:26,240
This is adultery.

923
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:29,270
Do you want me to spread you on social media as the mistress?

924
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:31,950
Do you want to live your life with a label as mistress at age 27?

925
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:36,550
Because of you, do you want to stigmatize Chairman as a cheater as well?

926
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:40,590
Is that really what you want?!

927
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:43,020
Chief Jo!

928
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:55,840
Chief Jo, what do you think you're doing to Ms. Park?

929
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:59,550
How can you take that girl's side at this moment as well?

930
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:02,820
Does it hurt your heart that much that I slapped her?

931
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:06,850
You didn't take me who is your fiancée, but why did you bring this girl?

932
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:10,100
What did you two do over there!

933
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,650
Chief Jo.

934
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:47,050
We spread banana peels on the floor in front of Chief Jo's room and made her fall.

935
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:49,020
We know we did wrong.

936
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:53,510
But then she locked even Se Jong with me in the storage room and turned off the light.

937
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:58,310
I'm really scared of Chief Jo, who did that to us.

938
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:23,710
Yes, Chairman.

939
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:28,350
Chief Jo, we need to meet now.

940
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:32,210
Okay.

941
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:03,920
Chief Jo.

942
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:12,560
Let's call off our engagement.

943
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:16,050
Excuse me?

944
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:19,950
Break our engagement?

945
01:09:19,950 --> 01:09:22,220

Hey, Park Dan Dan.

957
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:23,080
- Did you get fired?
- I'll just rest alone for a bit.

958
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,830
Where is Chairman Lee?! Get out here now!!!

959
01:10:24,830 --> 01:10:26,960
- What brings you here?
- How can you do this?!

960
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,940
I have nothing more to say about that matter.

961
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:31,590
Hey!! Who the hell do you think you are?!

962
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:32,890
I can't stop now.

963
01:10:32,890 --> 01:10:34,160
What do you think you're going to do now?

964
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:37,150
Madam, if you just help me, I can go back to the Chairman.

965

No matter how much I love Dae Beom, I really don't match with his family.

966
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:42,440
I should tidy up for her.

Oh, this looks a lot like Dan Dan's baby pictures.

What are you doing right now?

969
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:47,480
