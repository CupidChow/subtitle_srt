00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:03,840
[Episode 43]

2
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,840
Chairman, what's wrong?

3
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,300
Are you alright?

4
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,000
I... I'm fine. I'm fine.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,680
What was that sound? I just heard something breaking.

6
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,140
His water glass broke.

7
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:49,540
Ms. Park, leave it. You'll get hurt. I'll do it.

8
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,900
No, let me do it.

9
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,750
Ms. Park, I am going to get some air.

10
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,250
All right.

11
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,690
What was that? My heart is pounding.

12
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:21,430
I guess Chief Jo has a lot of unresolved issues with the Chairman.

13
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:26,850
If that's what really happened when he was 22 years old, it's understandable.

14
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,430
What am I saying?

15
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,800
I said I liked Ms. Park at that time also.

16
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,530
Then why would I do that with Chief Jo?

17
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,030
I must be remembering wrong.

18
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:03,950
It's a false memory. There is no way I would've done that.

19
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,000
What is that?

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,620
What are you eating all alone?

21
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,310
This? Dae Beom bought this for me a while ago

22
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,450
since I'm stressed out so much lately.

23
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,890
Why don't you have some, too?

24
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:34,050
You must be happy since your son is buying good stuff for you.

25
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,360
Mom, how do I look? Do I look different?

26
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,350
Yes, you're looking amazing.

27
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,730
Really?

28
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,830
Yeon Sil.

29
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:50,910
Well, yesterday Geon came with a woman.

30
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,410
What?

31
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,040
Did Geon bring a woman? Really?

32
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,810
Why didn't you tell us anything?

33
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,290
He must have wanted me to meet her first.

34
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,440
Seriously, Mom! You should have called me right away.

35
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,080
I would've quickly brought home some chicken then!

36
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,560
There wasn't any time to call.

37
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:18,230
They left right away as soon as they came in and sat down.

38
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:22,730
What? They left as soon as they sat down?

39
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,740
That's right. I felt uneasy.

40
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,970
I wonder if I did something wrong.

41
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,650
- I'm home.
- Geon.

42
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,740
I heard you brought a girl yesterday?

43
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,350
Mom, that woman from yesterday

44
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,530
is just someone I know.

45
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,690
She's just a friend.

46
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,600
So don't be confused.

47
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,530
Wait, what?

48
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,750
Why would you take someone you "just know" to your house?

49
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:00,040
If you take her all the way home, there must be something there.

50
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:06,140
You were also looking at her like she was the apple of your eye.

51
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:12,050
Goodness, Mother. I never looked at her like that. You're mistaken.

52
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,870
She has nothing to do with us.

53
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,280
So, don't get ahead of yourself.

54
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,720
I'm going to get some rest.

55
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,830
Wait...

56
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,250
What was that?

57
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,640
Dae Beom.

58
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,620
Yes, Se Ryun.

59
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,090
Do you deliver all the way out here? You're working hard.

60
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,560
If someone wants our chicken, I'll have to deliver it wherever that may be.

61
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,040
What about your father? Is he okay?

62
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,790
Yes. Thank you for contacting me at that time.

63
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:11,060
If you hadn't, it might've made things worse for my father and Dan Dan.

64
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,640
That's it?

65
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,900
- What?
- Don't just thank me with your words.

66
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,650
Treat me to a meal if you're really grateful.

67
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,700
The thing is, I'm hungry right now.

68
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,600
But I wondered what to do because I didn't want to eat by myself.

69
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:39,450
How is Dan Dan? Is she doing okay?

70
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,910
Yes. I think she's gotten a lot better.

71
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,250
So I'm back at my place now.

72
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,300
Good, that's a relief.

73
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,590
I hope Ms. Park and my brother's relationship works out.

74
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,420
I think they really like each other.

75
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,730
I sincerely hope they will work out.

76
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,750
Even though we broke up.

77
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:11,280
But I guess you don't feel the same way as I do.

78
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,010
Why? Are you against their relationship?

79
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,950
I wouldn't say I'm against it...

80
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,360
But I can also understand where my father is coming from.

81
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,970
It's not easy for my father to allow their relationship.

82
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,400
I only thought about how the two of them felt.

83
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:34,040
But I guess he could feel that way as a father of a daughter.

84
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,950
I really don't know why everything has to be so hard.

85
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,450
You said you were hungry. Why aren't you eating?

86
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,070
Stop talking and hurry up and eat.

87
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:50,920
You're right. It's weird, but I talk a lot when I'm with you.

88
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,660
Trivial things become fun too.

89
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,210
Remember how it was?

90
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,570
It won't taste good if it gets cold.

91
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,830
All right.

92
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:08,980
Anyway. I'm so happy to eat with you in a while.

93
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,340
This curry is so delicious too!

94
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,530
Try this also.

95
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:32,580
♫ I can barely see it, flickering ♫

96
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,310
Hurry up and eat.

97
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:42,340
♫ The road wrapped in the mist ♫

98

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,490
♫ The road like a rainbow ♫

100
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,680
Goodbye, Se Ryun.

101
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,140
Goodbye, Dae Beom.

102
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,040
♫  Where is it waiting for me?  ♫

103
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,410
♫  It's hard to find even if I look around  ♫

104
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,800
Dae Beom!

105
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:17,950
The curry was really delicious. Thank you.

106
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,680
Sure.

107
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,150
♫  So I can find the way that's given to me  ♫

108
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,750
Why aren't you going?

109
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,880
I'm going to go. You go ahead first.

110
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,880
No, you go first.

111
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,810
I'll watch you go and then leave.

112
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,890
No!

113
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,930
You go first.

114

Dae Beom.

119
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:21,670
- Se Ryun.
- I'm sorry.

120
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,500
I did everything wrong.

121
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,210
No, you didn't do anything wrong. I'm sorry.

122
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,830
Dae Beom...

123
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,310
♫ The hidden road of mine ♫

124
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,000
Don't cry, silly.

125
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,710
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,910
You didn't do anything wrong.

127
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,730
It's all on me. I'm really sorry.

128
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,490
Chief Jo.

129
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,180
The reason I asked to see you

130
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,920
is that I wanted to make my position clear.

131
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,920
I called off our wedding, Chief Jo.

132
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,250
Things are definitely over between us.

133
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,320
- Chairman.
- You know this fact too.

134
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,810
So, just tell me honestly.

135
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,670
What is it that you really want from me?

136
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,240
Was the alimony not enough?

137
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,240
Then I will give you more.

138
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,200
Tell me how much you need.

139
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,450
Chairman.

140
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,510
You told me...

141
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,020
You told me that you liked me and loved me.

142
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,360
We even promised our future together.

143
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,850
But because your memories from when you reverted to 22 years old disappeared, you abandoned me overnight.

144
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:01,030
But I didn't hate you.

145
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:05,450
I'm waiting for you, without resenting you once.

146
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,600
I've been waiting, but how could you...

147
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,260
How can you ask me if the money wasn't enough?

148
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,110
Chairman.

149
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:20,190
How could you trample over me so miserably like this?

150
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,200
While Young Ae Unni was holding onto her last breath,

151
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,630
she asked me to take care of you and the children.

152
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,990
That's why I took care of you and raised the children.

153
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,680
I really did my very best.

154
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,960
You're asking me what is it that I want?

155
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,560
All right. I will tell you since you asked.

156
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,610
Just like in the past, I want to be next to the three children,

157
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,530
Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong.

158
00:11:54,530 --> 00:12:01,550
I want to live by your side as I did before.

159
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,500
That is all I hope for.

160
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,450
Chief Jo.

161
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:15,230
Let me tell you clearly. You can't do that.

162
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:19,230
I like Ms. Park.

163
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:23,710
The person I currently like is Ms. Park.

164
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,860
Chairman...

165
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:34,830
So please don't come to see us anymore.

166
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,440
You're a really bad person!

167
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,330
Do you think only your love is important?

168
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:57,130
Is my love inferior?

169
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:02,380
Are only your memories precious? Are mine trash?

170
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,620
Then your feelings for Ms. Park, that brat is real.

171
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,510
But your feelings towards mine were fake?

172
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,430
What's the identity of your love then?

173
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,900
How are you so sure about what is real?

174
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,040
Lee Young Gook.

175
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,910
Fine.

176
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,060
I'm ready to take this as far as I need to.

177
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,280
You bastard.

178
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:53,710
Out of all the women...

179
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,250
why is it, Ms. Park?

180
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:00,770
How could you trample over me like this for a good-for-nothing brat like her?

181
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:04,070
After how I devoted myself to you?

182
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:18,030
Just because I used to work here...

183
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:23,070
am I some toy you can play around with and then dispose of?

184
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,210
Just wait and see, Chairman. I'm sure you will regret this later.

185
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,730
Once your memories come back,

186
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,590
you'll kneel down and apologize to me!

187
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:55,270
What in the world did I do when I was 22 years old?

188
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,470
Just what did I do...

189
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,090
for Chief Jo to talk to me that way?

190
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,640
Young Gook.

191
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,650
I can't understand you fully,

192
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,490
but I can understand how you feel a little.

193
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,530
Jung Woo.

194
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:20,620
As you said, I'm actually really afraid.

195
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,240
I wonder if I really did that.

196
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,660
I wonder what I did back then.

197
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:32,580
The person I really like is Ms. Park, but I got engaged to Chief Jo.

198
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,420
What if all my memories come back and everything Chief Jo said is true?

199
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,700
Also, just because I can't remember...

200
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,700
I wonder if it's okay for me to hurt a woman like that.

201
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,960
Hey, Lee Young Gook.

202
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,220
Pull yourself together.

203
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,880
It's true that you and Chief Jo got engaged.

204
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,740
But whether or not you and Chief Jo had a relationship or not...

205
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,890
we won't know until your memories come back.

206
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:02,540
We only have Chief Jo's claims.

207
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,940
There's no evidence at all.

208
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:10,650
So just be true to your current feelings.

209
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:15,590
You already gave her alimony for calling off the wedding.

210
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,340
Also, Young Gook.

211
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:22,190
You're not the type to date multiple women like that.

212
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,620
I know that better than anyone.

213
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,470
Jung Woo.

214
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:32,780
Also, I'll meet up with Chief Jo soon.

215
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,850
You have nothing to worry about.

216
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,450
Let's just drink.

217
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,510
Chairman.

218
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,290
Ms. Park. Why are you out here?

219
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,110
Were you waiting for me until now?

220
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:12,070
Yes. I was so worried after you left like that.

221
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,110
This makes me really happy.

222
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:19,040
The fact that someone is worried about me and waiting for me.

223
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,060
Of course, I will do that.

224
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,430
You are my boyfriend.

225
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:33,730
Ms. Park. Your hands are freezing.

226
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,880
Just how long did you wait for me?

227
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,600
It's fine.

228
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,160
It's not a big deal.

229
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,670
From now on, don't wait for me in the cold like this, and just call me.

230
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,090
Then I'll hurry back home.

231
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:48,440
Okay. I will do that.

232
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:53,000
It seems like you drank quite a bit. Let's get you some food.

233
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,290
I'll treat you to a nice bowl of ramen today.

234
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,280
What do you say?

235
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,250
That sounds good. Let's go.

236
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,150
Okay.

237
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:14,120
Chairman. You can see so many stars today.

238
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,060
You are right.

239
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,770
Chairman, do you remember that time?

240
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:23,400
When I got lost and hurt my leg at the vacation home.

241
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,540
You carried me on your back.

242
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,080
The stars were so pretty that day also.

243
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,800
I remember.

244
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:38,880
I love that we can look back at our very own memories.

245
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,470
Honestly, when you reverted to 22 years old...

246
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,680
you couldn't remember anything about me.

247
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,430
So I was really sad at that time.

248
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,220
I'm sorry.

249
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,110
No, it's fine. It's not like you did it on purpose.

250
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,830
You remember everything now.

251
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,500
But now...

252
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:12,890
I can't remember the time I turned 22 years old.

253
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,590
I'm sorry.

254
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:21,390
Why do you keep saying sorry? I told you, it's really fine.

255
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,920
But if your memories from that time come back,

256
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,770
you're going to feel really bad and embarrassed towards me.

257
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,220
You may want to move to another country.

258
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,680
You were like, "Ms. Park Noona!"

259
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,120
There you go again!

260
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,980
You can't just make some nonsense up.

261
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,270
Get on my back, Ms. Park.

262
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,030
I'll carry you to commemorate this starry night.

263
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,140
You can't, Chairman. You drank.

264
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,440
What if I fall?

265
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,870
I didn't drink that much.

266
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,710
Also, carrying you is a piece of cake.

267
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,330
Come on. Get on my back.

268
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,440
All right!

269
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,990
- Oh, man.
- Chairman! I think I'm going to fall! Please let me down.

270
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,680
I'm just kidding.

271
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,330
Ms. Park, you're so gullible.

272
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,280
Oh, come on!

273
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,860
Carrying you on my back makes me really happy.

274
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,240
I must be heavy. Why would you be happy?

275
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,410
Don't even think about telling a lie like that.

276
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,550
Sarah. I made your favorite dishes,

277
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:30,240
Galbi-jjim and spring cabbage geotjeori!

278
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,560
Hurry up and try it.

279
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,130
Try this too.

280
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,810
Mom, I'll eat on my own time.

281
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:44,030
You should eat a lot.

282
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,140
Sarah.

283
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,770
I told you once before, right?

284
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,960
Let's leave Seoul.

285
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,810
Let's just leave this place now.

286
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:00,340
Se Jong is doing well in that home.

287
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,630
So, forget about Se Jong now.

288
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:06,110
Let's go down to Jeju or go up to Mount Jiri.

289
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:10,410
Or shall we go abroad? Where would you like to go?

290
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,930
Okay, Mom. Let's do that.

291
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,320
Let's leave to wherever it may be.

292
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,960
Yes, let's do that.

293
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,420
There's no point for us to struggle here.

294
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,510
We'll start fresh. It'll be a new start!

295
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,910
Hurry up and eat this. Eat and regain your energy.

296
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,570
Then we'll leave this place without any regrets.

297
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,420
All right? Hurry up and eat.

298
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,840
- Mom...
- Eat a lot.

299
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,820
Let's do that.

300
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,790
Eat it together with this geotjeori.

301
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,420
Eat it, and—

302
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:43,060
Wh-What is it?

303
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,900
She can barely eat these days.

304
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,320
That's all because she's stressed.

305
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,770
Seriously, I'm so anxious and upset...

306
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,850
Why does this keep happening when I didn't eat anything?

307
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,890
No way.

308
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,380
Welcome.

309
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,840
I'd like one pregnancy test, please.

310
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,550
The only thing that can change my pathetic life...

311
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,430
is to meet a rich man and marry him.

312
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:56,220
I have been working hard for that until now.

313
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:00,130
I don't want to bet...

314
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,830
the last opportunity in my life on you.

315
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:44,470
Am I really...

316
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,340
pregnant?

317
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,620
What do I do?

318
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,840
How?

319
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,000
Hello.

320
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:28,190
- I would like an abortion...
- Oh, okay.

321
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:32,380
You need to receive tests and consultation first, so please have a seat.

322
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,890
Please fill this out first.

323
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,840
Look here.

324
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,270
What is that?

325
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,660
What am I going to do from now on?

326
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,360
What do I do?

327
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,050
Please back off from now on.

328
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,270
From now on,

329
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,270
I will take care of Ms. Park.

330
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,640
I can't trust you anymore.

331
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,970
I'm only going to trust the Chairman from now on.

332
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:56,290
If he asks me to marry him,

333
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,680
I will marry him.

334
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:09,300
What am I going to do with my Dan Dan?

335
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,570
Hold on.

336
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,490
Ji Young said she'd meet with Dan Dan, but why hasn't she gotten back to me?

337
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:20,640
Was she not able to see her?

338
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,980
Hello?

339
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,870
Hello?

340
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,520
Wh-What's wrong?

341
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,460
Soo Chul...

342
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:34,310
Hello?

343
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,140
Hello?

344
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,300
Ji Young.

345
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:58,590
Soo Chul.

346
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,020
Ji Young.

347
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:06,530
Wake up, Ji Young. Ji Young!

348
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,310
[Patient: An** Kim]
[Doctor in charge: Paik Hong Jong]
[Nurse in charge: Lee Ji Ha]

349
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,090
Are you feeling better?

350
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:33,590
Soo Chul.

351
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:37,540
Where am I?

352
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,770
We're at the hospital.

353
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:42,140
Are you okay?

354
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:46,050
I think it's because I've been stressed about Dan Dan lately.

355
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:50,020
- Lie down.
- I'm fine now.

356
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,290
Did you meet with Dan Dan?

357
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,890
- What did she say?
- Dan Dan...

358
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:00,080
She doesn't even want to look at me.

359
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:05,000
What are we going to do with our Dan Dan now?

360
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:12,860
I met with Chairman Lee too.

361
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:17,830
I think he's thinking about marrying her.

362
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,760
What?

363
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,500
Is he thinking about marrying her? Did he really say that?

364
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,790
Yes.

365
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,900
What a shameless punk.

366
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,770
How could he think to marry Dan Dan?

367
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:32,240
The punk has three kids.

368
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,690
How could you neglect your health this much

369
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:47,610
when you received surgery for cancer not long ago?

370
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:50,840
Your immune system is compromised, so you need rest.

371
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:56,080
I think it'll be best for you to stay a few nights at the hospital.

372
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,970
Okay, Doctor.

373
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,880
I'll get going.

374
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,100
Don't push yourself too much.

375
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,590
What are you going to do about Dan Dan?

376
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:17,370
Don't worry about it from now on. I'll take care of it.

377
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,570
Dan Dan found out about everything.

378
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:22,660
She's never going to go to America with you now.

379
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:27,280
Take good care of your body.

380
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,780
Go back safely to America.

381
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,730
I'm truly sorry.

382
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,490
I'm so happy I got to spend time with you.

383
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,110
- Is Seung Ho cooler or me?
- What's going on over there?

384
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,810
- You, of course!
- What are they doing?

385
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,530
You are a cutie!

386
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:09,450
My gosh, those two are back together again.

387
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,590
That couple really makes me sick.

388
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:14,120
They break up and get back together, then do it all over again.

389
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,810
My gosh, I feel sick.

390
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,640
What's that over there?

391
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,410
- What? What is it?
- Se Ryun.

392
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:24,450
- I wasn't going to kiss you, but you looked back.
- What was that?

393
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,870
It's hard to date someone.

394
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:30,390
But breaking up with someone is a hundred times harder.

395
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:34,140
How would you, a guy who's been single all his life, know about that?

396
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,940
Just let them be.

397
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,880
By the way, when is Hyun Bin coming?

398
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,520
Where is he right now?

399
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,060
I don't know.

400
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:47,170
He says he's in Spain and then Turkey.

401
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:51,700
The kid is like Robin Hood, popping up here and there.

402
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,920
I'm jealous.

403
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,530
What is taking Dae Beom so long?

404
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:00,620
We have to prepare to open.

405
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,700
Seriously. He said he was going to meet a friend yesterday.

406
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,260
Where in the world is he and not coming back until now?

407
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,930
This little punk better be ready for me when he gets back.

408
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:11,310
He went into the restaurant district with that young lady just now.

409
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:14,500
Are you talking about Dae Beom?

410
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,800
How did your son can't break up and get back together with that young lady again?

411
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,520
Just now at the restaurant district,

412
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,910
the two of them were kissing with their arms linked as they walked.

413
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,290
Are they getting married or something?

414
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,900
What are you talking about?

415
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,440
Young lady? What young lady?

416
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,450
The young lady that worked part-time here.

417
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:37,010
- What?
- What are you talking about?

418
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:42,160
Is it... Se Ryun?

419
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,930
Hey, Dae Beom! Are you seeing Se Ryun again?

420
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,270
- How did you know that?
- Seriously.

421
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,570
My gosh, are you crazy? You're crazy!

422
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:52,060
How could you date her again after all you went through?

423
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,090
It hurts! Just use your words.

424
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:56,240
- How can I just use my words?
- Ouch!

425
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,900
You can never date Se Ryun, you hear me?

426
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:02,630
That brat will dump you again once she meets another guy!

427
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:04,660
She's right, Dae Beom.

428
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:08,040
How can you date that girl again?

429
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,190
Grandma and Mom. It just happened.

430
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:13,460
- So just accept it.
- Gosh, you little!

431
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,650
He's killing me!

432
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,310
My gosh, they really suck the life out of you.

433
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:20,190
What do I do?

434
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,520
Who would that be?

435
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,420
Oh, my!

436
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:37,670
It's Dae Beom's mother.

437
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,060
What do I do?

438
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,910
What do I do?

439
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:47,490
- Have you been well, Mother? Hello.
- No, I haven't been well.

440
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:50,360
What are you doing? Why are you toying with Dae Beom again?

441
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,720
Are you bored again now that you've broken up with that punk?

442
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,980
Is that why you approached Dae Beom again?

443
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,120
Mother, that's not what happened.

444
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,410
Do you think we're a complete joke?

445
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,410
No matter how poor we are...

446
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:03,850
you can't keep toying with us and then disposing of us.

447
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:05,720
How could you do this?

448
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,060
Mother. Please calm down.

449
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:11,240
Dae Beom and I love each other.

450
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,280
We will never break up again.

451
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,020
Dae Beom and I are thinking about marriage.

452
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,980
As long as you allow it,

453
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,890
I want to marry Dae Beom.

454
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:24,260
Marry, my foot.

455
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:27,940
You try to marry all these men and then call it off.

456
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,190
Do you have any shame?

457
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:34,360
Don't even dream about marrying Dae Beom. Got it?

458
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:48,170
They're going to get married? Se Ryun and Dae Beom?

459
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:52,250
Yes. I really think I'm going to die early.

460
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:55,480
- I told her I wouldn't allow that marriage even if I died.
- What?

461
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,710
Did you say no?

462
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,220
You must be crazy.

463
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,510
You can't just hastily object to it without knowing all the facts.

464
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:07,920
- This isn't something you should oppose right away.
- Why not?

465
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,960
Se Ryun is seven years older than Dae Beom.

466
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,710
Also, Se Ryun comes back to him only after she's broken up with her potential fiancé.

467
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,370
Then she'll meet another guy and do the same thing again.

468
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:20,460
She'll end up breaking up with Dae Beom. That's the kind of girl she is!

469
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,480
Younger-sister-in-law.

470
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,590
Look, if Se Ryun and Dae Beom get married,

471
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,460
he'll get her share.

472
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,680
Why would you kick that ball of good luck away?

473
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,740
What are you saying?

474
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,430
Oh, you mean the share you mentioned last time?

475
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,860
Yes, that share.

476
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,760
Se Ryun's late father,

477
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,060
the former Chairman of FT Group, left a share of the company to Se Ryun.

478
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,410
He saw to it that she'd receive it once she got married.

479
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:51,480
That's why Mrs. Wang is trying so hard to get her married.

480
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,990
But if Se Ryun gets married to Dae Beom...

481
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:57,980
a share of the company will fall right onto her lap.

482
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,600
Who will that money eventually go to?

483
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,610
Are you saying it'll come to us?

484
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,770
That's right!

485
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:09,270
Then around how much is that share worth?

486
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:12,480
Is it around 1 billion won?

487
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,660
What are you saying?

488
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:17,340
You can't even buy an apartment with that money.

489
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,640
- Then is it 10 billion won?
- 10 billion? Are you joking?

490
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,050
Then is it 50 billion won?

491
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:26,040
F-fifty billion won, my foot!

492
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,650
Do you think FT Group is some mom-and-pop shop in a neighborhood?

493
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:33,590
- Younger-sister-in-law!
- Goodness.

494
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,830
- 50 billion won?
- Yes, 50 billion won.

495
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:38,710
Why is Soo Chul not back yet? Where did he go?

496
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,450
He's going to be a little late.

497
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,680
His military mate's father passed away,

498
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,660
- so he went to the funeral home in Incheon.
- Oh.

499
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,770
Is that so?

500
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,650
Dae Beom! Tell us what's going on in front of everyone.

501
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:57,180
Are you really going to marry Se Ryun?

502
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:02,750
I'm against it because I'm afraid she might dump you again, just like last time.

503
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,810
Gosh, Mom. That's not going to happen now.

504
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:07,150
So please, view her more positively.

505
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:14,210
If you're going to marry her, you should formally introduce her to us instead of being swung around by her.

506
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:16,270
Are you allowing it then, Mom?

507
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:20,080
Thank you, Mom. We were actually going to go to Se Ryun's home tomorrow,

508
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,980
and also come here to formally announce our relationship.

509
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,490
- Really?
- Oh, my gosh. R-Really?

510
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,300
Yes.

511
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:32,660
But I'm against it.

512
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:38,390
What? Why would you be against it when it's my son getting married?

513
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:41,780
They like each other so much.

514
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,680
Don't you think it's time for them to get married?

515
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,710
No, it's because you didn't see what happened.

516
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:50,580
Yeon Sil, get yourself together.

517
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,600
That brat only comes after Dae Beom when she needs him.

518
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,560
What faith do you have in her to allow this marriage?

519
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,000
With marriage, one's life is dependent on it.

520
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,740
What if he gets married and gets divorced soon after?

521
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:07,040
That will make our Dae Beom a divorcé.

522
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,020
What if she runs away from him after all the chasing?

523
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,650
What are you going to do then?

524
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,100
Grandma, it's not the same this time.

525
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,800
Right. She won't ever do that again.

526
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,640
If they get divorced, she'll become a divorcée.

527
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,560
She will also have to give Dae Beom alimony.

528
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,720
That's right.

529
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,080
They wouldn't break up again.

530
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,800
Dae Beom, do you really want to get married?

531
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,730
Yes. Please allow it, Grandma.

532
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,350
It's a shame to send my precious baby.

533
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:43,400
I can't believe he'll marry a brat that's seven years older.

534
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,490
Grandma! Age is nothing but a number.

535
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:50,200
My Se Ryun is like a baby. A cute baby.

536
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,600
What a joke.

537
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,950
- Hey, you punk. Do you like her that much?
- Good job.

538
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:59,250
- The persimmon fell.
- But wait.

539
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,760
If you're going to meet her family...

540
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,560
and they're against this, this marriage won't happen.

541
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,660
Mom, if their minds are set, they'll have to make it happen no matter what.

542
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,070
Why do you keep hoping they won't get married?

543
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,870
They are like two peas in a pod.

544
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:17,390
That's why they couldn't break up and got back together.

545
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,200
- That one!
- I got it!

546
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:38,150
- It's not over.
- It's not over yet!

547
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,260
We won!

548
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,080
We won!

549
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,690
Go!

550
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,700
All right, let's go!

551
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,890
Awesome, so cool!

552
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,950
You got this, Dad! You can do it!

553
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:03,690
You got this!

554
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,320
Chairman. I'm quite good at this.

555
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:13,430
You probably never tried anything like this. Are you going to be all right?

556
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:17,640
Well, how about we find out?

557
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:23,200
♫  Why are you so far away that I can't catch you? ♫

558
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:31,110
♫ How much more do I need to cry for you to come to me ♫

559
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,930
♫ From now on, shake that booty ♫

560
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,560
♫ Shake that booty from now ♫

561
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,410
♫  Don't stop that shake that booty. Yeah baby I got you baby ♫

562
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:40,540
♫ Just make you freak your body. Come and get you freak your body ♫

563
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:43,770
♫ Sech-Ki, Dance. Sech-Ki Dance. Let me see you freak that body ♫

564
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:47,280
Go, Dad! Go, Dad!

565
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:53,380
Awesome!

566
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:57,560
Ms. Park. Do you even know how much DDR I played back in the day?

567
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,310
I played it day and night.

568
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,500
Don't worry, Ms. Park.

569
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,900
We still have the basketball game left.

570
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,510
We'll win that one, too.

571
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:11,030
I'm going to win everything!

572
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:13,520
- We have to win!
- Yes, we will.

573
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:22,350
Throw it, Se Jong!

574
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,310
We won!

575
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:34,760
♫  A smile blooms in every step  ♫

576
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,410
♫  It's a shiny day because of you  ♫

577
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,590
♫ It's sunshine day ♫

578
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:48,420
♫ Strangely, I'm drawn to you ♫

579
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:53,250
♫ Nobody will understand me ♫

580
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,630
Kids. Shall I take a picture for you?

581
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:58,220
- Yes!
- Okay.

582
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:02,220
♫ It's a happy day like a dream, yeah ♫

583
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:09,030
♫ Woo, you are always my love ♫

584
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:12,310
All right, look here.

585
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:15,460
One, two, three.

586
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:18,010
♫ It is breezy wind ♫

587
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:20,020
One more picture.

588
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:23,930
♫ Woo, you are my love ♫

589
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:31,580
It came out well even though it's nighttime.

590
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,820
You're right!

591
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,910
Send this picture to us too.

592
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:37,350
Of course, I will.

593
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:41,000
Se Jong is so cute. Se Chan too.

594
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,090
Everyone, say hello. I'm going to marry this man.

595
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:49,920
His name is Park Dae Beom.

596
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,070
Hello.

597
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:00,830
Se Ryun.

598
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:04,640
Hey, Lee Se Ryun. Have you gone mad?

599
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,690
Lee Se Ryun, you. What are you blabbering?

600
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:10,310
"Marry this man?"

601
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:15,370
Hey, how dare you bring this gold digger home?

602
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:25,860
Take that punk out of here right now!

603
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,700
The kids are watching.

604
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:41,190
We caused a ruckus with you here.

605
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:42,860
I'm sorry.

606
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,300
It's fine.

607
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,260
You kids go on up.

608
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,510
- Okay.
- Okay.

609
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:53,390
Uncle. Let's play the 3-6-9 game later.

610
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:56,230
Welcome, Uncle!

611
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:17,540
The two of you are going to get married?

612
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:20,870
Yes. That's why we came to officially meet the family.

613
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:24,320
You allowed our marriage when you turned 22 years old.

614
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,400
So you can't take your word back.

615
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,180
What? Did I allow your marriage?

616
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:35,880
Yes. You definitely allowed me to marry Dae Beom.

617
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,710
You said, "There's no problem as long as you like each other."

618
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:45,410
Do you know what you said when I told you my mom was against it because of our backgrounds?

619
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:48,000
What did I say?

620
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,050
You said, "Our family is rich, so what's to worry about?"

621
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:55,740
- Did I say that?
- Yes.

622
00:44:55,740 --> 00:45:01,900
You'll know I'm not lying once your memory of 3 months as a 22-year-old comes back.

623
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:06,300
You also said, "Your love is all that matters."

624
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:09,600
You allowed it so easily.

625
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:15,430
Then why didn't the two of you get married back then?

626
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:19,120
We tried to get married at that time...

627
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:24,230
but we were unable to overcome our different lifestyles.

628
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:26,570
As you can see, there was the issue with my mom too.

629
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:34,340
We broke up because of many reasons. But I finally realized that Dae Beom is the only one

630
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:38,320
who believes in me exactly the way I am.

631
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:43,660
So, I really want to marry Dae Beom now.

632
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:54,530
I know I'm not good enough, but my love for Se Ryun is sincere.

633
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:06,570
What? Your brother allowed your marriage?

634
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:12,260
Yes. So we're going to go to Dae Beom's house to get permission now.

635
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,980
On whose accord? Whose!

636
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,900
My own accord!

637
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:22,420
Mom, like you said, I'm turning 40 soon.

638
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:28,220
I want to be free and live with the person I love now.

639
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:37,300
Fine! Fine then, do whatever you want.

640
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:41,920
I'm not going to attend your wedding. So go ahead and have that wedding.

641
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,940
Fine.

642
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,240
All right!

643
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:53,220
You decide whether you attend or not.

644
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:58,190
I would be so grateful if you come to congratulate me.

645
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:03,550
But even if you don't come, there's nothing you can do about it.

646
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:07,040
Do whatever you want, Mom.

647
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,960
We're going to go now.

648
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,290
Dae Beom. Let's go.

649
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,310
Goodbye.

650
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:44,670
That cruel girl...

651
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,200
That brat...

652
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:51,640
You came on time, Honey.

653
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,650
I was about to call you.

654
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:57,830
Is it someone's birthday today? Or is there a party?

655
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:03,960
No, that's not it. I was going to tell you beforehand, but I wasn't able to.

656
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,250
Dae Beom wants to get married.

657
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:09,750
Get married?

658
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:12,880
Is he dating someone?

659
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,030
It's with S-Se Ryun.

660
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:19,300
He said he's going to get married to Se Ryun.

661
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,910
So they're on their way to introduce themselves officially.

662
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:24,450
What?

663
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:29,550
Are you serious? You didn't even tell me.

664
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:33,620
That's why you made all this food so they can get married?

665
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:39,150
What can I do then? They just can't stay apart.

666
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:42,710
The two of them are meant to be. They can't ever break up.

667
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:45,030
That's why I allowed it.

668
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:48,080
Who said you could do that?

669
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:51,120
You saw how Madam threw money on my face.

670
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,570
Did you forget what those people did to us?

671
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:59,280
On top of that, Lady Se Ryun is Chairman Lee's little sister. How can we become a family with them?

672
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,110
Dae Beom isn't going to live with that ridiculous woman. He's going to live with Se Ryun.

673
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:08,460
They can't live without each other. It's not right for us as parents to split them apart.

674
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:11,800
Gosh, your children are going to resent you later.

675
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,880
I know you can't understand.

676
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,180
But just look the other way and allow it.

677
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:21,190
I told you, I won't allow it!

678
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:23,450
I allowed it! Me!

679
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:26,300
So just pretend to give in and let it go.

680
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:30,150
I'm allowing my son to marry her, so what's your problem?

681
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:33,510
What did you say? "My son?"

682
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:36,060
You didn't discuss the matter with Dan Dan with me either.

683
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,730
You didn't even let me get involved.

684
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:41,250
So why are you doing this to Dae Beom when I'm allowing it?

685
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:44,790
Yeon Sil. Why would you say something like that?

686
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:47,560
Noona. Stop.

687
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:53,840
Fine. Do whatever you want then.

688
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,170
- Older-brother-in-law...
- Honey.

689
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:58,200
Where are you going, Soo Chul?

690
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:05,050
What's wrong with Soo Chul?

691
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:11,810
Father.

692
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:13,120
Hello, Father.

693
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,790
Where are you going?

694
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:17,000
Go on in.

695
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:23,190
What do we do?

696
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:30,260
Se Ryun. We said we'll overcome whatever hardship that comes our way together.

697
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:33,950
Okay.

698
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:39,760
Just like how you endured for us earlier, I can do it too.

699
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,290
All right. Let's go in.

700
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:52,090
Here. Eat this fruit too.

701
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:54,500
I'm so full from dinner.

702
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:57,870
So, how did you like my food?

703
00:50:57,870 --> 00:51:00,850
Mother-in-law, it was really delicious.

704
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:04,710
Your food is exactly to my liking.

705
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:08,690
Gosh, thank you for enjoying my food.

706
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:12,950
Anyway, congratulations again,

707
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:15,390
now that Chairman Lee allowed your marriage too.

708
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:20,450
The two of you went through so much all this time, but now that it's meant to happen, it's smooth sailing.

709
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:25,270
You're right. Also, my little brother Soo Chul.

710
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:30,180
He may not be happy now, but once he sees you two living happily, he'll end up allowing it.

711
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,490
So don't worry too much.

712
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:35,390
- All right?
- Okay.

713
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:40,670
Don't we have to set a date for the families to meet now?

714
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:46,180
- What date should I arrange it, young lady?
- Hey.

715
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:50,650
She's basically your daughter-in-law now. Don't call her "Young lady."

716
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:54,040
She's right, Mother-in-law. Just call me by my name.

717
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,840
Oh, all right then.

718
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:00,460
Se Ryun. What should we do?

719
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:06,770
My brother said he'll go along with whatever you decide here.

720
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:11,700
My gosh, how generous and nice of Chairman Lee.

721
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:16,040
But where will you live after you get married?

722
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:20,520
We don't have the means to buy a house for you.

723
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:24,330
I discussed it with Dae Beom.

724
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:27,580
I would like to try living here for six months.

725
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,120
Wh-What did you say?

726
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,570
H-here?

727
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:35,320
Our house has no room, though.

728
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,680
The storage room over there. I'm thinking of using that.

729
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,210
You can stay in my room, Uncle.

730
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:44,120
Se Ryun said she wants to live here.

731
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,970
I see. But you'll be uncomfortable living with us.

732
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:49,560
No, it's fine.

733
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:54,930
During that time, I really want to get close to you, Grandma, and my father-in-law.

734
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:58,810
We have to get used to each other, or else it'll be awkward.

735
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:04,880
You're coming from a good place, but I'm not sure if you'll get along well.

736
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,080
Mom. She said she'd going to try.

737
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:13,340
Anyway, I'm so jealous of you. There are no daughters-in-law like her these days.

738
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:18,820
No matter how much you ask them to live with their parents, they don't want to.

739
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:24,250
I want to become a real family with Dae Beom's family.

740
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:27,050
I think we need some time to get to know each other.

741
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:30,770
I look forward to getting along.

742
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:36,230
Eat this.

743
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:38,300
Eat this, too, Se Ryun.

744
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:02,100
What was this dream?

745
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:05,320
Was it a dream or what?

746
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:59,270
Ajussi. Can we meet for a bit if you have time today?
[Teddy Bear Ajussi]

747
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,370
What will I do from now?

748
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:26,230
What do I do?

749
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:42,380
Yes, Lawyer Koh.

750
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:53,240
Why did you want to see me, Lawyer Koh?

751
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:58,010
I wanted to meet to ask if the alimony you received wasn't enough.

752
00:55:58,010 --> 00:55:59,970
Did Chairman send you?

753
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:04,040
Does he want me to take the money and leave him alone?

754
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:07,090
Chief Jo.

755
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:10,430
Let's try talking realistically.

756
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:13,980
It's been a while since the engagement was called off.

757
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:18,690
Chairman Lee Young Gook has absolutely no feelings for you now, Chief Jo.

758
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:21,330
That's why he called off the engagement.

759
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:25,390
There's no relationship between a man and a woman who doesn't feel anything for each other.

760
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:30,690
What good will come for you not letting go like this?

761
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:33,490
Chairman Lee is having a tough time, too.

762
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,980
So don't let it get messy and end it here.

763
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:40,470
You should start a new life, Chief Jo.

764
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:49,090
Lawyer Koh. Chairman is acting that way because he doesn't remember his time with me.

765
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:50,970
But that's not the case for me.

766
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:56,500
I remember everything like yesterday. How can I get over it overnight?

767
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,570
I can't do that.

768
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:04,010
I'm going to wait until his memory comes back.

769
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:09,690
I'm still his fiancée.

770
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:15,490
I'll ask since you're a lawyer.

771
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:21,480
Just because one gets blackout, makes a drunken mistake, and says they can't remember...

772
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,560
Does that make the wrong disappear?

773
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,280
It does not.

774
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:35,820
What did Chief Jo say?

775
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:39,660
She didn't budge. She's stubborn.

776
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:47,700
As you said, I don't think it's money that Chief Jo wants.

777
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:53,210
She's certain that you'll go back to her once your memory comes back.

778
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:56,450
She said she would wait until then.

779
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:05,680
Young Gook. I told you.

780
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:10,130
There's nothing Chief Jo can do until your memory comes back.

781
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:14,410
So don't get too stressed about your lost memory.

782
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:17,260
You understand what I'm saying, right?

783
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:21,090
Yes, I do. Thank you, Lawyer Koh.

784
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:23,630
I'll get going then.

785
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,800
That cruel girl.

786
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,650
Se Ryun, that cruel girl. She's no longer my daughter.

787
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:46,320
Fine. Who cares if she lives in that parasitic home?

788
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:50,770
Even if she lives with that gold-digging punk, I don't care anymore.

789
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:54,260
I'm not going to that wedding even if I die.

790
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:56,570
That betrayer.

791
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:06,210
In my opinion, I think Oppa is...

792
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:09,920
thinking of marrying Ms. Park too.

793
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:14,050
If you want to live in this house receiving allowances,

794
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,800
you better pick the right team to join and stop calling Ms. Park "that girl."

795
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,980
Did you get it?

796
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,370
All right.

797
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:27,090
Chief Jo is a lost cause.

798
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:29,180
Se Ryun is penniless.

799
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:31,710
All right then.

800
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:35,080
I need to find a way to survive now.

801
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:43,800
The reason my life turned out this way is all because of you!

802
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,250
Blending you and drinking it won't even subside my anger, you geezer.

803
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:49,850
You! Just wait.

804
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:52,730
I'll deal with you in the underworld.

805
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,960
It's me.

806
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,760
Yes...

807
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:11,300
What brings you here?

808
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:15,060
How are you feeling? Are you all better?

809
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:17,930
Yes, I'm fine now, Madam.

810
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:20,800
That's good! Come here, sit down.

811
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:27,450
Seriously. Since you are young, you recover so fast as well.

812
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:31,920
Here. Drink this, Ms. Park.

813
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:38,830
It's okay! It's not like it's poisoned.

814
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:41,020
Drink it. Here.

815
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:42,510
Pardon me?

816
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:46,690
Why are you surprised? I'm just joking.

817
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:50,930
Our Ms. Park is so naive and cute.

818
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:54,510
This here is some very precious Pu'er tea.

819
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:58,910
I haven't shared it with anyone, but I thought of you.

820
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:00,840
So I brought it for you.

821
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:03,070
Here, drink it.

822
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:06,120
- There you go.
- Thank you.

823
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:11,270
The kids just love it that you're here.

824
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:15,730
And my heart is so at ease.

825
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:18,340
I see...

826
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:22,580
There has been a lot of misunderstandings I've had about you.

827
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:28,580
But it was a situation where it would be impossible not to misunderstand.

828
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:35,100
But let's leave all of our misunderstandings and mistakes in the past.

829
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:38,800
Let's get along well from now on.

830
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:41,930
Since you're in a relationship with Young Gook,

831
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:47,370
I have no choice but to accept it.

832
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:51,330
Madam...

833
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:54,760
That's right. Be good to the kids.

834
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:57,240
And be good to Young Gook.

835
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:02,370
And especially, be good to me.

836
01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:04,540
Yes, yes.

837
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:06,330
I'll do my best.

838
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:11,330
If I'm lacking in anything, feel free to tell me.

839
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:13,270
How's the Pu'er tea?

840
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:16,180
It's delicious.

841
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:20,850
That's right. I really haven't given any to anyone. I kept it to myself.

842
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:24,400
It's a really precious Pu'er tea.

843
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,900
It's really aromatic.

844
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:30,350
You're drinking it up.

845
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:33,890
Oh my, Ms. Park. You're so cute.

846
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:35,780
Oh my, there you go.

847
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:37,410
Oh my, really.

848
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:40,930
I should give you some more.

849
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:56,950
Let's get engaged on Christmas Eve.

850
01:02:56,950 --> 01:03:03,330
Let's just get married this Christmas Eve.

851
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:35,660
Chairman.

852
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:43,610
Chairman, what's wrong?

853
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,350
Did something happen?

854
01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:51,600
Ms. Park.

855
01:03:51,600 --> 01:04:00,050
When I lost my memory and was 22, I liked you. Didn't I?

856
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:03,200
Yes, that's right.

857
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,740
You liked me.

858
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:08,990
Then can you tell me

859
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:13,340
how I was then? Everything.

860
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:15,790
You said you liked me

861
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:20,390
and came to find me in front of the kindergarten and the academy.

862
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:23,340
You called me nonstop.

863
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:30,820
And you said that if I told you that I liked you, you would cancel the engagement.

864
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:35,790
You waited a long time for me at Namsan.

865
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:40,630
You joked around with me by blowing bubble gum balloons too.

866
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:47,620
Chairman, you definitely liked me.

867
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:49,340
Really?

868
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:56,120
Yes, really.

869
01:04:56,120 --> 01:05:02,270
Thank you for telling me.

870
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:07,260
Ms. Park, no matter what comes,

871
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:12,680
no matter what happens, can you trust me?

872
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:16,010
Of course.

873
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:18,940
I believe you.

874
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:26,340
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

875
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:51,890
♫ Why do you run away, love

♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

880
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:39,410
My child, the Chairman. And me.

881
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:43,100
If this moment could last forever...

882
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:46,100
Chief Jo Noona.

883
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:53,260
Let's just get married this Christmas Eve.

884
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:56,190
What?

885
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:59,500
Really?

886
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,670
A man shouldn't go back on his word.

887
01:07:02,670 --> 01:07:04,970
Chairman...

888
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:17,730
That's right. I can start over.

889
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:52,540
All right. It's fine, even if it's a reckless gamble.

890
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:57,170
It's fine even if I die burning like a moth.

891
01:07:57,170 --> 01:08:03,190
Even so, I'll go next to Se Jong.

892
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:10,380
I will raise Se Jong and this child in this house together.

893
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:17,090
Now the only place for me to go is here.

894
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:19,650
Only here.

895
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:32,480
Jo Sarah, what brings you here again?

896
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:36,580
I came because I have something to tell the Chairman. He's inside, right?

897
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:39,580
What are you doing? You can't.

898
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:43,620
Move. I have something to tell him.

899
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,880
Alright, wait a moment.

900
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:48,310
I'll ask Chairman.

901
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:52,020
What's there to ask? I told you to move!

902
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,420
Chief Jo.

903
01:08:56,430 --> 01:09:00,020
What is it?

904
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:04,050
I came because I have something to tell you.

905
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:08,100
Okay. Then say it.

906
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:12,400
It's something important. Do you want me to say it here?

907
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:15,020
The family members will hear everything.

908
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:20,440
Is that all right with you?

909
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:24,340
It does not matter. Just say it here.

910
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:39,070
What is this?

911
01:09:39,070 --> 01:09:42,150
Our baby's ultrasound photo.

912
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:45,700
What?

913
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:50,430
I am pregnant with your child.

920

[Young Lady and Gentleman]

921
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:52,090
Is it really my brother's baby?

922
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:53,760
Shouldn't we get a paternity test first?

923
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:56,580
When did you hit the home base with Young Gook?

924
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:57,900
How could I have talked about that with you?

925
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:59,830
Is that child really my child?

926
01:10:59,830 --> 01:11:04,780
Just because you don't remember, are you going to deny this child as well?

927
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:06,390
- Chief Jo.
- Hi, Se Jong.

928
01:11:06,390 --> 01:11:07,990
Did you come back to work for the Chairman?

929
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:09,490
You should hear it directly from him.

930
01:11:09,490 --> 01:11:11,460
I'm sure he has something to tell you.

931
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:15,810
Is Chief Jo really pregnant with your child?

932
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:17,070
Let's break up here.

933
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:19,040
Chief Jo is pregnant with Chairman Lee's child?

934
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,640
That's why Dan Dan took her stuff and left that house.

935
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:22,790
I am sorry.

936
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:24,980
You bastard. I knew this would happen.

937
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:26,240
Father! Father!

938
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,980
Forget someone like me, and don't look back.

939
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:31,400
Chairman isn't someone who would do that!

940
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:34,200
He's not!
