It's all right.

00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,010
I'll be fine.

My Dan Dan.

00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,470
Thank you.

Don't worry.

Thank you.

Thank you.

19
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,180
Don't mention it.

Don't worry about Dan Dan.

When Dan Dan gets married,

22

I'll always be by her side.

I got you!

49
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,790
Hello.

50
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,980
What brought you to my office area?

51
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,260
Please sit.

52
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,730
First...

53
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,010
Because of my Dan Dan,

54
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:38,110
I made you suffer and treated you harshly.

55
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:41,380
I want to apologize for that first.

56
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,780
Please think of it as a heart of a father with a daughter.

57
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,030
And please forgive me.

58
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,330
I'm sorry.

59
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,230
Father.

60
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,620
My Dan Dan is all grown up.

61
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:04,430
And she's capable and smart enough to take care of herself well.

62
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:09,320
But I've treated her like a young child.

63
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,650
I thought of her as a baby I needed to protect.

64
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:25,390
Since my Dan Dan says she trusts and loves you sincerely.

65
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:31,730
So I'll approve my Dan Dan to marry you, Chairman.

66
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,450
Thank you for approving the marriage.

67
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:45,500
Father, I won't let you down,

68
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,450
and I won't make you worry.

69
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:51,860
I'll do my best.

70
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,700
It's not just because CEO Anna Kim left her will,

71
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:02,070
but my Dan Dan says she'll only be happy next to you.

72
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,950
That's why I'm approving this marriage.

73
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,650
I'm sending her to you at the pain of crushing my bones.

74
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,730
Please make her happy.

75
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,240
Yes, I will.

76
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,830
Thank you.

77
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,520
Young Gook. Chairman Lee.

78
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,260
Did something good happen?

79
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,470
Where are you going?

80
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,160
Me? I'm going to buy a ring.

81
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,490
What? A ring?

82
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:45,220
Dad, is that true?

83
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:50,830
Did you really approve of my relationship with the Chairman?

84
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,480
Yes.

85
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,940
What can I do when you love him so much.

86
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,120
Also, I've been observing.

87
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,160
Besides the fact that Chairman Lee has three kids,

88
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,260
he's a good person.

89
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,500
I don't think I need to worry.

90
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,620
Dad! Thank you so much.

91
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:17,380
I'll live happily with him so that you don't have to worry.

92
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:22,830
I know you've been against our relationship until now because you were worried about me.

93
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,140
Dad, thank you so much.

94
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,100
Yes, sure.

95
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:42,660
I think he'll propose to me today.

96
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,820
Since he brought me to a fancy restaurant like this.

97
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:54,440
Will he get down on his knees while we are eating steaks?

98
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,440
I'll be embarrassed if he does so!

99
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,400
No. This is not the time.

100
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,550
Even if I want to, Jung Woo said I shouldn't do it in the middle of a meal.

101
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,460
Right. Let's hang on.

102
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,310
Ms. Park. Please have some. The ice cream here is good.

103
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,660
Yes.

104
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:46,040
What do I do? Maybe the ring is inside this ice cream.

105
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,630
I think my heart will burst.

106
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:56,120
I have to eat a little at a time to make sure I don't swallow the ring.

107
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,490
What's this? What's going on?

108
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,310
Why can't I see the ring?

109
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:38,560
What's wrong, Ms. Park? Is the dessert not good?

110
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,070
No, it's very delicious.

111
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,650
I knew you would like it.

112
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:51,090
Ms. Park. Should we go now since you are finished eating?

113
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,790
Yes.

114
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:07,170
Right. Lots of people are here.

115
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:10,530
Maybe he's looking for a quiet place.

116
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:25,060
I know she'll love the ring when she sees it.

117
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,880
My Ms. Park is moderate and sweet,

118
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,010
so she'd be happy just with a ring without a big event.

119
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:37,390
No, I have to hold back for that optimal moment.

120
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:03,270
Chairman, we are already in front of my house.

121
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,820
Ms. Park. Please go in and rest.

122
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:11,050
I have something important to research, so I will have to get going.

123
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,520
Please go inside.

124
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,550
Okay.

125
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,690
Chairman.

126
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,970
What is it?

127
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:35,180
Is there anything you forgot to tell me?

128
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:56,500
Ms. Park, my rabbit.

129
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,070
Let's meet in our dreams.

130
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,260
A rabbit?

131
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,470
Am I a kindergartener? To fall for a line like that?

132
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,740
A rabbit, my foot.

133
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,380
Why is he not proposing to me yet?

134
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,710
I have something to tell you.

135
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:39,130
Looking at your expression, I think it's good news.

136
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:44,080
Does my face say good news?

137
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,570
Yes, in a very big way.

138
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:51,790
What is it? Please tell us quickly, especially if it's something good.

139
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:56,180
I finally got approval

140
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,330
from Ms. Park's father to marry her.

141
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,070
- Wow!
- Nice!

142
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,830
Yes!

143
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:10,160
Does that mean you are going to marry Ms. Park?

144
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,960
I am thinking about it, what do you say?

145
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:19,080
Please raise your hand if any of you don't approve of our marriage.

146
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,760
Then I will properly propose to Ms. Park.

147
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,910
- Yes!
- Nice!

148
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,640
Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong.

149
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,510
Thank you very much for congratulating me instead of opposing it.

150
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:42,560
But Dad, how do you plan to propose to her?

151
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:50,320
I already bought the ring, but I've been deliberating very seriously about how to propose.

152
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,270
Dad, I have a great idea.

153
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:58,680
If you follow it, there is zero chance Ms. Park will turn you down.

154
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,490
It'll be a memorable event she will never forget her whole life.

155
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:06,860
Really? Jenny, what is it?

156
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:27,330
I can't believe it. He hasn't called me to meet when it's a day off today.

157
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:30,420
What's wrong with the Chairman?

158
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:35,900
Is he thinking of skipping the proper proposal?

159
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,910
This is where our age difference shows.

160
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:45,530
I can't tell him I want to get proposed to him with my own lips.

161
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,320
Fine.

162
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:54,020
If Chairman keeps going this way, I will turn him down even if he proposes to me.

163
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,420
Yes, Jenny.

164
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:06,930
Ms. Park, can we meet right now? I have something urgent to discuss with you.

165
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:10,600
Discuss with me? What is it?

166
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,990
Jenny, did something happen?

167
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:26,040
Are you Ms. Park Dan Dan?

168
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,320

I'm sure you know, Dan Dan.

305
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:25,800
My mom lived as a hidden woman in our family in the past.

306
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:31,910
So I guess my dad secretly promised to her.

307
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:36,150
He gave her a diamond ring.

308
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,650
And he told her they'd get legally married

309
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:42,170
once Young Gook's mother passed away.

310
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:47,580
But my dad didn't keep that promise,

311
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:52,020
and even took away the diamond ring too.

312
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:56,680
He said it was for my Oppa's future wife.

313
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,890
So my mom was furious...

314
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:05,970
and she stole that diamond ring from my dad.

315
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:10,040
Oh, gosh.

316
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,520
But a few days ago,

317
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:22,050
the fact that my mom stole that ring from my dad got revealed.

318
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:25,670
So that, Oppa kicked my mom out.

319
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:28,170
She begged for forgiveness.

320
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,630
The house was in a total uproar.

Because of that...

322
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,650
my mom's allowance was cut in half.

323
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,470
I guess because of that...

324
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:50,450
my mom is suffering from depression now.

325
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,290

326
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:55,350
She keeps saying...

327
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:00,220
She keeps saying she has no hopes to live.

328
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:05,200
I honestly found it hard to understand my mom,

329
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,360
and I dislike her at times.

330
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:13,260
But she's my mom.

00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,460
So I can't help but feel sorry for her.

00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:22,300
It upsets me too.

333
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,530
Sister-in-law.

334
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,540
Dan Dan.

335
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:35,970
I know it's wrong for me to ask you this favor.

336
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:38,500
But once you marry my brother,

337
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,650
please...

338
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:44,350
please take care of my mom.

339
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,040
I will.

340
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:58,960
Chairman. Why did you want to see me so urgently?

341
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,680
Give me your hand.

342
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:24,760
Chairman. What is this ring?

343
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,170
It's my mother's ring.

344
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:30,550
It was lost, but now we found it.

345
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,620
It's your ring now, Ms. Park.

346
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:39,500
It's your mother's precious ring.

347
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,570
Do I have the right to wear it?

348
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,200
Of course.

349
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:49,080
You're going to be my wife soon.

350
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,530
Chairman.

351
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:56,660
My mother's ring suits you very well too.

352
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:02,990
If you feel like wearing two rings on one hand is too much, you can wear one on each hand.

353
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:06,790
They are both so pretty.

354
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,320
But my dad didn't keep that promise

355
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,510
and even took away the diamond ring too.

356
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:34,320
He said it was for Oppa's future wife.

357
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:39,340
I honestly found it hard to understand my mom,

358
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,430
and I dislike her at times.

359
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,370
But she's my mom.

360
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:50,260
So I can't help but feel sorry for her.

361
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,260
It upsets me too.

362
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,200
Chairman. This ring.

363
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,500
Please give this ring to Madam instead of me.

364
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:27,150
Ms. Park. What nonsense are you saying?

365
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:31,280
This is your ring now, Ms. Park. We're engaged.

366
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,890
Chairman.

367
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:38,750
I don't think it's time for me to receive this ring yet.

368
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:46,310
Also, I'm too young to wear such an enormous ring.

369
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:53,660
And I heard a little bit of the story related to this ring.

370
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,860
I'm sure Madam had her reasons.

371
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:02,500
This ring holds that much meaning to her.

372
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:08,560
Chairman. Can't we give this ring to Madam?

373
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,200
I think that'll make me feel at ease.

374
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:26,580
Wait, this ring.

375
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:32,780
Wait, Young Gook. I don't deserve to receive this ring. Why are you giving me this?

376
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,530
I-I can't take this.

377
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:39,510
Gosh, no. I can't. It's not right.

378
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:44,460
I was going to give this ring to Ms. Park until just now.

379
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:49,960
But she told me to give it to you.

380
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:54,980
I thought about it, and I know how much you wanted it.

381
00:37:54,980 --> 00:38:00,990
So take it. Consider it as a gift from my father.

382
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:03,280
Young Gook.

383
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,270
Why are you making me feel even more guilty? I already told you.

384
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:11,450
I didn't steal this ring because I coveted it.

385
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:16,000
I stole it then because I hated your father. I was so upset with him.

386
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,980
I lost it for a moment. But stealing is stealing.

387
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:25,410
I hurt your late mother deeply and you too.

388
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,560
I...

389
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,660
I never got the chance to say this, but I'm a sinner.

390
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,550
For a sinner like me to take this ring will really make me an evil wench.

391
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:42,590
So, I can't receive it. Just give it to Ms. Park, okay?

392
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:46,960
She's right, Oppa. Just give this ring to Ms. Park.

393
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,210
I don't think this is right.

394
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:50,410
That's right. Do that.

395
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:55,820
I'm already so grateful for the fact that you gave it to me today.

396
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:00,900
I could die with no regrets now.

397
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:07,180
I'm telling you to take it because that's how much this ring means to you.

398
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,580
It'll make me feel better too.

399
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,510
Oppa.

400
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:16,510
Oh, Ms. Park.

401
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:27,000
Madam. Please wear this ring.

402
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:32,310
I think that's the only way Chairman and I can get married with peace in mind.

403
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,610
Ms. Park.

404
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:39,590
How can I take this? How?

405
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:43,820
If you really want to give it to me, you can do it later.

406
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:47,660
You can pass it down to me later.

407
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:52,570
Ms. Park. Oh, Ms. Park.

408
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,620
Ms. Park...

409
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,560
This one and this too.

410
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,140
Are you done packing?

411
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,090
- Yes, almost.
- You're still packing?

412
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:20,420
But are you two really going to live separately?

413
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:24,060
One here and the other so far from Seoul?

414
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:28,550
Mom. We're still boyfriend and girlfriend.

415
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:35,120
I know. I completely understand now. I got it.

416
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:42,130
But Joon Oh, I'm going to be alone with you gone.

417
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:45,150
Oh, Mi Rim! Do you want to live here?

418
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:48,840
It'll be scary for you to live in the rooftop room by yourself.

419
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:53,110
Not to mention you have to pay rent too.

420
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,250
I'm asking because I'm lonely.

421
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:04,040
I'll think about it if you treat me as Joon Oh's girlfriend only.

422
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,580
My gosh.

423
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,120
Fine. All right.

424
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,740
I won't treat you like my daughter-in-law,

425
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,600
but only as his girlfriend.

426
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,760
So, please. Please move in and live with me.

427
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,970
Mi Rim. I'd like for you to do that too.

428
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:24,040
I'm worried about you living alone.

429
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,400
All right. I'll think about it.

430
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,130
Sounds good.

431
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:32,830
Fine, fine. Thank you.

432
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:36,780
I'm done packing, Mom. I should get going.

433
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:40,750
My son, Joon Oh. I know you can do well.

434
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:47,750
Don't worry, Mom. I think I can handle anything now.

435
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:53,040
- Don't worry and be well, okay? I'll come back on the weekend.
- Okay.

436
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,990
My son, Joon Oh. My baby.

437
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:58,200
Oh, wait. You come here too, Mi Rim.

438
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,800
Oh, come here.

439
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,590
Oh, my babies. Actually, you step back.

440
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:04,510
- My Mi Rim, I love you.
- Mother.

441
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,640
Me, too!

442
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,620
Oh, my pretty girl.

443
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:11,130
- Who's this guy?
- Back off!

444
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,160
All right.

445
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,430
- Ouch.
- My gosh! Oh, no, what do we do?

446
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:23,560
Oh, gosh. Did you get badly burned?

447
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,850
No, just slightly. It's fine.

448
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:29,230
What are you saying? This isn't slight. Come here.

449
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:31,890
- You need to get something cold.
- I'm really fine.

450
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:34,290
- It's so red, my gosh.
- It's really fine.

451
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:36,440
Oh, no! What should we do?

452
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,860
My gosh. I should've been burned instead.

453
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,230
Hey, don't talk like that.

454
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:43,170
- Burn instead of me?
- Show me your hand.

455
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:46,480
My heart will hurt even more if you get hurt.

456
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,740
Gosh, those guys are too much.

457
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,410
They must really love each other.

458
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:55,130
I guess she really likes Dae Beom.

459
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:59,470
Seeing Se Ryun loving my son so much makes me adore her even more.

460
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:02,470
I didn't like her at first because she was older and all.

461
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:05,440
But I like her the more I see her.

462
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,790
I allowed the marriage because of her share at first.

463
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:10,470
But share or no share,

464
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:13,840
seeing them just makes me happy now.

465
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,920
I feel the same way. Whenever I watch those two,

466
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,850
I feel happy, and they make me smile.

467
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:24,250
- Right, Mom?
- There's no use in being a millionaire.

468
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:27,520
Living happily like that is the best.

469
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,070
- Right, Mom?
- Of course.

470
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:32,990
Those two remind me of cute little puppies.

471
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,800
- You're right.
- Oh.

472
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,280
- Wait.
- What is it?

473
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,390
- It's Se Ryun's mother.
- What?

474
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:40,600
Why is that lady calling you?

475
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,980
I don't know.

476
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,030
Yes, hello.

477
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:48,800
What? You're in front of our house right now?

478
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,780
What?

479
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:02,460
What I did before...

480
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:07,850
I'm here to apologize to you.

481
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:22,450
I realized how much wrong I had committed all this time.

482
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:27,100
I didn't see my wrongdoings but only blamed other people.

483
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:31,610
I lived with a twisted grudge.

484
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:41,670
But after receiving generous forgiveness from Chairman Lee,

485
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:47,050
all the bad grudges I held got all resolved.

486
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:50,900
It made me realize how I have lived wrongly until now.

487
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:54,560
I felt so embarrassed.

488
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:03,740
Also, for all the horrible things I've said to you and how terribly I treated you,

489
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:06,570
I'd like to apologize for all that.

490
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:11,960
For Se Ryun's sake, please forgive me just once.

491
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:18,630
Gosh, I don't know why I lived that way. I really have no clue.

492
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:23,940
Why are you saying all this, In-law?

493
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:28,220
Driver Park. Oh, no.

494
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:33,700
Se Ryun's Father-in-law. Thank you for taking care of Se Ryun.

495
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:38,100
And thank you for accepting her.

496
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:41,930
It's nothing.

497
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:48,850
Please have a cup of tea since you're here. I'll get back to the store first. There's a lot of work.

498
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:57,500
Dae Beom's Mother-in-law. One word can pay off a thousand debts.

499
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:03,920
Now that you've apologized, all the grudge I held onto has left.

500
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,590
I'm sure Son-in-law Park feels the same way.

501
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:12,220
It's all in the past now. We should all forget it.

502
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:16,760
Now we are all one family, aren't we?

503
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,080
For saying that,

504
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:23,420
I'm really thankful to you all.

505
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,760
Mom.

506
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:32,730
I was very embarrassed.

507
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:38,060
I was very ashamed of myself.

508

[60th Chicken]

509
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:48,620
Younger-sister-in-law!

510
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:50,680
I've got terrible news, Younger-sister-in-law.

511
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,280
What's wrong? What's the matter?

512
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,660
Younger-sister-in-law, don't be surprised.

513
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:56,500
Don't faint, okay?

514
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,240
What is the matter that you are saying like that?

515
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,090
What should I do it?

516
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:06,610
Se Ryun doesn't have any shares. She gave it all to her brother.

517
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:11,590
I heard about it now from talking to Madam Oh.

518
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:17,350
Older-sister-in-law. Don't live such a materialistic life.

519
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:19,600
What are you saying?

520
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:24,040
Older-sister-in-law. It turns out money isn't that important.

521
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:28,070
Only having the amount you need is the best for money.

522
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:32,020
Looking at Se Ryun's mom, being the Madam of the FT Group did her no good.

523
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:35,380
It means nothing if you're emotionally unwell. You'll be unhappy.

524
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:41,470
Our Se Ryun and Dae Beom are a match made in heaven. They're in the top 0.0001 percent percentile.

525
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:45,590
I'm so happy seeing them happy.

526
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:50,000
Also, Se Ryun is from a rich family anyway. There's nothing to worry about.

527
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,370
And our restaurant is doing well. We're going to open a second branch.

528
00:47:54,370 --> 00:48:00,150
I don't want to vulgarly drool over my daughter-in-law's shares.

529
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:03,600
My gosh. Younger-sister-in-law!

530
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:07,850
Goodness, is she sick or something?

531
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:10,800
I can't believe this.

532
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:17,180
Why is there so much to do to get married?

533
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:21,550
I thought we'd head straight to the alter once we met our families.

534
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:25,260
We need to take wedding pictures and book a venue too.

535
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:27,780
We also have to officially meet our friends too.

536
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:32,340
Plus, we need to get our wedding invitations. What else is there?

537
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:35,600
Anyway, there's a ton of stuff to do.

538
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,740
Ms. Park. We just need to get through the list one at a time calmly.

539
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:43,280
I think we'll have to take the wedding pictures next week because I have an urgent meeting.

540
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:49,290
Also, after we're done taking pictures, let's head straight to go look for furniture for our newly-wed bedroom.

541
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:51,180
Okay.

542
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,920
It's so pretty.

543
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,090
Peek-a-boo.

00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:09,480
Excuse me.

- Peek-a-boo.
- Peek-a-boo.

00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:21,880
Dad. This one for me.

00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,490
I like this one more.

549
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:31,610
Kids. This is to decorate the room for Ms. Park and me.

550
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:34,940
Don't you think it'll be better for us to pick it?

551
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:40,690
Jenny, Se Chan, Se Jong. How about you three go and play over there?

552
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:44,520
Fine. I guess I'll go look at stuff for my room then.

553
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,140
- Let's go, kids.
- Okay.

554
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:54,430
Ms. Park. Let's come just the two of us the next time we do this.

555
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:56,610
Okay.

556
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,530
Which one do you like, Ms. Park?

557
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:06,360
I like this one.

558
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,230
It's elegant and slim.

559
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:11,040
What about you, Chairman?

560
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,830
I like this one as well. It's nice and unique.

561
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:18,360
Oh, Ms. Park. Where should we go for our honeymoon?

562
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,620
I think I'll have to reserve it now.

563
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:26,250
I asked around, and people said Hawaii is the best to go with kids.

564
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:28,810
I like Hawaii too.

565
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:34,910
Ms. Park. Are you saying you want to go on our honeymoon with the kids?

566
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:39,080
Were you thinking of going on the honeymoon just the two of us?

567
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,900
What about the kids?

568
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,460
Gosh, Chairman. You're so naughty.

569
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:46,050
Naughty?

570
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:49,350
Ms. Park. This is our honeymoon.

571
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:52,620
It's not a honeymoon if we go with the kids. It's a family trip.

572
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:55,480
Naughty, you say? My gosh.

573
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,390
Okay, Chairman. I'll do as you say.

574
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:16,960
Wh-why are you kids here?

575
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:24,340
Did you see that, Ms. Park?

576
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:27,250
Let's make sure it's only the two of us on our honeymoon.

577
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,890
Okay.

578
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:33,280
Oh, right. You didn't forget about our dinner plans, right?

579
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,680
Of course not.

580
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:41,660
I'll be meeting your friends and vice versa.

581
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:44,190
I'm already so nervous.

582
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:46,230
Don't be. I'll be with you.

583
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:50,040
Oh, right. Let's go shopping before that.

584
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,900
I'll buy you whatever you like.

585
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,250
Really?

586
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:56,240
Of course.

It's nice to meet you.

This is my fiancée, Park Dan Dan.

Now that I've met your friends,

it finally feels like I'm getting married to you.

599

It's like I've been approved as your fiancée.

I'm just in such a great mood.

Nobody can touch you now, Ms. Park.

602

Are you ready to meet my friends too, Chairman?

603

Of course. I'll make you look real good today.

Hello, I'm Lee Young Gook.

608
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:08,740
You are much more handsome in person than in your photo on the internet news.

609
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:11,200
You're very handsome.

610
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:16,250
But do you two not feel a generation gap?

611
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:18,060
Pardon?

612
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:22,790
Well, if you're 14 years apart, you're in your 40s when we're in our 20s.

613
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:29,120
When we're in our 30s, that'll mean you'll be in your 50s.

614
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:38,090
Hey, what are you talking about?

615
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,680
I feel absolutely no generation gap with the Chairman.

616
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,680
You have no idea how trendy Chairman is.

617
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:48,290
Hey, you see. You don't call him Oppa but Chairman instead.

618
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:53,940
I understand. I wouldn't be able to call someone 14 years older "Oppa."

619
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:03,150
Oh, dear. I was just joking.

620
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:06,480
My apologies. I'm sorry.

621
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,950
No, it's fine. I'm just hot.

622
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:11,430
It's a little hot in here.

623
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:25,220
Chairman. Are you upset?

624
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,980
Are you mad?

625
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:30,330
I'm not mad.

626
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:32,210
Gosh, Chairman.

627
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:38,080
My friend was just joking around to lift up the mood.

628
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:43,390
Also, it's not like she said something wrong.

629
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:45,690
What?

630
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:53,190
Come on, Chairman. Don't let that bother you. What matters is that we're okay with it.

631
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:57,350
So don't be upset. Will you, Chairman?

632
00:54:57,350 --> 00:55:03,820
Your friends view me as an old man because you keep calling me "Chairman."

633
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:09,430
Will it kill you to call me Oppa?

634
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:12,410
W-Well...

635
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:15,000
You call me Ms. Park too.

636
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,010
I've been calling you Chairman all this time. How can I change it overnight?

637
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:25,420
I don't think this will work anymore. It's not right that we call each other like that when we're getting married soon.

638
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:27,900
Let's change how we address each other.

639
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:33,980
How about we flick each other whenever we call each other Chairman and Ms. Park?

640
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:37,180
Fine. Let's do that, Chairman.

641
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:47,210
Are you really going to hit me?

642
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:52,740
That's what we agreed on. Let's not get upset. Okay, Ms. Park?

643
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:02,570
Fine. It's game on.

644
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:10,910
Chairman, Chairman, Chairman! It's a red light! Brake! Step on the brake, Chairman!

645
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:13,050
You scared me.

646
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:26,140
Chairman. Chairman. Chairman!

647
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:39,160
Stop the car on the side of the road right now!

648
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:55,590
I'm not going to marry you, Chairman.

649
00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:58,040
Ms. Park. I'm sorry.

650
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:02,090
I think I lost it for a second. Please don't be mad, Ms. Park.

651
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:06,460
Ms. Park. Let's go eat something delicious...

652
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:10,890
Ms. Park. Ms. Park. Ms. Park!

653
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:21,590
Ms. Park!

654
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:27,380
Ms. Park! Ms. Park! Ms. Park!

655
00:57:28,890 --> 00:57:32,570
Gosh. I can't believe she really left.

656
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:36,240
What? She's not going to marry me?

657
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:39,370
How can she say that?

658
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:47,280
I never knew Chairman was this kind of person.

659
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,510
- I don't think I can marry Chairman.
- What?

660
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,550
What are you saying all of a sudden?

661
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:57,290
Dan Dan. What do you mean?

662
00:57:57,290 --> 00:58:01,250
What in the world happened for you to say that?

663
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:07,230
Chairman hit me.

664
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:08,770
- What?
- What?

665
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:11,200
Chairman Lee hit you? Where?

666
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:17,970
What? Oppa did what? No way, he's not someone to do that.

667
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:21,400
Well, we went to go see my friends.

668
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:25,350
My friends joked about his age a little.

669
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:30,720
They said Chairman would be in his 50s when I'm in my 30s.

670
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,670
So we decided to change how we address each other.

671
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:39,470
We decided that I call him Oppa, and he calls me Dan Dan.

672
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:44,690
So if we called each other Chairman or Ms. Park, we'll get flicked.

673
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:48,650
But how can I suddenly...

674
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:55,180
call him Oppa? So I called him Chairman impulsively,

675
00:58:55,180 --> 00:59:01,020
and he flicked me ten times.

676
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:03,770
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

677
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:05,650
Really?

678
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:08,150
Oppa flicked her ten times?

679
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:11,110
No, there's no way he'd do that.

680
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:15,010
She was head over heels about him.

681
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:19,140
Just how hard did he flick her for Dan Dan to react that way?

682
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:24,860
Regardless of how big the argument was, it's unacceptable that he hit her. Don't you think so?

683
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:28,050
I need to do something about this guy.

684
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:41,660
Yes, Chairman. It's me.

685
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:44,060
Hurry on over here.

686
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:52,720
Son-in-law Lee. What's with your forehead?

687
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:57,750
Did I go overboard?

688
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,100
Did you trip and hit your head?

689
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:06,190
Your forehead is badly bruised.

690
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:11,950
Did Dan Dan do that? We heard you flicked each other.

691
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:18,580
Yes. Ms. Park hit me.

692
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:21,070
What?

693
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:23,090
Oppa, let me see it.

694
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:28,350
I hit him real gently. I don't know how he got bruised so bad.

695
01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:30,680
Aigoo, Dan Dan.

696
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:36,750
How could you bruise his forehead that bad when he's about to get married? What were you thinking?

697
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:39,840
What are people going to say about you?

698
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,920
I can't believe you.

699
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:48,010
Ms. Park hit me on the same spot over and over again.

700
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:53,020
Park Dan Dan. You didn't mention you hitting him earlier.

701
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:59,740
I seriously hit him real gently.

702
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:02,410
I know because I've been hit by Dan Dan before.

703
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:06,950
Dan Dan's hand is really strong. It's so painful.

704
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:12,630
You're lucky. At least you didn't get a nosebleed. I've had plenty in the past.

705
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:16,220
You must know how I feel then, Dae Beom.

706
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:21,360
Of course, Hyugnim. Let's have a nice, cold glass of beer.

707
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,120
Yes, I'd like that.

708
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,990
Just a moment.

709
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:27,320
Stay right here.

710
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:31,690
- What were you thinking?
- I'm hurt, too.

711
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:36,410
- His skin must be softer. I don't bruise easily.
- Be quiet. Eat this.

712
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:39,340
Dad, you were on my side.

713
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:41,420
- Bring an egg over, Dae Beom.
- Okay.

714
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:46,110
- Why'd you get bruised so badly?
- Just apologize.

715
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:53,960
I'm sorry, Chairman. I didn't know I hit you so hard.

716
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,590
I'm sorry, Chairman.

717
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:59,200
I'm fine.

718
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:03,470
I know it hurts a lot for you, Dan Dan. I'm sorry.

719
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:06,010
It's fine, Chairman.

720
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:10,290
I keep calling you Chairman.

721
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:13,120
Ms. Park. No.

722
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:17,990
Dan Dan. Let's just do what's comfortable.

723
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:21,560
Let's call each other however we want. We can change it later.

724
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:27,370
All right. Let's never flick each other or anything similar to that anymore.

725
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:32,650
My heart hurt so much when I saw your bruised forehead.

726
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:38,810
All right. Let's not fight and live peacefully with the kids.

727
01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:44,860
I'm not afraid of the future because you're next to me.

728
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:50,490
It's a full moon!

729
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:09,890
I made a wish to the full moon.

730
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:17,890
I asked that I could live a long life with you by my side.

731
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:20,470
What about you, Chairman?

732
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:28,020
I said I was grateful that I could be with you.

733
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:35,000
Me, too. I'm grateful.

734
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:03,690
It's a beautiful day, warm from the Spring sunlight.

735
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:07,200
The day has finally come for them to tie the knot.

736
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:11,250
The first star of the day, who's the happiest man in the world.

737
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:13,350
I introduce to you, the groom.

738
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:17,450
Groom. Please enter.

739
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,480
Hyungnim!

740
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:35,520
You look great.

741
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:11,120
Next up is the highlight of the day.

742
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:14,300
Let's welcome the beautiful bride.

743
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:16,410
Please give a warm round of applause.

744
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:19,370
Enter the bride!

745
01:05:19,370 --> 01:05:24,130

Hey, Park Dan Dan. It feels like yesterday when you gave me nosebleeds.

Don't give your husband a nosebleed.
