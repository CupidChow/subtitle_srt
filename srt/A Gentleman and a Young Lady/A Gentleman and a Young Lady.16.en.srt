[Episode 16]

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:09,920
I have something to ask you.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,740
Yes, what is it?

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:19,050
Do you have feelings for Ms. Park, by chance?

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,920
What?

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,510
- That's not it, is it?
- What?

7
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,040
Right, I don't have any feelings for her.

8
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,020
Right?

9
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,550
I should've not asked.

10
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,200
I noticed you kept looking at Ms. Park.

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,930
But that wouldn't make sense.

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,640
Why can't I be with Ms. Park?

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,190
- Is it illegal?
- Yes, it is.

14
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:56,460
Of course, you can't! Think of how old you are and how old Ms. Park is.

15
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,100
And is it also because I have three kids?

16
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,090
It's not that, but Ms. Park is still a child.

17
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,070
Is Ms. Park still a child?

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,540
Young Gook, what I want to say is,

19
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,710
it's time for you to find a nice person that's good for you.

20
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:24,480
For your children as well.

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,300
Noona, don't worry about me.

22
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,160
I know. Everything will be great.

23
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,870
What should I buy to eat today?

24
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,550
I should make Soo Chul's favorite, Chunggukjang stew,

25
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,180
and grill a mackerel.

26
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,800
Oh?

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,000
That woman... That woman is Dan Dan's mom.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,330
Isn't that Dan Dan's mom?

29
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,780
Thank you.

30
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,650
Where did she go?

31
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:13,940
I'm sure that was Dan Dan's mom.

32
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,820
But what's going on?

33
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,200
Why is a woman that went to America here?

34
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,620
Did she come back to Korea?

35
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,200
I'm sure it was her.

36
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,620
Honey, Honey! Soo Chul!

37
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,920
What is it? Did something happen?

38
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,980
I just saw Dan Dan's mom.

39
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,040
- Dan Dan's mom.
- What did you say?

40
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,920
What are you talking about right now?

41
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,030
Dan Dan's mom must have come back from America.

42
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,440
I saw her when I went to the marketplace to buy groceries,

43
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,330
and I'm sure it was Dan Dan's mom.

44
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,360
I told you not to talk about that woman again!

45
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,010
Why are you yelling?

46
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:58,590
I'm saying this in case she tries to go see Dan Dan.

47
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,910
Honey, has Dan Dan may be contacted her mom without us knowing?

48
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,990
That could happen.

49
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,840
Say something that makes sense.

50
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,860
That woman is dead. How could she contact a dead person?

51
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,850
I must have seen it wrong.

52
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:19,580
Yes, I did see wrong.

53
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,910
This is where I work. How can you come here?

54
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,320
Stop with the nonsense and leave.

55
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,410
Okay.

56
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,120
I'm leaving.

57
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:36,410
For dinner tonight, I'll make your favorite, Chunggukjang stew.

58
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,030
Come home early.

59
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:01,390
Even if Dan Dan's mom did come back to Korea,

60
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,080
she wouldn't be able to appear in front of Soo Chul and Dan Dan.

61
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,030
Unless she wants to get beaten up by Soo Chul, she won't show up.

62
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,000
We saw each other earlier.

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,340
It hasn't been that long since we last saw each other to see again.

64
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,930
What would you do if someone saw us?

65
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:04,190
Chairman, do you keep wanting to see me that much?

66
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,520
Ms. Park, aren't you being too overconfident?

67
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,650
I called you here because I have something to say.

68
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,320
Okay.

69
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,640
You didn't want to see me because you missed me,

70
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,160
but because you have something to say.

71
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,120
I'll believe it.

72
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,830
So, what is it you want to say?

73
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,210
Actually,

74
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:37,870
Anna asked if I had feelings for you earlier.

75
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,610
She asked frankly.

76
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,050
Did CEO Anna ask you that?

77
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:49,480
Actually, CEO Anna asked me before if I had a boyfriend.

78
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,620
I couldn't lie to her,

79
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,200
so I told her I do have a boyfriend, but I didn't say it was you.

80
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,670
I really didn't say that.

81
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,750
It's not because of you.

82
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,190
Without realizing it,

83
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:06,980
I must have kept looking at you. That's why.

84
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,910
You did seem to do that.

85
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,050
You were finding every chance to stare at me.

86
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,210
So what did you say to her?

87
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:24,520
Well, but without realizing it,

88
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,430
I said I don't have feelings for you.

89
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:47,200
It seems like I don't have the courage to date you.

90
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,170
Why?

91
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,250
I am much older than you,

92
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,600
and there are many more reasons.

93
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,190
And I'm worried about what others might say if they find out about us dating.

94
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:11,780
I'm okay with it, but you might get hurt.

95
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,020
That's why.

96
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:22,500
It's because I'm not a good enough person to be by your side.

97
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,610
Ms. Park. Don't say something like that.

98
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,960
It's not like that.

99
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,700
Thinking about it now,

100
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,290
I only thought about myself.

101
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,890
I thought if we confirmed each other's feelings,

102
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,440
that's all we needed.

103
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,920
But you have many more things to think about

104
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:50,170
and many more things to consider.

105
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,470
I wasn't aware of that.

106
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,630
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,630
It's not like that, Ms. Park.

108
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,260
I'm sorry.

109
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:10,010
Chairman, I can take things slowly.

110
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,160
I'll wait.

111
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:19,890
We don't have to announce that we're a couple to everybody right now.

112
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,760
Our feelings are what's important.

113
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:28,690
So until you feel confident to say that I am your girlfriend,

114
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,890
I can wait.

115
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,300
Will you really be okay?

116
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,600
That makes me feel sorry towards you.

117
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,230
Don't be sorry.

118
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,210
As long as our hearts don't change,

119
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,380
nothing else matters to me.

120
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,190
Thank you, Ms. Park.

121
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,610
Chairman, we are starting

122
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,400
a secret workplace relationship now.

123
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,370
A secret workplace relationship?

124
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,880
Don't you agree?

125
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,830
I work in your home,

126
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,450
and you're my supervisor.

127
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:13,020
Now that I say it, it sounds so thrilling!

128
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,590
Seriously...

129
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,760
What?

130
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,530
He took care of my severance pay first so that I can't ask to get back there.

131
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:58,210
Is he telling me to take this and get lost?

132
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,380
Sarah.

133
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:05,410
Sarah, no matter what's happening, how can you have such a messy room?

134
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,980
It's a total mess!

135
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:14,770
Sarah, I have something to tell you. Please sit up.

136
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:18,240
Mom, let's talk next time.

137
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,860
Sarah. Jo Sarah.

138
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:29,790
Did you get severance pay from that house?

139
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,320
Have you received it yet?

140
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,440
Why? Why do you want to know?

141
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:42,250
It's because Mi Sook wants us to move out of here.

142
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,770
She wants her brother's family to move in.

143
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:49,250
So we have to look for a new place.

144
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:54,420
But as you know, our deposit here of 100 million won will not be enough to find a new place.

145
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,460
How much severance pay did you get?

146
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,780
Mom! I worked without any vacation until now!

147
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,170
I've given you every money I've earned until now.

148
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,580
But you have no money?

149
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,080
Didn't you save any money at all?

150
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,940
I've spent it on our living expenses.

151
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,340
I didn't spend it on myself.

152
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,890
I have about 5 million won in my account.

153
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,750
What?

154
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,580
Only 5 million won?

155
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:29,840
Mom, other parents would work hard and save money

156
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,210
and buy an apartment when their daughter gets married!

157
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:37,480
But you have not even 50 million won,

158
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,560
but 5 million won?

159
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,320
Do you think this makes any sense!

160
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,440
But we had to pay off our debts.

161
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,810
It hasn't been that long since we've paid that off!

162
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,250
Mom. I paid off that debt, not you!

163
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,810
You didn't make the money that paid the debt!

164
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:59,260
Mom, how can you do this to me?

165
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:04,500
How can you be like this to me as well?

166
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:11,590
Sure! I'm sorry that I'm such an incompetent parent!

167
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:15,120
I am sorry!! I'm sorry!

168
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,580
You two look great together.

169
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,250
You should date each other.

170
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,470
Give me some chaser! Chaser!

171
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,930
One more time!

172
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,220
You are so cute.

173
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,910
Hey!

174
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,560
Is this your house? Are you two the only people here?

175
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,400
Are you the only ones drinking here? Seriously...

176
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,930
What kind of craziness is this?

177
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,640
Did you eat your manners with your food?

178
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,690
Or drink it with your drinks?

179
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,860
Is this woman mad?

180
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,660
What kind of crazy woman is this?

181
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,380
What? What did you just say to me?

182
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:20,090
What? Crazy? Yes, I'm a crazy woman.

183
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:25,850
Do you want to see what's really crazy!

184
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,960
What a mad woman!

185
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,660
I'm just going to--

186
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,820
Please don't. Please.

187
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,650
Why are you acting this way?

188
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,960
Isn't she the woman from Sokcho ocean the other day?

189
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,790
Why? Do you want to hit me?

190
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,910
Okay, go ahead. Hit me.

191
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,870
Try hit me, you bastard!

192
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,680
What are you doing with that shoe?

193
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,920
What? What are you?

194
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,250
Why are you so angry again? Put your shoes back on.

195
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,760
You are the guy from the other night.

196
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,390
- Do you know her?
- Yes, I know her.

197
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,330
I'm sorry, I apologize.

198
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,610
She's like this when she drinks.

199
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,490
Let's go, let's go.

200
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,700
What about the payment? Okay, I'll put it on credit.

201
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,020
I don't know what got you so angry,

202
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,040
but you could get into big trouble acting like that.

203
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,610
Don't pick a fight with anyone.

204
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,270
Or don't jump into the ocean.

205
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,230
Ahjussi.

206
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:33,940
- Am I really not that attractive?
- Excuse me?

207
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:38,820
Am I really that plain?

208
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:46,470
Do you mean your looks? You're top of the tiers!

209
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,910
You are pretty.

210
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:58,010
How old do I look?

211
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,850
In your mid to late twenties?

212
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,670
Right? I'm still good, right?

213
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,870
Yes, of course. You are very good-looking.

214
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,710
I'm not just saying that.

215
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:17,640
Do you know how much I've worked to look this young and pretty?

216
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,780
But he doesn't know my feelings.

217
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:27,220
But he fell for this young girl who's after his money.

218
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:32,480
He fell for this young girl!

219
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,450
And he dumped me.

220
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,160
What's wrong with his eyes?

221
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,430
I'm left speechless.

222
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:49,000
Right? His eyes are wrong. It doesn't make any sense!

223
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,450
Young lady from Sokcho night ocean,

224
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:57,280
the world is full of men.

225
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,970
Don't get broken like this by a bastard like that.

226
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,600
You can meet a really good man as much as you want.

227
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,460
Let a guy like that be punished.

228
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,210
- Right?
- Of course.

229
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:16,190
Here, repeat after me!

230
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:20,400
Let him be punished!

231
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:24,160
Let him be punished!

232
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,180
Let him be punished!

233
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,850
How does it feel? It feels better, right?

234
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:37,380
Yes. I feel much better.

235
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,860
Forget about it all and live well from now on.

236
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,320
You are very pretty.

237
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,740
I know that's the right thing to do.

238
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,450
I know I have to do that...

239
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,210
But...

240
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,520
I can't give him up.

241
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,030
Why?

242
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,560
I'll only say that much for today.

243
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,560
What is this for?

244
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:27,620
I want to thank you for today and the other day.

245
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:32,350
Consider this as compensation for life counseling.

246
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,810
Okay?

247
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:37,010
Bye. Goodnight.

248
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:43,960
Why would she give me a hundred thousand won when I didn't listen to her that much?

249
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,540
That's right. If I want to make this money,

250
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,670
how many chicken skewers do I have to grill?

251
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:57,940
I can't drive since I had a drink anyway.

252
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,950
Okay, it's great.

253
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,470
Mi Rim, come and eat breakfast.

254
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,260
Kimchi stew?

255
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,080
Yes. And some spicy stir-fried pork too.

256
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,380
Have a seat.

257
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,930
I'm sorry, Grandma. I'm late for class.

258
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,610
But still, you should at least have a bite.

259
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,360
I will get something on the way.

260
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,580
I'll see you later.

261
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:44,160
Aigoo, she should have had at least a little bit.

262
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,330
It's the first time I've seen someone eating seaweed soup in a convenience store.

263
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,670
People might think it's your birthday.

264
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:13,650
It is my birthday today. That's why I'm eating it.

265
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,260
I see.

266
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,350
Instant seaweed soup is pretty good.

267
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:34,540
Korea sure knows how to make things like this.

268
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,110
What is this?

269
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,170
I can't sing the Happy Birthday song to you,

270
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,220
but I can buy you this.

271
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,240
It's a happy birthday cake.

272
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,060
As your neighbor, I want to wish you a happy birthday.

273
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,140
Don't be late for class.

274
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,230
This is pretty good, right?

275
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,170
I think it's good. Do you like it as well?

276
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,190
I like it, yes.

277
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,910
Wow, the dishes are so nice these days.

278
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,180
Wow, look at this!!

279
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:54,090
When you have a baby later, you can make gratin in here for them! It'll be delicious.

280
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,200
I'm glad you like it.

281
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,940
There are so many good things and pretty things here.

282
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,650
I'm so excited!

283
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:09,030
Se Ryun, I'll make sure to set the whole place before you come back from your honeymoon. Okay?

284
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,010
I'm really, so excited!

285
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:15,580
What is that? Let's go over there.

286
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,230
Here, here.

287
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,320
It's good!

288
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,980
Hello!

289
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,210
Hello, welcome. Let me guide you this way.

290
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,570
Yes! Let's go.

291
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,390
Oh my, wow...

292
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:41,970
This feels so great.

293
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,650
Se Ryun, you feel good too, right?

294
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,700
I'm glad that you are having a good time.

295
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,480
I told you, aren't you glad you came with me?

296
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,240
You can get some massage as well.

297
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,860
- Even when you're married, you have to come with me to get massages, okay?
- Sure.

298
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,520
You two look like you have a great mother-daughter relationship.

299
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,810
Please make sure to take extra care of my daughter's face.

300
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:05,190
She's getting married the day after tomorrow.

301
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,680
Okay, I'll take good care of it.

302
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,140
You're so good. It feels great.

303
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,350
We sold three chicken skewers for the last five hours.

304
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,240
This is the worst. The worst!

305
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,870
There's no impact on sales for us to wear sleeveless in this cold weather.

306
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:31,590
This month's income isn't even a quarter of what I get from a part-time job in driver service.

307
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,150
Dae Beom.

308
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,860
Let's just close this business.

309
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:40,940
Uncle, if you want to quit, you do that. I'll continue on my own.

310
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,880
Why are you reacting emotionally?

311
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,940
I'm not saying this because I want to.

312
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,350
The situation is just not great.

313
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,690
Padak! Padak! Yes, Padak! Padak!

314
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,580
Clap, calp! It's the Hot Young Men!

315
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,260
We have some delicious chicken skewers! Come all!

316
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:59,560
Why is he so passionate? Padak! Padak! Clap, clap!

317
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,640
Chicken Skewers! It's so tasty!

318
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,850
Noona, Noona, you are so beautiful!!

319
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,610
We have a variety of flavors! It's so tasty!

320
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:10,600
Come here, come here!

321
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,240
Thank you, enjoy your new clothes.

322
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,160
Goodbye, see you again.

323
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,520
- Noona.
- Soo Chul! Come on in!

324
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,210
- Wait a minute!
- Is there something urgent going on?

325
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:26,610
Why did you want me to come here?

326
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,340
Wait a minute.

327
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:33,020
Soo Chul, try this on.

328
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,270
What's with the clothes all of a sudden?

329
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,800
Try it on first.

330
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,500
Wow, I think it's because my brother is so handsome.

331
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,000
You make the clothing shine.

332
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,150
Oh, you're exaggerating.

333
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,180
Just wear it and go.

334
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:57,660
It'll get colder soon, so wear this to go to work.

335
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:01,090
Why are you doing this? I still have the clothes you gave me last time.

336
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:04,550
- I'll buy this myself then.
- What are you talking about?

337
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,010
If you keep doing this, I'll get angry.

338
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:11,830
As an older sister, I can get a winter jacket for my little brother.

339
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:15,340
Okay. But this is the last time.

340
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,390
Okay.

341
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,320
Sit here for a second.

342
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,180
Okay.

343
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:29,690
I have something to tell you, that's why I asked you to come here.

344
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,610
What is it?

345
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,660
To tell you the truth, the house next door is my property too,

346
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,610
and I let my friend stay there until now.

347
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:39,530
And my friend is moving out soon.

348
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:42,220
So once she finds a place,

349
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:46,990
I'll let you know, so get ready to move according to that date.

350
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:52,270
Why are you saying about moving all of a sudden?

351
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:57,130
I was so shocked after I saw rain was dripping in your house.

352
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:00,060
So, just do as I say.

353
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,550
Noona, I am grateful that you thought of me,

354
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,750
but I really wish you wouldn't do this.

355
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,580
Why?

356
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:16,030
If you do this, I feel overwhelmed, and I won't be able to see you comfortably.

357
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,780
Also, we've been living without trouble until now.

358
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,280
Our current house is like that because it's in the redevelopment neighborhood.

359
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,590
We're going to move to a different place next year, so don't worry about me.

360
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:30,270
Soo Chul. Why can't you understand me?

361
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:35,430
It's because it's hard for me to see you living a hard life.

362
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,830
Noona...

363
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,660
I'm telling you I'm okay.

364
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,510
And, everybody's going through this much of a hard time.

365
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:48,040
Are you really going to do this to me?

366
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:53,740
If I really need your help, I'll ask you. Help me then.

367
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:57,790
And if you asked your friend to leave because of me, don't do that.

368
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,120
I don't think that's right.

369
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,380
You might lose a friend doing that!

370
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,550
You're just like your father.

371
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:11,490
You're so stubborn like him.

372
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:15,230
But I'll enjoy this jacket.

373
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,980
Thank you, Noona.

374
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,670
Take this regularly, Lady-in-law.

375
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,380
What is it?

376
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,850
I got you to take some. Can you give me scissors?

377
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,250
Oh, my! Thank you.

378
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:40,600
To be honest, from head to toe,

379
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,250
I have nowhere that doesn't hurt.

380
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,860
Oh, no! This will help you.

381
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,510
Why don't you drink this now?

382
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:53,030
Okay. Let me try it.

383
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:02,150
I'm so lucky to have you.

384
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:06,740
But this is more than enough.

385
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:10,370
I have nothing for you, and I keep getting things from you.

386
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:13,130
It makes me feel very sorry.

387
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:15,910
Yes, sister-in-law. Just visit us without anything from now on.

388
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,240
And if you call me, I can go wherever you are.

389
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,770
You don't have to come all the way to this humble place.

390
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:25,700
Lady-in-law, please don't say that.

391
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,770
I can do this for you without a problem.

392
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:35,450
Also, sister-in-law, I'm here to ask you a favor.

393
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:38,770
A favor?

394
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:41,550
Excuse me?

395
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,910
Do you want us to move into your next-door unit?

396
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,990
Oh my...

397
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:50,640
When I saw that rain was dripping in this house,

398
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,210
I was so sad.

399
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:57,720
The friend that's living in that house said she'd move out in two or three months.

400
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,030
It might be a little small for all the family to move in,

401
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:06,550
but rain doesn't leak inside. So, please move in.

402
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,210
Sister-in-law...

403
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:11,020
I would love to live there,

404
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:15,160
but how could we shamelessly move into such a nice home?

405
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,670
My goodness. What are you talking about?

406
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:22,980
Even if it's late, I want to live close to my brother. That's all.

407
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:28,810
So, I hope you can persuade Soo Chul.

408
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:31,610
I saw him earlier and talked to him about it,

409
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,690
but he said he didn't want to move in.

410
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:37,510
Did he say that?

411
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:41,970
Don't worry too much. I'll persuade him.

412
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,730
Of course. I doubt that he meant it.

413
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:48,300
He must've said that because he felt embarrassed.

414
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,210
That's right.

415
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:54,680
He just doesn't like to be indebted to others.

416
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,200
Sister-in-law, if I move in next door,

417
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,310
I want to do everything for you.

418
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:03,730
I want to live close to you soon.

419
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:05,770
Me too.

420
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:09,720
Also, when you move in, throw away everything you used to use here.

421
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,600
I'll get new household goods for you.

422
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,720
Oh my, really?

423
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:20,900
Mom, this just fell into our laps!

424
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,220
This is all thanks to you!

425
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:28,120
Yes. If I didn't work at her place,

426
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,210
this kind of day would never have come.

427
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:34,550
You have to treat me well. Okay?

428
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,070
After seeing you at home and the playground all the time,

429
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:50,090
it feels strange to see you outside like now.

430
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:54,190
In what way is it strange?

431
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:58,040
Don't ask me when you know already.

432
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:03,830
This is our first actual date, right?

433
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:09,040
I'm all dressed up right now, but until I go pick up Se Jong,

434
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:14,030
I've been thinking about what I want to do with you.

435
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,360
What do you want to do?

436
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,600
I've had a bucket list of things to do with a boyfriend.

437
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,840
Do you want to hear them?

438
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,840
Go to a night movie. Climb the Namsan mountain steps holding hands

439
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,580
and put the love lock on there.

440
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,720
Go camping.

441
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,900
A picnic by the Han River

442
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,820
with a chicken take-out.

443
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,970
And...

444
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:46,490
Lee Young Gook?

445
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,610
It's you, right?

446
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:52,450
It's me, Seong Sik, Kang Seong Sik.

447
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:56,080
Yes, it's good to see you.

448
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:00,080
Who is she? Is she your niece?

449
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,310
What?

450
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,810
Honey, over here.

451
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,710
My wife's calling.

452
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,910
Hey, it's really good to see you.

453
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:15,510
- Enjoy your meal.
- Yes, see you later.

454
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,540
I'm sorry, Ms. Park.

455
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:37,330
I couldn't say that you are my girlfriend again.

456
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,490
I am really fine.

457
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:42,510
I told you I would wait.

458
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,960
Okay. Let's eat.

459
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:19,340
Wait, please!

460
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,060
Do you really think she's not his niece?

461
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,220
I thought she was because she looked so young.

462
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,800
Does that make sense? I could tell that she wasn't.

463
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,150
I had heard that his wife had passed away.

464
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:39,510
If she's not a niece, Young Gook really is something.

465
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,050
How can he date someone that young?

466
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:42,560
Doesn't he have three kids?

467
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:47,510
Why would a young girl date an older guy with three kids?

468
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:51,800
Lots of young girls would do anything for money these days.

469
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:57,070
That young girl is probably going after him for the money.

470
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,400
Out of the fear of people like that,

471
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,790
I am not going to hide my feelings.

472
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,820
Chairman is a good person.

473
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:41,150
And I'm not embarrassed to have feelings for someone good like him.

474
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:52,080
Why? Are things not going well with your girlfriend with a huge age gap?

475
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,660
I knew you were talking of yourself.

476
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,410
You can talk about it comfortably.

477
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:11,950
Yes, it wasn't about my friend's story but mine.

478
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,380
Is the age gap really a big deal in a relationship?

479
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,990
It's not that.

480
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,340
I worry that she will get hurt because of me.

481
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:27,550
It's not like I hadn't thought about it,

482
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:34,890
but now that we are facing it, I feel sorry for her, and I'm worried about her.

483
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:36,920
Right.

484
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:42,260
When people with very different backgrounds get together, problems can arise.

485
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:49,810
But it's the same even between the people who are very much alike.

486
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:54,110
So why do you worry even before things happen?

487
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:57,560
If you like each other, you should be together.

488
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:03,590
Do you really think that's okay?

489
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:09,410
Is there anything Chairman Lee Young Gook can't do?

490
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:13,420
Thank you, my friend.

491
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,240
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

492
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,800
You are my style, Miss.

493
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,630
What did you say?

494
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,770
Get out of my way, please.

495
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,660
The wind feels good, and the stars are bright.

496
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:47,060
Let us lonely people have a drink together.

497
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:50,690
Just one drink, I said.

498
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,370
Let me go!

499
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:54,360
Let's go for one drink.

500
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,680
- Let's have a drink.
- Let me go!

501
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,770
- Just one drink, I said.
- Excuse me!

502
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:02,800
Please help me! Let me go!

503
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,840
CEO Anna!

504
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,530
What are you doing? Let her go!

505
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:10,420
Driver Park.

506
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,240
Who the heck are you!

507
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,380
What the hell are you?

508
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:19,740
You bastard, where do you think this is? Do you want to die?

509
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,520
I'm sorry.

510
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,000
Please let me go.

511
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:31,730
You bastard!

512
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:34,190
Just one drink, I said...

513
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,950
CEO Anna.

514
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:51,740
CEO, here is some hot water.

515
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,480
Please have some.

516
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:09,040
Are you feeling better?

517
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,500
Yes. I'm okay now.

518
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,700
Thank goodness.

519
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:21,060
I was so surprised earlier.

520
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,290
Driver Park. Your hand!

521
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:30,080
Pardon?

522
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:34,370
Oh, it's okay.

523
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:38,450
Get some rest. Please call me if you need anything.

524
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:41,270
No, Driver Park.

525
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,500
You hurt your hand.

526
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,810
Wait a minute, please. We need to sanitize it.

527
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:49,950
No, it's okay. It's not that bad.

528
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:52,480
Have some rest.

529
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:23,900
Why do I feel strange and sad every time I see her?

530
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:37,120
Right, Mr. Park, please take this.

531
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,460
What is it?

532
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:44,670
The CEO from unit 1801 left it here. She wanted to thank you for yesterday.

533
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,570
I see.

534
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:49,780
Have a good day, then.

535
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:52,460
Oh, my back.

536
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:10,110
Driver Park, thank you for yesterday.

537
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:15,470
It's small, but please receive it as a token of thanks from me.

538
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:24,060
It's my favorite color.

539
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,600
- Congratulations!
- Thank you for coming!

540
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:42,200
- Hello.
- Thank you.

541
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:46,580
- Congratulations!
- Thank you for coming.

542
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:53,180
Lawyer Koh, Lawyer Koh.

543
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:57,160
The papers for Se Ryun to receive the company shares are ready, right?

544
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,500
Yes. When the wedding is over and the marriage is registered,

545
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,520
you can sign the documents.

546
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,410
Does she have to register for the marriage?

547
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:09,230
Yes. That's the legal requirement.

548
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:12,030
Why is it so difficult to get that tiny amount of shares?

549
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:15,650
Isn't it enough to do the wedding in front of people?

550
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:18,810
Anyway, thank you, Lawyer Koh. Thank you for your work.

551
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:21,650
Not at all. That's my job.

552
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:24,550
- Then.
- Yes!

553
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,440
Thank you for coming.

554
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:35,000
That's right. Once Se Ryun gets married today and signs the paper,

555
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,500
it's the end of you and me.

556
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,550
The day the shares are transferred,

557
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:45,280
I will kick you by the shin, so be ready, you rude bastard.

558
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,200
Mrs. Wang!

559
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,970
What are you doing here?

560
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:52,190
How come you are so late? Is the traffic bad?

561
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:53,880
I offered to send you a car.

562
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,280
It's okay!

563
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,470
You have enough to worry about other than me today.

564
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:03,790
Right, did something happen between you and Gi Ja?

565
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:09,300
I asked her to come with me, but she declined, saying she didn't feel well.

566
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,420
Actually...

567
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:15,080
Later! I'll tell you later!

568
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:19,930
Mrs. Jang! I can't thank you enough.

569
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:24,000
When the wedding is over, let's meet separately, in a big way.

570
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,620
Okay.

571
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:29,170
Don't worry about me, and go see your other guests.

572
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,230
Okay.

573
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:35,630
Mrs. Jang. Thank you so much.

574
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,960
What does she plan to give me for the successful match-making?

575
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,680
I'm dying of curiosity.

576
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:50,040
That's right, how big is even 1% of this company shares?

577
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:54,210
I will make sure she compensates me well.

578
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,980
Se Ryun. You are gorgeous.

579
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:12,540
You're really beautiful.

580
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,740
Really?

581
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:18,780
Yes. I think I've gone blind from you shining.

582
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:21,790
- Se Ryun, where are you?
- Stop it!

583
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:24,310
- I can't see you.
- Your parents are looking for you, Groom.

584
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:25,590
Ah, yes.

585
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:28,900
I'll see you in a bit, Se Ryun.

586
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,810
Jenny! Se Chan!

587
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:42,670
Se Jong!

588
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:46,290
You're very pretty, Auntie! Congratulations!

589
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,980
Thank you.

590
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:50,600
Auntie, you look like a princess!

591
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,500
A princess in a fairy tale.

592
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,810
- Really?
- Yes.

593
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:59,700
Really! Congratulations on your wedding, Auntie!

594
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:03,070
Thank you, Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong.

595
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,650
Let's take a photo with her.

596
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,840
Yes! Come here.

597
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,140
Please look here.

598
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:13,290
One, two.

599
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,750
It looks good. Now, try a cute pose!

600
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:18,010
One, two.

601
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:20,210
Yes, perfect. One more time.

602
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:22,690
One, two.

603
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,390
Yes, very good.

604
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:27,430
The ceremony will begin soon.

605
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:32,140
Children, we will have to go to the hall since the ceremony will begin soon.

606
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,260
- Yes.
- Yes.

607
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:39,020
Congratulations on your wedding.

608
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,810
Thank you, Ms. Park.

609
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:45,480
Do you have a handkerchief by chance?

610
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,220
Handkerchief?

611
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:51,270
I will bring you one as soon as I get the children to the wedding hall.

612
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:52,970
Thank you.

613
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:55,400
Let's go.

614
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:28,240
Who are you?

615
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:33,620
I'm Kyung Seok Oppa's girlfriend.

616
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:34,800
Pardon?

617
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,880
Also,

618
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,740
I'm pregnant.

619
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:43,910
It's Oh Kyung Seok's child.

620
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,250
What did you say?

621
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:52,700
I was going to give him up but just found out that I was pregnant.

622
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,930
This wedding can't happen. Please cancel it.

623
00:44:54,930 --> 00:45:01,080
Kyung Seok's child is inside of me. How can you marry him?

624
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,760
What are you talking about it right now?

625
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:09,300
What are you doing at someone else's wedding?

626
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:15,660
Please leave if you are going to keep speaking that nonsense.

627
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:18,860
Hye Jung, I've explained it all to you already.

628
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:21,870
I'm not marrying her because I love her.

629
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:26,590
I have no choice if I want to save our hospital. I need her money!

630
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:30,780
Hye Jung, do you want me to go bankrupt?

631
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:36,890
Even for yourself, this is not right.

632
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:40,620
Can you be happy when he marries you for your money?

633
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:49,250
Look at this. Two lines mean a pregnancy.

634
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:53,820
I beg you for the baby who will be born.

635
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:57,180
Please don't enter the wedding hall.

636
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:00,910
I'm going to have this child.

637
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:03,270
So for this baby,

638
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:05,410
please, I beg you.

639
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:07,910
Please.

640
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,990
Ms. Se Ryun!

641
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,410
Ms. Se Ryun!

642
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:39,450
Wait. Where are you going?

643
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:44,660
You heard everything too, didn't you?

644
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:49,030
Do I have to do this wedding?

645
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:50,730
Please tell me.

646
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:56,130
Would you marry if you were in my shoes?

647
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:06,590
Ms. Park, please help me.

648
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:09,070
Please.

649
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:26,180
Bride, bride! Where are you going?

650
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:33,160
Yes, we will begin the long-awaited wedding between the Groom Oh Kyung Seok and Bride Lee Se Ryun.

651
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,380
The bridegroom,

652
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,680
please enter!

653
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:53,810
Something terrible happened. The bride has run away.

654
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:56,770
She's disappeared.

655
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:04,550
She ran away with a woman.

656
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,000
Se Ryun!

657
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,930
Se Ryun. Where did she go?

658
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:24,470
Noona, please go that way. I will go this way.

659
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:26,230
Okay.

660
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:28,950
That wench, where did she go?

661
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:32,550
All she had to do was to marry and sign the papers.

662
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:35,780
Se Ryun, Se Ryun!

663
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:39,010
- Ms. Se Ryun!
- Se Ryun!

664
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:43,540
Where should we go?

665
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,920
Ms. Se Ryun, please go on top of this.

666
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,280
Just in case.

667
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,880
Se Ryun!

668
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,880
Se Ryun, Se Ryun.

669
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,860
Se Ryun.

670
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,300
Is someone inside? Se Ryun!

671
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,990
Are you in there? It's your mom.

672
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:14,020
Please open the door, Se Ryun. Is someone inside?

673
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:18,080
It's me, Ms. Park.

674
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,990
Ms. Park, have you seen my Se Ryun?

675
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,520
No, I haven't.

676
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,620
What do we do? What happened to Se Ryun?

677
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,900
Did someone kidnap her?

678
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:36,050
Madam, I don't think she's here.

679
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:39,940
Ms. Park, our Se Ryun has disappeared.

680
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:42,780
Please come out and look for her.

681
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,520
Right now, please.

682
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,570
Hurry up, okay?

683
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:49,320
Let's go. Se Ryun!

684
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,970
Se Ryun!

685
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:06,340
Ms. Se Ryun...

686
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:42,550
Ms. Park. Thank you so much.

687
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:45,420
You just pretend to know nothing and do nothing.

688
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:49,210
I will take care of everything.

689
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:52,260
Don't worry about me.

690
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:09,560
What should I do?

691
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:13,291
Shouldn't I tell Chairman and Madam?

692
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,010
Please call Chairman, now!

693
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:27,980
Yes, yes.

694
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,890
Madam! Oh, my goodness.

695
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:31,990
Madam!

696
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:33,460
My goodness!

697
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,800
Where is my Se Ryun? You family of thieves.

698
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,770
Where is Se Ryun?

699
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:42,450
Excuse me, why are you looking for your daughter here?

700
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:44,080
What?

701
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,360
Se Ryun! Se Ryun!

702
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,200
Look here, how dare you go into my home?

703
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,750
Excuse me!

704
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:53,150
Where is Se Ryun!

705
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:56,720
Se Ryun, Lee Se Ryun!

706
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,360
Yes, You!

707
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,700
Come here, you bastard.

708
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,520
Where did you hide my daughter? Give her back, you thief!

709
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,620
Let go of him! What are you doing to my son?

710
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:09,760
Madam, do it with words.

711
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,670
You planned all this to hide my daughter.

712
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:16,220
Where is Se Ryun? Where did you hide her!

713
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,190
What are you saying?

714
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:20,660
I don't know where she is!

715
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:23,720
What? You don't know? You hide my daughter!

716
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:29,170
While she was at the wedding, you all planned and stole her away!

717
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:32,180
What? What are you saying?

718
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:35,250
We didn't even know your daughter was getting married!

719
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:38,040
Did you see Dae Beom stealing your daughter?

720
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,340
My daughter disappeared from the wedding hall.

721
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:43,390
Why would she escape from her wedding?

722
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:45,000
Who do you think she did it for?

723
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,880
This thief made her do it!

724
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,700
Give me my daughter!

725
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,480
Hey, let go of my son!

726
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:56,050
How dare you grab my son!

727
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:58,260
Why are you doing this to my son!

728
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:01,190
Why do you keep coming to my house and making a fuss!

729
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:03,540
Let go of this!

730
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:08,470
What is going on?

731
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:10,870
Stop it!

732
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:15,210
Let my son go!

733
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:17,870
What are you doing!

734
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:19,970
Please get out of here.

735
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:23,270
Get out of here.

736
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:25,360
Young Gook!

737
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:28,350
Young Gook, it's all their fault.

738
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:30,740
They took away my Se Ryun.

739
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:35,120
That thief made my daughter change her mind.

740
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:39,250
- You bastard!
- My brother doesn't know anything!

741
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,720
My brother has nothing to do with Ms. Se Ryun running away from the wedding.

742
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:49,610
The person who hid Se Ryun is... me!

743
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:51,100
What?

744
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:54,940
Hey, who do you think you are to hide my daughter?

745
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:58,620
Did you see that Young Gook? They are all in this together!

746
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,220
No, it's not like that, Madam.

747
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:03,820
The fact is, just before the wedding,

748
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:11,230
the groom's girlfriend came to the bride's room and told Ms. Se Ryun not to get married because she's pregnant.

749
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:14,840
So Ms. Se Ryun was in shock, and that's why she decided not to get married.

750
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,300
And she asked me to help her run away.

751
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,350
What?

752
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:23,640
You are lying, aren't you?

753
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,510
Don't lie to me!

754
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:28,130
They are all lying to me, Young Gook.

755
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:31,120
They are all in this together!

756
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:34,180
That's a lie. Stop lying to me!

757
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:38,390
They are all lying! It's all lie, Young Gook.

758
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:42,510
Young Gook! They're all trying to trick us!

759
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:45,780
They are all lies.

760
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:48,530
Please tell them to stop lying!

761
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:54,080
It's all lies. This can't be true!

762
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,890
They are lying to me!

763
00:54:56,890 --> 00:54:59,260
It's all lies!

764
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:01,260
It's all lies...

765
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,460
I'm sorry.

766
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:16,590
I've done a terrible thing, Chairman.

767
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:19,610
Hyungnim, please forgive me once.

768
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:22,160
Otherwise, my family will go bankrupt.

769
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,390
If you forgive me once, I'll live the rest of my life for Se Ryun.

770
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:29,240
Do not speak Se Ryun's name with your lips again.

771
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:35,470
You abandoned the woman with your child and tried to ruin my sister's life for money?

772
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:37,670
You garbage bastard.

773
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:39,420
It's unfair for me too!

774
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:43,460
I tried to end the relationship cleanly before getting married.

775
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:47,250
But the mother-in-law begged me relentlessly to marry Se Ryun quickly.

776
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:53,330
Se Ryun's mother promised to save our hospital if I married Se Ryun.

777
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:56,940
That's why I did it.

778
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:59,660
It's unfair for me as well.

779
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:04,950
Don't ever appear before me again.

780
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:10,540
If you do, it won't end here.

781
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:23,370
My son-in-law Kyung Seok wouldn't do that.

782
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:26,590
Someone set this whole thing up.

783
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:30,150
My son-in-law Kyung Seok wouldn't do something like that.

784
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:33,850
No, no. It's all lies.

785
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:37,440
Please have some honey water and get yourself together, Madam.

786
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,860
What will happen to Se Ryun?

787
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:43,350
What do we do?

788
00:56:43,350 --> 00:56:47,340
You have to get strong to find Ms. Se Ryun.

789
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:52,820
Right. I can't collapse here.

790
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:02,540
Did you see Kyung Seok?

791
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:05,190
Did you see him? It's not true, right?

792
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:10,150
No woman or pregnancy, those are all lies, right?

793
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:12,880
No matter the circumstance,

794
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,740
how could you marry Se Ryun off to that piece of garbage?

795
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:23,610
Did you beg him to marry her by promising to save his hospital?

796
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:28,010
Who said that? Did Kyung Seok say that?

797
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:29,680
That coward said that?

798
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:33,250
Were Se Ryun's shares that important?

799
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:36,160
More than Se Ryun's happiness?

800
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:39,260
Yes, they are.

801
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:42,480
I went mad for the shares.

802
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:47,820
I gave my youth, my life, and everything to your father.

803
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:52,840
But he didn't leave me a penny and gave everything to you.

804
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,450
Even what he left for Se Ryun kept it from me

805
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:58,910
by making it conditional to her getting married first.

806
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:01,990
So how can you blame me for acting this way?

807
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:10,220
I'm doing this because it's a lifetime of resentment!

808
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,360
Get out.

809
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,720
Get out of this house now!

810
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:20,090
Why would I? I can't leave. Not over my dead body!

811
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:22,060
Just kill me instead!

812
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:24,000
- I can't leave this house!

Since I couldn't marry the man I loved,

it didn't matter to me who I was getting married to.

840

Since I wasn't marrying for love,

841
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:15,590
I had no expectations.

It's a marriage, not just anything.

It's your life at stake. How can you make a foolish choice?

845

My mom was talking about my company shares all day, every day.

846
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:40,430
I wanted to fulfill her wish, at least.

847
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:43,850
That's why I did it.

848
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:47,390
Do you think that makes any sense?

849
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:50,890
I know. I know I made the wrong choice.

850
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:53,570
I know I did a foolish thing.

851
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:59,060
But Oppa, I know you hate my mom,

852

01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:05,380
So please, don't hate my mom.

If it weren't for her helping me at the wedding hall,

it would have been very scary and hopeless on my own.
