I knew you were going to come.

Park Dan Dan.

15
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,530
From now on, I won't call you "Noona."

16
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:22,210
I'm just going to call you "You" because you're my woman.

Okay, Lee Young Gook.

Do whatever you want to do.

20
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,350
Park Dan Dan, why did you come here?

21
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:19,190
Why'd you come here? You're not supposed to be here.

22
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,510
Even if the Chairman says he likes you now,

23
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:28,750
when he regains his memory, he's going to marry Chief Jo.

24
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:34,600
I can't let someone else suffer just so I can be happy.

25
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,950
Chairman, I won't be going to Namsan tonight.

26
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,180

28
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:12,190
No, I shouldn't send him a text either.

29
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,710
Dae Beom, stop doing that and let's go home.

30
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,760
No, it's okay, Father. You, grandma, and mom should head home first.

31
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,060
I just want to stay and clean a bit longer.

32
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,910
Dae Beom, didn't you clean that already?

33
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,470
Why do you keep cleaning the same thing over and over?

34
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,090
Stop cleaning it. You're going to wear the machine down.

35
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,090
That's right, Dae Beom. Stop doing that, or you might hurt your arm.

36
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,780
You can just do it again tomorrow!

37
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,350
Mother-in-law, we should just leave. Honey, let's just go.

38
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,590
Then I'll leave with your grandma and mom now. You come home when you're done cleaning.

39
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,660
Yes, go home safely.

Ms. Park Noona is definitely coming. Definitely.

48
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:10,020
If she couldn't come, she would've messaged me that she wasn't.

49
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,650
Dad? Where are you right now? Why aren't you coming home?

50
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,320
Jenny, I'm at Namsan right now.

51
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,470
Namsan? With who?

52
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,660
- I'm here by myself.
- By yourself?

53
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,470
Dad, it's past 10 right now.

54
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,460
But what're you doing at this hour over there by yourself?

55
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,500
On this cold night when it's snowing, what're you doing at Namsan?

56
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,490
I have something to do here.

57
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,340
So don't worry about me,

58
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,270
and go to sleep.

59
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,410
How am I not supposed to worry when you're at Namsan by yourself at this hour?

60
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,040
But Dad, why's your voice like that?

61
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,100
Have you been drinking?

62
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,250
No, that's not it.

63
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,170
It's so cold that my lips are frozen.

64
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:08,440
So Dad, why are you over there like that?

65
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,920
Seriously, Dad, why are you so immature?

66
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,270
I seriously can't take my eyes off of you for a moment.

67
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:21,230
Hurry up and come home now. Right now!

68
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,540
I'll go home in a bit.

69
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,910
Don't worry.

70
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:39,280
Seriously, Dad. I don't understand him.

71
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,530
Jenny, what's wrong? What's going on?

72
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,550
Thing is...

73
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,090
Dad says he's at Namsan.

74
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,280
His lips are all frozen, so he can't even talk right.

75
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,740
I can hear him shivering.

76
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,390
I wonder why he went there in this weather.

77
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:04,590
Still? Is he still at Namsan at this hour?

78
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,620
So did your dad say that he's coming home?

79
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,020
Yes. He said he'd be coming home soon,

80
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,120
but I'm still worried that he might get into an accident.

81
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:25,750
Is the Chairman still waiting for me there?

82
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,920
He said 8 o'clock, so if I didn't show up, he should've just come home.

83
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:34,260
Chairman, seriously, why does he make everyone worry?

I knew it would be this way.

00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,540
I knew that you'd definitely be here, Ms. Park Noona.

100
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:45,250
Chairman. Why on earth do you make everyone so exhausted?

101
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,230
Excuse me?

102
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,010
What are you talking about?

103
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,750
Chairman, what were you doing here until now?

104
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,770
Why do you make everyone worry over you?

105
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,820
I was waiting for you, Ms. Park Noona.

106
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,030
Why were you waiting for me?

107
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,590
Why is everything on your terms?

108
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,630
Also, if we were supposed to meet at 8,

109
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,580
and if I didn't arrive, that means it's nothing.

110
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,670
But up until now, what is this?

111
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,310
If that's so, then why did you come here?

112
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:25,550
Didn't you come to see me?

113
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,540
Jenny thought that you got into an accident,

114
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,110
crying that on this cold night, you were still at Namsan until this late hour.

115
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:35,730
She said she would call the police, so I had no choice but to come here.

116
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,530
So you're saying

117
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:45,680
that you didn't want to come here,

118
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,330
but you came here against your will?

119
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:53,010
Yes. Your phone's not working, so what could I do?

120
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,510
Jenny was saying that she'd call the police,

121
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:59,390
but on this cold winter night, why should the police suffer?

122
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:04,440
Why on earth are you making everyone suffer so much? Why?

123
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,450
I get it now.

124
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,760
Making you come here at this late hour,

125
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,890
I'm sorry for making you so tired.

126
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,700
Let's go now.

127
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,390
Jenny, your dad says he's going down now.

128
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,070
His phone died,

129
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:45,810
that's why he couldn't call. So don't worry and go to sleep.

130
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:42,580
Park Dan Dan. What's not is not.

131
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,740
Park Dan Dan, you did well.

132
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:50,700
You made the right choice.

133
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:10,520
Dad, why did you go to Namsan last night?

134
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,110
You can't even ride a cable car that late.

135
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,980
Why did you go?

136
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,520
Do you know how worried I was?

137
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,120
Does this make sense?

138
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,230
A father should be worrying about his daughter, not the daughter worrying about her father.

139
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:30,470
Dad! Don't pretend to be asleep.

140
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,910
Say something.

141
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:39,460
Dad, what's wrong? Are you sick?

142
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:44,160
It's burning. Why is he so feverish?

143
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,590
Jenny... I'm sick.

144
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:53,150
Ajumma. Ajumma, Ajumma!

145
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,900
- What is it?
- Ajumma, Dad's sick.

146
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,360
His temperature is really high. Do you have any fever reducer?

147
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,110
Is the Chairman sick?

148
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,470
Jenny, is your dad sick?

149
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:09,090
Yes, he can't even open his eyes, and he's burning up.

150
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:12,630
Okay, I'll go get some medicine.

151
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:29,500
Dad. Take some medicine.

152
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,380
Chairman, here.

153
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,300
Why did you go to Namsan yesterday?

154
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,560
It was snowing really hard.

155
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,300
Chairman, did you go to Namsan yesterday?

156
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,960
Why did you go there?

157
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,470
With who?

158
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,660
He went alone.

159
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:58,680
He stayed there past midnight, so this happened.

160
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,660
I just went exercise.

161
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,210
It's not a big deal, so don't worry about it.

162
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:09,490
Jenny, you'll be late. Don't worry about me and go to school.

163
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,430
Okay.

164
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,650
Chief Jo, please take care of him.

165
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,800
Yes, don't worry. Go ahead.

166
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,690
He said something urgent came up and sent me to the jewelry shop alone,

167
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:34,150
but he went to exercise at Namsan?

168
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,260
He must not have wanted to go to the jewelry shop with me.

169
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,110
Does he hate being engaged to me that much?

170
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,030
He hasn't even brought up our engagement to the children.

171
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:46,410
I really don't like it.

172
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,140
I can't even hit him.

173
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:56,550
I hope our sales rise today. It worries me.

174
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,800
Right. On the way to the store,

175
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,780
I will put up some flyers around the store and apartments.

176
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:07,520
Dae Beom. Dae Beom!

177
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,590
Who's calling your name this early?

178
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:16,290
Isn't it that young lady's voice?

179
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,940
Lee Se Ryun?

180
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,170
Dae Beom, I'm here.

181
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,330
Hello.

182
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,520
Oh, my goodness. Why are you here?

183
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,890
Ms. Se Ryun...

184
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:44,560
Lee Se Ryun, why did you come here?

185
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,000
Oh my. You were in the middle of eating.

186
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,600
Wow, it looks delicious.

187
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:55,600
Can I have some rice, too? I'm really hungry.

188
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,140
What?

189
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,440
What are you waiting for? Bring her some food.

190
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,820
She says she's hungry. She's still a guest.

191
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,310
Grandmother.

192
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:09,270
Let's eat first, then talk.

193
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,830
It looks delicious.

194
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:18,600
Wow, dried seaweed.

195
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,210
It's tasty.

196
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,030
Oh, goodness.

197
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,480
It's so good. It's really delicious.

198
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:38,090
We only have kimchi bean sprout soup, fried eggs, and dried seaweed, but you're saying it's delicious.

199
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,480
Thank you for saying that.

200
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,020
It's been a really long time since I've eaten something like this.

201
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,940
Wow. My goodness.

202
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,430
The soup is really tasty.

203
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,610
Young lady, don't tell such lies.

204
00:17:54,610 --> 00:18:00,770
You lived eating high-quality and delicious food. How could this taste good?

205
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,190
I'm telling you the truth.

206
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:07,440
I have never had such a delicious kimchi bean sprout soup in my life.

207
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,860
It's really the best. Mother, you're the best!

208
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,860
My goodness.

209
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:19,780
Young lady. How can you barge into someone else's house early in the morning like this?

210
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:23,890
You barged in here in the middle of the night drunk and made a scene last time too.

211
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,270
Now you're barging in regardless it's day or night.

212
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:30,070
Eat up and leave. We have to go to work.

213
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:33,820
You don't even bother a dog while it eats.

214
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:37,300
Let's talk after we eat.

215
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,690
Lee Se Ryun, if you're done eating, leave.

216
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,330
I have to get ready for work.

217
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,690
Dae Beom...

218
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,800
I'll eat fast.

219
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,490
It's good.

220
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,620
I'll eat faster, Mother.

221
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,420
What should we do?

222
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:07,180
That young lady must really like Dae Beom.

223
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,450
I mean, a young lady from a rich family packed her bags and came here.

224
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,450
She's even trying to get on our good side.

225
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:16,590
- Why would she do that?
- What should we do, Honey?

226
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,210
Should we just let her stay?

227
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,260
What do you mean to let her stay?

228
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,780
Tell Dae Beom to send her home.

229
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,830
Mother-in-law, I'll get going first.

230
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,890
- Okay.
- See you later.

231
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,580
Yes.

232
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:39,540
Mom, I thought that young lady had chased Dae Beom away,

233
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,200
but it seems like she didn't.

234
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,920
That's what I'm saying! I think so too.

235
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:49,960
How can we cold-heartedly chase her away when she likes him so much and came all the way here?

236
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:57,200
That's right. But her being seven years older than Dae Beom bothers me.

237
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,640
Who cares about age these days?

238
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,710
A 7-year age gap won't make any difference in the long run.

239
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,500
Is that so?

240
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:11,600
Hey, hey, where are you going in?

241
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,090
I'm going to live here.

242
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,600
This is your room, right?

243
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,880
What? You're going to live here? You?

244
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,990
Why can't I live here?

245
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:26,750
I can live wherever you are.

246
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,120
Lee Se Ryun, seriously why are you doing this?

247
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,230
You're driving me crazy.

248
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,440
Don't go crazy, Dae Beom.

249
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,230
If it's difficult for you, I'll get used to your environment.

250
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,670
I can adjust for you.

251
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,400
Whatever you eat, I'll eat.

252
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,610
Wherever you lay, I'll lay.

253
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:49,680
So just don't kick me out.

254
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:56,220
Stop with that nonsense. You know we're not right for each other.

255
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:01,640
I can't go. I won't go!

256
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,730
If you want to kick me out, you have to come with me.

257
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,930
Grandmother, Mother.

258
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:18,710
Look here, young lady. Dae Beom's dad told us to talk well with you and ask you to leave.

259
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,430
And even Dae Beom says that this isn't right.

260
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,990
So just hurry up and leave.

261
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,520
We don't have time for this, we all have to leave for work.

262
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,770
Please don't worry about me, and start your day.

263
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:34,220
While you're gone to work, I'll just stay here quietly.

264
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,360
Lee Se Ryun, say things that make sense.

265
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,950
Look here, young lady. As the grandmother, let me say one thing.

266
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:47,450
You might be seven years older than Dae Beom,

267
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,390
but if Dae Beom says he likes you, we'll give you our blessings.

268
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,920
But do you think your mother would be okay with this?

269
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,490
Think about it.

270
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,300
How many times has your mother come over here and caused a riot?

271
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,000
I will handle all of that.

272
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,360
I'll make sure that there won't be any situations like that.

273
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:10,090
Also, I'm at the age where I no longer need parental permission.

274
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:14,260
I don't wish for anything.

275
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:18,910
I just want to be next to Dae Beom.

276
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:27,250
Young lady, I know you're acting this way because you like Dae Beom.

277
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,410
But we come from completely different environments.

278
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:33,810
You can't go from living in a rich house to a place like this.

279
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,160
Even the bathroom will be uncomfortable for you.

280
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,380
So stop stirring Dae Beom's feelings, and please leave now.

281
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:44,100
Hey, Park Dae Beom, what are you doing? Hurry up and show the lady the way out.

282
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,340
Let's go. I'll take you home.

283
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,400
No! I'm not leaving.

284
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,800
Grandmother, Mother. Please let me live here.

285
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,970
Oh my...

286
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,860
What is she doing?

287
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,720
I just want to stay next to Dae Beom.

288
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,040
Oh my...What the...

289
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,180
I made the porridge watery on purpose.

290
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,390
Is it okay for you to swallow?

291
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:24,070
Does your throat still hurt a lot?

292
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,010
Since I had medicine and got plenty of rest, I'm feeling better.

293
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:30,300
I'm... home.

294
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:38,470
Why, Chairman? Just have a bit more.

295
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:41,220
I've had plenty.

296
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,870
You have to take your medicine, Chairman.

297
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,470
Has the Chairman's condition improved?

298
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,820
Has his fever gone down?

299
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,910
His fever's down, and he seems to be feeling better.

300
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,870
But in a day, his face became half of what it was.

301
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,690
I see.

302
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:09,840
Why did he go to Namsan in the middle of the night when it's snowing so much?

303
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,890
Yet, I feel like there's something else going on with the Chairman.

304
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:20,160
It's like his spirit is broken.

305
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,520
He's supposed to be getting engaged the day after tomorrow, but he's lifeless with his shoulders all low.

306
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:31,330
Oh, I wish the Chairman's memory would come back soon. Everything is such a mess.

307
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,120
Since my son Joon Oh is wearing this, it looks so good.

308
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,870
This one is from the new collection.

309
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:46,740
Joon Oh, you should wear this out today.

310
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,770
Thank you, Mom.

311
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:55,260
But, can you pick one out for a woman around my age?

312
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:59,540
What? Did you get a girlfriend?

313
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:04,520
The thing is, there's a senior in my class,

314
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,140
and she helped me a lot, and I'm grateful to her.

315
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,180
So I wanted to get her a present.

316
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,030
Oh, a class senior?

317
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:17,170
I thought you got a girlfriend in the secret of me.

318
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:21,410
If it's a senior friend helping my Joon Oh, then we have to get her a gift.

319
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:25,960
Let's see. How about this one?

320
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,190
Oh, this looks good and warm.

321
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,950
- Right?
- I'll take this one, Mom.

322
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:33,980
One second. With this, let's add this one, too.

323
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,900
If you put these together, it looks really good on ladies your age.

324
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,920
No, that's okay. I'll just do this one.

325
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,340
Okay, fine.

326
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,620
But Joon Oh,

327
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,090
why have you been coming around so often?

328
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:55,510
In the past, I'd say, "Come, visit," but you wouldn't visit.

329
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:01,640
Mom, the thing is...

330
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:08,290
What do you mean by I'm here so often? It's because I want to see you.

331
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:11,600
It's strange, but I've been thinking about you a lot.

332
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,400
Really?

333
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,630
Those are my favorite words to hear.

334
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:20,730
That you are saying, you want to see me.

335
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,930
Out of everyone in this world, I love you the most.

336
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:31,380
What's gotten into you?

337
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,370
Hey, Joon Oh. Let's go visit your uncle's restaurant.

338
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:40,670
Even if you're busy, your uncle opened a business, and we should at least go once.

339
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,440
Okay, that sounds good, Mom.

340
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,260
Good? Let's go.

341
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,610
Let's go.

342
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,930
We'd appreciate your honest opinions, please.

343
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:54,790
How is it?

344
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:58,630
My son-in-law and grandson invented this flavor.

345
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:03,020
Well, chicken just tastes like chicken.

346
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,940
It's not bad.

347
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,350
Eat a lot.

348
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,340
Aigoo, Mr. Park.

349
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:13,240
Don't listen to a word he says.

350
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,640
What does he know about flavors?

351
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,690
He means it's tasty.

352
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:23,820
For me,

353
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,200
both taste good.

354
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,610
Oh, really? Thank you very much.

355
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:32,120
Mr. Ma, with flavors like these, will our restaurant be a success?

356
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,600
Why are you being so hasty?

357
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,990
We need to do it first to see if it'll succeed.

358
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,160
Do you think they are fortune-tellers?

359
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,340
What your mother is saying is right.

360
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,250
"Heaven helps those who help themselves."

361
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,100
If you try really hard,

362
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,370
your day of success will come.

363
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:57,480
Thank you so much for helping us.

364
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,780
- Noona!
- Welcome!

365
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:05,300
- Have you been well?
- Oh, our doctor came, too.

366
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,490
How are you, Grandmother? How are you, Uncle?

367
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,720
Joon Oh, welcome.

368
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,900
This is your aunt.

369
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,130
- Nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you, too.

370
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:18,850
Sister-in-law, he's so cute and handsome!

371
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:20,490
Yes, he is.

372
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,900
Dae Beom, your aunt is here.

373
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,850
What?

374
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:27,340
Aunt, how are you?

375
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:30,180
Our lineage's eldest son. You're working so hard.

376
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,790
This is my son, Joon Oh.

377
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:34,240
This is your older cousin. Say hello.

378
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,570
Hey, it's nice to meet you.

379
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:39,180
Me, too.

380
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:43,160
My son Joon Oh is in medical school. I hope you two become good friends.

381
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,790
Yes.

382
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,670
Mr. Park, we'll be heading out.

383
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,440
Oh, yes.

384
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:56,730
Noona, say hello. They are the owners of the jokbal place across the street.

385
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,250
Yes, it's nice to meet you.

386
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,840
My name is Ma Yong Pil.

387
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,790
Ah, yes.

388
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:08,070
And I'm his younger brother, Ma Dong Pil.

389
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:11,900
Yes, How are you?

390
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:18,390
What do you think? Do you like it?

391
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:23,390
Yes, totally. It's so pretty, warm, and light.

392
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,850
But this looks really expensive.

393
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:30,920
I got it from my mom's store to gift it to you. Wear it comfortably.

394
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,950
Did you tell your mom?

395
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,660
No.

396
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,850
When I saw her face, the words wouldn't come out.

397
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:45,680
What're you going to do? If she finds out that you took a break from school, she'll freak out.

398
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:50,870
When I figure out what I want to do, then I'll tell her. I think that would be best.

399
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:53,780
If I told her I took leave without a plan,

400
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:57,340
I think my mom would worry even more.

401
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:02,700
From your mom's perspective, the two of us living like this would freak her out, too.

402
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:08,960
I said I was staying with a friend, but I didn't tell them that friend was a guy.

403
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,580
It feels like I lied, so I feel bad.

404
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:16,370
Let's live like this a little longer, and when you and I get more serious,

405
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:19,550
let's tell both our families then.

406
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:24,980
Yes, that sounds good. That would put my conscience at ease.

407
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:33,060
It's so pretty. Thank you, Joon Oh.

408
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,360
Yes.

409
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,630
Chairman, are you feeling better now?

410
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,800
Yes, I'm fine.

411
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:58,880
Here is ginger tea to make you feel warm.

412
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,290
Thank you.

413
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:06,960
And these are the rings for our engagement.

414
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,110
Isn't it beautiful?

415
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,540
Yes, it is.

416
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:15,720
Chairman, about our engagement,

417
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,040
we should really tell the kids now.

418
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:22,610
I will tell them since your condition is not good. They are all on the second floor now.

419
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:25,980
No, please don't.

420
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,830
I will tell them now.

421
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:52,240
Dad. Are you feeling better now?

422
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,250
Yes, I'm fine now.

423
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,200
That's a relief.

424
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,420
From now on, don't go somewhere like that alone, late at night.

425
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,860
Okay, I won't.

426
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:06,250
Did you have something to tell us?

427
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:09,190
What is it? Tell us.

428
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:22,290
I am getting engaged on Christmas Eve.

429
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:27,500
Are you getting engaged? With whom?

430
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:31,010
I'm getting engaged with Chief Jo.

431
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:34,460
Dad. What is an engagement?

432
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,440
It means promising to get married.

433
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,300
That means, dad and Chief Jo promise to get married to each other.

434
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,100
This means Chief Jo will become our new mom.

435
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,560
What are you saying, Dad?

436
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,940
Will Chief Jo become our mom?

437
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,630
Not right now.

438
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:57,450
You will get to know each other better during the engagement period.

439
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:01,530
In this world, our mom...

440
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:05,570
No one other than the person in heaven is my mom.

441
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:11,660
I don't want somebody else to be my mom.

442
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:19,360
Then my mom will be sad in heaven.

443
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:30,560
Dad. How can you decide on such an important matter without discussing it with us?

444
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:36,670
You said that you'd make a decision after democratically discussing it together, regardless of what it was.

445
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:41,740
This is something I had promised before my accident.

446
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:44,760
I could not discuss it with you all.

447
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,570
Actually, I had promised to marry Chief Jo.

448
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:54,040
But because my memory hasn't returned, we are only getting engaged for now.

449
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:58,770
So, I hope you all understand.

450
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,650
After promising Chief Jo of marriage

451
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:06,580
and not keeping the promise is not right.

452
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,500
Jenny and Se Chan.

453
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:13,440
I hope you can congratulate my engagement.

454
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,140
I thought about it a lot as well,

455
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,960
but you also need a mom.

456
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,450
I don't know when my memory will be recovered.

457
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:25,500
Instead of living in an anxious state like this,

458
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,980
at least for the sake of you guys,

459
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,410
I think it is better for me to get engaged.

460
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:34,650
Dad. Don't say you are getting engaged for our sake.

461
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:36,710
Because we don't like this.

462
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,220
I have definitely said this.

463
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,350
I am against this engagement.

464
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:44,270
Dad. I don't like it, too.

465
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:50,610
Especially the fact that Chief Jo will become our mom, I hate it!

466
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,310
Who cares what those tiny kids think?

467
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,180
Why would you postpone the engagement because of the kids?

468
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,210
How does the kids' opinion matter?

469
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:18,360
What do I do now?

470
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:26,830
That's right. Chief Jo, you could do this.

471
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,860
We have Ms. Park.

472
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,560
Ask her to help.

473
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,930
Ms. Park?

474
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:38,890
The kids love Ms. Park. They will listen to her.

475
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:41,210
- That's true, but...
- Chief Jo!

476
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:44,010
Now isn't the time to be picky!

477
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:47,880
If the engagement gets postponed now, it is the end. There is no future hope.

478
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,950
Only if you get engaged can you do something.

479
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,780
What if Young Gook's memory comes back?

480
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,690
What will you do then?

481
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:08,580
What is it that you want to say?

482
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:12,800
Earlier, you heard everything on the second floor, right?

483
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:21,090
That the kids are against me and Chairman's engagement.

484
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:26,650
Yes, although I couldn't hear everything clearly.

485
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,130
When I came to the Chairman's house for the first time,

486
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:36,440
Jenny was nine years old, and Se Chan was seven years old.

487
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:42,350
Se Jong was barely two years old.

488
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:47,010
The late Madam was always unwell.

489
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:50,430
So with Se Jong...

490
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:54,850
I basically raised him like my own child.

491
00:36:54,850 --> 00:37:02,770
That's why I paid extra attention to him since Se Jong is still young.

492
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:09,190
Even toward Jenny and Se Chan, I have been sincere to them until now.

493
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:13,390
But they have no idea of my intentions.

494
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:16,540
Besides the fact that I didn't give birth to them,

495
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:20,190
I really thought of them as my own children.

496
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:28,440
Here you go...

497
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,650
Thank you.

498
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:39,580
I wanted to receive the kids' blessings more than anyone else.

499
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,980
While taking care of the household activities,

500
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:45,870
I couldn't take care of the kids fully.

501
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:49,670
I regret that and am sad about that.

502
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:55,580
Chief Jo.

503
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:59,420
On that note...

504
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:07,630
Ms. Park, can you convince the kids?

505
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:10,630
Me?

506
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:13,700
How do you want me to do it?

507
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:19,320
How can the Chairman and I force the engagement when the kids are against it?

508
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,070
For the kids to attend the engagement with a good heart,

509
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,290
and for the children's sakes,

510
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:28,040
can't you convince them?

511
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,730
I should get engaged and married to the Chairman quickly,

512
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:35,230
for Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong,

513
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:40,240
our kids, to have a stable life.

514
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,510
Ms. Park, I ask you for a favor.

515
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:48,500
It's for the kids.

516
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:14,910
Please set it here first.

517
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:25,160
I hope they all like it.

518
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:32,200
We're in big trouble! Se Chan is missing!

519
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:37,360
What do you mean by Se Chan is missing?

520
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:41,470
Look at this. It was on his desk.

521
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:50,480
Dad. I hate that Chief Jo will become our mom.

522
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,480
Instead of seeing her become my mom,

523
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,190
I will live alone.

524
00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:00,170
Hereafter, don't look for me.

525
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:10,930
Why is everyone out? Did something happen?

526
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:13,580
Jenny, where are you coming from?

527
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,830
Did you see Se Chan by any chance?

528
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,770
I'm coming back from tutoring.

529
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:20,390
What about Se Chan?

530
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:27,220
Jenny. Se Chan went missing after leaving this note.

531
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,840
What did you say?

532
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,220
If anyone finds Se Chan, let's contact each other.

533
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,410
Yes.

534
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:49,080
Let's go that way.

535
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:03,250
Jenny, don't you think Se Chan went to the karaoke?

536
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,210
I just thought that as well.

Hey, Lee Se Chan. How can you sing alone?

542
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,690
What? Why did you guys come here?

543
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:32,210
Why would we come? We are here to sing as well.

544
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:34,290
Ms. Park, should we sing a song?

545
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,470
Let's do it!

00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:38,970
I have been sincere to them until now.

557
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:41,850
But they have no idea of my intentions.

558
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:48,360
Besides the fact that I didn't give birth to them, I really thought of them as my own children.

559
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:55,440
That's right. I will eventually leave the Chairman's house and go to the US.

560
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,960
Chief Jo should be next to Chairman and the kids.

561
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,270
Then I can leave at ease.

562
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:10,030
Jenny. What happened?

563
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:18,170
Ms. Park. Am I a bad daughter if I'm against my dad's engagement?

564
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:23,710
- What?
- I spoke to a friend at tutoring who is in a similar situation.

565
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,870
And she allowed it for her dad.

566
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:33,970
She said she was against it at first, but she felt bad for her dad.

567
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:43,030
So she allowed it. And now her dad looks very happy.

568
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:49,350
And she told me that I shouldn't be against it since it's my dad's life.

569
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:52,790
Noona, don't hang out with that friend.

570
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:55,270
She doesn't even know it that well.

571
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:58,110
I will become the bad son.

572
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:02,630
I don't like Chief Jo becoming our mom.

573
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:10,600
Ms. Park, what do we do?

574
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:16,240
My friend says I should do it for my father's sake.

575
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:21,170
What would you do if it were you, Ms. Park?

576
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:35,010
I understand all your feelings.

577
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:37,880
But like what Jenny's friend said,

578
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,250
for your dad,

579
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:45,460
because it's his life.

580
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:52,240
If it were me, I would probably be able to congratulate him.

581
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:58,170
Because, before the Chairman got into an accident and lost his memory,

582
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:04,990
he had promised to marry Chief Jo.

583
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:10,060
You should keep your promise.

584
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:15,710
Seriously! Why is everything up to Dad's term!

585
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:18,880
I heard that they planned a wedding,

586
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,700
but they changed it to an engagement for you guys.

587
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:25,230
So they can have an adjustment period with you guys.

588
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:31,670
So, why don't you guys also give it a try before the marriage?

589
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:39,910
It's an engagement, so try to get closer to each other before the marriage.

590
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:54,360
Dad. Just get engaged.

591
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,300
Are you sure I can do that?

592
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,960
Instead, discuss marriage with us beforehand.

593
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,950
Please don't do it your way.

594
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:11,240
Because you getting married means we get a mother as well.

595
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,260
Okay, I'll do that.

596
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:18,600
I am sorry for not telling it sooner.

597
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:26,440
We will try to get closer to Chief Jo before the marriage.

598
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:29,440
Thank you.

599
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:35,240
And we'll explain it well to Se Jong.

600
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:45,390
Dad. We don't like your engagement,

601
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:49,940
but Ms. Park told us your happiness is also important.

602
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:54,230
So we made a difficult decision.

603
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:56,980
- Did Ms. Park say so?
- Yes.

604
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:03,460
So I hope you understand our feelings as well.

605
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:25,480
Ms. Park, please come out for a second to see me.

606
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,890
I have something to say to you.

607
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:34,400
I'm not trying to say anything difficult, so please come out for a second.

608
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:40,390
Ms. Park? He is not calling me Noona anymore.

609
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:49,990
Chairman.

610
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:05,280
Ms. Park, thank you for coming out.

611
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,780
I called you out to apologize to you.

612
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,050
For what?

613
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:18,170
All this while, I made you feel uncomfortable with my immature actions.

614
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:21,100
I sincerely apologize.

615
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:25,330
Thinking from a different perspective, when the opposite person doesn't have any feelings,

616
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:30,190
but one follows you around, then it's very irritating.

617
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:35,420
I only thought of myself and made you tired. I am sorry.

618
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:39,770
If it weren't for you, I would have become the bad guy.

619
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:46,910
Thank you so much for telling me I shouldn't do that.

620
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:52,590
You are not just our kids' teacher,

621
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:56,910
but you are a really good mentor to me as well.

622
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:59,680
Thank you.

623
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:03,430
It's nothing.

624
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:06,910
Oh right, about the engagement.

625
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:12,520
Thank you for convincing Jenny and Se Chan.

626
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:17,250
Then I'll go inside now.

627
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,900
I'm in such a good mood because you came over to see me.

628
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,640
Please drink it.

629
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,590
Yes, thank you.

630
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,830
Gosh, there's no food for me to serve you with.

631
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:52,510
I should have bought something if I had known.

632
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:55,470
I am really okay.

633
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:01,740
Is everything all right at home?

634
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:05,850
How is Young Gook doing?

635
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:10,610
Chairman and Chief Jo

636
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:12,990
are getting engaged

637
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:15,270
on Christmas eve.

638
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:18,460
Did they end up going through with it?

639
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:22,310
Regardless of them making a promise, they should at least wait until his memory comes back.

640
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:27,050
What's the rush? Why are they in such a hurry--

641
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:31,010
Ms.Park, why are you crying? What happened?

642
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:33,270
It's nothing. I'm sorry.

643
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:35,900
Why? Did something happen to you?

644
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,930
No.

645
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:46,520
Did you have a fight with your boyfriend?

646
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:51,580
- So, did you break up?
- Yes.

647
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:58,950
Poor thing...

648
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:00,950
Who is it?

649
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:06,280
Who made our kind Ms. Park cry? What a jerk.

650
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,550
It's okay, Ms. Park.

651
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:11,970
You'll meet someone better later.

652
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:15,210
Thank you, CEO.

653
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:20,250
So please don't cry.

654
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:34,840
- Oh, my!
- What is this?

655
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:42,400
How was your day?

656
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,850
But where is Dae Beom?

657
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:48,540
Dae Beom said he's coming later after cleaning the restaurant.

658
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:52,560
But what's all this?

659
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:56,100
You must be tired from working all day today.

660
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:59,180
I thought you might be hungry, so I prepared this.

661
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:02,780
Have a seat, please.

662
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:08,060
You prepared all this yourself, young lady?

663
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:11,110
Oh, I didn't prepare this myself...

664
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:14,300
But I specially ordered it from a hotel.

665
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:19,100
Please, have a seat. This hotel makes really great food.

666
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:24,900
I figured you ate already, so I prepared something light.

667
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,340
Please, have a seat.

668
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:32,090
Their oyster dishes are good, Grandmother.

669
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:34,890
What's all this?

670
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:38,220
- Ms. Se Ryun.
- Yes?

671
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:41,380
I think it'll be best for you to leave before Dae Beom comes.

672
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:45,000
I'll take you home. Come on out with your bags.

673
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,710
Driver Park... No, Father-in-law! Can't you just take me in?

674
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:52,380
Ms. Se Ryun, you really should not be staying here.

675
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:57,390
I didn't come here without thinking.

676
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:03,750
After breaking up with Dae Beom, I put a lot of effort into forgetting him.

677
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:09,780
I was going to marry another man, and I even went to America.

678
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:14,410
Yet after all of that, I couldn't forget him. What could I do?

679
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:18,650
I suffered so much that I thought I would die.

680
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:22,310
It was so painful.

681
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:26,790
Father, I did not come here rashly.

682
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:31,390
My feelings for Dae Beom are genuine.

683
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:36,180
So please, please let me stay here.

684
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:40,510
Please, just don't tell me to leave.

685
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,830
Grandmother, please help me.

686
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:52,040
Can't you please take my side?

687
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,190
Grandmother.

688
00:53:54,190 --> 00:54:01,400
Okay, if you can last a month here, I'll think about it.

689
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,770
Are you serious?

690
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:05,460
I can last more than a month, two months,

691
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,790
no, I can last forever.

692
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:10,520
Grandmother, I'll be really good.

693
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,920
Thank you so much.

694
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:18,210
Do you like it that much?

695
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:20,580
Yes.

696
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:23,590
Grandmother, I'll massage your shoulders.

697
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:26,520
- Okay, give it a go.
- When it comes to massage,

698
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,940
since I've received so many, I'm really good at it.

699
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:32,770
- Oh, that feels good!
- It feels good, right?

700
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,170
Yes, it feels good, you're right.

701
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:37,320
Here, here.

702
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,890
Lee Se Ryun, you haven't left yet?

703
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:42,290
What are you doing now?

704
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:44,980
I'm going to stay with Grandmother in her room.

705
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:47,270
So you don't have to care about me.

706
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:51,100
Since you're tired, you should go wash up and sleep, Dae Beom.

707
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,110
Hey, Lee Se Ryun.

708
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:55,450
Grandmother, should I massage your legs as well?

709
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:57,900
You must be so tired after working all day.

710
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,770
Fine. Why don't you go ahead?

711
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:04,840
Okay, bring your legs out.

712
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,370
Oh, that feels nice.

713
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:09,490
Aigoo, that feels so good.

714
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:12,600
Lee Se Ryun, you need to leave by tomorrow.

715
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,600
Okay?

716
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:20,060
Grandmother, here are the pressure points.

717
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:23,400
If you press right here, it feels amazing.

718
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,560
How does that feel?

719
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,650
Does it hurt too much?

720
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:29,190
Aigoo, that feels so good.

721
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,450
What do we eat for breakfast today?

722
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:40,880
If it were just us, we'd eat whatever.

723
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,630
Since that lady is here, I have to put more thought into this.

724
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:47,380
Do I need to sauté some meats from the morning?

725
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,890
Yeon Sil, Yeon Sil.

726
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:53,350
That young lady left. She's gone.

727
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,530
What? Did she leave?

728
00:55:55,530 --> 00:56:00,310
She was definitely sleeping next to me last night, but she was gone when I woke up.

729
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:04,210
She probably couldn't handle it after one night, then ran.

730
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:08,100
She even left her luggage and just ran away.

731
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:12,330
She said, "I only need Dae Beom." It's unbelievable.

732
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:15,970
So she stirred his emotions again and left?

733
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:18,900
It's so upsetting.

734
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,280
- Mom!
- What is it?

735
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,270
Come here.

736
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,830
What is going on here?

737
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:39,170
I mean..!

738
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:52,420
How long has it been?

739
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:56,070
I was about to call you for a round of golf.

740
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:58,850
I guess our minds were connected.

741
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:03,920
Mrs. Wang, this is not a time to talk about golf.

742
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,820
Excuse me?

743
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:11,730
I thought about whether I should talk about this or not,

744
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:15,270
but I thought you definitely needed to know.

745
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:18,460
That's why I asked you to see me.

746
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:22,310
Something I need to know? What is it?

747
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:25,860
It's about your daughter.

748
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:30,860
Recently, my daughter's friend had dinner with Se Ryun,

749
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:36,990
and that night, Se Ryun brought her boyfriend.

750
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:40,590
A boyfriend? My Se Ryun?

751
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:43,100
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

752
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:46,990
Mrs. Jung, you know quite well, that thing that happened to Se Ryun.

753
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:50,440
But how could Se Ryun already have a boyfriend?

754
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:55,700
She definitely said he was her boyfriend when she brought him.

755
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:59,290
But the thing is, that guy said he dropped out of college,

756
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:05,060
and his background wasn't that good.

757
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:10,920
Right. His name was Park Dae Beom.

758
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:14,120
Do you know who he is?

759
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,280
Who did you say?

760
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:20,090
Park Dae Beom?

761
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:23,530
Since you grew up so precious, you probably have never done things like this before.

762
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:25,660
But you're peeling well.

763
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,840
You are right.

764
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:32,160
This is my first time, but I think I have a talent for this.

765
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,780
It's fun.

766
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:38,020
I think this fits my skill set.

767
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:43,340
Grandmother, Mother. From now on, I'll take care of garlic peeling.

768
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:46,070
Mom, we got another person to help.

769
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:49,470
You're right. You're right.

770
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:54,420
Dae Beom, don't forget to put on lotion.

771
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:56,300
Slather it on thick.

772
00:58:56,300 --> 00:59:00,270
Otherwise, your skin gets rough, okay?

773
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:06,300
I can't help it. I should go put it on him.

774
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:09,100
Grandmother and Mother, leave the garlic.

775
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:12,180
This is my work. You know that, right?

776
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:14,450
Just leave it as it is!

777
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:22,690
I know she's not that young, but she's very cute and charming.

778
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:27,090
Maybe she's coming from a wealthy family, and she's very straightforward.

779
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:32,550
I know. She's so comfortable around here, and it's so funny.

780
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:35,750
But Mom, if she leaves again,

781
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:39,100
Dae Beom will get hurt again, which worries me.

782
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:42,340
Should we just tell them to get married?

783
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:46,100
They're both at the age where they don't need parental permission to marry.

784
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:49,210
No, just leave them for now.

785
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:54,060
We need to see how long she can last here.

786
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:57,970
If they get married, and she leaves, then what?

787
00:59:57,970 --> 01:00:01,290
Yes, you're right. But I'm more worried about her mom.

788
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:04,980
Her mom probably doesn't know that they're together.

789
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:07,580
She probably doesn't know, which is why they've been together.

790
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:12,480
It is a concern. I wonder if this is okay.

791
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:18,550
Did you put the lotion on him well?

792
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:20,390
Yes, Grandmother.

793
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:25,990
I was putting lotion on him, and how soft he is...

794
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:28,390
He's like a cute puppy.

795
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:32,120
- A cute puppy?
- Yes.

796
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:35,840
So I'm going to try to raise him well.

797
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,090
Oh, what? She says she's going to raise someone else's son.

798
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:40,580
My goodness.

799
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:42,490
Hey, Lee Se Ryun!

800
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:44,110
Mom!

801
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:48,090
I doubted it, but what the heck are you doing here? And what are you wearing?

802
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:50,170
Hey, are you over here peeling garlic?

803
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:53,120
You crazy little brat, are you out of your mind?

804
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:58,320
Hey, this woman, how can you come into someone else's house with your shoes on!

805
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,350
What kind of manner is this?

806
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:03,140
Mom, take your shoes off.

807
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:04,880
What did you say to me?

808
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:10,410
How dare you speak like that to me! How can you drag my daughter and make her do this crap!

809
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:11,890
What the heck are you doing in someone else's house!

810
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:13,520
- What?!
- Mom, stop it!

811
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,340
Mom, let's go home!

812
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:16,970
- Let's go home.
- What?

813
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:18,800
I can't stand this!

814
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,960
Madam, why are you acting this way?!

815
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:25,080
Why am I acting this way? Are you asking because you don't know?

816
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:28,820
So you've tried all your tricks, and now you drag my daughter here? You piss-poor beggars...

817
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:33,040
Hey! Do you think I don't know your schemes?!

818
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,690
Wow, seriously. Here!

819
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:42,790
Take this money and get lost, you bums!

820
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:46,730
You all listen to me.

821
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:49,390
No matter what the circumstances,

822
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:52,990
your kind, and my people can never mix, you beggars.

823
01:01:52,990 --> 01:01:55,870
If you need money, say the word. I'll give it to you!

824
01:01:55,870 --> 01:01:58,870
Mom! Seriously, what's wrong with you?

825
01:01:58,870 --> 01:02:02,120
Mom, please go home with me. Hurry!

826
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:05,660
Hey! Don't you dare come close to my daughter ever again.

827
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:07,650
You gigolo bastard!

828
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:09,950
- Seriously, stop it!
- You beggar bastards!

829
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:12,610
Those horrible bastards!

830
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,030
How can she just spray money like that?

831
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:31,520
Does she saying we should pick this money and get lost?

832
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:34,760
What a horrible wench!

833
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,630
My goodness.

834
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:39,110
How could this happen?

835
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:46,280
Dae Beom, go inside to your room.

836
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:49,730
I said, Dae Beom, go into your room!

837
01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:11,590
- Come out!
- Let go! What's wrong with you?

838
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:15,690
How could you do something so rude and ignorant, Mom?

839
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:19,950
How could you go into someone else's home with your shoes on and throw money at them?

840
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:21,520
Did I do that for no reason?

841
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:24,820
I did that because that parasitic family keeps dragging you in.

842
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:29,260
Mom... I came here myself!

843
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:33,380
Grandmother, Father-in-law, and Mother-in-law told me to go home.

844
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:38,260
But I was able to stay because I begged them to let me be with Dae Beom.

845
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:40,870
Who do you think you are to do this, Mom?

846
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:44,890
Mom, please go inside and say sorry to them.

847
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:47,900
Are you crazy? Have you really lost your mind?

848
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:50,260
Madam!

849
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:59,990
This is the bag Ms. Se Ryun left behind.

850
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:02,920
And here.

851
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,230
It's the money that you left behind.

852
01:04:05,230 --> 01:04:08,660
I picked up every single bill.

853
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:14,410
Why? Don't you like the money?

854
01:04:14,410 --> 01:04:17,500
If you don't like it, forget about it.

855
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:22,470
I want to throw the money at your face as you did it, but I won't.

856
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:26,050
Because that will make me the same vulgar person that you are!

857
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:29,330
What? Did you say I'm vulgar?

858
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:32,800
Driver Park. Just say it's not enough money.

859
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:35,190
I hate your money!

860
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:39,120
I've lived very well without your money until now, and I won't need it in the future either.

861
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:42,230
Don't you come close to our house ever again.

862
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:47,890
I never want to see either Ms. Se Ryun or you ever again.

863
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:53,030
How did you call me just now? That ignorant man.

864
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:56,470
Seriously what's wrong with you, Mom?

865
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:58,210
Is money everything?

866
01:04:58,210 --> 01:05:02,940
I don't want to call you "mom" anymore.

867
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,310
I am embarrassed.

868
01:05:04,310 --> 01:05:05,810
What? Embarrassed?

869
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:11,340
Yes! I'm embarrassed! I'm mortified!

870
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:15,860
Hey! It's your brother's engagement tomorrow. You have to come!

871
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:18,790
Did you hear me, Lee Se Ryun?

872
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,710
Is he a new driver?

873
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:48,530
I was told to drive you over to the engagement party.

874
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:51,850
Chairman has already left with Driver Kim.

875
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:53,640
Okay.

876
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:17,540
Even the weather is so good, Sarah!

877
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:19,810
I guess the weather is blessing you on your engagement day.

878
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:26,420
It's December, but the weather is as beautiful as Spring!

879
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:30,260
It's like the Forsythia and Azalea are about to bloom!

880
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:35,700
Don't stop so abruptly!

881
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:39,740
My hair almost got ruined.

882
01:06:39,740 --> 01:06:42,040
I am sorry.

883
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:48,790
The weather is so good.

884
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,870
You look pretty!

885
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:22,520
Next, we'll have the exchange of rings.

886
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:27,780
The soon-to-be groom put the ring on the soon-to-be bride first, please.

887
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:36,970
Please have a round of applaud.

888
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:48,760
Next, the soon-to-be bride put the ring on the soon-to-be groom, please.

889
01:07:56,870 --> 01:08:01,580
Please give them another big round of applause.

890
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:03,830
You look pretty!

891
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:09,840
Next is the cake cutting ceremony.

892
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:12,630
The soon-to-be groom and bride,

893
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:17,670
please blow out the candle together.

894
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,590
What's going on?

895
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:04,920
Young Gook! What's wrong?

896
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,670
Chairman!

897
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:21,130
♫ Why do you run away, love. Like a shy child ♫

898
01:09:21,130 --> 01:09:27,770
♫ In case I lose it, I hold it tight ♫

899
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:35,020
♫ But love always runs away, chased by longing ♫

900
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:41,060
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

901
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:44,030
[Young Lady and Gentleman]

902
01:09:44,030 --> 01:09:45,270
Kids! Hurry on down!

903
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:46,700
We went to the amusement park before, yes?

904
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:48,840
All together with Ms. Park Noona, Se Chan, and Se Jong.

905
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:49,960
Do you remember that, Dad?

906
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,400
Am I right? That wasn't a dream, right?

907
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:54,510
There was definitely something between Ms. Park Noona and me.

908
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:56,800
Is the Chairman's memory coming back?

909
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,980
I'm going to get married even if you don't allow it.

910
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:00,660
You've really lost your mind completely, didn't you?

911
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:05,530
I'm not going to marry anyone besides Dae Beom. That means you won't get a share, is that okay?

912
01:10:05,530 --> 01:10:07,590
♫ Why do you run away, love ♫

913
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:09,230
Are you... CEO Anna?

914
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:10,440
Driver Park...

915
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,840
I think we'll have to do a thorough examination.

916
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:15,670
Jo Sarah! It's been a while. What a cute kid.

917
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:17,480
Who is this Ajussi?

918
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:23,070
I can't just do nothing and let this end. I have to do anything before Chairman's memory comes back.

919
01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:26,900
Whatever it is.
