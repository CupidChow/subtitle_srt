00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,380
Ms. Park.

♫ When I walk this road ♫

4
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,200
♫ it makes me cry  ♫

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,560
♫ It reminds me ♫

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,560
Chairman.

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,260
What are you doing here until now like a fool?

8
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,760
Chairman.

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,390
♫ My beautiful love ♫

10
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:50,590
♫ It seems like ♫

♫ Goodbye is easy
 ♫

15
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,630
Chairman. Thank you for coming.

16
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,230
I knew you would.

17
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,740
This means you are accepting my feelings, right?

18
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,140
Am I right?

19
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,940
Yes.

20
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,890
Let's do this.

21
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,350
Let's hold our hands and go wherever it'll take us.

22
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:34,240
Chairman. If you were going to do this, why did you come so late?

23
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,410
Why?

24
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,200
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,340
Ms. Park.

26
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,610
You are all frozen.

27
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,700
Why did you do this to yourself?

28
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,150
Your face is frozen too.

29
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:06,850
♫ The wind is blowing even with the collars up ♫

30
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,150
♫ I get teary with cold tears of farewell ♫

31
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,430
Now that you are here,

32
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,400
it's okay.

33
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,740
I'm perfectly fine.

34
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,270
♫ I couldn't forget and buried in my heart ♫

35
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:27,790
♫ My once precious love ♫

36
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,660
I'm sorry for coming late.

37
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:40,050
It's because I lacked confidence and felt sorry

38
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,350
about liking you.

39
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,540
You are a fool, Chairman.

40
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,140
Why would you be sorry for liking someone?

41
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,570
You should be sorry when you dislike someone.

42
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,840
♫ I have to abandon ♫

43
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,120
♫ the longing and the grieves ♫

44
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:10,130
♫  What am I looking for on this road wandering  ♫

45
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:18,720
♫  Why am I here for what  ♫

46
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,750
Please eat.

47
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,590
Thank you.

48
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,180
It's very warm and delicious.

49
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,580
It feels like my body's thawing.

50
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,740
I feel alive now.

51
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,210
Ms. Park. On a cold day like this,

52
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,310
were you really going to wait for me all night long?

53
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:59,360
Yes. I was going to wait all night long until you came.

54
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,180
You're very stubborn.

55
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,220
While I was waiting for you,

56
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,180
I reflected on myself a lot.

57
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,210
When you were 22 years old,

58
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,990
while you were waiting for me,

59
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:23,750
I realized how lonely and sad you would have been.

60
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,580
Also, I thought of how painful you would've felt.

61
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,820
When I thought this would've what you felt at that time,

62
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,880
I got very sad.

63
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,380
If you didn't come tonight,

64
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:43,400
I would've felt helpless and sad,

65
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:48,120
as if I were the only person left on the earth.

66
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,740
I don't remember that time, but when I was 22 years old,

67
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,160
did I wait for you that long?

68
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,680
Yes, you waited for me past midnight.

69
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,130
Like today, it was snowing and very cold on that day.

70
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,500
So you got sick the day after.

71
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,550
I think it's better that you don't remember that time.

72
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:19,960
Did I really that recklessly approach you?

73
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,680
Yes, you really approached straightforwardly.

74
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,190
You banged on my door at 3 in the morning,

75
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,930
asking me to answer whether I liked you or not.

76
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,670
You even came to the academy I was attending,

77
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,250
calling me, "Ms. Park Noona, Ms. Park Noona,"

78
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,510
and followed me around.

79
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,720
Wait, what did I say?

80
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,480
Ms. Park Noona?

81
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,350
Did I call you like that?

82
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,840
No way.

83
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,970
I'm telling you the truth.

84
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:55,170
If your memory for that time came back,

85
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,560
you would be very embarrassed.

86
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,380
Ms. Park. Please don't talk about things I don't remember.

87
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,030
Let's just eat the udon.

88
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,210
But Ms. Park.

89
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,190
It hasn't been that long since I called off my engagement.

90
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:31,120
I would need time before we go public about our relationship. I'm sure you know.

91
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,330
Chairman. I'm not that thoughtless.

92
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:42,630
For now, let's do a secret office relationship.

93
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,840
Thank you.

94
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,900
You don't have to.

95
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,170
But instead,

96
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:57,040
please promise me one thing.

97
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,860
What is it?

98
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:04,580
Let's not change our feelings for each other.

99
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,540
Okay.

100
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,540
I think my frozen body is thawed now.

101
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,670
Then, Chairman.

102
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,990
What should we do starting tomorrow?

103
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,360
Let's do everything.

104
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,860
Then, let's go have pork cutlets first.

105
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,790
Okay. Let's do that.

106
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,830
And, let's go to the late-night movies,

107
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,460
go out with the children,

108
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,080
and let's go to good restaurants--

109
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,790
Ms. Park, have you caught a cold?

110
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:45,250
It's okay. There is nothing wrong with me.

111
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,280
Is it good?

112
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,750
It's good, isn't it?

113
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,100
It's good.

114
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,760
It's because you are eating with me.

115
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,170
Let's say that's the reason.

116
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,690
Ms. Park. You can't sleep after freezing yourself outside for so long?

117
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,130
No, Chairman.

118
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,320
Is this really our first day?

119
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,530
I can't tell if this is a dream or a reality.

120
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:27,950
Chairman, you won't tell me you changed your mind tomorrow, right?

121
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,090
I'm afraid to go to sleep.

122
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,420
In case this is a dream.

123
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:36,560
Ms. Park. This is not a dream. Please go to sleep.

124
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,660
I promise I won't take it back.

125
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:43,200
If this is not a dream,

126
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,230
to celebrate the first day of our relationship,

127
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,700
can you sing a song for me?

128
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,180
Sing a song?

129
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,360
Ms. Park.

130
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,210
Please don't ask me for things like that.

131
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,730
When I got a boyfriend,

132
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,460
I wanted to hear him sing to me.

133
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,700
My friend's boyfriend sings to her every day.

134
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,660
Do you know how envious I was?

135
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,780
Ms. Park, even so, I can't do that.

136
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,490
Just once, please?

137
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:21,590
If you don't sing for me, I won't go to sleep.

138
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:25,770
Okay, then. Listen carefully.

Isn't this sound coming from Young Gook's room?

147
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,350
I think so.

148
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,640
It seems that way.

149
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,040
Maybe he's gone crazy.

150
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,440
He must be very lonely in these long winter nights.

151
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,400
For him to sing that song?

152
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
I know.

153
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,690
He's gone crazy.

154
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,040
Ms. Park. Did you catch a cold?

155
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,610
I just feel a bit down.

156
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,880
But I'm okay.

157
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,760
Ms. Park, you look a bit unwell.

158
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,420
Are you okay?

159
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,750
I think she's feeling under the weather.

160
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,930
It's nothing serious. Please don't worry.

161
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,160
Ms. Park. I will take Se Jong to the kindergarten today.

162
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,020
You should get some rest.

163
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,430
- Se Jong, I will take you to kindergarten today.
- Yes.

164
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,320
Jenny and Se Chan should come with me too.

165
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,350
I will drive all of you to school.

166
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,560
- Okay.
- I like it.

167
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,770
Have a good day, everyone.

168
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,520
Yes.

169
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,110
Have a nice day.

170
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,120
Have a nice day, sir.

171
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,470
I will go first.

172
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,030
Why so early? Let's go together in a bit.

173
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,730
I have a lot to do. I want to distribute more flyers as well.

174
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,440
We can do it all together.

175
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,540
- Why don't you sit and eat some?
- Yes.

176
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,520
I completely broke up with Se Ryun.

177
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,740
Please know that.

178
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,890
Seung Ho gave you this painting as a gift?

179
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,240
Yes.

180
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,000
That artist's work is hard to get even with money.

181
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,750
How did Seung Ho get hold of that?

182
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:23,080
He seems to know a lot of people in the art world.

183
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,790
He was always interested in that area.

184
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,450
Se Ryun.

185
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,000
While there are many guys who think they are great.

186
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,910
There aren't many who can buy you a painting like that.

187
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,020
You have to know that. Do you know why?

188
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,480
That painting is the only one in this world.

189
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,960
But instead of hanging it in his house, he gave it to you.

190
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:47,390
You can even give out money, but not that painting.

191
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,900
Seung Ho is very impressive.

192
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,990
Mom, stop it already.

193
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,460
I'm going to get a callus in my ear.

194
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,410
That painting shows his feelings for you.

195
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,240
Wow, Seung Ho did really like you.

196
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,320
It looks like he wants to restart with you.

197
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,030
Since you accepted that painting, you should buy him a meal.

198
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:13,000
You have to show your appreciation at the least.

199
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,040
Really?

200
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,230
Did your mother like that painting that much?

201
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,500
Yes. She said that it's a piece by an artist that's hard to get,

202
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,590
and saying you're capable and amazing.

203
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,600
It was quite a commotion.

204
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,730
It wasn't that much.

205
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,560
But Seung Ho, that gift was excessive.

206
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,540
I still don't know if I can take it.

207
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,970
I feel burdened by it.

208
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,040
You said you liked that painting.

209
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,580
If you can feel happy by looking at it, that's good enough for me.

210
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,740
Can't I do that for you?

211
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:58,570
Actually, I want to do a lot more than that if it's possible.

212
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,220
Seung Ho.

213
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:05,550
What I'm saying is, don't feel burdened.

214
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,830
Thank you, Seung Ho.

215
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,720
Was that Ajumma okay?

216
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,910
I left because you told me to.

217
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:18,640
But I felt bad, and I was worried about you.

218
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:24,510
Is she the mother of the guy you were seeing?

219
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,580
I want to apologize for what happened that day.

220
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,430
I'm sure you were shocked.

221
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:32,780
Is there a problem between you and him?

222
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,210
I'm sorry for intruding.

223
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,590
It's okay.

224
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:42,940
We broke up.

225
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,140
I see.

226
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,990
Was it because of me?

227
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,940
No, it's not just because of you.

228
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,200
I liked him a lot.

229
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:01,620
But there was an obstacle between us we could not overcome.

230
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,870
That's why we broke up.

231
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,880
I see.

232
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,330
Se Ryun.

233
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,750
I would like to make a formal proposal.

234
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:17,830
Let's date formally. What do you say?

235
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,100
Seung Ho.

236
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,810
I thought you were seeing someone.

237
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,240
So I stayed a distance.

238
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,470
But if you are all finished,

239
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,310
I would like to go out with you again.

240
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,790
Like before.

241
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,080
Did they break up completely?

242
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,600
Yes.

243
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,360
I was wondering about it.

244
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,090
But now that it happened, I'm very upset.

245
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,140
I knew she would be like this.

246
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,150
Since she's rich, she condescended and played with him.

247
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,170
She's even seven years older than him,

248
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:56,330
and the thought of her playing around with my baby Dae Beom

249
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,950
makes me upset and angry.

250
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:03,950
Our Dae Beom loved her genuinely.

251
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:07,860
It might have felt different if Dae Beom dated her casually as well.

252
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,910
But Dae Beom gave his all love to her.

253
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:20,260
I guess Se Ryun dumped Dae Beom for the second son of the Jinsa Group.

254
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,860
What did I do?

255
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:28,690
I've split up our Dae Beom and Se Ryun. I did that.

256
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,870
Yes, it's me.

257
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,570
Now?

258
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,820
Mrs. Jang.

259
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,950
What is this?

260
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,710
It's my heart because I'm so grateful to you.

261
00:16:55,710 --> 00:17:01,480
Se Ryun and Seung Ho have decided to date each other formally.

262
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,710
- Is that so.
- Thanks to you,

263
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,720
that gigolo from the parasite family could also be thrown away in one shot.

264
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,790
I love the fact that Se Ryun and Seung Ho are back together again,

265
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:17,120
but also, I'm so glad that we got rid of that gigolo from the parasite family.

266
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,790
I feel like a rotten tooth got pulled out.

267
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,900
Mrs. Wang. You've gone overboard.

268
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,610
You keep saying a gigolo from a parasite family.

269
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,440
How would they feel if they heard you speak like this?

270
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,160
You're only spitting back onto yourself.

271
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,720
What about Se Ryun, who dated a gigolo from a parasite family?

272
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,810
What does that make her?

273
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,970
Mrs. Jang.

274
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:42,280
I will get going first.

275
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,110
I forgot I had an important plan.

276
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,530
A plan?

277
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:49,130
Yes, you should go. But please take this.

278
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,990
It's okay.

279
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,520
Mrs. Jang.

280
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,020
Do you know what this is?

281
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,970
It's Hermes. Hermes.

282
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:01,190
I said it's okay!

283
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,810
Why is she acting like that suddenly?

284
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:11,710
What did I do wrong? She's acting like a different person.

285
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,330
Is this gift not enough?

286
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:18,970
Okay, whatever. I don't care if she takes it or not.

287
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:25,120
Will I be able to touch Se Ryun's shares now?

288
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,700
Oh, no! Mom. Mom!

289
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,090
- Sarah! Sarah!
- Mom!

290
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,940
Why did you do it? Why?

291
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,240
Why did you steal?

292
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,740
Mom, I'm scared.

293
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,910
Mom, please go and return everything and beg for forgiveness!

294
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,460
Please save me, Mom!

295
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,890
Mom!

296
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,960
My Sarah hasn't done anything wrong.

297
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,780
Please don't take her!

298
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,030
Sarah!

299
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,830
Mom! Mom!

300
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:05,400
Sarah... Sarah!

301
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,700
Mom. What's wrong? What is it?

302
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,980
It's nothing...

303
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,000
I had a strange dream.

304
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,960
What kind of a dream?

305
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,600
Look at your cold sweat.

306
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,020
It's okay.

307
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,900
It's okay. I'm okay.

308
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,600
Mom.

309
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,370
Mom, you don't look good at all lately.

310
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:40,060
Why don't you go to the hospital?

311
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,910
I'm going out now.

312
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:47,260
Are you going to see that bastard?

313
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,580
Get yourself together.

314
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,600
Mom. I will take care of my own business.

315
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,190
Please go to the hospital.

316
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,440
I'm going out now.

317
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,790
The reason why my Sarah turned out like this,

318
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:08,120
how everything got messed up, it's all because of me.

319
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,310
Because I've committed a crime, all the bad things happened to Sarah.

320
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,080
Right.

321
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,730
I should come clean, at least now.

322
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:28,620
I should do that, at least now.

323
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:51,340
Rather than living with nightmares, let's just sell this.

324
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:55,570
I don't think I can live out my life.

325
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,930
I've blocked Sarah's future too.

326
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,240
Oh! Hello.

327
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,630
Hello.

328
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:09,450
Please say hello, Honey. She's the owner of our store.

329
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,800
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

330
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,960
Oh, my.

331
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,950
- Why don't you come inside?
- Oh, it's okay.

332
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,150
- Hey, you!
- Oh, my goodness...

333
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,710
- Why don't you come in for some tea?
- No, it's okay.

334
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,570
I wondered why you bolted like that.

335
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:25,090
It's because of her.

336
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,370
The one who looks like your first love, Soon Ae. Oh, yes!

337
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,790
So you wanted to see her?

338
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,100
Just in a few months,

339
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,690
how can her face change that much?

340
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,560
You're right.

341
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,390
Is she sick or something?

342
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,150
Looking at her today, she's not the one.

343
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,610
She doesn't look anything like Ms. Soon Ae.

344
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,610
Really?

345
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,470
♪ Mountain bunny, bunny ♪

346
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:06,810
♪ Where are you going? ♪

347
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:11,350
♪ Hopping, hopping while running, ♪

348
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:16,280
♪ Where are you going? ♪

349
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,000
How did I collapse with one word by Ms. Park?

350
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,440
Why did I sing the Mountain bunny song?

351
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:34,260
I think she's feeling under the weather.

352
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,870
It's nothing serious. Please don't worry.

353
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,630
It's me.

354
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,220
Yes, Chairman.

355
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,900
Ms. Park. Did you take the medication?

356
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,540
No, not yet.

357
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,820
If I rest a little more, I'll be okay.

358
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:04,870
You froze yourself yesterday, and you still haven't taken any medication?

359
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:08,980
Chairman. I will wait a bit longer.

360
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,850
And if it doesn't improve, I will go get some medication.

361
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,970
I'm okay for now.

362
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,800
Okay, I get it. I'll hang up now.

363
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,250
Yes, Chairman.

364
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,500
Secretary Yoon. I have nothing until 3 pm, right?

365
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,950
- I will go out for a bit.
 - Yes, sir.

366
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,500
Chairman, why are you home at this hour?

367
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,230
My condition is not great.

368
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,210
So I thought I'd work at home and then go.

369
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:44,550
Mrs. Yeoju, my stomach is upset. Can you make me some porridge?

370
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:49,360
I was going to make some for Ms. Park, so everything is ready. I'll make it right now.

371
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,620
Okay. Thank you.

372
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:59,550
How do I get this medication to Ms. Park?

373
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:03,440
Chief Kim and Mrs. Yeoju are at home.

374
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:10,290
If I call Ms. Park and ask her to come and get it, they will think it's strange.

375
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,680
Chief Kim, please come to my study for a second.

376
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,310
Yes, Chairman.

377
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:29,340
I left files at the office, Chief Kim.

378
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,210
They are very important.

379
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,750
Please go with Driver Kim and get them.

380
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,900
I will let Secretary Yoon know.

381
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,330
Yes, I will.

382
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,240
Chief Kim has gone out.

383
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,370
What do I do with Mrs. Yeoju?

384
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,210
Is it ready already?

385
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:57,530
Yes. It's abalone porridge. Please have some.

386
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:01,770
Mrs. Yeoju, the house feels empty without flowers.

387
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:04,100
Can you go buy some?

388
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,700
I should have paid attention.

389
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,550
I'm sorry. I will go to the Yangjae flower market.

390
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:12,390
Ah, yes. But did Ms. Park eat her porridge?

391
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,650
Yes, I just brought her some.

392
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,130
I understand.

393
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:19,320
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

394
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,330
Chairman.

395
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:44,960
What are you doing at home, at this hour?

396
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:51,820
That is... I don't feel so well either.

397
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,470
Chairman.

398
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:03,710
Did you come home to have porridge with me?

399
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,960
Yes, that's right.

400
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,070
I wanted to eat porridge with you.

401
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,910
And I'm here to give you the medication.

402
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:18,460
Wait a moment. I will bring out my porridge.

403
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,990
Let's eat together.

404
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:29,720
Chairman, please hurry and go back to the office.

405
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,920
I'm going to work at home today.

406
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:39,300
Chairman, it's only the first day of our relationship.

407
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,850
You can't be like this already.

408
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,820
Because you want to see me,

409
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:49,430
you can't skip your work from the first day.

410
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:53,800
Ms. Park. Please just eat your porridge.

411
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:04,360
What if Mrs. Yeoju and Chief Kim see us like this?

412
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,100
I think they'll figure it out immediately.

413
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,920
Don't worry about that. I sent them on errands.

414
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,550
Chairman, I've brought flowers.

415
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,270
Chairman, where are you?

416
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,870
He's not in the study nor his bedroom.

417
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,290
Where are the porridge dishes?

418
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,800
Did he not eat here?

419
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,780
It's not like he would have done the dishes.

420
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,640
This is strange.

421
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:04,800
What do I do? What should I say if I get caught?

422
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,860
Yes, yes.

423
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:18,230
Ms. Park. Have you seen the Chairman?

424
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,920
C-Chairman?

425
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,260
Is he home?

426
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,290
Yes, he came home early because he said he didn't feel well.

427
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:28,860
And he asked me to buy some flowers, so I was on my way to the Yangjae flower market.

428
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,740
But a beautiful new flower shop opened at the intersection near here.

429
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,840
We don't have to go to Yangjae-dong anymore.

430
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,560
But where has he gone?

431
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,300
The porridge dishes disappeared too. How strange?

432
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:15,200
What is this? They weren't here a minute ago.

433
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,770
Have I gone crazy?

434
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:21,530
Where did these come from?

435
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,530
What is all this...

436
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:34,510
Chairman. How long have you been here?

437
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,770
You weren't here when I came in a little while ago.

438
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:40,480
What's wrong? Did something happen?

439
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,120
No, but you weren't at the study or your bedroom before.

440
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,190
I couldn't see the porridge you were eating either.

441
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:49,410
So I was going around the house looking for you and the dishes.

442
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:52,770
I felt a bit stuffy.

443
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:55,500
So I ate the porridge in the yard.

444
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,310
In the yard? In this cold weather?

445
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:02,670
It's not cold. It was nice and cool.

446
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,620
But when I came home with the flowers,

447
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,230
I didn't see you in the yard.

448
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:10,290
I ate it in the gazebo inside of the yard.

449
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,550
I see. I had no idea.

450
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:15,350
I went upstairs looking for you.

451
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,980
Is that right?

452
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:22,660
But the Yangjae flower market is quite far from here. How did you come home so quickly?

453
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,480
A beautiful flower shop opened just in front of us.

454
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,340
They have a lot of fresh flowers, so we won't need to go to the Yangjae flower market anymore.

455
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,910
Is that so? That's good.

456
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:36,420
I will talk to Chief Kim and make sure we don't run out of flowers.

457
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,630
Yes, thank you.

458
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,630
Was dating in secret this hard?

459
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,360
Ms. Park, don't worry.

460
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,160
I made it through without getting caught.

461
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,890
Chairman, let's not date secretly at home.

462
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:08,630
We should meet outside.

463
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:13,420
Worrying about getting caught is making me too nervous.

464
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,630
Okay. Let's do that.

465
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:20,100
It's too dangerous.

466
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:25,300
Ms. Park. Please get well soon.

467
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,360
So you can have pork cutlet with me.

468
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,810
Yes!

469
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:41,390
Ajussi, I really enjoyed the movie tonight.

470
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:44,560
Let's go to an early morning movie next time.

471
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,910
An early morning movie?

472
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:49,780
I've been working, so I couldn't do it before.

473
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,150
Is that so?

474
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,080
Sure, that's not hard.

475
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,700
Let's go any time.

476
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,100
No, let's go next week right away.

477
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:05,750
Okay. Let's meet early for the movie and go somewhere to eat.

478
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,320
Let's go for a drive, too.

479
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,100
Okay. Let's do that.

480
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,270
We are here already.

481
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:18,920
Please go inside.

482
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,510
Please go first.

483
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:25,210
I will see you off tonight.

484
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,170
Okay. Then, I'll go first.

485
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,680
Please go inside, now.

486
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:08,450
What is this? Sarah's phone was in my pocket.

487
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:13,310
Sarah.

488
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:17,630
What are you doing here? How dare you come here again?

489
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:22,970
Sarah, I heard your engagement got called off.

490
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:27,210
What business is it to you?

491
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:29,910
Who's that guy earlier?

492
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,310
Are you seeing someone like that after calling off the engagement?

493
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:36,830
You, who was in the media as the FT Group Chairman's fiancée?

494
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:40,580
How could you go all the way to the top and drop down to the bottom?

495
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,750
Your life is really a roller-coaster.

496
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:47,070
It's none of your business.

497
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:49,200
Let go.

498
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,670
Hey, Jo Sarah. What did you do with my son?

499
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:57,640
What?

500
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,990
What did you say?

501
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:02,600
You gave birth to my son at that hospital.

502
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,340
Hey, Jin Sang Goo.

503
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,420
What nonsense are you spewing?

504
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:11,540
What garbage talk is that?

505
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:20,960
My friend Byeong Sik's wife worked at the hospital you gave birth in.

506
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:27,640
She remembers everything about you had my son.

507
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,630
Why are you spewing garbage?

508
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:35,320
So tell me. Where is my son?

509
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,400
Where is my son?

510
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,520
Where is my son!

511
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:45,610
Tell me. Where is my son? Say it!

512
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,410
Where is my son?

513
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:50,930
Why are you not telling me? Tell me!

514
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:54,080
What are you doing, you bastard?

515
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,730
I warned you clearly.

516
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:06,630
I said, don't ever appear in front of Sarah again. Do you really want to die?

517
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,380
Hey, Jo Sarah!

518
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,250
I'm asking you. Where's my son?

519
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:14,990
Where is my son? Tell me!

520
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,270
I will be back shortly.

521
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:40,630
You'd better tell me the truth then.

522
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:46,190
Got it?

523
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,960
That's right.

524
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,150
He's someone whom

525
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:52,680
I used to date.

526
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:57,990
At some point in my life,

527
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:04,710
I was going to marry that terrible man.

528
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,600
Then...

529
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:16,290
Is that all true?

530
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:22,640
He was talking about...

531
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,280
A baby.

532
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,250
Yes.

533
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,090
That's true.

534
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,300
What about the baby, then?

535
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,150
Where is the baby now?

536
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:50,610
The baby is...

537
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,640
The baby is...

538
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,150
It's okay.

539
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:01,650
If it's too hard, you don't have to talk about it.

540
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:04,590
The baby is...

541
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:10,990
A long time ago,

542
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:14,760
I buried him in my heart.

543
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,520
He died.

544
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,140
Sarah.

545
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:25,950
Ajussi. This is the kind of woman I am.

546
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:29,290
Someone good like you should not be seeing me.

547
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:31,590
So...

548
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:34,180
It's not too late for you to leave me.

549
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,450
Please run away from me.

550
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,650
Chairman, tomorrow,

551
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:59,530
let's go to a gallery with children

552
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:02,710
and go on a date, too.

553
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,660
Will tomorrow be okay?

554
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,560
I think you should rest another day.

555
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:12,020
No, once I took the medication you got for me,

556
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:15,540
I got completely better.

557
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,960
Maybe because you are young,

558
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,640
you get over sickness very quickly.

559
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,950
If I am sick, I can't go on a date with you.

560
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:27,840
So I had to get well quickly.

561
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,520
I think kids will love it if we go to the gallery.

562
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,760
They've wanted to go badly.

563
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,910
Okay, let's go to the gallery and get some good food tomorrow.

564
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:42,210
And let's play the board game the kids love.

565
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:45,040
Yes, I like it.

566
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,690
Then, sleep well.

567
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:51,140
Wait, Chairman.

568
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,710
Tonight,

569
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:58,820
please dream of me.

570
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,910
Oh, well, Ms. Park.

571
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:06,760
It's not like we can control our dream.

572
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:12,270
Chairman, can't you just say, "Okay, please dream of me, too?"

573
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:16,310
Do you have to be so literal?

574
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:19,300
It's not easy training you.

575
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,980
What did you say?

576
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:24,160
"Training me?"

577
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,430
Am I a rabbit? Why would you train me?

578
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:30,250
I got it. You don't have to do it if you don't want to.

579
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:34,030
How can you embarrass me over just saying, "dream of me?"

580
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,650
It's fine.

581
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:39,400
I won't ever say "dream of me" to you as well.

582
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:46,640
Chairman. Please don't dream of anything, and just sleep tight.

583
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,140
Hello? Ms. Park. Ms. Park!

584
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:57,250
Is this something for her to get angry about this much?

585
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,700
Ah, honestly.

586
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:05,310
Why does she ask me for strange things? Like asking me to sing.

587
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,800
Okay, I'm older.

588
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,050
So I should understand and adjust.

589
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:27,550
Ms. Park. Please dream of me.

590
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:33,130
Let's meet in our dreams.

591
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:37,900
I can't do this. It sounds too cheesy.

592
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,240
- Mi Rim, how do I look?
- You look awesome.

593
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,310
It's not because you are my boyfriend. You really look great.

594
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:52,890
- Really?
- Yes.

595
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:55,230
Joon Oh. Don't be too nervous.

596
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:57,720
And be confident. Okay?

597
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,450
Okay. Even if I fail, I will do it confidently.

598
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:05,550
- Should we go?
- Wait a minute.

599
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:08,860
You have to take care of your skin on such an important day.

600
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:13,380
The role is director, so you have to take extra care of your skin.

601
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,030
Give it to me.

602
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:31,450
- I will do it for you, too.
- Me, too?

603
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:40,160
[Weekend Drama: My Secret-Side]
[Open Audition]

604
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:49,040
Joon Oh, what's wrong?

605
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,970
I blew it because I was too nervous.

606
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:54,790
I was shaking from the tip of my head to the bottom of my toes.

607
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:57,930
I couldn't emote on any of the dialogue.

608
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:59,910
Don't be too upset.

609
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,910
It's just a start.

610
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:03,690
It's like that at the beginning for everyone.

611
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:07,550
It happened to Yoo Jae Seok too.

612
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:09,510
- Really?
- Yes.

613
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:12,140
Who gets it right on day one?

614
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:18,340
If that's the case, what does that make the people who got after thousands of auditions?

615
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,620
That's right.

616
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:25,010
Mi Rim. You are right.

617
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:28,640
I will practice harder from now on.

618
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,870
I can do it!

619
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:33,810
That's right. There will be a lot more auditions.

620
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:36,140
Let's go eat something delicious and get strong.

621
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,530
I will buy it for you today.

622
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:39,930
- Do you want to go for spicy rice cakes?
- Spicy rice cakes?

623
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:43,430
- Let's go for a really spicy one.
- That sounds good.

624
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:46,860
Mi Rim. I'm so happy you are here.

625
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:51,680
When I am with you, I can find peace in my mind.

626
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,650
You are indeed my vitamin.

627
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,250
What are you saying!

628
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:00,640
Let's go.

629
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:05,750
To think I will have an in-law as compatible as you.

630
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:09,610
I feel so excited and honored.

631
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:14,520
Mrs. Wang, let's be good friends more than in-laws.

632
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,800
I would love that.

633
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,350
We can travel and go shopping together.

634
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:20,990
And golf too.

635
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:22,960
I'm looking forward to it.

636
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,110
At our age, it's not easy making a new good friend.

637
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,640
I know.

638
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,640
And besides that, I'm so happy that our children,

639
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,910
who are the first love to each other, got back together.

640
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:37,760
Isn't this something that's truly beautiful?

641
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:43,800
While we are at it, why don't we set a date for the pre-wedding family gathering?

642
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,960
Pre-wedding family gathering?

643
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:56,520
Mom. What do you mean by a pre-wedding family gathering already?

644
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,150
Seung Ho and I are not there yet.

645
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:00,810
We need more time.

646
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:03,890
What do you mean? You and Seung Ho have known each other for a very long time.

647
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:05,780
What more time do you need?

648
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:10,050
Mom. Yes, we dated very briefly before.

649
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:12,160
But we haven't seen each other since then.

650
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,650
So we need to get to know each other for some time.

651
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:17,340
- What's the rush?
- Seriously!

652
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:21,410
Se Ryun, you will be forty soon.

653
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:26,300
What if they change their mind while you take your time?

654
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:28,340
- Mom.
- Se Ryun.

655
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:31,350
If you're not going to get married ever, it's one thing,

656
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:33,020
but Seung Ho is the best if you are going to.

657
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:35,670
How many families are better than Seung Ho's?

658
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:39,620
It's more difficult and risky to be meeting someone new.

659
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:43,190
Also, Se Ryun, this is the time to get married.

660
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:45,620
When the guy's side is impatient and rushing,

661
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:48,500
just pretend you can't resist and do it.

662
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:55,020
Se Ryun. I would like you to get married and settle down.

663
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:57,090
That's your mom's wish.

664
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:01,450
I'm talking apart from the shares.

665
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:09,560
That's true. There aren't too many as trustworthy as Seung Ho.

666
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,300
Okay, then.

667
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:15,080
That's right. That's the right decision.

668
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:20,250
Then I'm going to your brother and talk everything about you two. Okay?

669
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:28,290
Oppa, you have met up with mom, right?

670
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:33,510
Yes. Is it true that you're going to do a pre-wedding family gathering?

671
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:35,110
Yes.

672
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:40,510
Oppa, I will get married to Seung Ho.

673
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:46,420
It hasn't been a long time since you two met again,

674
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:49,020
but why are you rushing it again?

675
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,970
I thought about it,

676
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:53,570
and Seung Ho is as rich as us.

677
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:59,590
So at least, Seung Ho's not marrying me for my money.

678
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:03,780
I think it's genuine and sincere this time.

679
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:10,860
- Se Ryun.
- I know what you're worried about.

680
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:13,620
But Oppa, don't worry about this time.

681
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:18,240
Seung Ho and I are old friends, and if I don't trust an old friend like him,

682
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,140
who should I trust?

683
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:30,540
Okay, I get it. I'm relieved that he is an old friend of yours.

684
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:33,020
[FT Group]

685
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:36,910
Yes.

686
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,680
What did you need to discuss with me?

687
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:48,210
Lawyer Koh, there is a man who Se Ryun is dating.

688
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:50,330
I heard it from Madam too.

689
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:55,400
I got a call earlier that Se Ryun will get married soon and prepare the transfer of shares.

690
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:00,630
On that note, can you look into the Jinsa Group's second son for me?

691
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:04,180
Is the guy that Se Ryun is dating Jinsa Group's second son?

692
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:10,420
Yes. I know he comes from a good family, but please investigate him.

693
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:14,980
My Se Ryun, if she makes a bad choice again,

694
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:17,930
she'll only get hurt.

695
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:20,720
I understand what you mean.

696
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,930
Yes.

697
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:25,220
Seoyeon Kindergarten?

698
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,770
Yes, I know where it is. Three chickens?

699
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:30,090
Yes, I'll bring them right over.

700
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:32,060
Yes, thank you.

701
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,900
Se Jong!

702
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:41,170
Ms. Park, we're going to the museum today, right?

703
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:45,430
Yes. Your brother, sister, and dad are waiting. Let's hurry up and go.

704
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:47,750
After going to the museum,

705
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:52,860
will we eat delicious pizza and play a board game too?

706
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:55,190
Wouldn't that be the case?

707
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:57,570
Wow, I'm excited!

708
00:48:57,570 --> 00:49:00,280
- Let's go!
- Yes!

709
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,800
Right.

710
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:16,760
I'm glad that Dan Dan looks happy.

711
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,580
She should be doing well.

712
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:24,350
Se Jong, are you going to be okay like this?

713
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:30,390
Don't ever think of this bad mother ever again...

714
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:32,850
Yes, Dan Dan,

715
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:36,080
please always be happy.

716
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:43,670
What are you doing here?

717
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:49,750
Soo Chul.

718
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:52,580
That's not it...

719
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:54,440
I'm not here to meet Dan Dan.

720
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,730
I was just passing by, I mean it.

721
00:49:56,730 --> 00:50:00,120
Dan Dan comes here every day. Don't even try to lie like that.

722
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:04,260
You said you would quietly leave that you would disappear like the wind.

723
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:09,350
But why are you here? Why can't you keep your promise?

724
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:12,150
I don't know...

725
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:15,720
I don't know how I got all the way here.

726
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,720
But, Soo Chul.

727
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:22,650
I really only watched her in secret.

728
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:26,930
When I go back to America, I'll never see her again.

729
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:31,390
It might be the last time. Can't I just watch her in secret?

730
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:34,770
You can't! You absolutely can't do it.

731
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:38,050
- You don't even have the right to look at her in secret.
- Soo Chul...

732
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:40,720
When you abandoned Dan Dan and me and left away,

733
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,430
didn't that mean you wouldn't see us forever?

734
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:46,730
So why are you doing this now? Why should this all be your way?

735
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:50,230
Don't ever think about seeing my Dan Dan again.

736
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:53,880
I don't even like you stealing glances at my daughter.

737
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,550
It makes me feel creeped out.

738
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:01,170
Okay...

739
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:06,550
Okay, I understand.

740
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:12,780
I won't even see her in secret anymore.

741
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:17,130
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

742
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:19,930
I did wrong.

743
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:56,160
For what did I live struggling so much?

744
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,040
This is all there was.

745
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:08,130
For what did I cause such pain and suffering?

746
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:11,160
Am I getting punished for that?

747
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,590
I'm so sorry.

748
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:18,110
I'm so sorry...

749
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:23,240
CEO Anna, why do you keep saying that?

750
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,340
Thank you

751
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:29,130
for everything until now.

752
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:51,960
Are you Park Dae Beom?

753
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,510
- Yes.
- I'm Oh Seung Ho.

754
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:58,880
Okay, what brings you here?

755
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,540
Take this.

756
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:03,920
What is this?

757
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,610
Instead of Se Ryun, I'm offering this consolation money.

758
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:10,190
Excuse me? Consolation money?

759
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:13,280
Se Ryun and I will be getting married soon.

760
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,320
There's nothing good for people to know that Se Ryun dated you before.

761
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,080
Let's say you never met Se Ryun in your life.

762
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,480
Why don't you take this?

763
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,810
I think you should've not come.

764
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:26,070
Also, you don' have to worry about things like that.

765
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,480
You have to take this so that I won't worry.

766
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,200
So please take it.

767
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,120
I don't need it.

768
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,990
Just take it.

769
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:39,310
And if it's not enough, let me know. I can give you any amount.

770
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:42,920
What the heck are you doing?

771
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:49,370
Don't ever come looking for me again, alright?

772
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:53,250
It's ridiculous.

773
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:56,580
You have quite some pride for someone with nothing.

774
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:00,180
Seriously, you bastard!

775
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,890
How dare you grab my collar?

776
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:05,000
You better let go!

777
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,760
Did I ask you for money?

778
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:10,040
- Why are you here showing off your money!
- What? Showing off money?

779
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,330
- This bastard.
- Wait! What's going on?

780
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:13,860
Why are you both acting like this?

781
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:16,160
Why are you over here fighting?

782
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,440
- Mr. Park!
- Dae Beom!

783
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,060
Hey, mister, stop it.

784
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:21,230
Hey, Park Dae Beom. Get your hands off of him.

785
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:23,170
Dae Beom, stop it.

786
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:26,200
If you ever come over here again like this,

787
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:30,190
I won't let you off easy, understand?

788
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,520
This is ridiculous...

789
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,940
What the...

790
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:48,550
- There are a lot of checks in here.
- Grandmother, please give that to me.

791
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:52,510
Hey, you! Take this back!

792
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:56,520
Dae Beom, it's that guy, right? Se Ryun's guy, right?

793
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:01,300
But why did he throw money and leave?

794
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:07,960
Oh my, it's Jinsa Group's second son.

795
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:11,110
How could this happen?

796
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,550
Dae Beom, what brings you here?

797
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:32,170
What's this?

798
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:35,880
The guy you're going to marry came looking for me.

799
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:42,020
What? Seung Ho?

800
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:44,650
Yes.

801
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:48,110
I guess he was worried that we dated might be an issue.

802
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:54,120
Tell him there's nothing to worry about and to never look for me again.

803
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:03,620
Dae Beom, I'm sorry.

804
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:05,750
I told you before.

805
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:09,150
I think of you as a great memory.

806
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:16,370
Se Ryun, I sincerely want you to be happy.

807
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:19,260
You're getting married...

808
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:23,680
Congratulations. Be happy.

809
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,200
What's this?

810
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,110
Why did you give this to Dae Beom?

811
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:47,880
That's fast. Did that jerk already come to see you?

812
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,960
What do you mean by "that jerk?"

813
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,400
How can you call him like that?

814
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,660
You said you ended things with him.

815
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:57,500
Seung Ho, Dae Beom is a good person.

816
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,560
He's not someone that would cause problems.

817
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:02,180
And the reason why I agreed to date you

818
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:05,310
was because I had already ended things with him.

819
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:09,040
If that bothers you,

820
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,520
then you should think twice about seeing each other.

821
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:15,110
No, I made a mistake.

822
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:16,950
And I'm sorry for talking about him like that.

823
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:19,540
I was just worried that he might make things hard for you.

824
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:22,710
But since you say he's not that type of person, then it's fine.

825
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:27,870
Also, I apologize for acting rashly without even knowing him.

826
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:31,270
If you want, I can go meet him to apologize.

827
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:33,550
No, there's no need for that.

828
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,980
I took care of it.

829
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,920
Don't ever do that again.

830
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,160
Yes, I won't. I'm sorry.

831
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:48,920
This late at night,

832
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,520
the thing you needed to talk at length about was this?

833
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,370
Yes.

834
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:57,240
It's serious to me.

835
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:03,260
She asks me to sing to her and makes me say, "Dream of me tonight."

836
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:06,280
Do I have to say these things?

837
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,730
Yes.

838
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:11,170
Just close your eyes and do it.

839
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:13,320
Jung Woo,

840
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,960
can you go to the karaoke with me? I need to practice my singing.

841
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,650
What?

842
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:26,130
Like old times, let's sing "You in My Blurred Memories."

843
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:40,110
How can you remember all that?

844
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:46,720
Is this right?

845
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:48,990
♫  Cloudy cigarette smoke  ♫

846
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:54,950
♫  People in flashy clothes, but in the mirror  ♫

847
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:59,120
♫  I see my humble self in my changed life  ♫

848
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:04,640
♫  You, my only you, get forgotten  ♫

849
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,920
♫  My disorganized heart, in a chaotic space  ♫

850
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:13,030
♫  My heart full of grief  ♫

851
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:17,920
♫  Now, now, I want to forget  ♫

852
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,840
Oh, my back!

853
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:56,640
Oh, that's so pretty.

854
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,590
Cho Rong, should I buy that for you?

855
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:01,480
Yes, Grandma. That's really pretty.

856
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,740
What?

857
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:06,280
Who's that little girl calling her "Grandma?"

858
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:08,360
Can you please find this in her size?

859
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,130
Yes, I'll look for it.

860
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:17,100
I heard their eldest son's kids were all in Middle School and High School.

861
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:26,770
How did you find out? It's something everyone keeps in secret.

862
01:00:26,770 --> 01:00:28,680
Are you serious?

863
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:32,410
So that little girl is Jinsa Group's second son's daughter?

864
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:34,250
According to rumors,

865
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:39,360
their second son made an incident, and the woman left him with the child.

866
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:42,390
It was a woman that family could not give their blessing to.

867
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:45,690
And there were rumors that she was a "working girl."

868
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:47,860
Oh my, do you mean

869
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:49,820
a booze house?

870
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:52,600
Yes, Mrs. Jang. I'm glad you called.

871
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,670
Why were you acting like that to me?

872
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:58,380
If you're upset about something, you should just tell me. You rejected my present and left.

873
01:00:58,380 --> 01:00:59,970
What's wrong with you?

874
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:03,420
Mrs. Wang, that's not the issue right now.

875
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:05,770
What's the issue, then?

876
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:10,050
Se Ryun dating Jinsa Group's son, you should put that on hold.

877
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:14,180
Out of nowhere, what're you talking about? We're already talking about gathering for the wedding.

878
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:17,330
I think Seung Ho has a child.

879
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:21,350
What did you say?

880
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:24,110
A child?

881
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:27,860
It seems Seung Ho has a daughter in pre-school.

882
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:30,820
That being said, put everything on hold

883
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:33,250
and investigate him first.

884
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:37,690
What on earth is this about?

885
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:46,450
I thought we would see at the family gathering for the wedding.

886
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:50,940
But why did you want to see me again?

887
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:55,190
It's because I heard such an outlandish rumor.

888
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:56,330
Rumor?

889
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:59,610
I know it's a rude question,

890
01:01:59,610 --> 01:02:03,170
but I heard that Seung Ho has a pre-school-aged daughter.

891
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:05,070
I don't know where it's coming from.

892
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:09,300
The rumors must not be true. They're not, right?

893
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,140
I thought it was something else.

894
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:13,850
How did you find out?

895
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:19,890
Are you saying the rumors are true?

896
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:22,000
Yes. It's true.

897
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,860
But why?

898
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:29,160
Mrs. Moon, how could you lie about something like that?

899
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,570
I mean, he has a child.

900
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:35,850
How can you ask us to let Se Ryun marry him?

901
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:37,770
Mrs. Wang,

902
01:02:37,770 --> 01:02:40,110
how is this a lie?

903
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:41,920
I just didn't tell you.

904
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,320
What did you say?

905
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,350
I wanted to tell you when the time was right.

906
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:48,160
Cho Rong is Seung Ho's daughter,

907
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,810
but she's legally under my husband and me.

908
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:55,180
So, even if Se Ryun and Seung Ho get married,

909
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:57,230
there won't be any issues.

910
01:02:57,230 --> 01:03:00,890
Also, I will keep raising Cho Rong,

911
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:02,900
so you don't have to worry.

912
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:08,240
What kind of idiotic saying is this, Mrs. Moon?

913
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:11,770
Just because she's not registered under Seung Ho's name doesn't mean she's not his daughter.

914
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:16,030
- I mean, how can you do this to us?
- Calm down and listen to me.

915
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:21,440
Frankly, we all knew Se Ryun and Seung Ho had flaws from the beginning.

916
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,460
We didn't bother by that Se Ryun has a boyfriend.

917
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:29,060
I thought your family would understand about this. Am I wrong?

918
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:30,660
What did you say?

919
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:32,730
I can't believe this.

920
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:38,300
Since we're being frank, do you think Se Ryun could marry anyone as good as Seung Ho?

921
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:41,340
The daughter of a mistress who ran away at her wedding,

922
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:43,730
and she was strung along by some strange gigolo.

923
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:47,640
Everyone in the know already knows.

924
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:51,930
If Seung Ho didn't say he liked Se Ryun, I never would have approved of them.

925
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:55,240
Also, Seung Ho declined all other better potential brides

926
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,480
and kept insisting on Se Ryun, so we gave our blessings.

927
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,700
Whose blemish is bigger?

928
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:03,490
If you don't like it, we can call everything off right now.

929
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:05,640
Do as you wish.

930
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:09,460
Then, I'll get going first.

931
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:35,740
What happened? Did you find out?

932
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:41,420
What I said was correct, right? He has a pre-school-aged daughter.

933
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:46,760
Mrs. Jang, keep it in secret.

934
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:51,240
Excuse me?

935
01:04:57,670 --> 01:05:01,370
♫ Why do you run away, love ♫

936
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:05,420
♫ Like a shy child ♫

♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

941

♫ I have to abandon the longing and the grieves ♫

942
01:05:35,270 --> 01:05:38,600
[Young Lady and Gentleman]

943
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,400
Sarah, I know you told me to run away, but I won't.

944
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,710
I don't want to feel bad every time I see you.

945
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:47,680
Don't call me anymore. Find a woman better than me.

946
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,520
Our scarves are the same.

947
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,610
Mi Rim is wearing the same scarf as me.

948
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:53,310
Look, isn't that strange?

949
01:05:53,310 --> 01:05:54,660
Yes, it is.

950
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:56,170
Before, when we asked you to go somewhere,

951
01:05:56,170 --> 01:05:58,180
you'd always say that you were busy, so we never went.

952
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:00,000
There's no other reason, right?

953
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,590
Why are you so surprised? We're allowed to hold hands now.

954
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:03,790
Who said anything?

955
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:05,990
Mom, I gave up all my shares.

956
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:08,140
You! Are you crazy!

957
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:10,310
Turn it back! Right now!!

958
01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:12,870
Mom, it's over for us.

959
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:16,770
So stop foolishly holding onto that!

960
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:19,280
Let's just die.
