[Episode 12]

2
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,700
The more I think about it, it's amazing.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,760
How could that little girl be Ms. Park?

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,730
I'm also amazed.

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,990
That military ajussi is the Chairman.

6
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:31,580
That military ajussi was someone I had wanted to see again.

7
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,230
How did I not recognize him?

8
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,450
That day, did you go straight home?

9
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,820
Yes, I went straight home, Ajussi.

10
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:47,680
I mean, Chairman, you drove me around the neighborhood on your bike,

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,570
so I felt much better.

12
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,090
That's good.

13
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:58,110
Honestly, I was still worried when I took you to your home that day.

14
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:03,720
I thought, "What if that little girl didn't go home and cause trouble?"

15
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,050
You left without even looking back.

16
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,800
And when I asked what your name was, you didn't even answer.

17
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,860
Did I do that?

18
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:17,340
But, why did you run away from home that day?

19
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,630
That's...

20
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:25,830
In fact, I fought with my brother over ice cream on that day.

21
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,310
So, you ran away because of some ice cream?

22
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,500
Back then, that seemed like a big deal to me.

23
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,430
My brother ate my ice cream,

24
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,240
but my mom only took his side.

25
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,440
That made me so upset and sad.

26
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,750
That could happen when you were young.

27
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,520
Those times feel like yesterday, but so much time has passed.

28
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,800
Now that troublemaker has grown into a pretty young lady like this,

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,360
and I became an old man.

30
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,070
You don't seem old at all.

31
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,140
You're not old.

32
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,340
You're like a great...

33
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,580
gentleman.

34
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:26,110
Because I bought you a meal today, your lip service is great.

35
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,940
It's not lip service...

36
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,790
I mean it.

37
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,030
Thank you for even saying it, Ms. Park.

38
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,050
That really made me feel happy.

39
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,890
Where are they going?

40
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,880
Are they going to a hotel?

41
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,780
How dare are you cutting in?

42
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,780
Are you trying to die?

43
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,990
[Emergency Center]

44
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,710
Jo Sarah!

45
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,060
Mom.

46
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,580
Sarah!

47
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,680
Sarah, what happened?

48
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,070
What's wrong with your neck?

49
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,070
Mom, don't worry, I didn't break anything.

50
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,440
They said it's because my muscles got startled. I'm fine, Mom.

51
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,580
So help me sit up.

52
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,510
Is the rest of your body really okay?

53
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,830
Let me see.

54
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,400
I've been checked. I just need to take some medicine, and I'll be fine.

55
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,740
Thank goodness.

56
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,540
Did you drink and drive?

57
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,760
What are you doing? I didn't drink.

58
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,540
You didn't even drink, but you violated the traffic signal and almost got into a big accident!

59
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,780
What were you thinking while you were driving?

60
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,900
Mom, that's not the issue right now.

61
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,560
Mom, look at this picture.

62
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,900
What is it?

63
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:15,070
What are they doing?

64
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,360
They're facing each other...

65
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,870
What is Chairman Lee doing with this young girl on the streets?

66
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,470
You were right.

67
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:26,130
Ms. Park was seducing the Chairman behind our back.

68
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:31,280
They had dinner together tonight and got in a car and went somewhere.

69
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,030
Then did you get into an accident while chasing their car?

70
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,030
What if they went to a hotel?

71
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,740
I have to go find out if they went to a hotel or went home.

72
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,900
Calm down!

73
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,950
You can just call to figure that out.

74
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:48,760
- Where are you trying to go like this?
- What?

75
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,920
We have Dae Ran.

76
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,310
Who's on our side.

77
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,940
Why is she calling me at this hour?

78
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,940
Yes, it's me.

79
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,320
Dae Ran, is Chairman Lee at home?

80
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,090
Of course, he came home way before.

81
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,460
Is he home?

82
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,890
But when did he get back?

83
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,940
Around what time?

84
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,770
It's been about an hour or so.

85
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,250
But why?

86
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,530
It's nothing, I'll tell you later.

87
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,870
Goodnight.

88
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,420
Hey, hey.

89
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:43,000
What is wrong with her? She startled me in my sleep!

90
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:57,200
That daring young girl became an adult, and she's now the teacher taking care of my kids.

91
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,040
It's unbelievable.

92
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,660
How is it possible to meet again like this?

93
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:12,980
Maybe the Chairman and I are destined to be together?

94
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:19,100
Park Dan Dan, get a hold of yourself.

95
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,080
How dare you have feelings for the Chairman?

96
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,040
Also, Chairman and I have a huge age difference.

97
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,940
I can't be like this. I can't!

98
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,640
Have a nice day at work, Dad.

99
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,140
Lee Jenny, Lee Se Chan. Should I take you to school today?

100
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,890
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah!

101
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,100
Dad, me too!

102
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,190
Okay. Today I'll drive Se Jong as well.

103
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,960
I will take Se Jong to kindergarten today, so have some rest, Ms. Park.

104
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,730
Okay, Chairman.

105
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:08,720
Have a good day.

106
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,440
You too, Ms. Park.

107
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,260
Have a nice day.

108
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,790
This little vixen.

109
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,750
Now she's openly flirting with him.

110
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,190
What should I do with her?

111
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:35,720
I can't just kick her out for no reason.

112
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,840
Hey, you little vixen!

113
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,870
Don't you dare to smile at Chairman again flirtatiously!

114
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,800
You better know your place.

115
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,910
Ajumeoni, this is so good.

116
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,360
Really? They say radish is good for you.

117
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,560
- Eat as much as you want. I'll make more.
- Thank you!

118
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,170
- Please, you should eat as well.
- You're eating well!

119
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,540
Ms. Park, what's with your hair?

120
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,880
Excuse me?

121
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,720
It really makes me lose my appetite. Your hair is always dangling so long.

122
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,050
Your hair goes into the soup and then the rice.

123
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,620
Is this a club?

124
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,910
For you to whip your hair around like that?

125
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,960
It's so disgusting. I can't eat with you.

126
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:08,770
That crazy woman, there she goes again.

127
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,180
Mrs. Yeoju.

128
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,870
Is my hair that weird?

129
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,990
It's not weird at all! It's very pretty.

130
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,710
Ignore that crazy woman.

131
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,150
She does that every now and then.

132
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,960
That nutcase.

133
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,460
Her friend probably got married to a rich family or something.

134
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,350
I have to do something to get her out of this house.

135
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,720
But with the Chairman having her back like that...

136
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,590
How can I get her out?

137
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:53,870
But when in the world is Madam coming home?

138
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,210
Mom, if this works out well, that family will pay back all of our hospital debt for us, right?

139
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,820
That's right.

140
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:09,070
I also looked into it that if you marry that family's daughter, she is definitely getting 5% of their company's share.

141
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,780
With a share that much, we can buy over ten of our hospitals.

142
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,280
Wow... It's really the jackpot.

143
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:20,640
So think of your father and our hospital, and do whatever you can, all right?

144
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,830
Our family's fate is resting on you.

145
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,060
But still, I have to see her first.

146
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,370
She's just your style! She's very pretty.

147
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:33,030
Oh, that's right. You completely ended things with that girl from last time, did you?

148
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,270
How many times do I have to tell you? I ended the relationship.

149
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,970
That's good. Let's go.

150
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:57,080
What is that, Mrs. Wang?

151
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,710
Oh, don't you know about this, Mrs. Jang?

152
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,920
As we get older,

153
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,620
we need to take great care of wrinkles.

154
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,830
That's why your skin is flawless!

155
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,340
Where are you? Will you be here soon?

156
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,280
Mrs. Wang. The wife of the director of the hospital and her son are coming.

157
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,070
Hurry up.

158
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,700
Hello, Madam.

159
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:31,820
Oh my, your son looks even more handsome than since when I last saw him.

160
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,900
This is Mrs. Jung from Sarang Hospital.

161
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,690
And this is Mrs.Wang from FT Group.

162
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,420
Hello, I heard a lot about you.

163
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:45,450
Hello, I've also heard a lot about you.

164
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,610
But, your daughter...

165
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,830
Yes, she will be here soon.

166
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,940
She's almost arrived. There must be a lot of traffic.

167
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,570
Here she comes.

168
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,520
This is my daughter.

169
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,820
What should I do? I have previous plans.

170
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,920
Don't worry about it! Please feel free to leave first.

171
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,940
Why don't we go golfing some time together?

172
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,060
Yes, let's do that.

173
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,020
Then I will get going first.

174
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,210
Go back safely, Madam.

175
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,640
Goodbye.

176
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,020
I have a very good feeling about today.

177
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,620
I think it will go well with those two.

178
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,090
Do you think so?

179
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:58,010
Yes! The way he looked at your daughter was sweet as honey!

180
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,320
I think he fell for your daughter at first sight.

181
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,700
And those two look so well together.

182
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,360
It seemed like they were destined to meet each other.

- Oh, that hurts.
- What kind of punk is that?

191
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,190
Why does he drive like that?

192
00:14:55,190 --> 00:15:00,850
His driving is a complete mess! That kind of bastard is a killer on the roads.

193
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,590
It hurts a lot!

194
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:08,730
Right, you shouldn't let that kind of bastard off easily.

195
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,100
Excuse me, get out of the car for a second.

196
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,940
I said, get out!

197
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,690
I mean, who drives like that... Hey, move over.

198
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,020
Hey, Ajussi. You better drive--

199
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,100
Why does she pop out here?

200
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,040
Excuse me for a minute, Se Ryun.

201
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm sorry.

202
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,810
You almost caused an accident.

203
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,610
It looks like that's my fault.

204
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,820
I will reimburse you.

205
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,380
How much should it be?

206
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,760
That's fine. You can just go.

207
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:03,510
Uncle, what do you mean, he can just leave? Our chicken skewers are all spoiled.

208
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,870
This should be enough.

209
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:11,330
₩500,000 is enough, right? Including the price for startling you.

210
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,390
It's fine, just leave.

211
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,630
Yes.

212
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,380
This should be enough, thank you.

213
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,300
Hey...

214
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,970
I guess that lady really went on a blind date for an arranged marriage.

215
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,200
That's a bit fast.

216
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,620
But why did she meet a guy with horrible driving habits out of all people?

217
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,200
There aren't any good guys who are bad drivers.

218
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,460
Gosh, I'm not even her brother, but I'm worried.

219
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,630
People with no money should at least have a conscience if they don't have any pride.

220
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,480
Did you see it just now?

221
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,620
He quickly snatched the ₩500,000 just because they dropped a few of the chicken skewers.

222
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,590
They have no conscience, I tell you. No conscience.

223
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,850
They'll think that they won a lottery today

224
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,970
and won't even work and go drink a ton.

225
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,580
I can just imagine it.

226
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,560
I'll think that I made a donation.

227
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:39,270
Anyway, since I saw the chicken skewers, it reminded me of spicy stir-fried chicken.

228
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,690
Ms. Se Ryun, shall we go eat spicy stir-fried chicken?

229
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,140
If we go to Chuncheon, there's a very famous spicy stir-fried chicken place.

230
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:50,020
What do you say we take a drive and eat spicy stir-fried chicken over there?

231
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,100
Sure...

232
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,500
Ms. Se Ryun, you must have been really startled just now. Your face doesn't look okay.

233
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,680
No, I'm fine.

234
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,000
Are you sure you're okay?

235
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,750
Then, I'll go to Chuncheon!

236
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:18,670
Oh, yes. If the in-laws are owners of Sarang hospital, it may not be the best,

237
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:21,770
but it's not bad at all.

238
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,860
Oh, will my Se Ryun

239
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,440
now score a marriage?

240
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:31,400
Oh! Am I going to sleep comfortably now?

241
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,400
Yes?

242
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,130
Oh, my!

243
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:40,180
My Chief Jo! What brings you here?

244
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,980
Well...

245
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,160
I have something to say to you.

246
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,900
What's wrong with your face? Did something happen?

247
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:53,890
Madam. Take a look at this.

248
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:58,150
I'm very upset.

249
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,650
What are Chairman Lee and Ms. Park doing?

250
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,620
Did Young Gook and Ms. Park have been seeing each other outside of the house? What are all these pictures?

251
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,660
Madam... It's not just this.

252
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,410
Last time, when we went to the vacation house,

253
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,740
Ms. Park went out late at night on purpose

254
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,140
and made a fuss about hurting her ankles.

255
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,690
So she had the Chairman carry her...

256
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:28,350
Did Chairman Lee carry her on his back? Chairman Lee did that?

257
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,780
Yes...

258
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:35,130
She even secretly gifted him a handkerchief where she stitched his initials and flowers onto it.

259
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:40,040
All this time, Ms. Park was seducing the Chairman behind our backs.

260
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,790
Oh, my! How could she be so sly?!

261
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:47,330
But why haven't you said anything about this to me until now?

262
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:51,360
I also had a hard time believing it.

263
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,090
I thought it was ridiculous...

264
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:58,570
Also, you were upset about Ms. Se Ryun.

265
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:01,510
I can't add to that.

266
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:07,710
Seriously, you're just too nice.

267
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,850
The way that the Chairman looks at Ms. Park is strange.

268
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,970
I think that the Chairman...

269
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:17,330
may be falling for Ms. Park...

270
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,960
What do I do?

271
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,330
What do you mean by that? We have to nip it in the bud immediately! We have to kick her out now!

272
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,910
Pardon?

273
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,640
Chief Jo. What did I tell you?

274
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,040
In my heart, you're already my daughter-in-law, Chief Jo!

275
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,860
But, do you think I'll do nothing after seeing something like this?

276
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,180
Don't even worry about it. I'll take care of everything.

277
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,560
Getting rid of a little girl like her is not even a problem.

278
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,480
Why are you even worried about a nobody like her?

279
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,370
Madam...

280
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,860
Mother-in-law...

281
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:18,120
Why is grandma going into Ms. Park's room?

282
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,530
Ms. Park's not even home.

283
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:53,120
Joon Oh, are you leaving already?

284
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,400
Do you want me to drive to the Seoul Train Station?

285
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,690
Am I a child? I'm going to go with my friend.

286
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:02,640
My son, when am I going to see you again?

287
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,130
At least call me often, okay?

288
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:09,420
Mom, I will come home every weekend from now on.

289
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:13,060
What? Am I going to see you every weekend?

290
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,660
- Really?
- Yes.

291
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,430
Doctor, I'll see you later.

292
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,220
I'm not a doctor yet.

293
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,570
Have a nice day.

294
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:27,210
Hurry on. You have a train to catch.

295
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,570
Hey, what's going on?

296
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:40,920
Do you need more allowance?

297
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,410
Mom, you trust me, right?

298
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:48,090
Of course, I do.

299
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:52,100
If I don't trust my son, who can I trust?

300
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,810
I will get going.

301
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,270
These are all almost new.

302
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,840
Thank you for giving it to me.

303
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,810
Are you not going to tell your mom that you took the semester off?

304
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,990
I should tell her.

305
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,380
But I'm going to tell her later when I get my license.

306
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:24,080
Are you going to get a license? I thought you were doing it for fun.

307
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,020
Are you really going to be a hair designer or whatever?

308
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:32,590
Don't tell me you're going to give up the medical school you worked so hard to get in.

309
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,440
I don't know.

310
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:43,510
No more difficult question like that, please.

311
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:47,040
We only live once.

312
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:51,600
I want to find something that I want to do, have fun doing it,

313
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,810
something that suits me.

314
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,880
I'm going to find that out.

315
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,820
That's the life's road map I've decided for myself.

316
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,170
Okay, Bong Joon Oh. Good luck with that.

317
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:12,390
And I hope you survive from your mom whenever you tell her.

318
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:15,170
I got it.

319
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,930
If I do become a hair designer,

320
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:21,230
I will take charge of your hair.

321
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,740
Okay.

322
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,140
What's up with that guy?

323
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:42,630
Did he register here because of me?

324
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:45,530
Something is off.

325
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,450
Chief Jo! Mrs. Yeoju, Chief Jo!

326
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:02,270
- Yes, Madam.
- What's wrong, Madam?

327
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,490
My necklace is gone.

328
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,900
The necklace that I bought not long ago.

329
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,060
Do you mean the diamond necklace?

330
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:13,050
Yes, that diamond necklace.

331
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,770
Madam, I am sure we can find it somewhere.

332
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:18,460
Please think carefully, where you left it.

333
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:22,610
What is there to think? I left it on top of my dresser this morning.

334
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,610
But it's gone.

335
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,490
I didn't see it when I was cleaning earlier.

336
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,840
I will look for it again.

337
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,340
It's not there. I'm telling you!

338
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,430
I looked at every nook and cranny!

339
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:36,210
It's not like the necklace has legs or wings.

340
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:39,530
Unless someone took it, how would it disappear?

341
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:43,920
Oh, my goodness. Are you saying someone stole it?

342
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,730
No, Madam. Why would anyone do that?

343
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:50,020
Something like this has never happened in our house before.

344
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,740
There is only one who came into our house recently.

345
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,070
Mrs. Yeoju, you weren't here because you went to the market.

346
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:59,060
I saw Ms. Park coming and going.

347
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:04,240
It cannot be Ms. Park!

348
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,620
Ah, seriously!

349
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,650
What is going on?

350
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,350
Why is she acting like that?

351
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:23,160
Madam, I don't think this is right.

352
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,280
Ms. Park is not someone who would do something like that.

353
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,010
Then where would my necklace that was sitting on my dresser go?

354
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:32,120
There is only one who's new to our house.

355
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,250
Help me find it, Mrs. Yeoju!

356
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,250
But still, I don't think this is the right way.

357
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,190
I don't think Ms. Park will stand for something like this.

358
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:43,640
Aigoo, what would she do if she didn't stand for it?

359
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,080
Oh, my goodness. It's here, Madam.

360
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,780
This necklace is your diamond necklace, right?

361
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,540
Yes, that's the one!

362
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,170
This is the necklace that I lost.

363
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:58,930
Yes. I knew it, I knew it!

364
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:02,590
It sure looks like we raised a thieving wench.

365
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:07,410
I didn't want to think it, but how could she do this?

366
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:11,140
My goodness, this doesn't make any sense.

367
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:17,910
Madam, Chief Jo, what are you all doing here?

368
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,170
Ms. Park.

369
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:24,340
Why is this necklace in your room?

370
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,120
What is it?

371
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,030
How can you play ignorant when we just found it in your drawer?

372
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,660
We didn't bring in a live-in tutor,

373
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:37,020
but a thieving wench!

374
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,710
Madam.

375
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:41,430
What are you saying?

376
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:46,270
Why is Madam's lost diamond necklace in your drawer?

377
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:49,430
Please explain how this happened.

378
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,080
That was in my drawer?

379
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,620
Yes, it was.

380
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,040
Both Madam and I saw it.

381
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,740
And Mrs. Yeoju too, right?

382
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:04,850
Ms. Park, what's going on?

383
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:09,250
That can't be. I've never seen the necklace before.

384
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,790
Madam, it's not me. Please believe me.

385
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:15,880
What do you mean it's not you when there is proof?

386
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,200
Chief, Jo, I can't leave our children to a thieving wench like her. Please dismiss her immediately!

387
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,180
Kick her out now!

388
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,330
What is going on right now?

389
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,180
What did Ms. Park do?

390
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,190
Chairman Lee! Young Gook.

391
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:33,470
Ms. Park stole my necklace.

392
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:37,760
Ms. Park is a thief. You must kick her out immediately!

393
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,780
I really didn't do it.

394
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:45,620
How can you say it so thoughtlessly? She's saying she didn't do it.

395
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,540
Listen, CEO Anna.

396
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:51,370
The necklace I lost was in Ms. Park's drawer.

397
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:56,710
Without knowing the details, why are you jumping in like that?

398
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,480
Even so, you can't accuse someone only on that basis.

399
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,990
Ms. Park is not someone who would do something like that.

400
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:07,230
Okay then, did my necklace walk here on its own two feet?

401
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:10,190
Anyway, you have to kick her out of the house immediately, Chairman Lee!

402
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:15,360
No matter what, stealing cannot be tolerated, don't you agree?

403
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,270
I put that necklace there.

404
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:24,350
Se Chan, did you put it there?

405
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,770
Yes. I saw it on the kitchen floor,

406
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,350
and I thought it belonged to Ms. Park.

407
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:33,420
Se Chan! Oh, Se Chan.

408
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,260
That's not possible.

409
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:38,520
That can't be true.

410
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,720
Se Chan, you really put it there, right?

411
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,340
Yes, that's true!

412
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:46,790
But Se Chan, it isn't you.

413
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,540
It isn't you.

414
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:53,510
If not me, did you do it, Grandma?

415
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,570
Oh dear, how can you say that?

416
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:00,410
Aigoo. Aigoo.

417
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:03,850
I'm telling you the truth. I did it.

418
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,760
Ms. Park. Ms. Park!

419
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,880
Ms. Park!

420
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,060
Se Chan, you stay here. I will go see her.

421
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,520
What kind of craziness is this?

422
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,780
How can you brutally accuse someone innocent?

423
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:39,310
Se Chan, can we talk?

424
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:42,070
About what?

425
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:46,950
Se Chan, lying is wrong.

426
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:49,630
Lying begets new lies.

427
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:55,220
And those lies could create something you can't manage later.

428
00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:00,650
Chief Jo, why are you talking to me like this all of a sudden?

429
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:04,440
Did you really pick up that necklace?

430
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,420
Did you really put it in Ms. Park's drawer?

431
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,500
- Yes.
- Se Chan!

432
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,310
Lying is wrong, I said.

433
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,990
Why do you keep saying I am lying?

434
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:19,910
Are you saying you know who put the necklace

435
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:23,050
in Ms. Park's drawer, Chief Jo?

436
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,440
- What?
- I have to do my homework.

437
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,970
Please get out!

438
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,390
I know you're lying!

439
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:38,830
You didn't put it in the drawer!

440
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,600
Seriously.

441
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:55,260
Okay. Do your homework.

442
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:10,820
What did Se Chan say? Why did he lie?

443
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,870
He said he didn't lie.

444
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:17,250
He kept on insisting that he did it.

445
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:21,520
But I'm the one who put it in the drawer, so why is he saying it was him?

446
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:26,500
Se Chan is doing that to protect Ms. Park, isn't he?

447
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,290
I think so.

448
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:32,870
What drugs did Ms. Park feed them for the children to love her that much?

449
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:38,750
You saw it yourself, Madam. Ms. Park is not ordinary. We've all been fooled!

450
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,830
Right, she's not an ordinary vixen.

451
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:45,720
She has at least nine tails.

452
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,540
We have to get her out here quick, or there will be big trouble.

453
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:06,190
Ms. Park!

454
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:14,010
Young Gook, haven't you found her yet?

455
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:18,760
No, she didn't take her phone, so I can't even call her.

456
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,520
I'll go this way. Let's call each other when one of us finds her.

457
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,950
Okay.

458
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,120
Yes, Noona. I found Ms. Park.

459
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,380
I will bring her home. So please go in first.

460
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:14,050
Okay. Please talk to her nicely and bring her home.

461
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,660
Oh, my head.

462
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,370
Here's some ice water, Madam.

463
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:29,910
I think the shock was too much for me. The fever won't go down.

464
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:32,440
Oh, my goodness.

465
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:38,550
Madam, how can you do that?

466
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:41,620
How can you accuse someone of stealing so hastily?

467
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:44,400
Is this how you've been treating your employees all along?

468
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,110
My goodness, CEO Anna.

469
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:51,340
Why are you speaking to me like that, with your eyes glaring?

470
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,730
She's in a strangers' house as a live-in tutor to make some money.

471
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:57,760
How can you accuse a helpless young lady like that of stealing?

472
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,730
- Is that something a human being should do?
- Excuse me, CEO Anna.

473
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:04,390
Are you scolding me right now? Who do you think you are?

474
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:08,180
Are you related to Ms. Park or something?

475
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,210
Just think if Ms. Park was your daughter.

476
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:14,470
How would you feel if Se Ryun was accused of stealing by someone?

477
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:17,560
This is not the way to live a life!

478
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,940
You leave me speechless.

479
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:24,130
Did I do it for no reason? I found my necklace in her room!

480
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:27,130
How dare you lecture me? Please pack up your bags and leave this house!

481
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:29,560
How dare a guest to speak to me this way?

482
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,720
Why would I get out? Are you the owner of this house?

483
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,320
Oh my, this woman is crazy!

484
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,560
You are the crazy one!

485
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,500
From now on, don't treat the employees carelessly.

486
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,010
Whoever it is, Ms. Park, Mrs. Yeoju, Chief Jo, or Driver Kang.

487
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:50,550
Do you get that?

488
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,870
That woman! I'm going to get her!

489
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:59,060
Madam! Please, calm down.

490
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:02,470
There's nothing good getting on the bad side of CEO Anna.

491
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:07,430
Chairman Lee listens to every word she says.

492
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:14,150
Not Ms. Park, but I need to kick that woman out first! It's infuriating.

493
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:18,710
It's crazy. That woman is crazy!

494
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:02,270
Ms. Park, are you okay?

495
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:11,160
Ms. Park, I'm sorry.

496
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,080
I don't know how this could have happened.

497
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:19,170
Let me apologize on behalf of everyone.

498
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:23,160
Since the necklace came out from my desk,

499
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,860
I understand how Madam could have misunderstood.

500
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:33,080
But still, it's very upsetting.

501
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:37,740
No one in my family thinks you would do something like that.

502
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,140
They are all on your side.

503
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,790
You must know that, right?

504
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:48,270
Yes.

505
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:53,770
Then, let's go back together. Everyone is worried.

506
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:57,410
I want to stay out a little longer.

507
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:02,280
Please go back home first, and don't worry about me.

508
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:14,070
Okay, then please come home soon.

509
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:16,580
Yes.

510
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:41,830
Ms. Park!

511
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:47,630
Get on.

512
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:50,380
Chairman.

513
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,240
I just couldn't leave you here.

514
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:57,810
I want to make you feel better before today's over.

515
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,900
Chairman, do you think I'm still a kid?

516
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,310
That I will feel better with a bike ride?

517
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,750
Let's pretend that you are a kid just today.

518
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:12,690
Ms. Park, how many times should I go around to make you feel better?

519
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:18,790
Get on, please.

520
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:22,570
Are you really going to bike around until I feel better?

521
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:26,550
That's what I am saying. So please get on.

522
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:35,120
Chairman. You may have to go around more than ten times.

523
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,740
Be prepared.

524
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:41,820
If it makes you feel better, I can go around a hundred times.

525
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,370
Let's bike it until you feel better.

526
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:47,340
We're off now.

527
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:52,450
♫  When I walk this road, it makes me cry  ♫

528
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:55,380
Hold on tight, Ms. Park. I don't want you to fall off.

529
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:01,870
♫ It reminds me of that person's touch ♫

530
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:09,560
♫ I couldn't hold her and just trembled my heart ♫

531
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:16,280
♫ My beautiful love ♫

532
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:24,020
♫  Why do you run away, love. Like a shy child  ♫

533
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:30,720
♫ In case I lose it, I hold it tight ♫

534
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:38,000
♫ But love always runs away, chased by longing ♫

535
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:51,200
♫  It would be nice to take a break  ♫

536
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:15,360
Oh, what is so silky and feels so good?

537
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:20,790
What is it?

538
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:54,160
Madam, what is it? Did you see a ghost?

539
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,820
Say something!

540
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,290
Young Gook...

541
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:03,330
There are snakes in my room! There are snakes in my bed!

542
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:07,850
Snakes?

543
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:16,930
These are toys, Madam. Toy snakes.

544
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:21,450
What? What are these?

545
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:25,180
These are toy snakes!

546
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,730
Who did this? Who did this!

547
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:31,760
Did you do it, Lee Se Chan?

548
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,990
No, right?

549
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:35,670
I did it.

550
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:50,010
Lee Se Chan. Did you really do that?

551
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:52,030
Yes.

552
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:55,610
Lee Se Chan. Why did you do that?

553
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:59,190
Why did you do such a thing?

554
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,050
Because Grandma was so mean.

555
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:04,020
What?

556
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,500
What do you mean?

557
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,980
I saw everything!

558
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:11,470
What did you see?

559
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:14,640
The person who put that necklace in Ms.Park's drawer

560
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,280
was Grandma!

561
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,660
What?

562
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:20,660
Grandma hid the necklace in Ms. Park's room,

563
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:24,500
blamed Ms. Park for stealing it, and made her cry!

564
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:30,090
That's a bad deed, so that's why I punished Grandma instead of God!

565
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:34,680
Lee Se Chan. Is everything you said just now true?

566
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,320
Yes! It's all true!

567
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,290
I had short classes today, so I came home early.

568
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:43,220
And I saw Grandma walking into Ms. Park's room with the necklace

569
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,380
and putting it in her desk drawer!

570
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:49,120
I saw it with my own eyes!

571
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:55,370
But why didn't you say that earlier?

572
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:58,300
It's because she's still my Grandmother.

573
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,710
If I say Grandma did it in front of everyone,

574
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,850
she'll be embarrassed,

575
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,860
and things might get bigger.

576
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:10,240
That's why I wanted to tell the truth, but I couldn't.

577
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:15,100
But I felt like she shouldn't get away with it.

578
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:18,050
She did something bad to Ms. Park,

579
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:22,160
so even if she's my grandma, she still has to be punished!

580
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:27,220
I thought if I didn't punish her, she'd be mean to Ms. Park again.

581
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:32,190
Okay, Se Chan.

582
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:36,860
Thank you for being honest with me.

583
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:40,120
But, Se Chan.

584
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:45,010
If something like this happens again, trust me and tell me first.

585
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:48,560
Can you do that?

586
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,970
Yes.

587
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,480
How!

588
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,960
How can you do that!

589
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,330
What did I do for you to shout at me like that?

590
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:05,260
Do you really not know?

591
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,920
I don't know!

592
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,690
I almost had a heart attack while I was sleeping! Why are you shouting at me!

593
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:19,040
Se Chan saw you hiding the necklace in Ms. Park's room!

594
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,240
Why on earth did you do that?

595
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,720
Why?

596
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,260
What kind of grudge do you hold against Ms. Park to do that?

597
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:30,990
T-That's because...

598
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:37,000
That's because... Kyung Sook?

599
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,870
I did it because she looks like Kyung Sook! Why else?

600
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:45,060
She looks like Kyung Sook, that damn woman who seduced your father!

601
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:49,550
That's why I did it! Why else?

602
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:52,900
Kyung Sook? Who is Kyung Sook?

603
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,330
Who is that?

604
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:59,830
My housekeeper! The girl who worked in my house, you know her!

605
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:02,060
What are you saying?!

606
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,760
That kind of person didn't exist!

607
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,620
There was, there was! Kyung Sook, Kyung Sook, Kyung Sook!

608
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:13,100
She seduced your father, so I had such a hard time! That Kyung Sook!

609
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,550
Pardon me?

610
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,980
Do you think we should test her for dementia?

611
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:26,570
Yes! I think Madam's acting strange.

612
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:28,900
She's a bit young to have dementia.

613
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,620
No, Young Gook!

614
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:32,770
There's a lot of people who have dementia at that age these days.

615
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:34,800
Does this make sense unless she's sick?

616
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:40,100
They say people do ridiculous things when they have dementia!

617
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,370
Now that I think about it, I think you're right.

618
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:45,400
There was never a person called Kyung Sook in our household.

619
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:49,740
Make sure she gets checked up, okay? Before it gets worse.

620
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,130
What just happened?

621
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:58,020
Who is Kyung Sook? Why did that name jump out of me?!

622
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:02,740
Oh, how embarrassing! Everyone must think I'm mad!

623
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,280
Wait.

624
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,820
That's right. Being mad is better!

625
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:11,030
It's better to be considered a crazy person than kicked out of this house in shame.

626
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:13,370
Oh, how embarrassing. Oh!

627
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:20,820
It's Chrysanthemum tea. Drinking it makes you feel at peace and lets you sleep better.

628
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:24,320
Here. Take a sip.

629
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:27,030
Thank you.

630
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:37,250
Ms. Park. You were shocked and saddened today, weren't you?

631
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:41,710
We've decided to get Madam tested for dementia tomorrow.

632
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:44,230
A dementia test?

633
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:47,690
I think the Madam's ill.

634
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:50,440
So, about what happened today,

635
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,070
it seems like it happened because Madam's sick.

636
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:58,910
So please don't take it to heart and forget about it, okay?

637
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:09,740
Even if anything like that happens, no one in this house thinks you'll do that.

638
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:16,860
Oh, no, Ms. Park.

639
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:24,190
It's nothing. I'm really okay.

640
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:27,410
It's not that...

641
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:30,130
I'm just very grateful.

642
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:36,830
I'm so thankful to you for understanding me so well.

643
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:41,030
Yes, Ms. Park.

644
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:49,170
It's okay, my daughter.

645
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:52,810
I'll always be beside you.

646
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:56,680
Oh.

647
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:07,040
Hey.

648
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,210
What are you doing out here instead of sleeping?

649
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:14,200
Mom, why did you come out? Are you unable to sleep as well?

650
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:18,510
You're right. My heart just keeps beating so fast.

651
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:22,450
If that Madam and son-in-law Park are really siblings,

652
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:25,190
aren't we being sinful?

653
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:30,010
Aren't we going to get punished if we keep pretending that we don't know?

654
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:33,940
Mom. Should we just try the DNA test?

655
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:38,570
Yes. If the test says we're wrong, we're wrong.

656
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:41,990
If it says we're right, we let them meet!

657
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:47,080
Why don't you go in and pluck a hair from your husband?

658
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,440
Okay.

659
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:18,610
What are you doing?!

660
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:21,410
What's going on?

661
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,830
Why are you acting like this?!

662
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:26,630
Oh, it's not what you think!

663
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:29,090
I was trying to catch a mosquito,

664
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:32,970
but it landed on your head!

665
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:39,280
- What...
- Go back to sleep.

666
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:03,150
What?

667
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:08,040
You acted mad on purpose, Madam?

668
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:11,810
Then what was I supposed to do? Because of Se Chan, that brat,

669
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:17,860
everyone realized I fabricated the incident to accuse Ms. Park of a robber!

670
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:21,790
If I hadn't acted crazy, I would have been chased out of this house at that moment!

671
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:26,030
Even if I hadn't been chased out, how would I live in this house with my head up?

672
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:28,390
It's embarrassing.

673
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:30,360
What should we do now, Madam?

674
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,110
The Chairman told me to bring you to the hospital today

675
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:37,000
to get an Alzheimer's examination!

676
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,970
What examination?!

677
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:42,760
I acted mad, I said!

678
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,090

Chairman Lee! Y-Young Gook!

680
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,130
Ms. Park stole my necklace!

681
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:10,450
Ms. Park, she's a thieving wench! So kick her out now!

682
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:13,590
It's really not me...

683
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:19,690
Why does my daughter have to cope with that?

684
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:24,020
I need to do something

685
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:27,560
to bring Dan Dan back to the States with me.

00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,810
Mr. Park.

688
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:45,200
Hello, CEO!

689
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,240
Do you have some time?

690
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,650
I have something I want to talk about with you.

691
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,740
With me?

692
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,770
What did you want to talk about?

693
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:59,400
It's actually about...

694
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:05,660
I came to Korea for business, but I'll have to return to America in six months.

695
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:10,030
I want to take Ms. Park with me this time.

696
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:12,290
I'm sorry?

697
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:14,330
Our Dan Dan?

698
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:18,490
Yes. I like Ms. Park a lot.

699
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:21,360
She's very responsible, diligent, and kind.

700
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:26,310
So I asked Ms. Park if she wanted to work with me,

701
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:32,840
but Ms. Park seemed to be feeling responsible for the children.

702
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:37,710
She said she wanted to work in Chairman Lee's house for a while longer.

703
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:39,960
Our Dan Dan said that?

704
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,140
Yes.

705
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:47,410
If you have a chance, could you bring this up with Ms. Park?

706
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:51,600
I'd love to work with Ms. Park.

707
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:55,180
And I believe Ms. Park would have a more beneficial time

708
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:58,970
working with me in America than working as a tutor.

709
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:02,600
Of course, that's true!

710
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:07,200
I don't know why Dan Dan refused such a great opportunity.

711
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,020
I'll talk to her about it!

712
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,990
- Thank you.
- No, no!

713
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:14,570
I'm more grateful!

714

01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:20,420
Is this where you live?

807
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:26,710
Yes. It'll go through re-development soon, so it's a bit old, but it's comfortable to live.

808
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:28,610
Yes!

809
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:30,090
Who is this?

810
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:33,770
This is my son, Noona.

811
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:36,680
Hello, my name is Park Dae Beom.

812
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:41,070
Oh, my... You're my Kyung Hoon's son.

813
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:46,620
My gosh, you're exactly the same as when my Kyung Hoon was young!

814
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:53,040
My mom would have been so happy if she saw you, Dae Beom.

815
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,840
- Dad!
- Oh, Dan Dan! Welcome.

816
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:58,050
Noona... She's my daughter.

817
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:00,820
Your daughter?

818
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:04,280
Hello, my name is Park Dan Dan.

819
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:07,830
You grew up so well and pretty.

820
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:16,120
Our Dae Beom... My mom should have seen you before she passed away.

821
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:21,830
Oh!

822
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:23,570
Who's this now?

823
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:26,530
Oh, that's my son.

824
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:29,430
Hello, Madam Sister-in-law.

825
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:31,330
"Madam Sister-in-law?"

826
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:34,020
Oh, you punk. Why would you call her 'Madam?'

827
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:37,060
You need to call her 'Sister-in-law.'

828
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:41,950
It's all right. There's nothing wrong with 'Madam Sister-in-law.'

829
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:56,160
H-hyungnim... I didn't prepare much, but I hope you enjoy it.

830
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,950
Hyungnim...

831
01:02:57,950 --> 01:03:00,820
I have a sister-in-law now.

832
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:04,790
Thank you for the food, sister-in-law.

833
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:11,170
Thanks to reuniting with my Kyung Hoon, I get to be called 'Hyungnim.'

834
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:13,540
My son-in-law's name is Soo Chul.

835
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:16,730
Don't you think you'll have to call him Soo Chul now?

836
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:19,230
Oh... That's right.

837
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:23,940
I shouldn't call you Kyung Hoon anymore and call you Soo Chul from now.

838
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:27,740
Let's all lift our glasses and toast!

839
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:30,560
Yes, Noona!

840
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:34,720
My Joon Oh should've come to this happy gathering too.

841
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:38,860
But he's going to medical school outside of Seoul. He'll come next weekend.

842
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:41,380
I'll make sure to bring him that time, and we'll gather together.

843
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:45,420
Let's do that! The doctor is busy with his studies.

844
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:48,910
We have a doctor in our family now!

845
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:52,450
Let's toast to us becoming one family!

846
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:55,270
- Let's all toast together!
- All right, then...

847
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:59,760
Let's celebrate my brother-in-law and sister-in-law reuniting. Let's all cheers to that!

848
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,750
Cheers!

849
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:16,720
Mom... Are you watching from heaven?

850
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:22,350
I found our Kyung Hoon. Our Kyung Hoon!

851
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:29,480
Kyung Hoon... Until right before our mom passed,

852
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:33,220
she only kept calling your name and then passed away.

853
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:38,190
- Did our mom do that?
- Yes.

854
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:43,910
Our mom must be so happy now.

855
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:50,550
Mom... I...

856
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:53,440
Our Kyung Hoon's hand...

857
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,970
I'll never let it go anymore.

858
01:05:03,610 --> 01:05:06,980
So, Mom...

859
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:10,970
Rest in peace up there.

860
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,710
Mom...

861
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:29,240
- Why don't you have some meat?
- Let's eat!

862
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:31,430
Let's eat a lot!

863
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:43,720
It's so late.

864
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:47,660
Ms. Park doesn't even have a car. When does she plan on coming?

865
01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:17,200
Chairman!

866
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,480
You're a bit late.

867
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,710
I'm sorry... I'm a little late.

868
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:26,050
Did you meet your Aunt well?

869
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:29,600
Yes, I did!

870
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:32,570
My eyes are so swollen today, aren't they?

871
01:06:32,570 --> 01:06:35,390
Our entire family was crying so much today.

872
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:40,310
We cried and then laughed, then laughed and cried...

873
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:42,940
I sincerely congratulate that you found your aunt.

874
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:45,380
Thank you, Chairman.

875
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:48,900
I'm so happy today.

876
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:54,270
It's been so long since my dad was that happy.

877
01:06:54,270 --> 01:06:58,350
So, because I was so happy,

878
01:06:58,350 --> 01:07:03,520
I had just one drink! Just one!

879
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,890
I don't think it was one drink.

880
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:09,280
You're right... It wasn't one.

881
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,690
I drank quite a lot.

882
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:18,410
Please understand me, Chairman. If not on a day like this, when will I get to drink?

883
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:21,520
All right, I will understand. Let's go in now.

884
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,490
Thank you!

885
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:48,760
I'm sorry. I thought you were going to fall.

886
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:58,510
Chairman...

887
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:02,050
Why are you being so nice to me?

888
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:03,610
Excuse me?

889
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:07,110
Because you keep being so nice to me,

890
01:08:07,110 --> 01:08:11,790
my heart feels like it's going to explode!

891
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,600
What did you say?

892
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:21,450
I think...

893
01:08:21,450 --> 01:08:23,670
I like you, Chairman.

894
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:28,890
Whenever I see you, my heart keeps pounding and making a fuss.

895
01:08:28,890 --> 01:08:32,310
Chairman, what if I get heart disease from this?

896
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:37,760
If I get heart disease, will you take responsibility?

897
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:53,890
♫ A smile blooms in every step ♫

898
01:08:53,890 --> 01:08:58,580
♫ It's a shiny day because of you ♫

899
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:00,700
♫  It's sunshine day ♫

900
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:07,700
♫ Strangely, I'm drawn to you ♫

901
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:14,120
♫ Nobody will understand me. You're the only one that I was looking for ♫

902
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:22,440
♫ Woo, it's a happy day like a dream, yeah ♫

903
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:25,920
[Young Lady and Gentleman]

904
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:31,280
I won't tell you to take responsibility for my heart, Chairman.

905
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:34,450
If the Chairman asks about the Alzheimer's test result...

906
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:39,650
Seriously... Just tell him I just have a little bit.

907
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:44,320
- We see again.
- What is Ms. Se Ryun going to do with that two-timing guy?

908
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:48,080
- It's for you to eat when you're hungry.
- Thank you, Ms. Park. Oh...

909
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:51,720
How could he call me, Ms. Park? How could he...

910
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,410
I'll take care of it.

911
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:58,340
If I were a real Alzheimer's patient, I would do something ridiculous and kick her out.

912
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:00,340
- That's it!
- That's it!

913
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:03,440
Madam. I brought your juice.

914
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:08,180
You wench who deserves to die! You, evil wench!
