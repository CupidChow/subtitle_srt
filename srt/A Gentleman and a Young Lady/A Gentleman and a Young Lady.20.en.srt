00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,210
What?
 [Episode 20]

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,730
You and Chief Jo were going to get married?

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,440
Why are you so surprised? Didn't you know?

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,650
Of course, I'm surprised.

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:16,540
Let alone getting married, but I've never heard of you dating each other.

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:22,760
You told me that you were dating someone with a huge age gap.

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,090
What?

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,780
Was I dating a woman much older than me?

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,840
No, that's not what I meant.

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,200
You were dating a young lady who was much younger than you.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,970
Really?

12
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:44,740
Was I dating a young lady much younger than me?

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,790
But who is that?

14
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,700
You didn't tell me who the young lady was.

15
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,500
But you worried a lot about the fact that she was much younger.

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,610
And whether you should keep seeing her.

17
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:02,730
Did I really do that?

18
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,970
Jung Woo.

19
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:18,840
I'm afraid... I was having an affair.

20
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,550
What?

21
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,790
Why else would I have been worried about seeing her?

22
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,610
Please keep this a secret.

23
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,630
If Chief Jo Noona finds out about this, she will be upset.

24
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,630
I don't want to hurt someone so nice.

25
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,090
What?

26
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,090
Jung Woo, I beg you. I will go now.

27
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,380
I will have to talk to Chief Jo Noona.

28
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,380
I lived a hard life watching my father abandoning my mother for an affair.

29
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,660
And I hated my father for it.

30
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,660
But then I became the same as him,

31
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:08,950
betraying a woman and scarring her heart.

32
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:13,490
Chairman. Something happened, didn't you?

33
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,820
Please tell me what it is.

34
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,230
Yes, Lee Young Gook.

35
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:23,760
Like a man, end this vicious cycle of betrayal.

36
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,970
Chief Jo Noona, I've committed a mortal sin.

37
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,060
Chairman, what are you doing?

38
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,640
Please stand up.

39
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:49,780
I will not stand up until you say you will forgive me.

40
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,730
What happened?

41
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,060
Okay, I'll forgive you.

42
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,360
So please get up.

43
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,940
Are you sure?

44
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:03,790
Will you really forgive me?

45
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,210
Of course. Please get up.

46
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,430
People are looking at us.

47
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:22,810
Chairman, what happened?

48
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,110
I betrayed you

49
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:31,010
and had an affair with a much younger woman, but you say you'll still forgive me.

50
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:38,010
I don't know how I could have done that to someone so good and angel like you.

51
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,120
41-year-old me is such a corrupted and terrible person.

52
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,500
I am too embarrassed and ashamed

53
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,370
that I don't even want to go back to that person.

54
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,500
Chairman, what are you saying?

55
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:00,650
From what Jung Woo told me, I think I was having an affair with someone much younger than me.

56
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,390
You must've had a hard time because of me.

57
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:10,430
That's why we fought, and you left the house, wasn't you?

58
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,850
Right?

59
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,310
No, that's not it. I didn't know about it.

60
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,570
Lawyer Koh must be mistaken.

61
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,490
Chairman is not someone who would do something like that.

62
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,900
You were faithful to me.

63
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,400
If there was a young lady,

64
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,000
probably you weren't the one who had feelings,

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,770
but she was pursuing you unilaterally.

66
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,230
You trust, forgive, and understand me like this.

67
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,600
I'm really grateful.

68
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,110
I will be good to you from now on.

69
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,390
Chairman.

70
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:04,150
Even if it was so, it's all in the past.

71
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,580
Also, it's something you don't even remember.

72
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:13,420
For me, in any situation,

73
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,110
I trust you.

74
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,370
Chief Jo Noona.

75
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,760
I betrayed you

76
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,520
and had an affair with a much younger woman, but you say you'll still forgive me.

77
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,520
From what Jung Woo told me,

78
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,140
I think I was having an affair with someone much younger than me.

79
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:54,590
This is definitely about Ms. Park.

80
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,960
How does Lawyer Koh know about this?

81
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,280
Did Chairman tell Lawyer Koh before he had an accident?

82
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,440
Is that what it is?

83
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:12,620
Does Lawyer Koh know that the young woman is Ms. Park?

84
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:23,620
Right, it wasn't easy for me to come all the way here.

85
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,480
I will check it for myself.

86
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,750
[FT Group]

87
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,600
Excuse me. I'm here for the interview for a driver's position. Which way should I go?

88
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,440
- Please go to the General Affairs division.
- Thank you.

89
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,050
I can't even play games.

90
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,820
She says she's okay,

91
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,220
but Chief Jo Noona must be very hurt.

92
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:07,630
How could anyone be okay with their fiancé having an affair?

93
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,390
Right, let's do that.

94
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:17,790
I will make her feel totally better.

95
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,340
Mrs. Yeoju! Ajumeoni!

96
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,960
As I asked you,

97
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,030
did you request the manager for a bonfire in the garden, candles, and wine at the vacation home?

98
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,920
Yes, I did.

99
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,790
Did you say a hundred roses as well? I asked to make it in a heart shape.

100
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,280
Did you tell him clearly?

101
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,550
Yes, I clearly told him about everything.

102
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,310
He said he would have everything ready.

103
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,620
But, Chairman.

104
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,630
Are you going to propose to Chief Jo today?

105
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:51,980
Mrs. Yeoju. Please pretend you don't know something like that.

106
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,600
Mrs. Yeoju and Ms. Park Noona.

107
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,670
Take a look at this.

108
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,510
I picked this ring myself.

109
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,370
Do you think Chief Jo Noona will like it?

110
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,710
It's pretty, but...

111
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:08,840
Why?

112
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,330
It would've been better if you had gotten a bigger rock for her.

113
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,420
I picked this because it's cute.

114
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:18,860
Women prefer bigger and expensive one than cute ones.

115
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,970
What do I do? I don't have time to exchange it.

116
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,770
But your heart is there, and you can buy a bigger one next time.

117
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,680
Of course. And Chief Jo Noona doesn't care about things like that since she's very sweet.

118
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,430
Mrs. Yeoju and Ms. Park Noona.

119
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,730
Even if I am not here, please take good care of Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong.

120
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:42,250
I guess you and Chief Jo will stay overnight at the vacation house?

121
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,410
Ajumeoni, you shouldn't ask things like that.

122
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,050
I will get going now.

123
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,010
It must be so nice for Chief Jo.

124
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:57,660
Proposal ring, roses in a heart shape, and red wine over a bonfire.

125
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,480
It sounds like it will be a hot evening.

126
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,070
What am I saying in front of you, Ms. Park?

127
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,170
How would you like your hair styled?

128
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,410
I would like to change it into a softer style.

129
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,710
Ah, a soft style?

130
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,170
Yes, I see.

131
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,750
Three of us were the real family.

132
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:46,640
Even if people call me a bad woman, or if I get punished, it's okay.

133
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:53,320
Even if it's late, I will stay next to him and my daughter.

134
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,300
Please give it due consideration.

135
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,520
If given an opportunity, I would work hard.

136
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,730
Mr. Park Soo Chul, we will be in touch.

137
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,050
Okay.

138
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,640
[CEO Anna]

139
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:20,750
Ah, yes, CEO. Hello.

140
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,390
Why did you call me?

141
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,350
It's done now. Why don't you turn on the light?

142
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,580
Is it done already?

143
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:41,100
It is very beautiful. Thank you, Driver Park.

144
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,360
I bought these lights because they were so pretty,

145
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,440
but I'm not too familiar with the other guards, so I bothered you.

146
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,320
No, that's fine.

147
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,240
Call me if you need anything done. I'll do everything I can.

148
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,270
Thank you for saying that.

149
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,970
Silly me. Sit for a bit, have some coffee.

150
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,810
No, no.

151
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,260
If you just leave, I'll feel sorry.

152
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,020
You came here and helped me.

153
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,000
I just brewed some coffee.

154
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,960
Please, have some.

155
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,420
What's wrong?

156
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,760
It seemed like your hairstyle had changed.

157
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,690
Because it's fall, I changed the style. Does it look strange on me?

158
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,580
No. It looks great on you.

159
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,230
Thank you. Please, have some.

160
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,160
Yes.

161
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,710
The more I look at Ms. Park, the more she's pretty.

162
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:07,320
She's thoughtful, kind, hardworking, and smart.

163
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,960
You really raised her well.

164
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:19,790
Thank you for thinking so fondly of her.

165
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:25,000
Ms. Park really looks like you.

166
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,700
Yes. I heard that a lot.

167
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:35,690
How was Ms. Park when she was younger? Tell me about her childhood.

168
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,450
My Dan Dan has been smart and put it together since she was a child.

169
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,740
She was an easy child to bring up.

170
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,950
Dan Dan didn't make any trouble as a child.

171
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,660
But there was one time that she got into trouble.

172
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,420
I even had to go to her school. The teacher called me.

173
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,470
What was it for?

174
00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:00,290
Well... She had hit a boy in her class.

175
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,910
- A boy?
- Yes.

176
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:07,870
The boy seemed to have played a mean prank on Dan Dan's friend.

177
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,050
So to protect her friend,

178
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:16,950
she fought with him and gave him a bloody nose.

179
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,350
She fought with a boy and gave him a nose bleed?

180
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,600
Oh, my!

181
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,930
I will get going now. Thank you for the coffee.

182
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,710
Yes, Driver Park. Thank you for helping me today.

183
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:54,680
Whenever you need help, call me.

184
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,210
71, 72...

185
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:09,620
83, 84... Oh?

186
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,620
I got a cramp on my hand.

187
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,560
Who would've thought the day I get a cramp from counting money would come?

188
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,990
It's great even if I get a cramp. I'm full even without eating.

189
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,990
It's great no matter how many times I have to count!

190
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,580
Look at this.

191
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:40,950
This is the literal moment of sitting on top of a cushion of money!

192
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,330
What should I do with all this money?

193
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:51,190
Even if I put it in the bank, I won't get much interest.

194
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,560
That's right.

195
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,080
Real estate is the best!

196
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,870
Real estate. I will buy some real estate.

197
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,700
Hey, hey, you are hardly moving.

198
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,230
Dong Pil, if you're going to do it,

199
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:17,000
sweep all the way vigorously over to that front of the street.

200
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,590
Sweep it powerfully and generously!

201
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:22,670
Why would I sweep in front of someone else's store?

202
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,740
What, am I the neighborhood sweeper?

203
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,750
Nothing in life is free.

204
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:34,450
You have to volunteer and work hard to have good things come to you.

205
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:38,370
Just listen to what I say. Then, at your elder age, fortune will open up.

206
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,520
You will die laughing then.

207
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,690
I listened to you and ended up like this. I give up.

208
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,140
When did you ever listen to me?

209
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,970
How are you, gentlemen!

210
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,330
We're fine.

211
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,590
Is it all one building until there?

212
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:02,580
He doesn't even come to our jokbal place, and how can he say hello to us?

213
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:09,020
Yong Pil Hyung, doesn't that woman look like Soon Ae?

214
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:14,760
Your first love lasts such a long time!

215
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,550
No matter how hard I look, I don't see any resemblance to Soon Ae.

216
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:23,300
She does look similar to me.

217
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,940
I heard the people from the store across the street are moving abroad.

218
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,950
Wonder if she's looking at the store.

219
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,780
Are you sure the monthly rent of 2 to 3 million won will come in without delay?

220
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,290
Of course. You will have no trouble with the rent,

221
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:45,450
and it won't be vacant at all. I can promise you that.

222
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:48,850
Okay! Let's sign the contract with this.

223
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:53,560
I like the location, and the building maintenance looks good too.

224
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,500
You've made a good choice.

225
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,520
The current renter is moving abroad next month, so you will have a different renter right away.

226
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,750
I'll take care of those things with responsibility, so don't worry.

227
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,100
Sounds good. I'll look forward to working with you.

228
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,530
Thank you.

229
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,590
[Real Estate (Shopping Arcade) Purchase Contract]

230
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:20,420
It's not like I'm paying monthly rent,

231
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:27,170
but now I became the landlord getting the monthly rent!

232
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:33,400
Mother and father, thank you!

233
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,030
For the first time in my life,

234
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:40,300
with my name, Lee Gi Ja,

235
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,520
I got the building registration!

236
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,920
Aigoo.

237
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,120
W-Who is this?

238
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,060
Sarah! Sarah!

239
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,130
What? What is it?

240
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,110
Chairman Lee is here!

241
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,840
Who? Chairman?

242
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,330
What is this? What is going on?

243
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:14,180
How would I know? You should know!

244
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:18,710
Open the door. Gosh!

245
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,880
Oh, Chairman.

246
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,290
Chief Jo Noona.

247
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,030
Welcome, Chairman.

248
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:27,090
What brings you all the way here?

249
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,780
- Here you go.
- You didn't have to buy all this.

250
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,490
We would've welcomed you so much even if you came empty-handed!

251
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:38,580
This is my first time greeting my mother-in-law. So how can I come empty-handed?

252
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:44,700
M-mother-in-law? Are you saying that to me?

253
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,210
Please take that to take care of your health.

254
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,220
You have to take care of your joints at your age, Mother-in-law.

255
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,810
You have to be healthy so that Chief Jo Noona would be happy.

256
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,250
Of course, of course.

257
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,180
Then this here, to show my gratefulness for the gift,

258
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,260
should I take a little sip?

259
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,740
Oh, already,

260
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:19,250
I'm already getting a strong feeling of my joints getting better!

261
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,480
Stop it, Mom.

262
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,100
Don't stand here, and please have a seat.

263
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:31,310
Oh, actually, I have somewhere to go with Chief Jo Noona today.

264
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,360
Would it be okay if I take Chief Jo Noona?

265
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,140
Of course, it's okay!

266
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:42,160
But where are you going with my daughter?

267
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,310
The vacation house.

268
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:47,730
Vacation house?

269
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,440
I can't believe it! I can't!

270
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,160
The day we've been waiting for so long is finally here!

271
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,600
Mom! Chairman will hear it.

272
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,200
But how am I supposed to act all of a sudden?

273
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,170
What do you mean, how?

274
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,880
Tonight you should just, bam!

275
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,360
Transform into a temptress. One like the world has never seen before, okay?

276
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,340
You're really driving me crazy, Mom!

277
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,680
What are you going to do if Chairman hears you?

278
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,200
- Seriously!
- Get ready quickly.

279
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,840
What are you taking?

280
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:39,320
Also, Chairman is very pure and innocent right now.

281
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,820
Hey! In the past, people got married and had tons of kids at that age.

282
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,960
It's all up to you.

283
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,160
Tonight, nothing more or less,

284
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,830
just conceive a healthy baby boy, all right?

285
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,340
Seriously! You're driving me crazy, Mom!

286
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,420
- Mi Sook! Hey, Mi Sook, Mi Sook!
- Yes?

287
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:05,020
Hey, what? What is it?

288
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,470
Let's call Dae Ran and have a party today!

289
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,290
Party? What Party?

290
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,440
It's my treat today!

291
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,910
Let's party the night away today! Mi Sook!

292
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:21,660
I'm so happy today that I feel like I'm going to lose it! I'm ecstatic!

293
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,770
Hey, hey! What in the world happened that made you this happy?

294
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:29,440
What? Did you hit the jackpot or something?

295
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,330
No, not that. Something better than that!

296
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:36,150
What? There's something better than hitting the jackpot?

297
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:41,180
My daughter is getting married to Chairman Lee!

298
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:46,600
The two of them just left to go spend an intimate time at the vacation home together!

299
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,580
I'm saying they left for their honeymoon early!

300
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,990
Oh, my goodness. No way.

Today is the day I become FT Group's Mother-in-law!

but why is Dae Ran like that?

314
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:46,960
Is Chairman Lee getting married to Sarah something to be that excited for?

315
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,390
Goodness... how could she behave that way just because he's not her son?

316
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:58,320

Let's go!

00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,350
Chairman, let's go and make something delicious at the vacation home.

We can cook conveniently like this these days.

00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:26,520
Wow, there's everything!

323
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,160
Chief Jo Noona, which one do you like in there?

324
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,170
I am going to cook today.

325
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,780
Will you?

326
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,290
I can cook. Just trust me and follow my lead today.

327
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,620
It's customary for men to cook when you go to places like that.

328
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,880
Chief Jo Noona, you should just comfortably rest while I cook,

329
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,790
because you're the star of today.

330
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,930
Okay.

331
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,990
I can't wait.

332
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,230
The world's become a much better place.

333
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:10,080
Should I try it?

334
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,750
It's good. It's delicious!

335
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:41,330
My goodness. Did you prepare all this, Chairman?

336
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,200
Did you come out?

337
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,370
To be honest, I didn't do it alone.

338
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:49,710
But the manager Ajussi and Ajumeoni here helped out a lot.

339
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:52,970
How is it? Do you like it?

340
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:58,990
Yes. It's so pretty and I really, really like it.

341
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,040
Why don't you sit first?

342
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,320
Please have a seat, and try the food that I made.

343
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,270
Please, try it.

344
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,520
How is it?

345
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,440
It's very delicious.

346
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,500
Also, because you made it, it's more delicious.

347
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,200
Oh, what a relief.

348
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,120
Wait! I need to open the wine first,

349
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,080
but the order is wrong.

350
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,570
I've totally ruined it.

351
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,150
It's okay.

352
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:58,350
It doesn't matter if the order is different.

353
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:01,530
Oh, again! The order almost changed again.

354
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:05,840
There was an important step before the wine.

355
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,720
Today's highlight!

356
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,120
Today's highlight?

357
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,550
Chairman...

358
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:00,440
There was no ring on your hand, Chief Jo Noona.

359
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,540
I guess I didn't even buy you a ring.

360
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,940
It's not like that.

361
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,670
You said you were going to buy me one,

362
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:21,470
but I refused and said buy me one when we get married.

363
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:24,240
Still, that's not right.

364
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,520
No matter how much I think about it, Chief Jo Noona,

365
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,130
I forgot my memories,

366
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:35,380
but I think I did many bad things to you,

367
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,510
gave you many wounds.

368
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,740
I am really sorry.

369
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,500
I will be really good from now.

370
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:53,140
So, please forget everything I did wrong.

371
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,300
Chairman...

372
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:09,980
I won't do something like that again.

373
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:15,480
Let's live happily together.

374
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:47,500
Oh, gosh! Goodness!

375
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,410
Oh, no! Chief Jo Noona!

376
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,170
How could he push me at that moment?

377
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:11,350
Crazy punk... Crazy bastard!

378
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:19,520
Can we talk outside for a bit?

379
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,410
If he's going to make me feel better because he's sorry,

380
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:25,980
he should come here himself. Why is he asking me to go see him?

381
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:53,510
Chief Jo Noona, I'm very sorry.

382
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:57,400
I did not push you on purpose earlier.

383
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:03,010
I was instinctively reacting to the situation without even knowing.

384
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,770
I really wanted to make new history

385
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:11,790
in our relationship with you today, and that's why we came here.

386
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:15,160
But, I think I can only think of you

387
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,170
as a real Noona.

388
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,880
Chairman.

389
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,420
Let's try a little harder.

390
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:32,010
I can't even kiss you. But does that relationship worth trying?

391
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:37,760
Let's just go back home today.

392
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:53,470
That bastard...

393
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:18,570
Regular, spicy, and crazy spicy flavors are all on sale!

394
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:22,200
Tasty chicken skewers are on sale for 5,000 won for ten.

395
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,580
Oh, yes! Padak, Padak!

396
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:30,480
Hot! Young Men! There are many, but...

397
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,920
Regular, spicy, and crazy spicy flavors are all on sale!

398
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:38,780
Tasty chicken skewers are only 5,000 won for ten!

399
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,450
5,000 won will do.

400
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:43,450
Tasty chicken skewers...

401
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:47,050
are 5,000 won for ten...

402
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,990
Dae Beom.

403
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:11,330
Please don't work like this here,

404
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,810
and come with me.

405
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:15,590
Se Ryun.

406
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:21,220
I even went to the US to forget you.

407
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:24,650
I tried to live and forget about you.

408
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:27,590
But I couldn't do it.

409
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:32,010
Dae Beom, please come with me.

410
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:36,460
No matter where, and don't think about anything else.

411
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:40,220
Just think of the two of us.

412
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,720
Okay, let's do that.

413
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,000
I will go with you.

414
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,730
I will forget everything...

415
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,520
and leave everything up to you.

416
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,740
Okay, let's do that.

417
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:19,680
"I can't even kiss you. But does that relationship worth trying?"

418
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,110
"Let's just go back home today."

419
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:25,790
What a bastard...

420
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:34,220
Auntie, please bring another bottle.

421
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,440
Okay!

422
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,280
- Here is the key.
- Thank you.

423
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,510
Good night.

424
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,100
A number I don't know. Who is this?

425
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,830
Hello?

426
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:02,270
Ajussi.

427
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,810
It's me.

428
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,340
Me? Who?

429
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:12,220
- Who is this?
- It's me.

430
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,920
Sokcho Night Beach.

431
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:22,080
I called your company to get your number.

432
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,370
You are the teddy bear Ajussi, right?

433
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:29,740
Yes, it's me. But we agreed to ignore each other.

434
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:37,250
Ajussi, I'm really drunk right now.

435
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:41,040
Please take me home.

436
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,340
Where are you?

437
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:51,010
Okay, I will be right there. Wait there for me.

438
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:24,020
Why did she drink this much?

439
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:31,030
Be careful.

440
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,880
It's the teddy bear Ajussi.

441
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,100
When did you come here?

442
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:48,690
Please get up. I will take you home.

443
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:53,000
Thank you.

444
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:19,110
Are you okay?

445
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,380
I'm okay now.

446
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,990
You said you were getting married soon.

447
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:27,080
Should you be drinking like this?

448
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,430
Don't drink this much anymore.

449
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:37,780
Ajussi. I'm sorry.

450
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:46,420
And thank you so much for picking me up today.

451
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,790
Ah, no, it's okay.

452
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:03,250
What do you mean? You just did the driving service.

453
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,720
You have to get paid for work.

454
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,590
We are strangers to each other.

455
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,960
Why would you not take money?

456
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,330
Please take it.

457
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:45,870
The Chairman does not think of me as a woman.

458
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:49,320
He doesn't think of me as anything but an Ajumma.

459
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,100
He's just a silly young man in his twenties.

460
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,930
Right.

461
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:00,550
I just need to marry him next month.

462
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:03,490
Who cares if he doesn't think of me as a woman?

463
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:07,020
I just have to be the madam of that household.

464
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,920
That's all I need.

465
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:22,820
Sarah, please come closer.

466
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:52,580
It's crazy! Why would I imagine such things?

467
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:57,980
Why would I care what they do with each other?

468
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:01,270
Why would I care?

469
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,860
What business is that to me?

470
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:28,520
I took her to the vacation house to propose to her.

471
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:33,480
With the bonfire, wine, and roses,

472
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,070
I set the romantic mood.

473
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:47,880
But how could I push Chief Jo Noona away at that moment?

474
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,330
My brain is broken for sure.

475
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:58,110
How could I face Chief Jo Noona from now on?

476
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:11,650
I must have gone crazy. Now I'm seeing stuff.

477
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:14,560
Why do I see him here?

478
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,020
Ms. Park Noona. Ms. Park Noona.

479
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,880
That's really him.

480
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:36,130
Ms. Park Noona, didn't you see me? I was calling you.

481
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:40,420
Did you? I didn't hear you.

482
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:43,600
Please come and sit here.

483
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,010
I'm glad to run into you.

484
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:50,590
What's wrong?

485
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:56,290
I was frustrated, and I needed to talk to someone.

486
00:41:56,290 --> 00:42:00,540
Please listen to my story, Ms. Park Noona.

487
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:05,740
But why are you here? I thought you went to the vacation home.

488
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,570
Didn't you go?

489
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:13,120
That's not the important thing.

490
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,940
You are my children's teacher, right?

491
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:22,200
With the heart of teaching my children,

492
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,820
please listen to me.

493
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:26,950
What is it?

494
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:30,070
So the thing is...

495
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:32,630
I mean, it is...

496
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:37,440
It's about my friend, not me.

497
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,950
I get it. What is it?

498
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:46,940
My friend did something wrong to his fiancee,

499
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:50,210
so he was trying to make her feel better,

500
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:54,280
and to propose to her grandly, he took her to a vacation home.

501
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,910
He was going to kiss her and so on there.

502
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:05,330
But instead, he pushed the woman he was supposed to kiss onto the ground.

503
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:06,740
Pushed her?

504
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,890
Yes, without even me knowing.

505
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:13,820
What I mean is my friend did.

506
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:17,640
And he asked what he should do in a situation like this.

507
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,790
I feel so bad.

508
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:23,210
What should I do?

509
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:28,430
You are saying this is not about you but your friend, right?

510
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,490
Of course.

511
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:34,860
I am really not that kind of a man. It's about my friend.

512
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:42,290
That woman must be very upset.

513
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:48,500
But why did your friend push the woman?

514
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:54,040
I'm asking you right now because I don't know about that!

515
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:58,260
I'm supposed to marry her next month, but I can't even kiss her.

516
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,760
What should I do?

517
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:05,100
I mean, what should my friend do?

518
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,410
Maybe it's because your friend

519
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:17,650
likes this woman and that woman, a two-timer.

520
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:22,830
Daebak, how does she know that?

521
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:31,810
Please give your friend this message.

522
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:36,660
The worst thing in the world is a two-timing!

523
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:41,630
Two-timers should be ripped in half,

524
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:45,060
between his two legs!

525
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:59,130
People who have affairs should be killed.

526
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:24,470
He was going to kiss her and so on there.

527
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:29,960
But instead, he pushed the woman he was supposed to kiss onto the ground.

528
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,120
Then, what does that mean?

529
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:37,520
Did they come back without anything happening?

530
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:45,610
Park Dan Dan, what does that have to do with you?

531
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:48,950
Please stop thinking these strange things.

532
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:53,110
Chairman is a two-timing jerk!

533
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,140
Why did I do that?

534
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:25,060
Maybe it's because your friend

535
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:31,080
likes this woman and that woman, a two-timer.

536
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:34,960
No.

537
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,110
I am not a two-timer.

538
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:40,090
I don't have another woman.

539
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:48,070
Am I really someone promised to marry Chief Jo Noona?

540
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:52,440
I'm home.

541
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,070
You're home. But what about Dae Beom?

542
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:59,780
What? Is he not home yet?

543
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,680
Was he not with you?

544
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,550
Noona, the business is not going well for both of us to be there. I was working as a driver.

545
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:11,560
I asked him to close the business, but he wouldn't listen, so I said he should do it alone.

546
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:15,610
What? Then is he grilling chicken skewers by himself until now?

547
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:20,460
It's past midnight. Maybe he went to see a friend.

548
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:25,860
My goodness. Call Dae Beom, now!

549
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:29,570
Why do you worry?

550
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:31,950
The phone of the person you're trying to reach is turned off...

551
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:33,950
His phone is off.

552
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:37,680
What? Is it off?

553
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,000
Did something happen to Dae Beom?

554
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,410
What about Dae Beom?

555
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:47,840
Honey, Dae Beom didn't come home or contact us until now.

556
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,330
And his phone is turned off.

557
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:54,260
I think I will have to go to the food truck and see for myself.

558
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:58,470
Where are you going alone? I'll come with you.

559
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,860
Why are they going out at this hour?

560
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:04,500
My goodness...

561
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,580
What happened here?

562
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:21,250
Honey, Dae Beom disappeared without putting everything away.

563
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:25,140
Where did Dae Beom go, leaving everything like this?

564
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:31,180
What do we do, Honey? Do you think he thought of something crazy because the business wasn't going well?

565
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:36,250
What are you saying? He's probably meeting with a friend nearby.

566
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,350
Do you know any phone numbers of his friends?

567
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:44,090
Wait a minute. I will call Jae Seok.

568
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:50,130
Hello, is this Jae Seok? This is Dae Beom's mom. I'm sorry for calling so late.

569
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:53,240
Are you with Dae Beom by chance?

570
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:58,300
No, I am not. I saw him last week, but haven't heard from him since.

571
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,850
Is that so?

572
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:06,800
I'm sorry, but could you call around to see if anyone is with Dae Beom and call me if you hear of anything?

573
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:13,370
Dae Beom disappeared all of a sudden. Please, call me.

574
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:18,590
What do we do, Honey? Where did Dae Beom go? Dae Beom!

575
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:23,300
- Noona, Noona.
- Honey, Geon and I will look for him. You should go home and wait.

576
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,460
No, no, I will find him. Dae Beom! Dae Beom!

577
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:30,370
- Honey!
- Dae Beom!

578
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:34,190
Can you go in that direction? I will go this way.

579
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:36,740
Yes, Brother-in-law.

580
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:40,170

Yes, I won!

583
00:49:54,990 --> 00:50:00,520
Ah, what? Time out for now.

584
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:08,400
Grandma, why do you keep calling me? I told you I was sleeping over at a friend's house tonight.

585
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,370
Mi Rim, did Dae Beom contact you today?

586
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:17,660
No, he didn't. Why? Is he not home yet?

587
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:21,920
It's nothing. Be careful at night, okay?

588
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,730
Yes. Don't worry about me, Grandma.

589
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:31,090
Hey, let's play one more time.

590
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:34,680
- Okay.
- I won't go easy on you.

591
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:50,570
Honey, why don't you sit up? I made some porridge for you.

592
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:55,600
I don't want to eat. I don't even know what happened to Dae Beom.

593
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,620
How could I eat porridge?

594
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:03,510
You have to eat something to gain strength. You will need to gain energy to look for Dae Beom.

595
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:09,990
I'm sure nothing happened to Dae Beom. He will not do something carelessly.

596
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:13,350
Why don't you sit up and have some bites?

597
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,180
What is it? Where are you going?

598
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,290
I can't stay like this. I have to go out and look for him.

599
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:30,080
I get it. Please eat this, and let's go out together.

600
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:36,200
Noona, has Dae Beom called you yet? His phone is still off.

601
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:41,640
Really? Isn't it strange his cell phone is still turned off?

602
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:46,150
It's easy to charge a cell phone anywhere these days.

603
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:51,470
Oh, no, my Dae Beom! What if something happened to him? I have to look for him.

604
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:53,660
Honey!

605
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:56,930
Where would you go to find him? We looked around everywhere yesterday.

606
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:01,190
I have to go somewhere and look for him. Don't stop me!

607
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:03,580
My goodness...

608
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:10,590
You can't just go out without a plan. Get yourself together, Noona.

609
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:14,120
Oh? Is it Dae Beom?

610
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:19,190
- It's Dae Beom.
-  Mom, I will have some time clearing my head. Please don't look for me.

611
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:23,550
I told you, that bastard went to clear his head because he was frustrated.

612
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:26,370
Why are you worrying about him?

613
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:30,030
Seriously, this bastard!

614
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:32,830
The phone of the person you're trying to reach is turned off...

615
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:37,490
He turned it off already.

616
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:42,870
What is it? Did you hear from Dae Beom?

617
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:48,240
This bastard says he wants to clear his head for a while and doesn't want us to look for him.

618
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,200
I told you nothing has happened to him.

619
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,250
I will go out for a bit.

620
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,930
See you later.

621
00:52:55,930 --> 00:53:01,040
Oh, that jerk. Doesn't he know what this is doing to me?

622
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,570
He should have contacted us sooner if that's what he was doing!

623
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:08,150
That crazy jerk. We'll see when he comes home.

00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,270
So, you are going around looking for a job.

644
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:43,830
Yes.

645
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:49,900
I guess you're worried since you have a big family. It's hard to find a job these days.

646
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:56,540
I'm sure I'll find something. There will be a job for me in this big city.

647
00:54:56,550 --> 00:55:01,100
Private Park, why don't you take this over?

648
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:04,200
Pardon?

649
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,670
This business?

650
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:11,480
I'm actually moving abroad next month, so I'm selling it.

651
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,430
I see.

652
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:19,370
Private Park, try it out. We are near a big apartment complex, so there is a lot of floating population.

653
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:22,100
If you run it well, you will do well.

654
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:27,040
If you want to do it, I will forgo premium.

655
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,670
Why would you forgo the premium?

656
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:34,630
You saved my life. How could I charge you a premium?

657
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:38,490
I am alive now because of you.

658
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:44,720
I wondered when I could pay you back, and I finally got the chance.

659
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:51,010
I will talk to the landlord, so all you need is a deposit.

660
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:53,860
How much is the deposit?

661
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:56,990
It's 50 million won deposit and 2.5 million won monthly rent.

662
00:55:56,990 --> 00:56:00,520
You can't find something like this without paying the premium.

663
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:03,450
You should think about it.

664
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:21,720
Right, if I worried about my pride, I would not even have started.

665
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:25,490
It's a matter about my Se Jong.

666
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:34,320
Yes.

667
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:49,060
Chief Jo Noona, I'm sorry.

668
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:52,610
You were very upset because of me yesterday, weren't you?

669
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:54,750
I'm okay.

670
00:56:54,750 --> 00:57:01,280
When I think from your perspective, I can understand.

671
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,850
Chief Jo Noona.

672
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:05,910
I think we were rushing too much.

673
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:11,180
You lost your memory suddenly, and it must be chaotic for you.

674
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:15,640
I did not consider your feelings.

675
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,600
That being the case,

676
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:25,080
let's start from the beginning again. One at a time.

677
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:28,950
Okay.

678
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:32,650
How about a movie today?

679
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:38,590
Our first date was going to a movie.

680
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:43,200
Okay, let's go see a movie. Let's go right now.

681
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,970
Enjoy your time.

682
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:47,420
We'll be back soon.

683
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,960
Are they going somewhere again?

684
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:59,180
I thought they fought at the vacation home, but maybe they made up. They are going to a movie.

685
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,910
Did they fight yesterday?

686
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:04,890
Chairman came back not long after he went to the vacation home.

687
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:11,720
So I called the manager, and he said the Chairman left without even eating the dinner. So I thought they fought.

688
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:14,380
Are you saying they didn't sleep at the vacation house last night?

689
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:17,020
No!

690
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:21,560
Okay, right. It's not the only place they can get together.

691
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:25,510
Ah, my head! I think I have a hangover. Please get me some honey water.

692
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:28,540
- Ah, my head!
- Yes, ma'am.

693
00:58:29,850 --> 00:58:31,590
Ms. Park, are you going somewhere?

694
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:35,760
Ah, yes, I am going to the stationery store.

695
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,430
Okay, see you then.

696
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:11,430
I wish Chairman just get married to Chief Jo soon.

697
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:16,790
That way, I can forget about it quickly as well.

698
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:29,260
It looks like you came here to talk to me about something. Did something happen?

699
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:36,390
CEO Anna. Your invitation for me to go to the US with you.

700
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:40,070
Is that still possible?

701
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:44,890
Of course! It's still valid.

702
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:48,880
I have about six months left in my contract with the Chairman.

703
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:53,460
I can go with you after that.

704
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:57,850
That's great. I have work left to do here during that time.

705
00:59:57,850 --> 01:00:02,290
We can go to the US together after our work is done.

706
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:09,590
Yes. What should I prepare until then?

707
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:15,410
I think you should start studying English. Language is the most important thing when living in the US.

708
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:20,280
And, you can prepare the rest with me throughout the time.

709
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:24,100
Okay, I get it.

710
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:27,830
Ms. Park. You've made a wise choice.

711
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:34,390
I am so excited now that I am going back to the States with you.

712
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:37,790
Thank you, CEO.

713
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:42,080
You don't have to. I'm more grateful.

714
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:49,100
Dan Dan, thank you, thank you. You will go with me, your mother.

715
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:54,700
It's all good. It's all good now.

716
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:05,070
Yes, I'll leave after six months.

717
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:06,730
That's right, Park Dan Dan.

718
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:10,240
Until then, I'll live there for the children.

719
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,490
I'll just do my best with my job.

720
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:20,710
Where are you? Here you are!

721
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:23,380
Go Hee Su! My daughter!

722
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:25,990
Where are you?

723
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:29,320
Are you here?

724
01:01:36,510 --> 01:01:39,150
Were you surprised?

725
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:43,300
You thought I wouldn't know, did you? I knew where you were!

726
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:47,570
Chairman. Say, 'ah.'

727
01:01:49,870 --> 01:01:52,380
I caught you!

728
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:54,670
My wish is to see you do the dog leg dance.

729
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:55,980
Just once, okay?

730
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:58,790
Thank you.

731
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:06,040
You have to give me one, too. Ah.

732
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,580
Mom? What's for dinner today?

733
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:26,340
Chief Jo Noona. Let's comfortably eat by ourselves now.

734
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:30,240
You're all grown up now. You know to be considerate of your dad too.

735
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,340
Mom and Dad. I love you.

736
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:38,140
I love you so much too, Hee Su.

737
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:41,030
What about you, Dad?

738
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,140
I made a promise to Hee Su.

739
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:57,930
That I'm going to stop being sad and tormented now.

740
01:02:57,930 --> 01:03:01,580
If I keep doing that, Hee Su will be sad too.

741
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:09,900
Chairman. Let's go to Seoul Forest and eat pasta and take a walk too.

742
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:13,310
Seoul Forest at night is very beautiful.

743
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:16,230
Oh, my stomach hurts!

744
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:17,990
What's wrong?

745
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:21,660
To be honest, my stomach has been hurting since before.

746
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:24,190
I think I drank too much coke with ice in it.

747
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:27,960
I don't think I can stay out anymore. Let's go home now.

748
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:29,700
Is that so?

749
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:32,970
Yes. Let's go quickly.

750
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:39,340
This is really driving me crazy.

751
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:41,490
What's wrong with me?

752
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:44,610
Chief Jo Noona and I are meant to get married.

753
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:48,070
But whenever I'm with her, it's not fun, and I feel trapped.

754
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:51,530
Seriously, what do I need to do?

755
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:57,710
Chairman? Your door is locked.

756
01:03:57,710 --> 01:04:00,520
Chairman!

757
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,340
Why was your door locked?

758
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:14,430
Take medicine, Chairman.

759
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:16,690
My stomach doesn't hurt.

760
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:18,910
I don't need to take medicine.

761
01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:22,500
Pardon? You were saying your stomach was hurting a lot until just now.

762
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,700
I lied that I had a stomachache.

763
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:28,990
- Chairman?
- I can't do this anymore.

764
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:31,080
Rather than lying and tricking you,

765
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:35,620
I think it's better, to be honest for both of us.

766
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:39,050
What in the world are you trying to say?

767
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:41,720
Say it next time. You look very tired right now.

768
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:46,770
Being with you is so boring and not fun that I lied.

769
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:49,210
But I really hate myself for doing this.

770
01:04:49,210 --> 01:04:53,260
No matter how hard I try, I can only see you as a Noona.

771
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:57,630
So, I can't get married to you, Chief Jo Noona.

772
01:04:57,630 --> 01:05:02,590
We should push back our wedding.

773
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:12,890
What? Chairman, seriously, how could you do this to me?

774
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:21,940
Chief Jo Noona!

775
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:27,200
Chief Jo Noona!

776
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:37,760
That's right... I can't do this anymore.

777
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:45,940
I don't want to live by forcing myself to adjust to others and things I can't even remember.

778
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:51,680
Dad. What's going on that's making you hesitate so much?

779
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:55,090
I'm busy.

780
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,910
All right. I'll say it.

781
01:05:57,910 --> 01:06:00,100
Pay attention, everyone.

782
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,700
My memory got damaged,

783
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:08,040
so everyone from this family knows that I can only remember until I was 22 years old.

784
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,550
So, to me who can't remember anything,

785
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:16,040
I would like for you all not to force anything on me with things I can't remember from now on.

786
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:19,050
What is he saying?

787
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:22,550
Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong. You say you're my children,

788
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:24,610
but I still can't believe it yet.

789
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:29,680
I feel very sorry, but I'm going to think of you all as cute little kids.

790
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:36,790
So, I'd like you all to think of me as just a comfortable Hyung or Oppa you live with.

791
01:06:36,790 --> 01:06:40,070
I really tried to be 41 years old,

792
01:06:40,070 --> 01:06:41,750
but I just can't do it!

793
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:43,910
I'm no longer going to force myself to do something I can't from now on.

794
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:47,550
I'm just going to live as 22 years old!

795
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:50,860
So, nobody can stop me!

796
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:04,730
What is that crazy punk saying?

797
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:13,010
- Let's go!
- Dad. Ms. Park has to go together too.

798
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:16,090
Oh, right! Ms. Park Noona has to go together too.

799
01:07:16,090 --> 01:07:19,830
Ms. Park Noona! Ms. Park Noona!

800
01:07:19,830 --> 01:07:21,720
Yes, Chairman?

801
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,920
Ms. Park Noona, let's go exercise together.

802
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,440
Me, too?

803
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,860
What are you saying? How will I handle three kids by myself?

804
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:31,710
Oh, yes. All right.

805
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:35,650
- Let's go!
- Let's go! Come on!

806
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:38,930
Go! Go! Go! Go!

807
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:47,890
One, two, one, two!

808
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:56,060
Jenny!

809
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:58,500
- Okay!
- Here!

810
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:00,780
Okay. Se Chan!

811
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:02,790
Good job!

812
01:08:02,790 --> 01:08:05,870
- Good job!
- Are you ready? Go!

813
01:08:05,870 --> 01:08:08,410
Okay! Se Jong!

814
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,610
There you go!

815
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:18,020
Nice!

816
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:20,710
Ms. Park Noona!

817
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:30,610
How could you not catch that?

818
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:38,070
- You kids stay here. I'll go get the ball.
- Okay.

819
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:40,720
I'll go with her.

820
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:53,620
The ball is over there!

821
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:17,310
♫ Woo ♫

822
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:22,900
♫ It's a happy day like a dream, yeah ♫

823
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:44,450
♫  A smile blooms in every step  ♫

824
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:49,220
♫ It's a shiny day because of you ♫

825
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:51,210
♫ It's sunshine day ♫

826
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:58,350
♫  Strangely, I'm drawn to you  ♫

827
01:09:58,350 --> 01:10:00,990
♫ Nobody will understand me ♫

828
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:03,630
♫ You're the only one that I was looking for ♫

829
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:06,630
[Young Lady and Gentleman]

830
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:09,680
She could have avoided it. It was like we were drawn to each other like a magnet.

831
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,190
I didn't do that on purpose!

832
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:12,910
- I feel unfair, but--
- What? Unfair?

833
01:10:12,910 --> 01:10:14,650
You have three kids, Chairman!

834
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:17,890
How could you not seal the deal even after going to the vacation home?

835
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:19,670
This won't do anymore! End it. Just end it.

836
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:23,080
Hey, Wang Dae Ran!! You coaxed my daughter, so you take responsibility!

837
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:27,140
I want to stay with you like this, Dae Beom. For our Future.

838
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:29,790
- I have something to say to you.
- Do you have more complaints to make?

839
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:31,310
I was thinking of going to an English academy.

840
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:34,010
It doesn't matter whether you go to an English academy or a math academy.

841
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:35,820
- Park Dan Dan?
- Hyun Bin Sunbaenim?

842
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:37,540
Mistress Ajumma! Have you gone mad!?

843
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:40,370
I can't force myself to marry her when I don't have any feelings for her.

844
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:42,770
You'll end up marrying her anyway when your memory comes back!

845
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:45,560
Get engaged, at least.
