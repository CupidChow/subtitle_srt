1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,180
Chief Jo.
[Episode 18]

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,990
Become my daughter-in-law.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:12,120
Get married to Young Gook.

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,640
Yes, Madam.

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,000
I'll do that.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,250
What are you talking about it? Hey!

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,960
Are you going to lie and get married to someone who doesn't remember anything?

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,110
This is a scam!

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,010
You! Are you trying to create a scam with my daughter?

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,520
To save yourself?

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,510
Chief Jo, do you think this is a scheme?

12
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,780
No.

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,040
I liked the Chairman, and he liked me too.

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,150
Hey, you can't. Sarah!

15
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,210
This is craziness. It's crazy.

16
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,340
Hey, you leave right now. If you're going to say stuff like this, leave.

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,360
Mom, be quiet!

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,470
I said I would do it, even if it's crazy.

19
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,190
Ajumeoni!

20
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,470
Mrs. Yeoju!

21
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,450
Yes, Chairman. Did you call for me?

22
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,710
Why are these bags still in this room?

23
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,260
Did that lady not leave the house?

24
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,010
Are you talking about Madam?

25
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,870
That's... She went out for a moment.

26
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,760
What? Went out for a moment?

27
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,580
She didn't leave?

28
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,980
You said you would take responsibility and make her leave.

29
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,100
Put all these bags outside of the gate.

30
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,010
And if she comes home, don't open the door. Do you understand?

31
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,320
Never mind. I'll do it.

32
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,680
Chairman.

33
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,260
What is it? Why are you blocking me?

34
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,600
Ms. Park, get out the way.

35
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,340
Chairman, I don't think this is right.

36
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,210
What's not right?

37
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,240
Well... besides everything, Madam

38
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,780
is Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong's grandmother.

39
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,120
When this happened last time, it scared the children a lot.

40
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,400
For the children's sake, you shouldn't do this.

41
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,830
Even if Madam leaves, she should say goodbye to the children

42
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,150
and leave on good terms.

43
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,770
Wow, this is ridiculous.

44
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,940
Ms. Park, you are the kid's tutor.

45
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,890
Are you my tutor?

46
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,470
- What?
- Why do you keep nagging me and telling me what to do?

47
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,470
Who do you think you are?

48
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,910
Chairman, calm down.

49
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,660
If you don't know anything, be quiet!

50
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,780
Ajumeonie.

51
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,690
Was the Chairman that rude when he was 22?

52
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,160
He's like a completely different person.

53
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,270
Ms. Park gets on my nerves.

54
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:22,590
She's a tutor to the children, not me. But why does she keep nagging me?

55
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:46,140
Who is that pretty lady?

56
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,890
But why is she looking at me like that?

57
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,770
Is she crying because of me?

58
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,670
What's wrong with her?

59
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,230
Chairman, thank you.

60
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:21,900
Thank you so much for coming back alive.

61
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,590
Who...

62
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,710
Who are you? Who are you to be doing this to me?

63
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,900
He really doesn't seem to remember me. Did he really lose all his memory?

64
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,810
Chairman.

65
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:41,730
It's me, Sarah. Jo Sarah.

66
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:46,060
If something happened to you,

67
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,990
I was going to die too.

68
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,830
But I'm glad you came back safe.

69
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:00,800
Thank you. Thank you so much.

70
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,890
W-Wait.

71
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,290
Who are you?

72
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,650
Why were you going to kill yourself if I died?

73
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,570
Are we...

74
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:23,130
Are we in that kind of relationship?

75
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,390
Yes. Yes, that's right.

76
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:31,080
Chairman, you and I are in a relationship.

77
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,730
We love each other.

78
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:40,140
In love with each other?

79
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,920
Are we?

80
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:54,390
Is that true? Are we really in a relationship?

81
00:05:54,390 --> 00:06:02,060
You really can't remember anything about me as well?

82
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:09,090
Even our promise to get married as well?

83
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,990
M-Marriage?

84
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,850
No way.

85
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,240
Oh, no.

86
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,430
Even if you can't remember anything else,

87
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,230
I thought you'd recognize me.

88
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,510
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

89
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,520
I'm not doing this on purpose.

90
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,760
I really can't remember.

91
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,210
This is driving me crazy.

92
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,040
It's okay. It's okay.

93
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,280
I just need you to stay by me like this.

94
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,310
Let's find your memories together.

95
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,170
I'll help you by your side.

96
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,190
T-Thank you.

97
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:15,330
Was I in a relationship with such a beautiful, sexy, and kind woman?

98
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:18,430
Lee Young Gook, as expected.

99
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:51,460
This is the record that I was doing housework by your side for over five years.

100
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,350
We didn't get married,

101
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:58,420
but I was in charge of everything in this household.

102
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,610
Even finances.

103
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,790
I can see you were an important person to me.

104
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,010
By the way, Noona,

105
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,540
what did I call you?

106
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,050
Noona...

107
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:22,350
In my eyes, you look like a Noona. I'm sorry.

108
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,360
It's okay.

109
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,440
You can call me whatever you want

110
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,230
and do whatever you want for a while.

111
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:36,960
When I was at home, you called me Chief Jo,

112
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,750
because there are many people here.

113
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,620
When it was just the two of us,

114
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,020
you called me baby.

115
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,060
Then, right now,

116
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,600
it's just the two of us, so...

117
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,990
Baby... Noona.

118
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,760
By the way, the wife I was married to,

119
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,290
I was told she passed away two years ago.

120
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,660
Then Baby Noona and I,

121
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,900
we weren't in a relationship since five years ago, right?

122
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:21,120
You and I in an affair? No, it wasn't like that.

123
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,110
Right?

124
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:27,960
That's good. It's not okay to do that if you're married to someone.

125
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,030
The reason I started working at your house

126
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:34,580
was that your wife asked me to.

127
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,820
And we started dating

128
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,600
after she passed away.

129
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,090
When she passed away,

130
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:47,180
you, the kids, and this home,

131
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,310
she asked me to take care of it all.

132
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:56,520
I see. That timing makes sense.

133
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,500
By the way, what's this?

134
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:08,790
This is an allowance given to the Madam.

135
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,040
Was allowance given to that Ajumma?

136
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,600
Who decided that?

137
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,430
Did you give it to her?

138
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:21,050
No, you signed off on all of these. You told me to give it to her.

139
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:25,510
Did I say to give that Ajumma allowance money? This much money?

140
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:29,350
Yes, I followed it because it was your order.

141
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,460
I wouldn't be able to give her money on my own.

142
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,080
Ten million won every month...

143
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,200
Wait, what is this 100 million won used for this month?

144
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Well, that...

145
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,140
That was for Madam to go on a vacation...

146
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,810
What?

147
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:54,760
I gave that Ajumma a hundred million won so she could go on vacation?! This huge amount of money?

148
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,980
I mean, I can't even understand her living in this house with me.

149
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:03,340
Wow, Lee Young Gook, you're crazy! This doesn't make any sense at all!

150
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,820
Chairman.

151
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,850
Yes, Baby Noona?

152
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,060
Chairman.

153
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:20,050
We promised to get married, and I'm always on your side.

154
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:24,500
So I gave you advice whenever there was some incident,

155
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,910
and you usually listened to me.

156
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:34,590
So, trust me again this time, and please hear my opinion.

157
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:37,110
Will you?

158
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,600
What... What is it?

159
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:46,300
Really? Did he really say I can stay in this house?

160
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,340
Yes. But only until Chairman regains his memory.

161
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,130
Also, it's under the term that you won't show yourself to the Chairman,

162
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,290
so when he's home, stay in your room or go out.

163
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:03,030
Okay! It's not a difficult thing.

164
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:10,680
Chief Jo, I knew you could do it. Thank you so much. Good job.

165
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:16,360
By the way, Young Gook wasn't suspicious at all and believed everything?

166
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,450
Yes. I said I lost my phone so I don't have photos, and he just believed it,

167
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:26,130
and when I showed the record of my past household work, he seemed to believe everything.

168
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,440
Really?

169
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,800
Even if he's a bastard, thank goodness he's a naive twenty-two and not thirty years old.

170
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,520
He must've believed without even questioning because he's simple, stupid, and naive.

171
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,740
It's very cute.

172
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,850
Cute?

173
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,590
I guess he's only an asshole to me.

174
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:53,320
By the way, did you ask about my safe?

175
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,950
The gold bars and money that were in my safe. It must be in the safe in the study.

176
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:02,950
Not yet... It's not quite the time to bring that up.

177
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:07,290
Okay, okay. Take it slow. Things in the safe won't just disappear.

178
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:13,610
And when you become the madam of the FT Group, those gold bars are nothing.

179
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,750
Yes, of course.

180
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:22,040
But I'm a bit worried that Chairman will get his memory back.

181
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,210
No, no, that can't happen.

182
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:29,620
Before Young Gook's memory comes back, we should hurry up your marriage.

183
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,780
Yes.

184
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,460
All of you must be guessing already.

185
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:46,230
Starting today, Chief Jo will be working here again.

186
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:52,930
The Chairman is not well, so it's better to have Chief Jo back instead of getting someone new.

187
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:58,220
So, from now on, how should we call Chief Jo?

188
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,560
Excuse me? What do you mean? Chief Jo is Chief Jo.

189
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,620
Well, I guess. It's not like they are married yet, so it's not quite right to call her madam.

190
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:13,240
Okay, for now, let's just call her Chief Jo as usual.

191
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,800
Getting married?

192
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:22,100
Madam, what are you saying? Who is getting married with whom?

193
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:25,160
Well, the thing is,

194
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,090
Chairman Lee and Chief Jo were going to be married originally.

195
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:32,460
They were going to get married after the second death anniversary of Jenny's mom,

196
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,480
but they thought the kids might be shocked.

197
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,430
So they decided to get married a year after, but then they kept going back and forth about it

198
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,370
and gave up on it.

199
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:49,210
Now I understand. That's what happened.

200
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:52,300
So, from now on,

201
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:58,090
treat her like a soon-to-be lady of the house, treat her more respectfully.

202
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,780
What are you talking about?

203
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:07,850
Young Gook and Chief Jo are getting married?

204
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,590
Young Gook didn't say about it before.

205
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,030
Is this the first time you're hearing it?

206
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:19,600
Well, I suppose he might talk about business to you, but he wouldn't tell such an important issue to a non-family member.

207
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,450
No. Something is wrong.

208
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:41,440
Chairman and Cheif Jo were going to get married?

209
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,190
Then, was the Chairman cheating with me?

210
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:51,650
No. Chairman is not that kind of person.

211
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,560
Why did you want to see me outside?

212
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:10,260
It wasn't something I could speak to you about at home.

213
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,840
I am curious about the matter.

214
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:19,120
She's such a vixen. She kept flirting with the Chairman.

215
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,280
She must be shocked. Well, let's hear what you got to say.

216
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,420
I will make sure you won't even think of taking him from me.

217
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:36,690
Well, I heard you and the Chairman promised to get married...

218
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:43,350
Is that true? Madam told us earlier.

219
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:49,760
It is true. But why do you ask?

220
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:57,340
I had no idea about it, and it was a bit unexpected.

221
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:02,480
But if you and Chairman were going to get married, he would've told us about it,

222
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,830
but I never heard anything about that.

223
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:10,390
Why didn't you tell us until now, and now this got brought up?

224
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,700
Also, if you two promised to get married,

225
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:19,850
why did you suddenly quit? I was wondering about a lot of things.

226
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:26,440
Ms. Park, are you interrogating me right now? Are you a detective?

227
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:31,140
No. It is not like that.

228
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:37,560
Okay. Since you're curious, I will tell you everything.

229
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:45,220
To be honest, the Chairman and I liked each other for a long time.

230
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,280
Is that so?

231
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,140
Not long after the late wife passed away, we found out how we felt about each other,

232
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,610
and we promised to get married after her second death anniversary.

233
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,970
But, because of the Chairman's children,

234
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:07,160
he postponed it to after the third death anniversary of his late wife.

235
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,490
You can understand me since you are a woman too.

236
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:17,820
I understand the Chairman's position, but I hated him for not keeping his promise,

237
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:24,610
and so, we fought about the marriage, and I left the house for a moment.

238
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:27,750
I see.

239
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:35,210
But since Chairman was in an accident, I think it's best to get married as soon as possible to stabilize the household.

240
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:39,180
At least for the kids.

241
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:47,170
Ms. Park. I wanted to ask you, would you help me from now on?

242
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:55,500
Yes, of course. I'm sorry, Chief Jo.

243
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,070
I need to buy Jenny's study worksheet, but I forgot,

244
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:03,460
so I have to head out first. I'm sorry.

245
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:17,440
You should've gone after someone in your own league.

246
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:22,100
I'll repay all the same pain you caused me.

247
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:28,860
You made me cry bloody tears, so you shall too.

248
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,750
Was the Chairman cheating on me?

249
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:52,670
How could he do that? When he had someone he was going to marry,

250
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:57,800
why did he hang the handkerchief? Why did he give me a ride on a bike?

251
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,340
Why did he hug me?

252
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:08,550
Why did he say he was happy to have me by his side? Why did he do all that?

253
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:13,210
Was he such a bad person?

254
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:37,070
Se Jong.

255
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:40,570
Chief Jo Ajumma?

256
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,530
Have you been well?

257
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:50,060
I miss you a lot.

258
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:56,380
Se Jong, I, your mom, promised I would be back.

259
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,540
You're making me suffocate.

260
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,810
Sorry. I am sorry.

261
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:07,980
It's because I'm happy to see you after a while.

262
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,040
What are you doing here?

263
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,880
I'm going to work here again. We'll see each other every day.

264
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,590
Ah, okay.

265
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:26,460
Se Jong, since I'm back here,

266
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:31,710
you can tell me anything you want to do. I'll do everything.

267
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,310
Really?

268
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,650
Of course.

269
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:45,010
Arcade games.

270
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:47,880
Arcade games?

271
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,520
Yes. Let's do it.

272
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,660
Really?

273
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,920
I'm excited!

274
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,970
Let's go.

275
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:59,110
Yes.

276
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:08,740
Joon Oh! What brings you here without even a call?

277
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,880
I came to see your face. Also, to bring some of my winter clothes.

278
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,700
We must have perfect telepathy.

279
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:24,020
I was thinking of going to see you because I missed you anyway. How did you know?

280
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:29,050
Mom, I'll come to see you so don't try to visit me.

281
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,590
Even if you come, I won't be able to see you because I'll be busy.

282
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:39,500
Fine. When will you finish all that hard studying?

283
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,150
What is this?

284
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:46,310
It's a present for you. You can't sleep these days so I thought you would need it.

285
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:50,450
Oh my, Joon Oh. Come here.

286
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:54,730
I did good sending you to medical school.

287
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:58,160
I've been feeling achy here and there.

288
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,450
And I've been having hot flashes and can't even sleep at night.

289
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:06,190
You are all I have.

290
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:12,940
Should I try what my son bought for me?

291
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,430
Go ahead, Mom.

292
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:32,090
I don't know if it's because you bought it for me, it tastes sweet like honey.

293
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,660
I'm so touched.

294
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:43,190
Mom, don't be too grateful since I bought this with your credit card.

295
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,480
But still, you bought it because you were thinking of me.

296
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:53,210
Other kids are busy buying things for themselves.

297
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:57,020
My son is truly a good son.

298
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:08,580
If you left medical school, how old are you?

299
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,130
I'm twenty-six.

300
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,090
Me, too.

301
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:18,910
Since we are the same age, should we speak comfortably?

302
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:24,110
- Yes. Let's do that.
- Okay.

303
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:27,270
We are friends now.

304
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:31,040
Yes, friend.

305
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:34,520
Then to celebrate our friendship, let's do cheers!

306
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,430
Yes. Cheers!

307
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,190
The beer is very refreshing.

308
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:47,680
Yes, the breeze is refreshing as well.

309
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,800
It's good. But can I use your bathroom?

310
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,280
Of course. It's right past the door.

311
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,490
Thank you.

312
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:24,620
I will go to the bathroom when I get home. Where is my bag?

313
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:29,400
I'm sorry, I didn't do it on purpose. I mean it.

314
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:32,430
I know. It's an accident.

315
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:36,240
I'll get going.

316
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:52,430
Young Gook and Chief Jo were going to get married?

317
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:56,400
Young Gook never said anything about that.

318
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,540
I don't think this will do.

319
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,290
Madam, did you call for me?

320
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,500
Chief Jo.

321
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:10,410
Don't you think we should get CEO Anna out of the house?

322
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,740
CEO Anna?

323
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,010
If she stays in the house, she might mess up our plan. Think about what happened earlier.

324
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:19,740
She was questioning everything. She's very annoying.

325
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,050
How should we send her away?

326
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:29,160
She is the daughter of the nanny who raised the Chairman, but it's weird that he doesn't recognize her.

327
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,250
I will talk to Chairman about this.

328
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:38,250
That's right, that's right. That sounds nice.

329
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:47,650
I think something is strange. Young Gook and Chief Jo were even thinking about marriage?

330
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:51,130
They didn't seem like that at all.

331
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:53,080
Yes.

332
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,750
Young Gook's memory will come back soon.

333
00:26:55,750 --> 00:27:02,460
When that happens, everything will become clear.

334
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:07,380
Oh, my! What's going on, Young Gook? Why did you come in without a knock?

335
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,050
You said you are CEO Anna, right?

336
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:12,660
That's right. I'm CEO Anna.

337
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:16,250
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes, ask me anything.

338
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:23,370
You said you are the daughter of the nanny who raised me. Is that true?

339
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:28,600
Yes. I'm Ji Young, Kim Jung Sook's daughter. You and I used to—

340
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,940
Are you saying you're Ji Young? Who are you trying to fool!

341
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,220
What?

342
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,420
Leave this house right now. Right now!

343
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:44,810
Young Gook, I'm Ji Young. You might be like this because my face is changed.

344
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:50,350
That's because I got in a big accident in America and had to get surgery on my face.

345
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,350
I don't know why you are living in my house,

346
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:02,240
but besides everything, I can't stand you pretending to be Ji Young.

347
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,330
So I am sorry...

348
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:09,650
No, I have no need to be sorry.

349
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:13,140
I want you to leave the house right now.

350
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:18,120
- Young Gook!
- If it weren't for Chief Jo, it would have been bad.

351
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,920
Are you okay?

352
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,130
Yes, yes. I am okay.

353
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,780
I am sorry.

354
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,890
The Chairman kept asking who you were,

355
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:41,800
so I just said you were someone important for the company.

356
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:49,060
Also, I only told him that you're the daughter of his nanny.

357
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:55,350
I understand. I'll gather my stuff and leave now.

358
00:28:55,350 --> 00:29:02,110
This happened because you stayed too long in someone else's house.

359
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:07,510
Madam, why are you saying that?

360
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:24,590
How can she say she's Ji Young Noona?

361
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:28,020
Does she think I'm stupid?

362
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,750
Why is that woman in my house?

363
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,690
Yes.

364
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:40,760
Chairman, CEO Anna just said she would leave.

365
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:46,190
Really? I did well, right?

366
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:51,970
Yes. It was uncomfortable having her when we didn't know who she really was.

367
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:59,630
You did so well. You are so manly and reliable.

368
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:02,040
Really?

369
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,740
CEO Anna. What brings you here?

370
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:23,420
I wanted to say goodbye.

371
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,630
What are you talking about?

372
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:30,240
I'm leaving the house right now.

373
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,140
Why are you leaving all of a sudden this late?

374
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:39,140
Did the Chairman tell you to leave?

375
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,810
No, no. It's not that.

376
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,990
I want to leave.

377
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:50,690
Because Chairman Lee can't recognize me right now, it's made an awkward situation.

378
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:55,020
The Chairman will regain his memories soon.

379
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,150
That's right. He will.

380
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:02,250
But I'm okay with leaving this house,

381
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:05,360
but it worries me to leave you here alone.

382
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,120
Will you be okay by yourself?

383
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,190
Of course. I'm fine.

384
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,520
Ms. Park,

385
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:23,190
if things get hard here, you can always call me.

386
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:26,910
I'll come to pick you up right away. Let's see each other outside.

387
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:29,840
I'm always on your side.

388
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,550
Don't forget that you always have me.

389
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:37,650
Thank you, CEO Anna.

390
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:41,080
Why am I crying?

391
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,250
I know.

392
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,690
Why am I like this as well?

393
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:55,090
Ms. Park, stay healthy and be well.

394
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:02,030
CEO Anna, thank you.

395
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:11,060
CEO Anna.

396
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,760
What is all this?

397
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,370
I left Chairman Lee's house.

398
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,550
I am going to stay here now.

399
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:22,440
I see. I'll carry that for you.

400
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,600
It's okay. I can do it by myself.

401
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,290
No, it's heavy. Let me do it.

402
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:42,230
Thank you. I keep getting help from you.

403
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:45,030
No, not at all. I'm fine.

404
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:48,570
Whenever you need my help, feel free to call me.

405
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,250
Thank you.

406
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,710
Then, have some rest.

407
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,380
Goodbye.

408
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:04,830
Will Dan Dan be fine without me?

409
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:08,290
Chairman Lee is also in a bad state.

410
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:12,400
Should I have tried to stay there?

411
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,330
Uncle, if you want to take your hands off from the business, go ahead.

412
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,370
I said I could do it by myself.

413
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:06,990
Why are you thinking so much without sleeping?

414
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:10,610
No matter how it goes, I'll do it on my own.

415
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:13,160
Seriously...

416
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,340
You punk.

417
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:23,370
How can you understand the hole in my heart?

418
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:27,730
How could you know?

419
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:45,050
[Pretty Deer]

420
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:53,460
Forget about it.

421
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:07,610
Teddy bear Ajussi.

422
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:16,580
Snap out of it, Cha Geon.

423
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:21,040
That was just a one night's dream.

424
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:24,340
You shouldn't dream about it when it won't come true.

425
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:29,810
What are you doing here in the middle of the night?

426
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,680
It's nothing.

427
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,890
Go in and go to sleep, Mother. I'm going in first.

428
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,060
What?

429
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,600
It's so cold!

430
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:43,900
He couldn't get married until that age.

431
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:48,750
These long, long winter nights must be so boring for him.

432
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:00,650
- Driver Kim, here.
- Yes, ma'am.

433
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:05,300
Ms. Park, I already told Mrs. Yeoju,

434
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,340
but the Chairman and I are going golf,

435
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,120
so take good care of the kids, please.

436
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,290
Yes, I will.

437
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:17,500
By the way, Ms. Park, are you not feeling well?

438
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,750
Did you have trouble sleeping last night?

439
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:22,290
Your face is a bit gaunt.

440
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:26,890
No, I'm okay.

441
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,460
Dad.

442
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,520
Chairman! You look like a college student!

443
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,710
Am I not supposed to look like a college student?

444
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,360
Why? Is it weird?

445
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,900
No, no, it's not weird at all.

446
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:45,430
Chairman, on the way,

447
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:48,950
why don't we take Se Jong to his kindergarten?

448
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,470
Is that okay?

449
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:54,730
Of course. Se Jong's my son.

450
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,410
- Se Jong, let's go.
- Okay.

451
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:04,310
See you later.

452
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:08,530
It's so good to see the three of you leaving together.

453
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:11,850
Have a good day.

454
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:22,820
Wow, it's dope! It's freaking fun!

455
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:26,680
Chairman, you can't say things like that in front of Se Jong.

456
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,360
What? Are you talking about "freaking fun?"

457
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,410
I learned it from Se Jong.

458
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,900
Here, here, Lee Se Jong, you're here! I got you!

459
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,700
Yes! I got third place!

460
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,600
This happiness,

461
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,950
- this moment, I wish it'll last forever.
- Let's play it again! Come in!

462
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:50,970
I hope the Chairman's memory doesn't come back.

463
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,940
Wow, you're so good!

464
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:01,580
I'm sorry. Dae Beom's dad said not unless there's dirt in his eyes.

465
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,810
I wanted to live next to you happily.

466
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:07,240
I'm very sad about it.

467
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,500
Soo Chul's stubbornness,

468
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,410
he gets that from our father.

469
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:14,440
He also can't do something unreasonable.

470
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,840
Sister-in-law, when my friend leaves,

471
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:24,140
let's try to persuade Soo Chul and live together. Okay?

472
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,390
Yes, sister-in-law.

473
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:42,510
Jo Sarah, Jo Sarah, Jo...

474
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:47,060
Sarah will open this to eat food.

475
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,450
And Mi Sook will do that, too.

476
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:52,070
Gosh, I'm in a pickle.

477
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:56,000
Where can I hide this?

478
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,610
I should hide it over there.

479
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:14,100
It's so heavy.

480
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,420
What are you doing?

481
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:25,740
Hey, why are you so surprised?

482
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:28,010
As if you were caught stealing.

483
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:29,980
What? Stealing?

484
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:33,810
Hey, how dare you say such a thing?

485
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:36,320
Why are you getting so upset?

486
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,500
You were so surprised that I was surprised too.

487
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,460
What were you doing on that chair?

488
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:49,660
It's just, you told me to move, so I was cleaning in the kitchen. See if there's anything to throw away.

489
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,970
You don't have to move out.

490
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:55,570
Just stay another year.

491
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:58,460
Really? Can I do that?

492
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,960
My brother said he didn't want to move in.

493
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,680
He takes after my father, so he doesn't like being rude.

494
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,790
I guess he feels like he owes me.

495
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:14,440
Really? Thank you.

496
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,220
But that cabinet looks like it should be closed well.

497
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:21,720
I-I just need to clean it up.

498
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,980
Hey, why are you sweating so much?

499
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,770
It's not like we have the heater on or anything.

500
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:31,900
Well, I'm like this these days.

501
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:36,090
Heat comes up and down. I sweat a lot and cool down...

502
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:40,450
Oh my, that's because you're having menopause.

503
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:45,020
Wait, I'm late. Anyway, that's what I needed to tell you. I'm going to go.

504
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,660
Okay, Mi Sook!

505
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:51,410
Mi Sook! Thank you! You're the best!

506
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:56,010
Oh my, that was scary. That's not the place either.

507
00:40:56,010 --> 00:41:02,530
Where do rich people hide their money?

508
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:10,070
Yes, that's the place!

509
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:17,740
Yes! My life is finally sunny!

510
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:22,420
Now, this... Dear god!

511
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:25,350
Mom and Father, thank you!

512
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:28,120
Oh, my babies.

513
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,280
Now that I think about it, Chairman Lee is my lucky person.

514
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,730
Lucky person! I mean, how could he, at that timing,

515
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:39,130
lose his mind? Oh, my babies.

516
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:43,060
Stay well hidden, okay?

517
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:46,800
I'll cover you, so you can't be seen.

518
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,710
Don't come out no matter what, okay?

519
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,500
Chairman, good luck!

520
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:08,790
I don't have much experience golfing. What should I do?

521
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:11,760
It's embarrassing if I'm bad at it.

522
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,810
Don't worry. Your body must remember it.

523
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:19,770
Forty-one years old Chairman was like a pro golfer.

524
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:22,260
Was I? Was I that good at golf?

525
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,070
You practiced a lot, and I came with you many times.

526
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:29,250
This was one of our date routes.

527
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,800
I see.

528
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,970
I do have a good athletic ability.

529
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,830
Then I'll start.

530
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,700
Good luck.

531
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,590
Nice shot!

532
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,940
Wow, it's freaking dope.

533
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,690
Why am I so good at it?

534
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:07,070
See? I told you. Your body remembers it.

535
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:13,590
Now that I see my body remembers golfing, I think my memory will come back soon too.

536
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:15,120
Yes.

537
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,250
Chief Jo, you go ahead too.

538
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:34,030
Good luck!

539
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,890
Nice shot!

540
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:59,240
It went to the right side too much.

541
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:14,110
Chairman, what's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

542
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:17,370
Is your head hurting?

543
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:23,640
I... think my memory is coming back.

544
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,100
Excuse me?

545
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,970
I think I remember why I got into an accident.

546
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:39,140
Do you remember it?

547
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:55,520
By the way, how should I open the safe in Young Gook's study?

548
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:02,160
Finally, she's calling me.

549
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:07,300
Hey, why did you call me, Se Ryun? Why didn't you just never call again?

550
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,400
Mom, I'm sorry.

551
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,600
Is everything good at home?

552
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:16,900
Actually, your brother--

553
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,420
What's wrong with him?

554
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:24,330
It's nothing. Never mind. It's just that he's really nice to me.

555
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:27,910
I told you not to worry.

556
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:30,960
How's New York? Is it not too cold?

557
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,360
Not yet.

558
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:38,130
Mom, I'm doing well, so don't worry about me.

559
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:40,740
Okay.

560
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,950
Eat many tasty things, shop as much as you like,

561
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:47,510
and have fun hanging out with your friends. Have a good time, okay?

562
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:50,550
Forget about everything that happened here.

563
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:52,070
Okay.

564
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:55,910
Mom, I'm hanging up now.

565
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:04,540
That was close.

566
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:08,420
If Se Ryun comes home and hear Chief Jo and her brother getting married,

567
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:11,670
she would've thrown a fuss because she didn't hear about it before.

568
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,440
I almost ruined the plan.

569
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,470
It's perfect timing that she's in the U.S.

570
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:20,490
That was so close.

571
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:22,260
- Madam.
- Cheif Jo.

572
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,070
- There's a problem.
- What is it?

573
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:26,350
Was there another accident at the golf course?

574
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:30,490
No, not that. I think his memory is coming back one by one.

575
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:33,520
What do you mean his memory is coming back?

576
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,350
He said his head was hurting suddenly at the golf course.

577
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:40,380
So did his memory all come back?

578
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:44,140
Not all. Just the moment of the accident.

579
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:46,410
What if all of his memory comes back?

580
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:49,800
What do you mean what if? We have to hold your marriage as soon as possible.

581
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,450
So he can't back out even if his memory comes back!

582
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:16,770
If the memory was going to come back, I wish all would've come back. Not just that one memory.

583
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:20,490
But what was that handkerchief?

584
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:23,440
Was it important to me?

585
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,840
Yes, come in.

586
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:34,090
Come in. Why aren't you coming in after knocking?

587
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:45,730
Chairman Lee, it's me.

588
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:49,840
Did you not hear that I don't want to see you?

589
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,050
How dare are you in here!

590
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:54,010
Get your face out of here now!

591
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:57,010
I heard about it! Just give me one minute!

592
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:59,970
I have a very important thing to say to you.

593
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:02,880
I don't care if it's one minute or two minutes. Get out, now.

594
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:08,860
I don't know how the forty-one me was, but the current me doesn't want to deal with you even for a second!

595
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:13,450
My god! I know it's hard to believe,

596
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:16,670
but before you got into the accident,

597
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:22,120
we discussed important matters together.

598
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,250
What?

599
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:27,320
Get out now.

600
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,590
No, never mind. Who avoids poop because they're scared?

601
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:33,310
People avoid it because it stinks. I'll leave.

602
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:36,120
Hey! Hey.

603
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,920
It's fine for you to hate me.

604
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,830
But you can't do that to Chief Jo.

605
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,750
What are you talking about?

606
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:51,590
Did I do something wrong to her?

607
00:48:57,030 --> 00:49:00,820
If something happened to you,

608
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:04,770
I was going to die too.

609
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:11,480
But I'm glad you came back safe.

610
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:16,440
Thank you. Thank you so much.

611
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:24,130
She must've loved me so much to think of dying if I died.

612
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:31,120
Chief Jo and I must've loved each other a lot.

613
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,550
Chairman.

614
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:56,170
Did you want to see me?

615
00:49:56,170 --> 00:50:01,090
Yes. I have something to ask you.

616
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:07,280
Chief Jo, I heard that last Christmas Eve,

617
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,510
I proposed to you.

618
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:17,370
How did you know that?

619
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:23,000
Is it important how I know? Why didn't you tell me?

620
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,940
You're confused, and you can't remember anything right now.

621
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:32,470
How could I add to that?

622
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:35,680
I heard everything.

623
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,730
Even when we were dating, because of the people's views,

624
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:44,150
because of the kids, you were hiding in the shadow.

625
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:51,110
I heard how much you sacrificed for my family and me.

626
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,910
I never thought of it as a sacrifice.

627
00:50:56,910 --> 00:51:04,340
And it's enough if I have your love.

628
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:11,410
And I'm grateful just to have you well next to me.

629
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,760
Chief Jo,

630
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:24,590
this Christmas eve, let's do it.

631
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:29,990
Let's get married.

632
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:32,930
Excuse me?

633
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:36,430
Really?

634
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:39,420
A man shouldn't change his words.

635
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:41,850
Chairman.

636
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:28,130
And also, I'll try to care for you more from now on.

637
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:31,080
Please wait just a little longer.

638
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:37,040
Yes, I'll wait more and try harder too.

639
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:53,050
Mrs. Yeoju? Mrs. Yeoju and Ms. Park.

640
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:57,460
Please congratulate me...

641
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:05,800
I'm getting married to the Chairman this Christmas Eve.

642
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:10,160
R-really? M-ma'am?

643
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,310
Congratulations! Congratulations, m-ma'am.

644
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:17,070
Chief Jo! From now on, do I have to call you like this then?

645
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:20,050
'Madam!' Like this?

646
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:27,010
Are you all right, Ms. Park?

647
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:29,260
Did you hurt yourself anywhere, Ms. Park?

648
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:32,070
N-no... I'm fine.

649
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,570
You'll get hurt. I'll do it.

650
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:39,140
Do you know how I felt a little now?

651
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:44,240
But this still isn't enough.

652
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:11,600
[Letter of resignation]

653
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,890
Ms. Park?

654
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:22,540
I suddenly have some personal issues...

655
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:26,330
I'm really sorry.

656
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:33,250
Ms. Park! If you suddenly quit like this, what are the children going to do?

657
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:36,750
What are the personal issues?

658
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:42,000
I'm sorry, that's...

659
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,440
Well, all right then. If you have a problem, I can't do anything about that.

660
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,520
I'll report it to the Chairman. You can leave.

661
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,630
Okay...

662
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,590
Wow, it's insane! It's crazy!

663
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:09,500
It's freaking fun!

664
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:12,260
Yes, come on in.

665
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,820
Chairman?

666
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:20,280
What is it? Did something happen?

667
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,030
There's something I have to report to you.

668
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:25,200
What is it?

669
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:29,710
Ms. Park said she's quitting starting today.

670
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:33,320
Should I process her letter of resignation?

671
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:37,410
Is that so? You handle it then, Chief Jo Noona.

672
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:40,410
Then we'll have to find a new teacher.

673
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:43,470
You take care of that too, Chief Jo Noona.

674
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:46,610
Okay, I'll do that.

675
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,090
Take my lethal move!!

676
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:52,060
Oh, yeah!

677
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,480
Combo, combo!

678
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:02,340
- Mom! Mom!
- What?

679
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:04,110
W-What is it?

680
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,550
What is it?

681
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:08,010
Oh, h-h-hey...

682
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:12,320
- Mom...
- Yes?

683
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,220
The Chairman proposed to me.

684
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:20,020
The Chairman asked me to marry him this Christmas Eve!

685
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:23,450
- Is that real?
- Yes!

686
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:26,710
It's real, of course!

687
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:32,010
But... getting married is good,

688
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:37,140
but what if Chairman Lee's memory comes back? What if everything goes down the drain?

689
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:40,780
Mom, I've already hit rock bottom.

690
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:45,390
Even if it goes wrong, it won't be worse than that. It won't hurt to try.

691
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:47,420
But still, Sarah...

692
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:52,640
Mom! Don't you understand what it means for me to get married to the Chairman?

693
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:56,430
I will become the Madam of FT Group!

694
00:56:56,430 --> 00:56:59,400
You'll become FT Group owner's mother-in-law!

695
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:04,590
You don't want to become the mother-in-law of FT Group, Mom?

696
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:10,360
Mom, don't worry.

697
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,920
Everything will work out.

698
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,590
Ms. Park, that woman said she's quitting too. Nothing is standing in our way now.

699
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:20,020
Mom, we have to go no matter from now. We have to go straight ahead.

700
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,450
There's no turning back now.

701
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:27,030
Yes, go no matter what. Let's go straight forward.

702
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:30,100
There is no turning back!

703
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:31,920
- Go, go!
- Go!

704
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,370
Go!! Yes, go!

705
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:35,130
Yes!!

706
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:41,370
Why did you gather us, Ms. Park? What bomb are you going to drop on us?

707
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:45,050
I'm a little nervous about this...

708
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:48,690
What is it, Ms. Park?

709
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,520
Jenny.

710
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,390
Se Chan.

711
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,440
Se Jong.

712
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:03,770
I...

713
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:09,760
I won't be working here starting today.

714
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,640
Why, Ms. Park?

715
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:17,940
I've come across a situation where I have no choice...

716
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:23,900
I'm so sorry for suddenly quitting like this.

717
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:27,230
What are you saying all of a sudden, Ms. Park?

718
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:28,920
This doesn't make sense!

719
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:32,890
Don't lie, Ms. Park!

720
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:34,630
Ms. Park...

721
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:38,330
It's chaos since our dad can't even remember us right now.

722
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:41,640
What are we going to do if you quit too?

723
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,630
You can't do this to us, Ms. Park.

724
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:47,010
I'm sorry.

725
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:50,560
I'm so sorry.

726
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,640
At least tell us the reason.

727
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,580
What's the situation?

728
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:59,590
Ms. Park... this is a lie, isn't it?

729
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:03,230
You're joking, right?

730
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,350
I'm sorry.

731
00:59:06,350 --> 00:59:08,880
I'm so sorry.

732
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,870
Please understand me...

733
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:13,530
Ms. Park.

734
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:16,050
Ms. Park!

735
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:18,890
Ms. Park!

736
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:24,670
Dad! Dad!!

737
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:28,350
Ms. Park!

738
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:30,240
- Dad!
- Dad!!

739
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,690
Dad!

740
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:34,460
What is going on?

741
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:36,390
What is it? What? Did something happen?

742
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:41,360
Dad... Please stop Ms. Park from quitting.

743
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:48,360
If Ms. Park isn't here, I won't eat...

744
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:52,380
I'm not going to go to kindergarten either.

745
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:57,860
I won't listen to you either, Dad.

746
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:03,190
Dad, even if you're 22 years old right now, you can still do this.

747
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:05,150
Please stop our teacher for us.

748
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:07,530
We need our teacher!

749
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:10,210
Dad! We're begging you.

750
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:14,120
Please don't let Ms. Park leave!

751
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:19,930
You're acting like this because Ms. Park Noona is quitting?

752
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:21,190
Yes...

753
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:25,900
Dad, please just let our teacher stay at our house.

754
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:28,430
Please.

755
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:39,510
Kids... I'm sorry.

756
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:43,570
I didn't know that Ms. Park was such an important person to you guys.

757
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:45,020
I'll apologize to you.

758
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:49,750
I think I handled the problem undemocratically without even hearing your opinions.

759
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:52,950
Do you guys really need Ms. Park?

760
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:55,230
Yes.

761
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,600
All right.

762
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:04,120
Your dad will try to solve this!

763
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,610
Stop crying!

764
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,910
Yes, come on in.

765
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:29,300
Ms. Park Noona... Are you packing your bags to leave?

766
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,180
Yes.

767
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:36,640
But Ms. Park Noona... I don't think you can quit.

768
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:42,680
I heard that my letter of resignation was processed.

769
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:48,100
Oh, that... I processed that without looking into it properly.

770
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:51,670
So I think I'll have to cancel it.

771
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:55,730
What are you saying?

772
01:01:55,730 --> 01:02:00,230
As you know, because I lost my memories, I don't really know the current situation.

773
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:04,490
So, I didn't know that my kids liked you this much.

774
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:07,030
You said you would quit,

775
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:10,940
and then Chief Jo Noona said she'd find a new tutor, so I just said yes without thinking much.

776
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:14,570
But that was because I didn't know very well, so I'll cancel it.

777
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:17,930
Ms. Park Noona. I'm going to cancel processing your letter of resignation.

778
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:23,370
Please just stay with the sense of duty of taking care of my kids.

779
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:28,740
Chairman. I'm sorry,

780
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:32,880
but please just process my resignation.

781
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:37,430
I wasn't going to take it this far.

782
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:40,510
I have no choice.

783
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:44,700
I looked into the contract, and you signed a one-year contract.

784
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:48,110
But you haven't even stayed for six months, and you didn't tell us beforehand.

785
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:51,700
Saying you're going to quit all of a sudden is clearly a violation of your contract.

786
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:53,680
But if you still insist on leaving right now,

787
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:57,950
I'll have to handle things legally through our lawyer.

788
01:02:57,950 --> 01:02:59,510
What did you say?

789
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:02,400
Did you say you're going to handle things legally?

790
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:07,720
I didn't want to be stiff like this, but since my kids said they need you and want me to hold you back no matter what.

791
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:10,000
So I don't have a choice.

792
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,120
I'm sorry, but please fulfill your contract period.

793
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:17,620
It seems like you're doing this because you got a better offer elsewhere. I'll give you more starting this month.

794
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:21,530
I'm not quitting because of money.

795
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:26,900
Ms. Park Noona, you know about this.

796
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:30,300
Since I lost my memory, I'm confused, and I don't know anything.

797
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:35,390
But if you quit in the midst of all this, then what are my kids going to do?

798
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:40,200
I only think those three are my kids because people are telling me they are.

799
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:43,330
But honestly, I still can't believe it.

800
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:49,010
So I'm asking you to stay until my memory returns, at least.

801
01:03:49,010 --> 01:03:53,900
Please, help me out just once.

802
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:56,700

Should I call the lawyer?

804
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:12,370
Kids! Ms. Park is going to stay longer.

805
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:16,850
- Your dad solved the problem!
- Wow!!

806
01:04:16,850 --> 01:04:21,420
Also, the fact that I handled things undemocratically without even hearing your opinions.

807
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:23,860
I'll apologize for that. I'm sorry, kids.

808
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:30,340
From now on, with anything that concerns you all, I'll discuss it with you and make a decision.

809
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:37,470
What is that? They don't even hear me out.

810
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:41,140
Do they like Ms. Park Noona that much?

811
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:44,920
Ms. Park!!

812
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,500
Ms. Park, thank you so much.

813
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,110
You said you were going to quit because you had a situation.

814
01:04:50,110 --> 01:04:53,890
But thank you so much for saying you'll stay because of us!

815
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:59,450
Ms. Park. I'll make sure I won't cause trouble from now on, and I'll listen to you well.

816
01:04:59,450 --> 01:05:01,500
Thank you, Ms. Park.

817
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:04,350
I won't cause any trouble either.

818
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:06,000
I'm sorry, kids...

819
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,050
But I didn't say I was quitting because of you!

820
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:13,430
I'm really sorry...

821
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:21,120
What am I going to do from now on? What do I do?

822
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:30,070
I guess Ms. Park Noona has been really good to the kids.

Yes, it's me, Chairman. Why are you calling me at this hour?

Chief Jo Noona!

Cancel finding a new teacher.

Ms. Park Noona has decided to stay for the time being.

Chairman?! What are you saying?

846
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:50,420
Why? Did Ms. Park say she can't leave?

847
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:54,260
That's not it. She said she'd leave, and I was barely able to make her stay.

848
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:57,420
Ms. Park Noona is someone very important to the kids.

Why didn't you tell me that?

850
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:07,110
Anyway, Ms. Park Noona is going to stay as the teacher. So finding a new teacher is canceled.
