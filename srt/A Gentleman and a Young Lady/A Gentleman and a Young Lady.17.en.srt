[Episode 17]

2
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,960
What? It was a dream.

3
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,210
What kind of dream is that vivid?

4
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,960
Why would I have a dream like that? It's unpleasant.

5
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:12,230
[Ms. Park]

6
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,940
The person you are trying to reach is unavailable...

7
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,820
He's not answering the phone.

8
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,150
Did he leave it on silent because he's in the mountain?

9
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,920
Why? You should've called after I was dead.

10
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,280
You called your brother, and only now you call me?

11
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,360
I was so worried about you!

12
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,330
I'm at Incheon Airport.

13
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,420
I'm going to New York. I'm about to get on the plane.

14
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,800
What? New York?

15
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:57,230
Why are you leaving? You didn't do anything wrong. Why?

16
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,160
I'll come back after I clear my head.

17
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,210
If it were you, would you want to stay in Korea?

18
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,990
How could you leave me alone? If you want to go, leave with me.

19
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:13,570
I'm about to get kicked out by your brother. He told me to leave the house.

20
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,710
Oppa decided to let you stay.

21
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,060
So he won't do anything to you.

22
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,800
Really? Is that true?

23
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,480
Yes. I asked him to.

24
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,260
So don't worry about anything.

25
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,640
I'll call you when I figure things out. Okay?

26
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,890
Se Ryun.

27
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:41,130
Don't get any foolish ideas, okay?

28
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,450
Breaking this marriage was a good thing.

29
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,510
If you did a wedding with that jerk, what would have happened?

30
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,750
This was help from Heaven.

31
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,250
Mom, I'm hanging up. I have to get on the plane.

32
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,520
Hey, Se Ryun. Se Ryun!

33
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,960
What should I do? Poor Se Ryun.

34
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,770
Seriously...

35
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,320
Apologize? Compensate for psychological trauma?

36
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,110
Who is the one that should be receiving an apology?

37
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,240
Who is the one that should be receiving compensation for psychological trauma?

38
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,100
This is ridiculous. After inviting everyone,

39
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,230
who is the one that made a mess of the wedding?

40
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:35,070
How did you raise your daughter that she could run away at her wedding?

41
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:38,180
They say whoever smelt it dealt it, don't start with me when you're the one who's done wrong!

42
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,230
He hid a pregnant woman and was thinking of getting married to someone else!

43
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,380
Who said she was pregnant?

44
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,940
Did you see that she was pregnant?

45
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,450
Also, it's fine to date someone before getting married. Did your daughter not date anyone before?

46
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,750
Should I look into it?

47
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,150
I've never seen such a vulgar woman!

48
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,030
What? Vulgar woman?

49
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,630
You're just a mistress,

50
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:05,220
and you should be bowing to me for even allowing you to be an in-law.

51
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,430
But how dare you?

52
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,810
What?

53
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,240
A mistress?

54
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,080
How dare you--!

55
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,740
How dare you--!

56
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,890
Are you leaving?

57
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,470
Yes. I'll be back.

58
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,230
Honey, one second.

59
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,340
You should answer what I said yesterday before you leave.

60
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,020
What should I tell sister-in-law?

61
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,320
I'll tell her we are moving into that house.

62
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,690
I told you we can't.

63
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,310
Why not? Why?

64
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,410
She told us to move in.

65
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,940
If you don't want to, we will go without you then.

66
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,390
What?

67
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,800
Who are you to go there? Are you out of your mind?

68
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,680
Why are you yelling?

69
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,660
She said she wants to live next to her little brother

70
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,570
and asked me to convince you to agree.

71
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,160
Should I tell her you don't want to?

72
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,860
And, what's wrong with owing your sister?

73
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,590
Why are you being so selfish?

74
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,520
Why do you think only from your perspective?

75
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,170
Dae Beom's chicken skewer business got screwed.

76
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,350
At least the house should be nice for him to feel motivated.

77
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,980
What motivation would he get from living in a crappy house like this?

78
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,880
Do you think that makes sense?

79
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,100
Why doesn't it make sense?

80
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,210
If you don't want to move into that house,

81
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,570
go get a loan for Dae Beom and Geon's business.

82
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:27,310
They were screwed because they were doing business out of a conked-out truck.

83
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,730
What?

84
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,920
Honey!

85
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,710
The number you are trying to call is turned off. Please leave a message after the beep.

86
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,930
He should have been back from the mountain by now.

87
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,690
Did he go to a mountain far away from the city?

88
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,820
Oh, Chairman...

89
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,160
He should've charged his phone first.

90
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,630
He doesn't think about me worrying about him.

91
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,080
We'll see when he comes back.

92
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,320
I should've ordered a little later. It won't be delicious if the ice melts...

93
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,420
I'm home.

94
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,870
Was everything okay today?

95
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:35,600
Yes. Did you eat? Should I set up a meal for you?

96
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,070
It's late. I already ate something, don't worry about me.

97
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,210
Why is Lawyer Koh calling me at this hour?

98
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,040
Yes, this is Anna.

99
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,310
I'm sorry to call at such a late time.

100
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,290
No, it's okay. Go ahead.

101
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:57,490
I have an urgent business-related thing to talk to Chairman Lee about, but his phone's been off.

102
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,050
Are you at his house by any chance?

103
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,270
If he's home, would you ask him to call me?

104
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,660
Chairman Lee? One second, please.

105
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,560
Is Chairman Lee home?

106
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,260
No, not yet. He went to a mountain early this morning,

107
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,350
but he hasn't come back yet, so I was just wondering about it.

108
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,220
Chairman Lee went to a mountain?

109
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:25,060
Yes. He never did this without calling first, but I just assumed he was meeting someone for dinner.

110
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,830
Lawyer Koh?

111
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:32,350
Chairman Lee went hiking early in the morning, but he's not home yet.

112
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,930
Did he go to a mountain early in the morning?

113
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:39,980
And you're saying he's not home yet?

114
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,960
- Yes.
 - And he is out this late without even calling?

115
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,630
He rarely does this.

116
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:51,930
CEO, do you think something might have happened to him?

117
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,270
What do you mean by that?

118
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:58,270
Do you mean an accident?

119
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,590
I'll look into it and call you back.

120
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:06,560
Before that, if he comes home, please call me.

121
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,450
Okay. Please let me know.

122
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,630
Did he say the Chairman might have been in an accident? What do we do?

123
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,960
Oh, my arm! Why is my arm hurting so much?

124
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,310
Mrs. Yeoju, steam some mugwort rice cake. I think I didn't eat enough for dinner.

125
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,370
Rice cake is not the issue right now, Madam! There's a bigger issue!

126
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,130
Chairman went climbing a mountain early in the morning, and we couldn't get in touch with him,

127
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:31,510
and we think he might have been in some accident.

128
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:36,060
Don't overreact! His phone's battery must be out.

129
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,670
I hope that's it.

130
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,910
It didn't rain or snow today. How can he get in an accident on a clear day?

131
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,140
Also, there are so many people in the mountains these days.

132
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,930
If there were an accident, we would've gotten a call already.

133
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,430
That's true.

134
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,950
Stop worrying and just steam some mugwort rice cake for me.

135
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,480
Put some generous amount of honey in it, too.

136
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,800
I hope there's nothing happened, and just his phone's died.

137
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:21,070
I'm so full because I drank two strawberry lattes.

138
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,840
I'll call him one last time.

139
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,590
The number you are trying to call is turned off. Please leave a message after the beep.

140
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,450
What happened to him?

141
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,300
Did he lose his phone on the mountain?

142
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,830
Or did something happen to him?

143
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,780
No, no. What could happen?

144
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:51,780
He probably forgot our plan and went home first.

145
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,910
That's right. Let's go home first.

146
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,190
What? Young Gook still hasn't called?

147
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,450
No.

148
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,050
That's weird.

149
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:11,510
Did something really happen to him?

150
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,120
My goodness, what happened?

151
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,300
I'm back.

152
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,650
Ms. Park, where were you until now? You left the kids by themselves.

153
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:24,150
Have you contacted Young Gook today?

154
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,030
What? Today? No.

155
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,010
I went to see a friend.

156
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,150
Today is Ms. Park's day off.

157
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:37,090
Ms. Park only has two days off a month. She should see her friends at that time.

158
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,970
These people, seriously...

159
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,960
If she goes out to see her friends on her day off, she must not have been dating Young Gook.

160
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,400
Did I misunderstand?

161
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:53,080
That's right. They have a huge age gap. Unless Young Gook is crazy, he won't date someone like her.

162
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:58,660
But did something happen? Is the Chairman not home yet?

163
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,100
No. He went to the mountain and isn't back yet--

164
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,050
Still?

165
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,280
Yes, Lawyer Koh.

166
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,510
What did you say?

167
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:20,250
What? What did Lawyer Koh say?

168
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,690
Yes. Yes, I understand.

169
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,660
If there's anything new, please give me a call right away.

170
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,440
Yes, I get it. Thank you.

171
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,920
Why? What did Lawyer Koh say? Tell us!

172
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,170
They think Young Gook got in an accident while hiking.

173
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:43,830
They caught the last phone signal near the top of the mountain,

174
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,680
and after that, there's no trace of him...

175
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,820
An accident? What should we do?

176
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,550
He has young kids! What should we do now!

177
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:59,790
Madam, please watch what you say.

178
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,050
Nothing has happened yet.

179
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:05,590
Nothing will happen to Young Gook.

180
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,310
Oh my?

181
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,350
Why is she acting like that? What did I do?

182
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:13,100
Does she think she's this house's madam?

183
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,310
It's ridiculous.

184
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,720
Darn it.

185
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,810
I'm hungry.

186
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:52,880
Why is it so dark? Where am I?

187
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,040
What is this?

188
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,950
Is this blood? Why?

189
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,470
Why am I bleeding?

190
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,630
Where am I?

191
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:21,210
Oh my God! Mom!

192
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,680
Mom!

193
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,180
I fell asleep for a short time,

194
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,850
and it's already night?

195
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,450
What? Who are you?

196
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,840
Grandma.

197
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,950
- Please give me some food.
- What?

198
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:52,530
Please help me.

199
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,880
I'm hungry.

200
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:13,500
How long have you been starving?

201
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,800
No one is going to take it away, so eat slowly.

202
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,680
Okay.

203
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:24,360
But do you really not remember anything?

204
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:33,290
No. Not even my name or age.

205
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,420
Or where my house is.

206
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,670
I don't remember anything.

207
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,900
Then after you eat,

208
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,940
let's go to the police station.

209
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:49,190
If you walk for 30 minutes, there's a police station. I'll go with you.

210
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,010
No, Grandma!

211
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:54,430
We have to go to the police station to find out who you are

212
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:57,280
and be able to meet your family.

213
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,030
Grandma.

214
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,660
I'll do everything you ask,

215
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:07,120
so please wait a few days until my memories come back.

216
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,180
Instead, I'll do anything.

217
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,510
Okay.

218
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:20,490
But you have to work for your food. It's not free!

219
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,470
Of course, of course.

220
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:26,400
I'll work for my food. Just tell me to do anything.

221
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,220
Okay. Eat as much as you want first.

222
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,380
Yes.

223
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:47,130
Our Chairman will be fine.

224
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:52,440
His phone battery died, that's all.

225
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:58,170
Right, Mr. Moon?

226
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:03,670
Our Chairman is fine, right?

227
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,910
He's safe, right?

228
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,540
Did I get into an accident while hiking?

229
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:20,520
Or did I do something bad and hide in the mountain?

230
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,660
No.

231
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:26,570
I'm not a bad person.

232
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:33,770
But what am I doing here alone?

233
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,990
Who am I?

234
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,470
Young Gook!

235
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,780
Mr. Lee Young Gook!

236
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,230
Young Gook!

237
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,270
Mr. Lee Young Gook!

238
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,440
Chairman!

239
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,760
Here, we found Mr. Lee Young Gook's backpack.

240
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,510
Okay. Leave it right there.

241
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,770
The person you are trying to reach is unable to take your call at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep.

242
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,020
It's impossible to get a hold of her on the phone!

243
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,690
Shouldn't she tell me if she arrived safely?

244
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,610
It's chaos here since her brother is missing!

245
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,260
Wait a minute.

246
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,130
If something really goes bad with Young Gook, then what's going to happen?

247
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:26,900
What about the company? The house?

248
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,650
Jenny and Se Chan are too young to take over the business.

249
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:36,150
And they can't just hand over the management to someone else.

250
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:39,990
Should I step up?

251
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,180
Madam, Madam!

252
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,120
My goodness! Don't you know how to knock?

253
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:49,330
I'm sorry. Madam, they found the Chairman's backpack.

254
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,160
Did they find the backpack? What about Young Gook?

255
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,040
Nothing about the Chairman yet...

256
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,250
They have to find the person! What's the use of finding just the backpack!?

257
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,040
Oh, god! The smell!

258
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,460
Shouldn't a machine do this?

259
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,160
Why does this have to be done by hand?

260
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,160
Do it well.

261
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,630
If you don't do it right, there's no food for you.

262
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:21,090
Grandma! You're making a big deal out of food.

263
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,310
If you don't like it,

264
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,960
you can go to the police station with me instead.

265
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,730
Okay, I got it.

266
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,780
Get out of my way, cow.

267
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,380
Why did you poop so much?

268
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,980
Grandma! Grandma! Grandma!

269
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,990
What is it?

270
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,430
Did my cow runaway or something!?

271
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,980
No, Grandma, that's not it!

272
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,590
I remembered who I was! I'm relieved!

273
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,100
What?

274
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,880
Do you remember who you are?

275
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,500
Then tell me, what is your name?

276
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,570
My name is Lee Young Gook.

277
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,870
Lee Young Gook!

278
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,850
My name is Lee Young Gook.

279
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:42,380
My name is Lee Young Gook!

280
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,950
I'm going to go like this!

281
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,450
I'm going to go home!

282
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,510
I think we should ask Se Ryun to come back home right now.

283
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,620
As a Chairman proxy.

284
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:00,140
We can't leave the Chairman's seat empty, can we?

285
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,120
Calm down, Madam.

286
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,940
Right now, it's more important to find Chairman Lee than worry about that.

287
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:13,010
The company has Executive Director Han and also the presidents' board members. So don't worry about it.

288
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:18,810
Lawyer Koh, how is our FT Group made?

289
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:24,390
Se Ryun's father, who passed away, worked very hard to build up that company, don't you think so?

290
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:28,450
If so, shouldn't Se Ryun be in the seat if there's a problem with the Chairman?

291
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,310
Why are you mentioning Executive Director Han and the presidents' board?

292
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:35,290
What rights do Executive Director Han and the presidents' board have?

293
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:40,570
Madam. How can you speak so thoughtlessly?

294
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:43,900
It hasn't been that long since Young Gook went missing.

295
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,150
Are you thinking something went wrong with Young Gook?

296
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:51,800
Is that why you're worried about the company and the Chairman seat more than about Young Gook?

297
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,760
Listen, CEO Anna!

298
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,910
How dare you speak like that!?

299
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,240
Are you saying I want Chairman Lee to be dead?

300
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,860
Is that what you mean?

301
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,470
Chairman Lee is going to be okay. He'll be fine.

302
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:06,810
So you don't have to worry about the company.

303
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,870
Look here, CEO Anna.

304
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,230
Our family is hanging by a thread,

305
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,840
like a candle in front of the wind.

306
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,090
We have to prepare for the worst, that's what I mean.

307
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,640
So can you, an unrelated person, get out of our business?

308
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,530
Stop meddling in other people's business.

309
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:28,540
How dare you keep saying "we," and get involved in this when you're a total stranger?

310
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,930
What are you doing in broad daylight?

311
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:44,550
Mom, did you buy anything tasty?

312
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:48,810
Mom, sit here and drink with me.

313
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,600
How long are you going to be like this?

314
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,600
Mom.

315
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,470
My life...

316
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:04,810
is a failure.

317
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,520
What's the use of living like this?

318
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,030
Mom, I'm...

319
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:15,140
I'm hopeless.

320
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:21,210
How could you say that in front of your mother?

321
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:26,470
Mom, should I bring Se Jong back now? At least, just him?

322
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:31,820
If I bring Se Jong, you and I can raise him together, and the three of us can live together.

323
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:37,150
Then I think I'll have hope to live again.

324
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,040
Sarah...

325
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,620
Sarah.

326
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,720
What would you do if you did bring Se Jong?

327
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,430
We can't even move because we don't have money.

328
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,220
We are about to live in a half-basement apartment,

329
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:57,330
but do you still want to bring Se Jong?

330
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,960
Life as a rich man's son in that house,

331
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,160
life as the son of FT Group, is better.

332
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:07,090
Jo Sarah! Jo Sarah, please! Snap out of it!

333
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:12,180
You can start a new life again!

334
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,250
Se Jong... I'm going to go get Se Jong.

335
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,480
She's out of her mind!

336
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,390
If I catch you, you'll...

337
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,430
Hey!

338
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,650
Ms. Park, are you worried about something?

339
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,360
No.

340
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,990
Ms. Park, you look worried.

341
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:46,290
Talk to me. I'll help you.

342
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:49,740
I have no concerns. It's okay.

343
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,210
By the way, when will my dad come home?

344
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:56,710
He didn't even tell me he was going on a business trip.

345
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:59,760
He doesn't answer even if I call either.

346
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:06,780
Maybe the call doesn't go through because he's abroad. He'll be back soon.

347
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:11,620
Se Jong, do you want to play a game? It's been a while.

348
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,470
Oh, yeah!

349
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,250
Let's go.

350
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,460
Let's go.

351
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,200
Se Jong.

352
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,140
Get yourself together, Sarah!

353
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,840
No, Sarah. You can't do this.

354
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:33,190
Let's leave him to live life like that.

355
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,630
He's a weird Ajussi.

356
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,600
Let's get off.

357
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,560
What a weird Ajussi!

358
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,610
Weird Ajussi?

359
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:48,160
Are they saying that to me?

360
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:53,920
I can't believe it. Why am I Ajussi?

361
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,120
Did I hit my head in the mountains?

362
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,990
It's weird.

363
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:04,120
Everything is weird.

364
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,710
I feel like I'm in the far future.

365
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:13,340
I should just get home as soon as possible.

366
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,980
If I get home, shower, and sleep for a bit, I'll feel better.

367
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,550
I must be shocked from going to the mountain.

368
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,570
Wait.

369
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:31,510
What's wrong with my house gate?

370
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:35,310
When did this change?

371
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,430
This is my house.

372
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,950
Who is it?

373
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,950
Chairman?

374
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:50,000
Why are you calling me Chairman?

375
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,430
It's me. Why isn't the door opening?

376
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:56,200
Hurry up and open it!

377
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,330
Okay, okay.

378
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:59,450
Who is it?

379
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:03,680
The Chairman! The Chairman is here!

380
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,570
Dad!

381
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:09,090
Dad's back?

382
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:13,530
Is this not my house?

383
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:16,000
I think this is my house...

384
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,900
Why is everything so weird?

385
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,130
- Dad!
- Dad!

386
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,230
- Dad!
- Dad!

387
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:31,450
You startled me!

388
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:37,350
What's up with you guys? Why are you doing this?

389
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,940
Dad, what's wrong?

390
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:43,190
What? Dad?

391
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,370
What are you saying?

392
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,690
Am I you guys' dad?

393
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:53,460
It's ridiculous. I'm a bachelor! I didn't even get married!

394
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,780
Chairman.

395
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:03,110
Young Gook, why are you doing that to your kids?

396
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:10,340
Koh Jung Woo? What are you doing at my house?

397
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,710
Your face is weird, by the way.

398
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,690
You're dressed like an Ajussi too.

399
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:21,690
What's wrong with you? Did you eat something wrong? Or did you hurt your head in the mountain?

400
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:24,630
Why are you at my house, Ajumma?

401
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,870
What's wrong with him?

402
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:28,570
Ajumma, who do you think you are to be at my house!

403
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,960
Oh, my!

404
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:36,090
Who is it? Who let this woman in my house?

405
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,910
Who brought her here without consulting me!

406
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:40,010
Oh my, he must be crazy!

407
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:43,390
My mom died because of you!

408
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,460
Did my father ask you to come here?

409
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,430
Father!

410
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,810
Young Gook, Young Gook!

411
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:52,470
Young Gook!

412
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:57,280
What's going on with my dad?

413
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,400
Dad's scary!

414
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,380
It's going to be okay.

415
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,820
Father! Father!

416
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,880
Where are you, Father?

417
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,180
Father!

418
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,500
What's wrong with my father's room?

419
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:39,400
This isn't your father's room anymore. It's your room now.

420
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,640
I never changed rooms with my father.

421
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,150
What's going on right now?

422
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:53,290
Young Gook. Do you know who I am?

423
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,940
You're...

424
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,530
You're Koh Jung Woo. Koh Jung Woo.

425
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:00,630
You've been my best friend since high school.

426
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:04,990
Yes, that's right. I'm Koh Jung Woo.

427
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:10,540
Then, how old are you now, Young Gook?

428
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,600
How old?

429
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,040
We're twenty-two.

430
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,930
Young Gook, have a seat first.

431
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,940
Young Gook, look closely at me.

432
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,770
How do I look?

433
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:36,740
Do I look twenty-two to you?

434
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,370
Koh Jung Woo, did something happen to you?

435
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:43,110
You got so old in a few days.

436
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:47,670
What's up with your clothing too? Why are you like an Ajussi?

437
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:51,580
Young Gook. I'm not twenty-two.

438
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,600
I'm forty-one.

439
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,850
What?

440
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,500
Forty-one?

441
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,370
What are you talking about? Stop joking around.

442
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:05,450
Listen to me. Young Gook, you are forty-one too.

443
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:08,670
And the kids who called you dad earlier.

444
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:14,320
Those kids are your kids, who you love the most in the whole world.

445
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,520
Why are you doing this to me?

446
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,320
Why are you speaking gibberish?

447
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,570
I think your memory is a bit off right now

448
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:26,240
from an accident you got in while hiking in the mountains.

449
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,410
What?

450
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:30,760
Lee Young Gook. You're forty-one,

451
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:36,710
and you have three kids. And you were married before.

452
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,620
Was I married?

453
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,640
To whom?

454
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:48,240
Can't you remember Ms. Young Ae as well?

455
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,800
Your wife.

456
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,600
This is driving me crazy.

457
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,190
Who is Ms. Young Ae?

458
00:32:56,190 --> 00:33:00,530
Then where is this woman that I supposedly married?

459
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:07,060
Ms. Young Ae died two years ago.

460
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,480
From an illness.

461
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,130
Koh Jung Woo. Are you pulling my leg?

462
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,750
The woman who I was married to is dead,

463
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:20,170
but I have three kids?

464
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,890
Young Gook. Let's go to the hospital first.

465
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:29,020
No. I don't want to talk to you anymore.

466
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,240
I want to talk to my father.

467
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,240
Where's my father?

468
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,310
Is he at the office?

469
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,840
Young Gook.

470
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:44,420
Your father is at nowhere.

471
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:50,680
What's that supposed to mean?

472
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,870
Are you saying...

473
00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:00,240
Your father died only after a few days since you got married

474
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,190
from pancreatic cancer.

475
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:13,740
My father...

476
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:17,230
Did he pass away?

477
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,480
My father?

478
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,470
Yes.

479
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:28,800
That can't be true.

480
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:31,460
No way.

481
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,290
My father's not dead.

482
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:37,440
My father's not dead.

483
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,690
That's not possible. No way.

484
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:44,960
My father's not dead. Hey, my father's not dead.

485
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,500
But why is my father's room like this? Jung Woo, why?

486
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:53,420
Jung Woo! Hey!

487
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:57,910
My father isn't passed away, right? Right?

488
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,010
Tell me!

489
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:06,150
All I did was be an asshole to him!

490
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:19,190
Why is this tree so big?

491
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:24,800
Do I really have amnesia?

492
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,530
When my father planted this tree,

493
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:31,880
it was as tall as me.

494
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:37,270
I can't believe my father passed away...

495
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,530
My mom passed away too.

496
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,490
What am I supposed to do by myself?

497
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,490
Chairman!

498
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:03,160
Chairman. Did you get your memory back?

499
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:09,390
Do you remember tying the handkerchief to this tree?

500
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:14,190
Who are you, Noona?

501
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:20,480
Mrs. Yeoju told me earlier.

502
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:26,820
You're Ms. Park, who came to be a tutor to the kids, right?

503
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,220
Yes.

504
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:39,050
I'm Ms. Park. Park Dan Dan.

505
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:41,560
Chairman.

506
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:49,020
Do you not remember me, nor this tree?

507
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,500
I'm sorry,

508
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,570
but I can't remember anything, so stop asking if I remember things.

509
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:02,150
If I remember, I'd say I remember!

510
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:05,000
Do you even know how it feels like not to remember?

511
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,280
Why is everyone asking if I remember!

512
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,780
It's annoying.

513
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,800
Chairman...

514
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:26,000
It's okay. It's okay.

515
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,330
Chairman came back alive.

516
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,650
That's all that matters.

517
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:34,240
It's okay even if he doesn't remember me.

518
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,480
Since he came back safe,

519
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,790
I'm grateful for that.

520
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:12,150
Wait a minute!

521
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,690
Please take this to eat.

522
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,680
What is this?

523
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,060
It has Samgak Kimbab, chicken leg, milk, salad, this and that in it.

524
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:28,890
You only eat a cup-ramen every day, you should eat a variety of food.

525
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:36,110
Do you want to eat together?

526
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,350
This place is so great.

527
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:54,860
My dream is to live by myself too.

528
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:58,220
I'm jealous.

529
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:02,840
I just wanted to live alone, so I left.

530
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,240
Mi Rim, who are you living with?

531
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:13,830
I live with my grandmother, aunt, uncle-in-law, uncle, and cousin.

532
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:17,450
Your family is big.

533
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:21,580
But where are your mom and dad?

534
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:29,160
When I was ten, they both passed away in an accident.

535
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,120
I see.

536
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:42,020
My dad passed away when I was ten, too.

537
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:51,660
I can eat this in one bite without stopping.

538
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,970
That's a lie.

539
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:58,360
I am not lying. It's real.

540
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,890
Then, do you want to wager if I can eat this in one bite?

541
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:03,550
Shall we bet 10,000 won?

542
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,690
Sounds good.

543
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:07,360
If you fail, you have to give me ten thousand won.

544
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,420
Okay!

545
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,630
I'm leaving this as evidence. You can't change your words if you lose.

546
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:16,050
Who do you think I am? Get the money ready.

547
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:18,600
Okay! Ready.

548
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,890
Wait a minute!

549
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:23,030
Go!

550
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:29,390
Are you really eating?

551
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:32,180
Awesome!!

552
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,740
Are you really eating all of that?

553
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,310
He's really funny.

554
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:48,250
How can he eat without even biting into the noodle once?

555
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,970
Awesome! It's really crazy.

556
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:54,470
That's really crazy!

557
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:57,850
What is making you laugh so much?

558
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:00,240
Eat some sweet potato.

559
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,040
Is it pumpkin sweet potato?

560
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,740
It's a chestnut sweet potato.

561
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:08,550
Grandma, you know I don't like chestnut sweet potatoes. It chokes me.

562
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,300
You can eat it a lot, Grandma.

563
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:15,190
Have one bite, still.

564
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:19,160
Grandma, you always do this, even I said I didn't want to eat it.

565
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,580
It's a number I don't know.

566
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:38,280
Dae Beom, I'm sending this text in case you're worried about me. I'm in America right now.

567
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,950
I'm okay, so don't worry about me.

568
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:47,070
Please be well, and I hope you be happy.

569
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:50,500
I'm really sorry.

570
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:59,350
Oh, my goodness. Huh?

571
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,690
Sokcho night beach lady!

572
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:05,600
Teddy bear Ajussi!

573
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,920
Ajussi, come and sit here, please.

574
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,160
Come here and have a drink.

575
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,140
Come on.

576
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:20,400
Ajussi!

577
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,000
Who is it?

578
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,450
He is my friend.

579
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:25,330
You came again, handsome young man.

580
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:27,340
Yes.

581
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,100
Did you call me Teddy bear Ajussi?

582
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:37,170
You look cute and nice, like a teddy bear.

583
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:42,660
It's the first time I've heard that I'm cute after hearing from my mom.

584
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:49,020
Here. Teddy bear Ajussi, have a drink.

585
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:01,390
Why are you drinking alone again today?

586
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:06,150
Today, everything is over.

587
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:10,320
So to celebrate ending everything,

588
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:14,710
I should have a drink.

589
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:19,550
Well, if you end it, you have to drink.

590
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:29,100
I really ended everything today.

591
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,420
It feels so freeing.

592
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:38,160
I'm not sure why I didn't end it and just dragged it out all this time.

593
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,500
It's good that it feels freeing.

594
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:45,340
I feel so relieved. So relieved!

595
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:50,550
It's so freeing. Very freeing!

596
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:52,650
Cheers!

597
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:55,600
Drink slowly, drink slowly.

598
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:03,670
Eat some food too. Why are you only drinking alcohol when you're so skinny?

599
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,090
Teddy bear Ajussi!

600
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:13,830
Let's have one more, just one more drink.

601
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:16,580
I said I'd pay for it.

602
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,730
Today's an ending celebration.

603
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:20,990
Sokcho night beach lady.

604
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:23,640
Stop drinking for today. You can't drink anymore.

605
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,590
You're already drunk.

606
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:27,940
I called a taxi. It'll be here soon.

607
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,500
Let's go.

608
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:40,400
I'm not sure

609
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,720
if my heart feels free

610
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:50,920
or if it's in pain, Ajussi.

611
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,970
You said you felt free after ending it.

612
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:11,690
Why are you crying?

613
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:18,880
I thought I felt free after ending it.

614
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:25,930
But it's just because my heart has a hole,

615
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:34,230
so the wind is going through.

616
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:54,910
Someone will fill that hole with hard cement for you.

617
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:59,580
So don't cry.

618
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:05,550
The taxi will be here soon. I'll take you home.

619
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:08,190
Let's go.

620
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:17,460
Ajussi.

621
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:22,630
Can you stay with me tonight?

622
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:30,590
I wish someone could be by my side today.

623
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:53,910
Why does he have to be back to twenty-two?

624
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:56,810
Young Gook was a bastard at that time.

625
00:46:56,810 --> 00:47:01,460
That was the time he hated me the most, like an angry boar.

626
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,880
What should I do?

627
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:10,520
If he's going to revert, he should have reverted to a baby. Why does it have to be 22 years old?

628
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:12,570
Oh, my goodness.

629
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:18,270
Ajumma, I'm going to the hospital. In the meantime, leave the house.

630
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:20,090
Did you understand?

631
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:21,150
What?

632
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:24,630
Who's fault is it that my mom passed away?

633
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:30,640
It's because of you! So if you have a conscience, you can't live here.

634
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,380
Chairman Lee?

635
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:39,390
Young Gook, we took care of all our past a long time ago.

636
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:42,380
That's why I'm still living in this house!

637
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:44,890
You must not remember that--

638
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:48,060
Who do you think you're fooling with your bullshit!

639
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,110
What?

640
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:52,510
When I'm back from the hospital, you'll be gone, so let me say my farewells first.

641
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:56,130
Goodbye forever. I told you for sure.

642
00:47:56,130 --> 00:48:01,970
When I'm back, you'll leave this house and be gone.

643
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,610
So, did you see something?

644
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:27,530
When will my son come back to his normal self?

645
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:30,570
He's not your son.

646
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:33,570
You don't have a son.

647
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:38,150
Do I have to give birth to call them my son? The son I raised with my love is also my son.

648
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:41,350
- The love from raising them is said to be bigger.
- You didn't even raise him!

649
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:43,600
He's still my son!

650
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,320
So, when will my son

651
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:50,620
get his memory back and calm his temper?

652
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,210
Ajumma.

653
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:55,400
You have a lot of sin.

654
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,620
You have to pay for your sins.

655
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,490
I didn't sin.

656
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:04,600
I didn't do anything wrong!

657
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,420
The sin of stealing someone else's possession!

658
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:09,190
The sin of breaking other's heart!

659
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:13,400
Do you still think you didn't sin?

660
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:19,410
This is why you're losing your hut's grains.

661
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:22,630
Ajumma, don't worry about your son,

662
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:25,890
and instead, worry about yourself.

663
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:28,170
What a fraud!

664
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:30,560
I don't need this! I don't!

665
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,990
Seriously!

666
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:36,770
Ajumma, keep your shed safe!

667
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:43,160
How can they make my daughter miserable when she devoted her youth to that family?

668
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:50,650
Today I'll get the money back that Dae Ran's mom took from my mom.

669
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:55,660
In her safe, she has a heap of gold and money.

670
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:59,340
I won't let her get away with saying she doesn't have money today.

671
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:01,270
I might even sue her!

672
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:04,980
Sue her! Sue!

673
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:17,940
Ajumma, I told you not to worry about me.

674
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,900
Madam's not answering her phone.

675
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,880
She'll come home at some point.

676
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,640
Don't worry about me, and go about your business.

677
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,940
Please, have some tea.

678
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:41,660
Today, until she says she'll lend me money, I won't leave a step out of this house.

679
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:46,230
Over there, she has a heap of gold and money.

680
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:48,780
How can she say she doesn't have any money?

681
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:52,940
A human can't be like that.

682
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:31,430
Oh my, what did I just...

683
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:33,840
What did I just do?

684
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:37,030
I am crazy! I am crazy!

685
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:40,450
No, I shouldn't do this.

686
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:48,190
Three, six, nine...

687
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:53,640
Why are only the three, six, nine buttons worn out?

688
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:57,620
Is her password is three, six, nine?

689
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:02,850
Three, six, nine.

690
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:09,850
Of course, it wouldn't be it.

691
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:13,420
Wait, maybe it's that.

692
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,730
Three, six, nine, three, six, nine, three, six, nine.
[T/N: Korean game where you clap on multiple of three.]

693
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:21,590
Three, six, nine, three, six, nine.

694
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:26,860
Oh my!

695
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:30,990
I-It really was three, six, nine, three, six, nine.

696
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:33,010
Oh my god, she's crazy. Crazy!

697
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:36,950
Why is she so simple and stupid!

698
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:39,920
My god, this girl...

699
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:46,610
I... really...

700
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:51,190
I... really didn't do anything.

701
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:54,480
It just opened up last time, and this time as well!

702
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,470
Why is it keep opening easily?

703
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:09,670
This is the god's sign, telling me to take it.

704
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,590
If I have this, Sarah and I,

705
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:16,760
we can start anew.

706
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:22,090
Yes! This is what my mom lost.

707
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:25,010
My Sarah, who devoted her youth to this house,

708
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:27,030
it's her life fee too!

709
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:28,730
Oh, dear god!

710
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:34,370
Oh, dear god...

711
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,570
A-Ajumma.

712
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:15,710
Mrs. Yeoju.

713
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,330
Yes?

714
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:24,600
I just... I didn't feel right staying in the empty room by myself.

715
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,850
So let Dae Ran know when she comes home that I left after waiting for her.

716
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:31,440
You said you wanted to wait until Madam comes home.

717
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,140
I forgot I had to go to the bank.

718
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:37,650
Thank you for the tea!

719
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:42,330
She says she'll wait, and then she says she's leaving.

720
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:45,240
She keeps changing her mind.

721
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:54,260
This is a wealthy household,

722
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:58,670
so there must be security cameras all over the place.

723
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:02,210
So I should walk calmly like usual.

724
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:03,870
Stay calm.

725
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:05,880
Stay calm--

726
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,480
I can't drop this.

727
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,860
It's gold.

728
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:17,250
Dollar.

729
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:19,360
The smell of dollars is special.

730
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:23,870
Let's see. They say if you bite gold, it dents.

731
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:25,410
It's true!

732
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:28,590
Wow, so many gold bars!

733
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:31,610
What is this one?

734
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:37,770
How could a diamond be...

735
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:41,130
It's so sparkling! It's dazzling.

736
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:45,140
Why is the diamond so big?

737
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:48,410
Is it fake?

738
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:50,020
It won't be.

739
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:55,380
She wouldn't keep a fake one in the safe so securely.

740
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:01,390
It fits perfectly.

741
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:02,930
It feels amazing.

742
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:05,660
- My head hurts.
 - Gi Ja.

743
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:09,060
Gi Ja, are you in there?

744
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:12,860
What should I do?

745
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:20,070
I guess she's not home.

746
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:23,010
Are you not in there?

747
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:25,700
Gi Ja.

748
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:34,530
Why is this here!

749
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,490
What is that sound?

750
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:44,940
Did I hear wrong?

751
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:57,560
My goodness...

752
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:06,230
Oh, my goodness.

753
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:10,930
Oh, my mom and father.

754
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:17,940
Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong.

755
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:20,480
Your dad is a little sick now.

756
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,030
All of you know that, right?

757
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:32,820
He just lost his memory for a moment.

758
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,070
Dad seems like a stranger.

759
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:38,120
His face looks the same.

760
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:46,940
Ms. Park, if our dad never remembers us, what should we do?

761
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:50,790
That won't happen.

762
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:56,320
Your dad loves you all so much.

763
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:59,210
He will definitely get his memories back.

764
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:03,280
So, for him to regain his memories faster,

765
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,210
why don't we help him?

766
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:10,410
If we help him, he can get his memories back.

767
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:13,240
Is it true?

768
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,850
Yes.

769
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:20,440
Shall we all work together to help your dad to regain his memories?

770
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,910
Yes.

771
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:24,800
Okay!

772
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:28,860
Lee Jenny, Lee Se Chan, and Lee Se Jong gather up!

773
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,120
You all understand what state I'm in right now, do you?

774
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:43,800
Yes, we know that you reverted to 22 years old.

775
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,250
That's right. You're smart.

776
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:51,130
I can't remember right now, but I am your dad,

777
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:54,230
so let's be close with each other.

778
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:56,270
Okay.

779
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:58,940
I will try my best,

780
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:01,880
so I ask you all to help me.

781
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,060
Yes.

782
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:05,380
On that note, how do you feel about having a unity tournament?

783
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:07,790
A unity tournament?

784
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:13,650
Usually, playing games helps you get closer. Do you guys have any games you play?

785
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:20,060
You guys are too young to have gone on school trips or freshman orientations.

786
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:22,720
That's where you learn good games.

787
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,900
I'll just teach you. You guys know how to do multiply, right?

788
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,950
Do you guys know the "three, six, nine game?"

789
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,780
Don't you know that popular game?

790
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:43,140
Okay. If you guys take after me, then you must be smart. I'll teach you.

791
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:44,510
This is how you play it.

792
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:47,080
Three, six, nine, three, six, nine. Three, six, nine, three, six, nine!

793
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,610
- One!
- Two!

794
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:52,110
- Four!
- Five!

795
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:53,670
Seven.

796
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:55,100
Eight?

797
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,300
Nine!

798
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:59,210
Dad, you got it wrong!

799
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:01,330
Why are you guys so good at playing games?

800
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:03,120
Here, hit me.

801
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:06,400
Indian bob!

802
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,820
We'll see when you lose.

803
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:09,590
Let's do it again!

804
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:12,440
Three, six, nine, three, six, nine. Three, six, nine, three, six, nine!

805
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:15,560
The atmosphere of the house is so different!

806
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:19,560
How can it be so full of joyous!

807
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:29,890
Kids, I have something to talk about with this elder, so go upstairs for a moment.

808
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:33,120
Ms. Park, please repeat the kids the three, six, nine game.

809
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,710
When I finish talking, we will play again.

810
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:35,910
Okay.

811
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:37,700
Let's go upstairs, everybody.

812
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:40,410
Okay.

813
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:43,140
Why did you stop?

814
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:47,470
It was a lovely mood. Why don't you play more?

815
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:53,220
Ajumma, did you already forget what I said?

816
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:57,150
I told you to leave this house before I come back from the hospital.

817
01:00:57,150 --> 01:00:59,510
Why do you keep telling me to go?

818
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:01,910
Young Gook, I'll be good to you.

819
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:05,920
No need. I thought you would be like this, so I packed for you.

820
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,000
What?

821
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,040
So you can take those bags and leave right now.

822
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:13,780
I can't live with you. And you know that too, right?

823
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:15,050
So please leave now.

824
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:19,170
I don't have anywhere to go. This is my house now!

825
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:21,290
What did you say?

826
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:24,000
Did you say this house is your house?

827
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,510
Ajumma, have you lost your mind?

828
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:29,670
Leave right now!

829
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:34,180
Okay, I will.

830
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:47,710
That jerk. Even if he reverted to 22 years old and went back to that bastard again,

831
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:51,140
but how could he be like this to me?

832
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:54,970
That's right. If I don't leave this house, he will probably kill me.

833
01:01:54,970 --> 01:01:57,090
I have to go. I'll leave.

834
01:01:57,090 --> 01:01:59,480
I'm leaving.

835
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:12,370
What is this? Where did it all go?

836
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:15,710
My gold, my money, and my ring.

837
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:18,320
Where did it all go?

838
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,210
Three, six, nine, three, six, nine. Three, six, nine, three, six, nine!

839
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:26,620
Three, six, nine, three, six, nine. Three, six, nine, three, six, nine!

840
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:30,990
Did that bastard pack these as well?

841
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:36,140
My ring.

842
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:41,470
That bastard. That bastard!

843
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:47,190
Why didn't you bring out your bags?

844
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:50,300
Do I really have to chase you out?

845
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:53,870
Okay, I get it. I'll leave!

846
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:58,180
But you have to give that to me. You have to give that to me for me to leave, Young Gook.

847
01:02:58,180 --> 01:02:59,540
What?

848
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:03,320
The things that were in my safe, the things you took. You have to give them back!

849
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:06,740
Young Gook, those are things I built up my whole life.

850
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:10,050
That's all my fortune. Give it back to me, Young Gook.

851
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:13,010
What is this Ajumma talking about? What safe?

852
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:16,360
That is my lifeline, Young Gook!

853
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:19,110
Why are you acting like this? Please, Young Gook!

854
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:21,680
Why are you talking nonsense?

855
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:24,030
Have you lost your mind?

856
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:28,160
I don't even want to talk with you, so leave now.

857
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,330
Are you not leaving?

858
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:32,570
You jerk. How can you pretend that you don't know?

859
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:36,430
Hey! Are you taking revenge on me because I took your father from your mom?

860
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:39,880
Is that why you're kicking me out empty-handed?

861
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:42,970
I can't leave like this. Should I leave and become a beggar?

862
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:46,590
You jerk. I'm not leaving over my dead body!

863
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:49,500
Ajumma! Ajumma!

864
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,460
Ajumma!

865
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:53,750
What is going on?

866
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:56,200
Open the door!

867
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,850
I said, open the door! Ajumma!

868
01:03:58,850 --> 01:04:01,450
Get out right now. Right now!

869
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:05,120
Ajumma! Ajumma!

870
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:08,030
Dad, what's wrong?

871
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:14,470
Ms. Park. I told you to take the children upstairs. Why did you come down?

872
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:15,680
Yes, yes.

873
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:18,090
Jenny and Se Chan, let's go upstairs.

874
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:19,680
Quickly.

875
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:23,520
Chairman, calm down. You'll scare the children.

876
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:27,790
I'll talk to Madam well.

877
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:31,890
Then, you take responsibility for this.

878
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:45,010
What should I do?

879
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:48,220
What do I do?

880
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:53,720
That's right. That's my only way to survive.

881
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:57,950
That's the only way.

882
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:03,400
I've gone crazy. I've gone crazy.

883
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:09,160
What did I do?

884
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:13,070
What should I do now?

885
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:17,140
She's probably going to report it to the police.

886
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:20,710
And their surveillance camera probably has footage of me leaving the house.

887
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:24,100
What if I get arrested for stealing?

888
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:27,060
If I become an ex-convict and get marked as one,

889
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:30,530
Sarah will become a daughter of an ex-convict.

890
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:36,560
What should I do?

891
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:43,030
Should I just throw all of these out? What should I do with it?

892
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:47,960
Should I throw all of it away?

893
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,210
Who is it?

894
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,330
She must have found out that I stole her safe.

895
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:05,460
What should I do?

896
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:07,710
Mom, what is it?

897
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:09,700
No, don't open the door.

898
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:10,870
It's Madam.

899
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:12,520
No, don't open it.

01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:15,710

Madam, what's wrong?

904
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:28,080
Chief Jo. Save me, Chief Jo.

905
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,990
I'm getting kicked out of that house.

906
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:34,180
The only person that can save me is you.

907
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:37,390
Madam, what are you talking about?

908
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:39,020
What's the problem?

909
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:41,420
Young Gook, he...

910
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:44,910
He became a twenty-two-year-old bastard!

911
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:49,510
What? What does that mean, the Chairman became 22 years old?

912
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:54,010
He got into an accident in the mountains, so he can't remember anything.

913
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:59,430
And he reverted into 22 years old bastard again and treated me so rudely.

914
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:03,840
What should I do, Chief Jo? Please save me.

915
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:06,290
- Excuse me?
- That bastard!

916
01:07:06,290 --> 01:07:09,810
He took all the fortune I worked so hard to save up!

917
01:07:09,810 --> 01:07:14,060
My gold bars and cash in my safe, he took it all!

918
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:16,810
And then he said I should leave the house.

919
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:18,690
What should I do? Please help me.

920
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:22,450
Save me, Chief Jo. What should I do?

921
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:31,350
What is this? I'm the one who stole it all. What nonsense is she talking about right now?

922
01:07:31,350 --> 01:07:36,420
Does the Chairman really not remember anything?

923
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,020
That's what I said!

924
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:40,190
He doesn't remember his kids. He doesn't know anything!

925
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:43,620
He doesn't even remember his father died. He just completely reverted to 22 years old!

926
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:46,580
And he wants me to leave the house.

927
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:50,560
Chief Jo, if you help me stay in this house,

928
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:55,300
I'll do whatever you want.

929
01:07:55,300 --> 01:08:00,910
Madam, I was kicked out too. What could I do?

930
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,970
Chief Jo.

931
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:08,460
You were in love with Young Gook.

932
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:11,680
You were going to marry Young Gook.

933
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,920
Don't you remember?

934
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:20,180
Hey! Don't you remember what you did to Sarah and me?

935
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:23,950
What do you think you're doing, speaking such nonsense?

936
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:27,380
Sarah just managed to get over him.

937
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:29,430
Get out.

938
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:32,590
If you get kicked out of that house and become a beggar,

939

For the kids, you can't do this.
