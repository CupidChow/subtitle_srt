00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,140
[Episode 41]

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,450
That one looks great on you!

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,610
Wear these glasses, too!

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,500
One, two, three!

5
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,560
Yes, Chairman.

6
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,760
Ms. Park.

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,900
I'm very sorry this late at night.

8
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,720
But could you come here just once more?

9
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,420
Pardon?

10
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,310
Right now?

11
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,560
Se Jong is very sick.

12
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,390
He's asking for you.

13
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,580
Is Se Jong sick?

14
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,080
Dan Dan, where are you going this late at night?

15
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,310
Something urgent came up.

16
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,980
I will be right back.

17
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,480
Are you going to see that man?

18
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,300
No, Dan Dan.

19
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,350
I will come back soon.

20
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,340
- Dan Dan.
- Dad, please don't do this.

21
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,770
Se Jong is sick. He's asking for me.

22
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,210
No. Please don't go, Dan Dan.

23
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,360
- Dad, let go of me. I have to go.
- Dan Dan!

24
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,600
Oh my, what's going on?

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,470
- My goodness.
- What's going on?

26
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,270
What's going on at this late at night?

27
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,730
What's going on with Dan Dan and Soo Chul?

28
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,050
I don't know.

29
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,460
Dan Dan!

30
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,100
Dan Dan!

31
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,020
Ms. Se Ryun.

32
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,210
Ms. Park, thank you for coming.

33
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,720
Oppa is with Se Jong, so I came out instead.

34
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,650
Please hurry.

35
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,210
I heard that Se Jong is sick.

36
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,870
What's wrong with him?

37
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,540
- Is he very sick?
- He suffers from separation anxiety.

38
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,030
- Separation anxiety?
- Yes.

39
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,540
Since Se Jong had to say goodbye to you abruptly,

40
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,090
he got psychological trauma.

41
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,790
He can't eat anything since he keeps throwing up.

42
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,990
And he can't sleep at night.

43
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,130
Really?

44
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,220
Oppa didn't know what else to do.

45
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,570
That's why he called you.

46
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,980
Se Jong said if you read him a children's storybook,

47
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,120
he could fall asleep.

48
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,920
We are truly sorry.

49
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,600
No, don't be. Let's go inside.

50
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,350
601.

51
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,480
602.

52
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,010
603.

53
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,540
Ms. Park!

54
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,040
- Se Jong.
- Ms. Park.

55
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,510
Is it really you?

56
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,200
I'm not dreaming, am I?

57
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,840
It's really you, right?

58
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,470
Se Jong, you are right. It's not a dream.

59
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,980
I came because I heard you were sick.

60
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,660
Are you very ill? How are you feeling?

61
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,750
After you left,

62
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,850
I was so sad.

63
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,950
I didn't feel like eating.

64
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,480
And I couldn't sleep as well.

65
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,310
Se Jong. If you are like this,

66
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,380
it makes me very sad.

67
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,050
It makes me heartbreak.

68
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:09,560
If you are sick like this, how can I leave?

69
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,140
I'm sorry, Ms. Park.

70
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,980
No, no.

71
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,780
I am really sorry.

72
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,960
Se Jong, I'm sorry.

73
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,690
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,010
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,920
I'm sorry...

76
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,550
I'm sorry, Se Jong.

77
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,120
I'm sorry, Ms. Park...

78
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,830
What kind of commotion is this late at night!

79
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,540
It's very upsetting.

80
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,760
Se Jong.

81
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,260
There was a reason why I had to quit.

82
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,470
You know that already, right?

83
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,120
Yes.

84
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,030
I know.

85
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,810
But, Ms. Park.

86
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,400
Even though I know,

87
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,040
without you here,

88
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:35,520
I couldn't swallow the food and couldn't sleep.

89
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,500
Se Jong. We are not saying goodbye forever.

90
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,490
We will meet again.

91
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,590
Do you remember what I told you on our farewell trip?

92
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,880
That I will be back in three years.

93
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,450
Since you didn't die,

94
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,430
you didn't go to heaven,

95
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,900
so you will come back for sure, right?

96
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,650
It's for sure, right?

97
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,960
Of course. Of course, yes.

98
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:12,890
I was scared you wouldn't come back like my mom.

99
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:22,300
No, Se Jong. I will be back.

100
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,970
I'll definitely come back.

101
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,700
Ms. Park...

102
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,970
Then, pinky promise.

103
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,490
I promise.

104
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:49,150
Since we promised,

105
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,950
you have to eat well,

106
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:57,110
sleep well, and stay strong.

107
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,680
Can you promise me that, Se Jong?

108
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,550
- Promise.
- Yes.

109
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,910
I promise you.

110
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:12,890
I'll also eat well and stay strong. Okay?

111
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,590
Mr. Se Jong, please slow down.

112
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,060
If you eat like that, you could get indigestion.

113
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,030
It tastes so good.

114
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:35,190
And I have no problems anymore.

115
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,170
Do you want to try marinated beef too?

116
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,300
It's delicious.

117
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,570
That's amazing.

118
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:53,440
He couldn't keep a spoonful of food down and look at him now.

119
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,820
Dr. Kim was right.

120
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,300
Mom, there is no time to be looking in the mirror. Let's go.

121
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,480
- Hurry up!
- Why are you making this fuss?

122
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,770
Did something good happen?

123
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,310
We have to watch it before it's over.

124
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,040
It's my debut today.

125
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,650
The drama I am in will air shortly.

126
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,500
Are you saying you will be on TV?

127
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,420
Yes, I told you so! Even though I don't have any lines.

128
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,500
But it's an action scene where I jump over a wall like this.

129
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,590
Oh, my goodness.

130
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,890
Okay, my son's debut stage.

131
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:43,010
- I will go and watch it with you.
- Hurry up, and let's go!

132
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,020
Mi Rim, please come with us if you're not busy.

133
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,030
We could share some beer too.

134
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,130
Yes, Niece-in-law, if you have time, please come with us.

135
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,490
Yes.

136
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,460
- Let's go.
- I will be there as soon as I finish cleaning.

137
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,150
Hurry, hurry.

138
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,360
I will hurt everyone who hurt me.

139
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,830
I won't die.

140
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,480
Joon Oh, how come you are not on?

141
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,480
Didn't you say there is a scene of you running away?

142
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,320
That's strange...

143
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,500
It's today's episode, for sure.

144
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,220
But the drama is over.

145
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,750
Are you sure you filmed for this show?

146
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,760
I think my scene was edited out.

147
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,080
What? Edited out?

148
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,250
I told you so. I said this is not what you should be doing.

149
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:51,140
Please don't try to do acting anymore. Okay?

150
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,780
You should go back to your school. Go back to your school!

151
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,190
You're upsetting me.

152
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,020
Have a good night, Niece-in-law.

153
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,060
Hey...

154
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,270
We came home after going all around our neighborhood.

155
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:25,150
I like my house and our neighborhood very much.

156
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,860
Since you read a book for him,

157
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,650
Se Jong really fell asleep like magic.

158
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,220
He ate a lot of porridge too.

159
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,910
I think he's settled down now.

160
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:08,030
I am really grateful.

161
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,910
Not at all.

162
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,610
You can leave now. I will take you home.

163
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,900
Your parents will be worried.

164
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,790
Yes.

165
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,730
What the heck are you doing?

166
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,160
You promised me to let go of Dan Dan.

167
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,720
Why do you keep shaking up her feelings when she finally made up her mind?

168
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,420
Why are you not keeping your promise!

169
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,110
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,590
I needed her help because my child was sick.

171
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,650
Stop talking nonsense!

172
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,530
A phone call from you can bring an array of doctors.

173
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,640
Don't you think I know that you're using your child as an excuse?

174
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,260
How shameful.

175
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,460
How can you call yourself a chairman?

176
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,600
You should be ashamed.

177
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,820
Why are you doing this, Dad?

178
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,910
I went because Se Jong was really sick.

179
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:56,040
Dad, I've come back.

180
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,530
I am leaving for the US the day after tomorrow, isn't that enough?

181
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,640
So please stop acting like this to the Chairman.

182
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,200
Chairman, please go on home.

183
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,700
Dad, please go inside.

184
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,000
What the heck are you doing?

185
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,020
You promised to let go of Dan Dan.

186
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,400
Why do you keep shaking up her feelings when she finally made up her mind?

187
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,170
Don't you think I know that you're using your child as an excuse?

188
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,220
Dan Dan, come out and eat breakfast.

189
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,030
I have to go now.

190
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,300
Dan Dan.

191
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,690
Where are you going this early in the morning?

192
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,320
You aren't going to that house again, are you?

193
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,550
No, I am not.

194
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:22,020
Where are you going then?

195
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,180
I am on my way to see CEO Anna.

196
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,820
She asked me to help with the fashion show today.

197
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,760
Why are you acting like this, Dad?

198
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,760
As you wanted, I've ended it with the Chairman and am going to the US.

199
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,700
I am going the day after tomorrow.

200
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,000
So what are you worried about for you to act like this?

201
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,030
I mean...

202
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,070
It's because you said you ended with him,

203
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:51,740
but you still went to Chairman Lee's house.

204
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:57,510
I told you yesterday I had to go there because Se Jong was sick.

205
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:02,870
Se Jong, that little baby, got sick because he missed me.

206
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,530
Should I have ignored him?

207
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,760
You're going overboard, Dad.

208
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,130
Son-in-law Park.

209
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,890
Just leave her alone.

210
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:23,730
What if she gets angry and says she won't go to the US? Then what would you do?

211
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,210
That's right, Brother-in-law. She said she'd ended it.

212
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,780
Just leave her alone.

213
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,820
Please eat.

214
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:36,050
But, there's no secret in the world.

215
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:40,150
What if Dan Dan finds out Anna Kim is her mother?

216
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,650
What are you going to do then?

217
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,950
What?

218
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:49,640
We agreed not to talk about it anymore.

219
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,230
Mom.

220
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:00,300
No matter how much I think about it, I don't think it's right to send Dan Dan to that woman.

221
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,820
She's a scary woman, the more I think about it.

222
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,970
She changed her face and approached us with a complete lie.

223
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:08,900
She tried to take Soo Chul and Dan Dan away.

224
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,990
It makes me feel horrified thinking about it.

225
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:20,220
Why don't we switch the hats?

226
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,280
Why is this outfit missing a bag?

227
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,620
I'm sorry. I'll bring it right now.

228
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,540
Ms. Park, isn't this chaotic?

229
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,960
Yes, a little.

230
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,210
But it's very interesting and fun.

231
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,650
Is that so?

232
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,830
One moment.

233
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,980
Oh, no. I'm in trouble.

234
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,250
What's wrong?

235
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:10,420
I forgot to bring the USB with important materials for today's fashion show.

236
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,350
I must have lost my mind.

237
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:16,150
We need it to hold the fashion show.

238
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,320
Ms. Park, I am sorry.

239
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,770
But can you take a cab and go to my apartment?

240
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,600
Yes, I'll do that.

241
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,820
It should be on top of my desk.

242
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,030
It's in a red pouch, so it'll be easy to spot.

243
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:32,780
Check the pouch to see if the USB is in there, and bring it to me right now.

244
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,760
Yes, I'll be back soon.

245
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,590
- See you in a bit.
- Yes, thank you.

246
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,260
She said the pouch would be on top of her desk.

247
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,670
But why is it not here?

248
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,650
Oh, my goodness!

249
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,830
These are baby photos.

250
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:25,280
What? These photos look like my baby photos.

251
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,210
Is she CEO Anna's daughter?

252
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,710
Oh, it's not the CEO's daughter,

253
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:40,960
but it's the daughter of the lady in the photo.

254
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,790
How can it be so similar to my baby photo?

255
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:50,780
Do babies all look alike?

256
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,300
[CEO Anna]

257
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,310
Yes, CEO Anna.

258
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,730
Did you find the pouch?

259
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,230
Not yet.

260
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:18,390
I'm looking for it right now.

261
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:23,200
Ms. Park, look in the drawers.

262
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,010
Yes, one moment, please.

263
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,230
Yes, I found it.

264
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,020
I'll leave right away.

265
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,930
One moment, please!

266
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,620
I'm sorry. Please go first.

267
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,460
It's okay. Please get on.

268
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,020
Oh my, I left my wallet at the restaurant.

269
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,330
Excuse me.

270
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,160
The door is closing.

271
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:38,940
What brings you to the office?

272
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:44,780
I came to help CEO Anna with the fashion show today.

273
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,520
And I'm on my way back from an errand.

274
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,310
Is that right?

275
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:54,210
Is the preparation for going to the US going well?

276
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,090
Yes.

277
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,800
How is Se Jong?

278
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,340
Is he okay now?

279
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,380
Thanks to you, yes.

280
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:07,910
He ate his breakfast and went to the kindergarten.

281
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,430
Ms. Park.

282
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:14,140
I am really grateful.

283
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,720
I'm so glad.

284
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:25,610
Chairman, I'm really sorry for how my dad spoke to you harshly yesterday.

285
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:28,090
I want to apologize on his behalf.

286
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,390
No, it's alright.

287
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,240
I'm in the middle of an urgent errand for CEO Anna.

288
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,910
I will get off.

289
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:41,140
Please be healthy, Chairman.

290
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,420
The door is closing.

291
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,610
How come you are here already?

292
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:59,410
You should have had a chat with Ms. Park over coffee.

293
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,400
I thought you were going to the restaurant to retrieve your wallet.

294
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,440
- How come you are here?
- You really don't know?

295
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,700
I left so that you two could have privacy.

296
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,290
But why am I feeling heartbroken?

297
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,060
Young Gook.

298
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:20,070
Are you really going to let Ms. Park go to the US?

299
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,380
I think you should go and stop her, even now.

300
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,800
If you don't want to regret it later.

301
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,600
I have to work.

302
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,470
Lee Young Gook. This is not right.

303
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:36,970
If you can't, should I go and stop her for you?

304
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,680
Jung Woo.

305
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,820
You're frustrating. So frustrating.

306
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,100
It's frustrating.

307
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:57,170
Are you really going to let Ms. Park go to the US?

308
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,480
I think you should go and stop her, even now.

309
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,200
If you don't want to regret it later.

310
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,620
Don't you think I know that you used the child as an excuse?

311
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,520
How shameful.

312
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,760
How can you call yourself a chairman?

313
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,810
You should feel ashamed.

314
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,710
Se Jong, I heard you ate well today,

315
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,750
and played well with your friends, too.

316
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:58,050
Yes. Until I reunited with Ms. Park again,

317
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:01,430
I promised to stay well and strong.

318
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,280
You are so strong, Se Jong.

319
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,710
When Ms. Park sees you so strong,

320
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:09,860
she would love it!

321
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,190
Se Jong, since we feel so good today.

322
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,870
Do you want to play with me before going home?

323
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,780
Yes, I'd love that, Auntie!

324
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,370
What would you like to do?

325
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,550
Let's play the stationary store game.

326
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,970
Stationary store game?

327
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,320
What is that?

328
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
Come this way.

329
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,640
This is it.

330
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:35,230
I don't know how to play this.

331
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,080
Really?

332
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,400
It's no fun playing alone.

333
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,020
What do we do?

334
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,200
Enjoy your food.

335
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,530
Hello, Uncle!

336
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:50,070
Hello, Se Jong.

337
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:53,430
Uncle, do you know how to play this game?

338
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,500
- Yes, I do.
- That's great.

339
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,710
Can you play a game with me?

340
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:03,110
Auntie doesn't know how to play.

341
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,860
Shall we? Let's do it. It'll be fun.

342
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,350
Why aren't the keys working for me?

343
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,750
Honestly, what's going on here?

344
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,210
Se Jong, you got the lead!

345
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,380
I've won! Awesome!

346
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,980
I've lost to Se Jong. How could it be?

347
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,670
I will buy a meal since I've won!

348
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,410
What? You will buy a meal?

349
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:38,000
Yes, my dad told me whoever wins has to buy.

350
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,440
Auntie, I want to buy it so can you pay for it?

351
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,800
What?

352
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,260
Auntie, I want to eat pizza.

353
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:50,910
Let's go, Uncle. I'm buying so you have to enjoy the food.

354
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:54,210
Okay. Let's go.

355
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,370
You're eating so well.

356
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,700
Try some of this too, Se Jong.

357
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,210
Auntie, I will bring us some salad.

358
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,880
No, I will bring it for you.

359
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,360
No, it's okay, Auntie. I can do it.

360
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,120
We were very grateful that Ms. Park came by yesterday.

361
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,430
Se Jong was in serious condition.

362
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,460
Due to separation anxiety.

363
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,860
But once Ms. Park came by,

364
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,680
he's gotten as bright as he is now.

365
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:53,500
Please tell Ms. Park, we are grateful.

366
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,820
Okay.

367
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:00,440
But it's very strange.

368
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,910
- What is?
- I know we broke up.

369
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:09,110
But it doesn't feel like we did.

370
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:13,230
It feels like we are seeing each other after a few days.

371
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:18,950
Why do I feel so good and comfortable when I am with you?

372
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:22,490
Whenever I see you, I'm in a good mood.

373
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:27,130
I'm so happy right at this moment.

374
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,920
Lee Se Ryun, please don't push your way in like this.

375
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,750
I heard about Se Jong yesterday.

376
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,900
So I came with you for his sake.

377
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,010
I heard he was very sick.

378
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:42,720
Okay, I understand. You don't have to go on.

379
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,020
Auntie. Uncle.

380
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,160
I brought lots of salad.

381
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,130
- Let's all eat it together.
- Yes!

382
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,150
Thank you.

383
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:54,510
- Se Jong, eat as much as you want.
- Yes.

384
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,150
Very good.

385
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,020
The FT Group 2022 S/S concept is

386
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:34,510
about the unity between generations, between golf and lifestyle.

387
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,940
It's the "Harmony."

388
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,330
This photo.

389
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:42,940
It looks very similar to my baby photo.

390
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,460
Is this really my photo?

391
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,000
It can't be.

392
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,530
Why would CEO Anna have my baby photos?

393
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:01,120
Ms. Park.

394
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,950
Can I give you a hug just once?

395
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,140
Yes.

396
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,140
Thank you, Ms. Park.

397
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:22,370
CEO Anna, until now, I thought

398
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,810
my biological mother was dead.

399
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:26,870
But I heard that she's in the US.

400
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:29,840
I would like to start looking for my mom.

401
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,420
But I don't know anybody in the US.

402
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:36,720
That's why I came to see you as my last hope.

403
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,360
I'm sorry, Ms. Park.

404
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,540
I don't know anyone in the Korean community.

405
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,680
This is not something I can help you with.

406
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,810
I have to go due to work.

407
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,160
CEO Anna.

408
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:18,920
Something's strange about CEO Anna.

409
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,370
There is something.

410
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:27,980
Also, these photos are exactly like my baby photos.

411
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,040
Sir, I'm sorry but can you go any faster?

412
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,700
Yes.

413
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,690
Thank you for your work!

414
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,250
Thank you!

415
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,170
Thank you.

416
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:52,200
I heard you are going back to the US with Ms. Park.

417
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,310
Yes.

418
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:57,940
Good choice. People who used to live in the US should live in the US.

419
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,750
I'll come to see you if I go to New York.

420
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,770
Yes, Se Ryun. Let me know.

421
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,740
Yes.

422
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,670
We will get going.

423
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,860
I'll see you later.

424
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:19,740
CEO Anna, thank you for your hard work.

425
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,290
Thanks to you, we got it done.

426
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:27,080
Thank you.

427
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,140
Let's say goodbye here.

428
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:33,960
Please be well and stay healthy.

429
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,090
Yes, you too.

430
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,090
But, where did my Dan Dan go?

431
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,110
I haven't seen her in a while.

432
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:03,020
This is...

433
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,540
Me... It's me.

434
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,500
What's going on here?

435
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:20,230
Does that mean this woman is?

436
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:23,060
Is she my mom?

437
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,980
Is that it?

438
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,240
Hello, Ajumma.

439
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,340
Can I see you for a second right now?

440
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,890
Yes, as soon as possible.

441
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,400
That's the one, yes.

442
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:01,790
She is your biological mother.

443
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:05,130
Really?

444
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:08,410
Yes, I remember now looking at it.

445
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:11,740
Where did you get this photo?

446
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:15,760
Are you sure she is my birth mother?

447
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,660
Yes, she is.

448
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:23,560
Did you come to see me because it's awkward to ask your dad?

449
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:47,490
But how can CEO Anna have my baby photos and my birth mom's photo?

450
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:51,730
Is she CEO Anna's sister by any chance?

451
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:56,260
No, CEO Anna has no family.

452
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:02,770
Then... Is CEO Anna my mom?

453
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,490
What am I thinking?

454
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:08,120
That makes no sense.

455
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:12,020
Why could my dad not recognize my mom...

456
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:15,500
Maybe CEO Anna has been extra good to you because she has no family.

457
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,170
According to the lady who worked here before me,

458
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:22,980
CEO Anna went to the US by herself to become successful when she was young and lived a hard life.

459
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,250
But then, she got in a car accident and almost died.

460
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:30,710
She had plastic surgeries on her face more than ten times due to a severe injury.

461
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:33,120
Plastic sugeries?

462
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,450
- Really?
- You saw it yourself.

463
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:40,680
When Chairman turned 22 years old again, he didn't recognize her and kicked her out of the house.

464
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:47,720
Plastic surgeries?

465
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:53,740
Then...

466
00:35:53,740 --> 00:36:00,450
Is CEO Anna my mom?

[CEO Anna]

469
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,100
- Yes, CEO Anna.
- Where are you, Ms. Park?

470
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,610
We finished our fashion show very well, and we are celebrating now.

471
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:32,870
Do you want to come here?

472
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:38,510
Are you at the after-party?

473
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,690
I am sorry.

474
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:45,310
You looked busy, so I couldn't say goodbye before leaving.

475
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:49,140
I have friends to see before I leave for the US.

476
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,130
Yes.

477
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:53,680
I will see you at the airport.

478
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,370
When would the results be ready?

479
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:54,690
It should be ready by tomorrow afternoon.

480
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,710
Okay.

481
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:04,140
Yes, Mom.

482
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,970
To the chicken restaurant?

483
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:08,030
Okay, I got it.

484
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:23,070
Am I doing the right thing?

485
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:29,450
Yes. Before going to the US, I have to resolve it if it bothers me.

486
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,870
The chicken is ready.

487
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:35,120
- Dan Dan!
- The main star is here.

488

Dan Dan!

00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,580
Dan Dan, come and sit.

490
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:41,320
Come and sit here.

491
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,860
Dan Dan, did something happen today?

492
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,250
Why do you look so tired?

493
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:49,590
I had to run around all over the place today.

494
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:52,200
Have you been with CEO Anna all this time?

495
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,800
Did the fashion show go well?

496
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:55,620
Yes.

00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:59,830
Dan Dan, I am very happy you are going to the US.

498
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:04,400
Learn a lot over there, and come back successful. Okay?

499
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,520
And, Dan Dan.

500
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,410
I've got some US dollars for you.

501
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:10,340
Use it when you need it.

502
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:13,210
- You shouldn't do this, Noona.
- Why not?

503
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:16,060
Can't I give her this much when my niece goes to the US?

504
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:19,230
- Please take it.
- Dan Dan must be happy!

505
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:24,250
What are you waiting for? Take it when your aunt is giving it to you.

506
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:27,740
Thank you, Aunt. I will spend it well.

507
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:31,050
- Hello!
- Hello.

508
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,610
Are you having a party?

509
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:36,450
My granddaughter is going to the US.

510
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:39,190
You've made it.

511
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,270
Our Hyun Bin will feel sad.

512
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:45,960
You two looked good together when you were both going to the English Academy together.

513
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,170
I'll make sure to call Hyun Bin Sunbaenim before I leave.

514
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:52,060
Yes, please do.

515
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,510
Please come and join us here.

516
00:39:55,510 --> 00:40:01,580
If I had known in advance, I would have prepared it in an envelope.

517
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:04,490
Please take this and use it when you go to the US.

518
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,920
Thank you, but it's okay.

519
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,450
Please don't do this, Hyungnim.

520
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:11,070
When an elder gives it, you should take it.

521
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,960
Please take it.

522
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,780
Yes, please. It's not easy to get money out of my brother's wallet.

523
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:20,250
Bring him a gift when you come out for a vacation.

524
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:24,240
I will accept it gratefully.

525
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,670
Please sit.

526
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,340
Why don't you take that dish from him?

527
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:31,280
Everything came out now!

528
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,390
And the beer is here.

529
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:36,180
Cha Geon, please say something.

530
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,430
Yes, yes.

531
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:42,660
For the happiness of our Dan Dan, who's leaving this country on an airplane the day after tomorrow,

532
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,350
let's all do cheers for her.

533
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:48,580
For Dan Dan's happiness and everyone's health!

534
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,700
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

535
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,020
How are you doing with that young lady?

536
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:03,880
- Please don't ask. It's not good.
- I'm glad to hear.

537
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,870
Please eat chicken. Please.

538
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,780
Is this woman my mother?

539
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,450
The mother who abandoned me?

540
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,790
She looks like a totally normal person,

541
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:25,900
but how can she abandon an infant and run away?

542
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,800
Right, it won't be CEO Anna.

543
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,460
She's not someone who would abandon a baby.

544
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,610
Then what is the relationship between CEO Anna

545
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:38,550
and the woman who abandoned me?

546
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:41,880
Should I just ask my dad?

547
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:58,900
Okay, once I get the DNA test results tomorrow,

548
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,940
it won't be late to ask him.

549
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,260
Last January, in front of Soo Jung Orphanage,

550
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:14,700
an anonymous donor left 500 million won.

551
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,510
And it became a hot topic.

552
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:19,630
To relay their gratitude, the Orphanage is looking for

553
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:24,990
an anonymous donor who gave the wonderful gift.
[The Orphanage is searching for the anonymous donor of '500 million won' to thank them]

554
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:31,040
Why can't they just spend the money on the children?

555
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,750
Why are they looking for me all over the place?

556
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:41,060
They won't be able to find me, will they?

557
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:47,090
What if they find out I stole the money?

558
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:49,290
If that happens, my Sarah

559
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:51,880
becomes a thief's daughter.

560
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,120
What should I do now?

561
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:03,510
I don't know that number.

562
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:05,950
Who could it be?

563
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,600
Hello?

564
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,820
Yes, hello. This is Report Ji Dong Won from Home Country Newspaper.

565
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:20,310
Have you made a donation to the Soo Jung Orphanage?

566
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,560
Do...Donation?

567
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,240
No, I never have.

568
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:33,380
I don't even have enough money to eat and die.

569
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:36,350
You called the wrong number.

570
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:43,680
H-How did he know my number to call?

571
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,410
What do I do now?

572
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:49,490
What do I do?

573
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:14,540
Is this Soo Jung Orphanage?

574
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:20,830
I am the one who donated 500 million won.

575
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:24,990
Please, please, do not search for me. Okay?

576
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:27,780
Did you get it?

577
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:38,660
[National Flower Delivery Service]

578
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:43,450
Mrs. Yeoju, here.

579
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:45,630
What's this?

580
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:49,260
I made some Short rib patties, Se Jong's favorite.

581
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,410
Really? He'd love it.

582
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:54,960
But Chief Jo, doing the flowers is enough.

583
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,940
You don't have to do things like this.

584
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:59,660
It's not hard.

585
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:02,070
I know Se Jong's tastes the best.

586
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:04,560
Since I raised him since he was a baby.

587
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,110
Thank you. I will make sure he eats it.

588
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:11,430
Se Jong, that was fun, wasn't it?

589
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:14,070
Welcome home.

590
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:20,290
Isn't this Chief Jo?

591
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:24,060
It's been a while, Ms. Se Ryun.

592
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:29,210
Se Jong, hello!

593
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:31,770
Se Jong, Chief Jo brought you

594
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:34,450
your favorite, Short rib patties.

595
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:36,610
That'd be delicious.

596
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:40,040
But I'm full from having pizza.

597
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,880
I will go upstairs.

598
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,720
But what brings you here, Chief Jo?

599
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,770
She comes here twice a week to do the flower arrangements.

600
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:04,920
What do you mean?

601
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,330
Why does Chief Jo do that?

602
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:10,150
I started working for the flower shop near here.

603
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:14,250
I made sure we were never without flowers when I worked here.

604
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:18,160
- So...
- Does my brother know about this?

605
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,820
Not yet. Madam told us not to.

606
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:25,430
Ms. Se Ryun, please don't worry.

607
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:29,480
I was going to report to the Chairman about it.

608
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,170
Since it's not something we could keep to ourselves.

609
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:36,780
Chief Jo. I think it'd be better if you didn't come here anymore.

610
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,000
If Oppa finds out, he won't let this slide.

611
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,880
You know how he's like.

612
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,480
So let's agree to do so.

613
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:57,160
Is Se Jong home? Is he alright?

614
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:01,430
Yes, I think he's better now.

615
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:07,740
But Mom, how can you allow Chief Jo to do flower arrangements here?

616
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:10,220
- Is Chief Jo here?
- Yes!

617
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,760
She was once engaged to Oppa.

618
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,180
How can she come to do flowers at our house?

619
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:18,190
You should have stopped it at the start.

620
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:20,620
I felt bad for her.

621
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:25,310
And she said she wanted to, so I couldn't say no.

622
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:27,320
Mom, what if Oppa finds out?

623
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,290
He would say something to you for sure.

624
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:32,710
Why can't you think of that?

625
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,220
Are you here, Chief Jo?

626
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,250
Yes.

627
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:45,940
Ms. Se Ryun. I'm only here during the day.

628
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:48,410
So I won't run into the Chairman.

629
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:51,790
And it's only twice a week.

630
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:55,520
So, please let me do the flower arrangements.

631
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,210
Chief Jo. That's not right.

632
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:02,870
You're different from any other people. You were once engaged to my brother.

633
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:06,260
But it's okay with me. I would like to come once in a while

634
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:12,090
to see Madam and the children as well.

635
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:15,890
I'm saying it's uncomfortable for us.

636
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:19,740
That's right. It doesn't look right to me either.

637
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:25,010
If he finds out, we will all be in big trouble with Young Gook.

638
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:27,640
But it's okay with me, I said. It's fine with me!

639
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,220
I will be careful to make sure the Chairman doesn't find out!

640
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:33,990
Chief Jo, why are you insisting so much?

641
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:36,770
Right, it's hard for me to understand as well.

642
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:41,380
Did you bury a gold bar in our house, Chief Jo?

643
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:52,960
Did I ask for money or anything?

644
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,040
I just want to do the flowers.

645
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,980
How can they say no to that?

646
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:04,980
Like what my mom said, should I sue them

647
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,240
to get my Se Jong back, even now?

648
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,530
Welcome.

649
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:37,220
What brings you here at this hour?

650
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:41,150
It's my day off today.

651
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:43,150
Did you have lunch?

652
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,110
Yes.

653
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:48,800
What flowers do you need today?

654
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:53,050
Can you make me a flower basket today?

655
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:56,530
A flower basket?

656
00:49:56,530 --> 00:50:01,280
I'm going to give it to someone I really like this time.

657
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,630
Make it pretty, please.

658
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:07,230
All right.

659
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,200
Are you almost done?

660
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,240
Yes.

661
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:26,550
Do you have plans today?

662
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:30,520
I have no plans.

663
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,510
Then...

664
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:36,780
it's almost time for me to switch shifts with my boss.

665
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:40,990
Shall we go day drinking, since it's been a while?

666
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:45,460
Sounds good.

667
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:48,600
It's been a while, so shall we?

668
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,920
- Enjoy your food.
- Thank you.

669
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,410
This looks delicious. Go ahead and eat.

670
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:10,750
What is it?

671
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:14,150
- Nothing. It just smells a little fishy.
- I see.

672
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:18,090
Then eat these oyster fritters.

673
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:32,160
What is it? Is this unpalatable too?

674
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,700
No.

675
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:38,060
I think my stomach is upset from lunch.

676
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,960
What should we do?

677
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,470
Shall we go out and take a little walk then?

678
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:44,460
You can't drink when you have an upset stomach.

679
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:47,490
Okay, let's do that. My stomach doesn't feel good.

680
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:50,350
All right, let's go out.

681
00:51:56,610 --> 00:52:00,530
How does your stomach feel? Is it better?

682
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:05,790
It's a little better now that I'm walking and got some fresh air.

683
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:10,210
That's a relief. You should go home, drink something warm, and rest well.

684
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,240
Okay. Go home safely, too, Ajussi.

685
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,410
Here.

686
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:20,030
But you said you were going to give it to someone you like.

687
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:24,090
You looked a little down, so I bought it to give to you, Sarah.

688
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:27,620
So take this and look at it to feel better.

689
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:30,840
It's my present.

690
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,800
Ajussi...

691
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,360
I told you not to feel pressured.

692
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:39,070
We're friends. Friends.

693
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,840
Thank you.

694
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,080
I'm more thankful.

695
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:51,310
That you accepted me as your friend.

696
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:05,310
I wonder when your tears will stop.

697
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:16,910
Yes, Se Ryun, it's me.

698
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:19,820
How is Se Jong today?

699
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:27,080
All right. Please take good care of him with Chief Kim until the new tutor comes.

700
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,560
All right. Thank you.

701
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:41,510
Yes, hello? This is Lee Young Gook.

702
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,580
What?

703
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:50,860
CEO Anna Kim...

704
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:53,350
is that Kim Ji Young?

705
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:56,500
So you are saying, CEO Anna Kim...

706
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,790
is Park Dan Dan's biological mother?

707
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:01,400
Are you certain?

708
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,290
Yes, I'm certain.

709
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:05,970
I cross-checked it multiple times.

710
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:09,940
I sent you all the related documents via email.

711
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:11,960
All right.

712
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,350
Thank you.

713
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,460
This can't be true.

714
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,540
How could this be?

715
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:26,440
Ms. Park is a young woman only 27 years old. How could you do this?

716
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:31,640
If people find out about this, they're going to gossip, "What is the Chairman of FT Group doing with a young girl?"

717
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:35,020
Then Ms. Park will be the center of gossip amongst people.

718
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:38,230
What in the world did you think to do this?

719
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:42,590
No matter how close you two are, she crossed the line.

720
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:44,890
It doesn't sound like she said it out of worry for you.

721
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:49,020
People may think CEO Anna is Ms. Park's mom.

722
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:56,000
Secretary Yoon. Get the car ready now.

723
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:07,800
- I'll drive.
- Yes, sir.

724
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:23,090
What brings Young Gook all the way here?

725
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:29,600
What brings you here unannounced?

726
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:35,100
There was something I had to ask you.

727
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:38,040
Is that so? What is it?

728
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,250
Noona.

729
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:46,550
What's your relationship with Ms. Park?

730
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:48,710
Young Gook...

731
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:51,000
What are you saying?

732
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,610
What do you mean by that question?

733
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:58,680
Ms. Park is an employee of my company who will be going to America to work with me now.

734
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:02,490
Did you come all the way here to ask that? I thought it was something serious.

735
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:06,380
Are you the biological mother who gave birth to Ms. Park?

736
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:10,830
What?

737
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:13,330
Y-Young Gook.

738
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:16,020
What are you saying right now?

739
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:18,090
What nonsense are you saying?

740
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:20,700
Noona.

741
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:24,120
Don't think about lying to me.

742
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:28,360
Ms. Park said she wanted to find her biological mom, so I had been searching until now.

743
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,890
I got the results today.

744
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:33,180
Ms. Park's biological mother's name is Kim Ji Young.

745
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:37,110
The person who gave birth to Ms. Park 27 years ago, then left for America less than 3 months later.

746
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:39,500
That person is Anna Kim.

747
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,760
It was none other than you, Noona.

748
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,760
I found out today.

749
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,830
Y-Young Gook.

750
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:51,350
It's you, isn't it?

751
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:54,010
The mom who gave birth to Ms. Park.

752
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,800
Kim Ji Young.

753
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,300
Young Gook...

754
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:01,430
That... that's all in the past.

755
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:04,190
What?

756
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:07,430
"That's all in the past?"

757
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:12,360
Are you saying abandoning the newly born Ms. Park is just something in the past?

758
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,930
That's right. It's the past.

759
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:18,130
It was a long time ago.

760
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:20,580
Is that so?

761
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:24,200
It may be the past for you and something that happened long ago.

762
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,480
But do you think that's the case for Ms. Park too?

763
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,770
Noona. Does Ms. Park know you're her biological mother?

764
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:33,960
Is she going to America with you aware of that fact?

765
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,680
W-Well...

766
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,320
Why can't you tell her when it's the past?

767
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:45,360
Noona. At least tell Ms. Park now.

768
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:49,970
Since it's the past, tell her you're her mom who abandoned her!

769
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:52,090
Young Gook.

770
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:54,660
I beg you.

771
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:57,800
Dan Dan will not want to go to America if she finds out about this.

772
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,490
So, please act like you don't know.

773
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:04,420
You want me to act like I don't know that you're fooling Ms. Park and taking her to America?

774
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:08,610
No. Ms. Park has to know this truth too.

775
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:12,030
How could you think to fool Ms. Park into taking her with you?

776
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,760
How could you do something like this?!

777
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,300
This was all discussed with Dan Dan's dad.

778
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:20,600
I discussed it all with Park Soo Chul. So—

779
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,730
What?

780
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:26,790
What did you say?

781
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:29,020
Is that true?

782
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:33,340
Yes. So as long as you stay quiet,

783
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:36,940
the fact that I'm her biological mother...

784
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:39,000
It won't be a problem at all.

785
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,130
Dan Dan's dad allowed all of this.

786
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:44,360
Noona.

787
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:47,060
It's one thing if I don't know this.

788
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:49,440
But now that I know this truth, I can't cover it up.

789
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:56,120
I think that Ms. Park has to know this truth.

790
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,160
So before I tell her, you tell her yourself.

791
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:03,130
Solve this problem before you leave for America.

792
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:06,500
Or I will have to tell Ms. Park myself.

793
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,230
I'll get going now.

794
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:11,730
Young Gook. Young Gook!

795
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:14,310
Young Gook...

796
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,370
As long as Dan Dan gets on the plane tomorrow...

797
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:29,470
I have nothing to worry about anymore.

798
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:32,870
As long as she gets on the plane...

799
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:10,390
What is it? I told you not to call.

800
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:16,340
We're in big trouble. Young Gook found out that I'm Dan Dan's mom.

801
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:18,740
What? What did you just say?

802
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,760
What do we do, Soo Chul?

803
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:25,600
Young Gook hired someone to find Dan Dan's mom for her.

804
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:29,440
He said he would tell her everything if I didn't tell her myself immediately.

805
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,620
He'll tell her I'm the mom who abandoned her.

806
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,060
Is that true?

807
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:36,800
Dan Dan will not go to America if she knows this.

808
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,950
Try to stop him. Before Young Gook goes to Dan Dan.

809
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:43,550
Please hurry. I'm dying from anxiety right now.

810
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:46,090
I told him the plan to take Dan Dan to America

811
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:48,970
was discussed with you.

812
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:52,770
So, hurry on up and do whatever you can.

813
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:05,530
[Chairman Lee]

814
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:12,300
Hello?

815
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:14,530
It's me, Lee Young Gook.

816
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:17,440
I have something to say to you.

817
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,820
I would like to meet you for a moment.

818
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,950
Okay.

819
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:25,260
I will.

820
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:33,520
The fact that CEO Anna Kim is Ms. Park's biological mother who abandoned her.

821
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:37,690
I heard that you know about that too.

822
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:40,840
Is that really true?

823
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:44,900
That person...

824
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:49,300
She is Dan Dan's biological mother.

825
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:54,050
But then...

826
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:59,350
How could you think to hide that fact from Ms. Park and send her to America?

827
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:02,220
The reason you're going to this extent...

828
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,640
is it because of me?

829
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,750
Yes, that's right.

830
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:13,540
It's because of you, Chairman.

831
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:18,380
The two of us agreed to break up as you wished.

832
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:20,850
But what is still the issue for you to do this?

833
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:24,750
CEO Anna Kim is the mother who abandoned Ms. Park.

834
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:27,100
I think that Ms. Park has to know that truth.

835
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:30,270
Only you just need to pretend you don't know.

836
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:33,600
Chairman. My Dan Dan...

837
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:37,750
Please cover it up so that she can go to America with CEO Anna Kim.

838
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:43,020
It's true that CEO Anna Kim is Dan Dan's mother, who abandoned her.

839
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:45,450
But she is still Dan Dan's biological mom.

840
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:48,050
She will take care of Dan Dan better than anyone.

841
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:50,160
So, please...

842
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:54,610
I ask that you cover this up just once for Dan Dan's happiness.

843
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:57,370
I am begging you.

844
01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:03,110
Do you really think this is for Ms. Park's happiness?

845
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:05,350
I disagree.

846
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:08,410
You are deceiving Ms. Park.

847
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:15,620
Did you think about how shocked Ms. Park would be if she somehow found out about this later?

848
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:18,660
If you truly care for Ms. Park,

849
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:21,180
you need to reveal the truth now before it's too late.

850
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:26,060
If she says she'll still go to America after that, then you can send her.

851
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:31,650
I don't think it's right that Ms. Park goes to America without a clue like this.

852
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:36,020
Chairman. Please pretend you don't know.

853
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,670
I am begging you like this.

854
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:39,960
I can't accept this.

855
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:43,390
Tell her the truth by tonight.

856
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:48,300
If Ms. Park says she'll still go to America, then I will no longer interfere.

857
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:52,260
But if you continue to refuse to tell her the truth...

858
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:54,920
I will tell her.

859
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,320
Then, excuse me.

860
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:16,510
What are you going to do?

861
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:19,680
Are you going to tell Dan Dan everything?

862
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,260
How could I tell her that?

863
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:24,820
Dan Dan will not forgive us if she knows about this.

864
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:27,420
She won't go to America either.

865
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:32,190
Then Dan Dan will get back together with Chairman Lee.

866
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:37,240
She went to their house last night, too, with the kids as an excuse.

It's only a matter of time until Dan Dan finds out.

872
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,990
This won't do.

873
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:59,940
Just take Dan Dan and leave the country right now.

874

Transfer through Japan or do whatever you can.

876
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:09,190
I'll try to stop Chairman Lee from telling her, and I will kneel down if I have to.

877
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:13,230
So you hurry and take Dan Dan away with you.

Honey, is Dan Dan in Mother-in-law's room?

No, she left earlier saying she had something to do.

884
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:34,240
Did she go out? What does she have to do?

885
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,270
She didn't pick up her phone.

886
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:39,270
She didn't tell me what it was. I wonder why she's not picking up her phone.

887
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:42,260
Maybe she put it on silent?

888
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:48,450
Mother-in-law. Dan Dan's bags are all packed, right?

Yes, it seemed to be. Why?

01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:15,480
- Dan Dan is going to leave today.
- What?
