2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,300
Dan Dan!

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,410
Sunbaenim.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,570
- Did you get your homework done?
- No.

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,780
- I thought so.
- Of course.

6
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,690
What's going on?

7
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,820
Does Ms. Park Noona have a boyfriend?

8
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,800
She said she was going to study.

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,210
Is that why she wanted to go to an English academy?

10
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,930
So she can date?

11
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,640
Because you left right after class yesterday,

12
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,170
I didn't get a chance to talk or ask for your number.

13
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,230
How have you been?

14
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,740
I've been like everyone else, working every day.

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,720
Did you get a job? What kind of work are you doing?

16
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,480
- I work as a live-in tutor.
- A live-in tutor?

17
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,140
It must be hard teaching the kids while living there.

18
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,800
How many kids are you teaching?

19
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,170
- Three kids.
- Three?

20
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,790
Wow, that must be really tough.

21
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,290
It's not. The kids are nice and adorable.

22
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,520
And they listen to me well, so it's not hard at all.

23
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,820
Rather, I get energized by looking at them.

24
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,440
That's Park Dan Dan. You haven't changed at all.

25
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,240
You've always been positive and brave.

26
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,450
How have you been?

27
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,130
I'm getting ready to go to law school.

28
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,220
That seems pretty hard.

29
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,630
I'm trying to enjoy it.

30
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,520
- By the way, do you have time this Friday?
- Why?

31
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,580
Ji Hae is getting married next month.

32
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,210
So we decided to throw a congratulation party.

33
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,140
People from your year will be there too.

34
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,060
Really? I should go.

35
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,210
If Ji Hae Sunbae is getting married, I have to go.

36
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,740
I should go and see people I haven't seen in a while.

37
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,900
Yes. When we set a place and time, I'll let you know.

38
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,830
Can you give me your number?

39
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,560
It's annoying.

40
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,490
What is this? Is it not a soft drink?

41
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,300
Excuse me, sir! You have to pay first.

42
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,840
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,890
How much is it?

44
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,420
It's 5,000 won.

45
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,510
What drink is 5,000 won?

46
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,430
It's a drink for hangovers.

47
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,990
Ah, that's why.

48
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,380
Where's my wallet?

49
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,320
Did I not bring my wallet?

50
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,050
I'm sorry, but I'll be back soon from my house with my wallet.

51
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:22,030
Okay, but you have to leave your phone here.

52
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,360
My phone?

53
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,650
I think I left my phone too.

54
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,740
Seriously. Ajussi, you shouldn't be doing this.

55
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,130
You look like a normal person. What are you trying to do?

56
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,260
I'm not that kind of person!

57
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,820
I'll pay for it. He seems like he really forgot his wallet.

58
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,240
I'll pay for it together.

59
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,560
I said, give me your number.

60
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,310
I'll pay back the 5,000 won.

61
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,110
It's fine.

62
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,540
Things like that happen in life.

63
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:09,710
You drank the wrong drink earlier. It seems there's something on your mind.

64
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,920
Drink this.

65
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,790
Hyung.

66
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,000
Are you calling me?

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,940
Yes, Hyung. Thank you for helping me today.

68
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,040
Thank you for the water!

69
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,840
Sure. You're welcome.

70
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,960
Why does he seem familiar?

72
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,230
Hello.

73
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,490
I'm Cha Geon, reporting for the first day as a driver.

74
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,760
I will do my best.

75
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,530
Hello.

76
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,930
Follow me. I'll take you to the Drivers' office.

77
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,080
The weather and the air are good today.

78
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,910
I came out for work, but it's nice.

79
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,700
Yes, it is nice.

80
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:33,840
Mr. Park, let's have some udon before we leave.

81
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,020
No, I'm okay.

82
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,700
Why don't you go and eat without me?

83
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,050
I can't leave you here and eat by myself.

84
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,930
Let's go together, Mr. Park.

85
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,340
Let's go.

86
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,510
Oppa, we can't miss the bus. Let's eat faster.

87
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:21,190
You'll get indigestion. You have to chew it well.

88
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:25,480
We can't miss the bus.

89
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,970
Oppa, what should we do? The bus is leaving!

90
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,550
Ajussi! Wait!

91
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,750
Wait a minute!

92
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,720
What do we do?

93
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,780
The bus left.

94
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,570
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,570
It's all because I said let's eat udon.

96
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:55,560
How can we not eat udon when we're at the rest stop?

97
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,460
Ji Young, since it ended up like this, let's finish eating.

98
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:03,080
We can just take the next bus.

99
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,190
Sure!

101
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,620
♫  I hope I can find it  ♫

102
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,300
♫  Please open a way for me  ♫

103
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:23,050
It's strange, but udon at a rest stop is always delicious.

104
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,290
Yes, I think so, too.

105
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:31,250
I like rest stop udon a lot, so one time I missed a bus while eating udon at a rest stop.

106
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,070
Really?

107
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:37,270
I did that once too.

108
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:40,490
It looks like you and I

109
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,380
have a similar memory.

110
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:48,250
♫  Please open a way for me  ♫

111
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,750
Eating rest stop udon makes me reminded of old times.

112
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,440
I see.

113
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:11,170
♫  The hidden road of mine  ♫

114
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,800
It's the boat! Run, run!

115
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,640
Here! Here!

116
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,100
Right, I can't help it.

117
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,140
I will have to adapt to the 22 years old Chairman.

118
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:48,220
I have to try my best to fit in with him and get close to him first.

119
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:03,820
These documents from Executive Director Han, I can't understand any of it, no matter how hard I try.

120
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,500
You look like you lost more weight!

121
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,870
No, I didn't.

122
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,940
What is their relationship?

123
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,180
Is he really her boyfriend?

124
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,300
If you hadn't grabbed onto my waist when you fell,

125
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,180
there would have been no reason for our lips to collide!

126
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,870
I can't believe this was my first kiss at the age of 22.

127
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:36,280
It's so unfair!

128
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,280
What about me?

129
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,780
It was my first time too!

130
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,190
She said it was her first kiss.

131
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,430
Then did they start dating recently?

132
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:53,720
Boyfriend or not, it's none of my business.

133
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,880
I don't understand, nor can I focus on any of these.

134
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,170
What am I doing? I'm so distracted.

135
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,340
It's driving me crazy.

136
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,760
Please come in.

137
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:16,000
Chairman. What are you doing?

138
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,680
I'm reviewing the documents Executive Director Han gave me.

139
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,280
But I have no idea what they are about.

140
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,500
Don't worry too much.

141
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,100
Executive Director Han, Lawyer Koh, and senior management are taking good care of everything.

142
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,020
You can take your time.

143
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:35,110
Also, I will meet up with Executive Director Han and get an update regularly.

144
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,770
Will you do that for me? That will be very helpful.

145
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:44,380
Chairman. Do you want to play games to decompress?

146
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,240
Games?

147
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,390
Do you play games?

148
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,550
Yes. I want to play games.

149
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,500
Please teach me how to play.

150
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,130
Sure. I was stressed out.

151
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,850
Playing games will help.

152
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,960
Follow! Follow! Now! Now!

153
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,100
If you don't go now, we will die!

154
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,230
But how? I tried to shoot them, but they hid.

155
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,980
They are out again. Shoot them, shoot them now!

156
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,820
Shoot? Okay!

157
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,450
Seriously. How many times have you done that?

158
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,300
It's no fun if I'm the only one who survives all the time.

159
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,020
I'm sorry. Let's try it again.

160
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:28,090
I don't want to. How come you can't play when I explained it over and over?

161
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:32,850
- I will try harder and practice.
- No, please don't.

162
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,350
I understand you are trying hard to get close to me.

163
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,390
But you have to play games because you want to, not because you're trying to.

164
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:43,140
Don't force yourself if you can't.

165
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,880
I will go to the PC room and cool down.

166
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,310
I'm stressed out about something else already.

167
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,580
I got even more stressed playing the games.

168
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,760
Ah, really. I can't do it!

169
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,650
Why is it so hard? It's annoying!

170
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,400
What do I do now?

171
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,690
Seriously!

172
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:34,140
So pronouns are going to be really, really important.

173
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,220
Please memorize them as soon as you can.

174
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:42,570
Now, if you take this example, it is going to be 'I am,' right?

175
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,400
The next one is 'you are.'

176
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,900
This isn't the time to be playing games.

177
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,280
I think I have to confirm it with my own eyes.

178
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,780
This is for the sake of my kids.

179
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,540
If the teacher is focused on something else, she will lack attention to the children.

180
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,330
It's not something I can let go of as their father.

181
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:15,270
[YNB Language Academy]

182
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,160
It's time for her to get off, but where is she?

183
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,180
Did she leave already?

184
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,700
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes, see you.

185
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,400
What?

186
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,660
Is he not her boyfriend?

187
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,710
If he was, they should be holding hands or going for something to eat.

188
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,630
Maybe there is nothing between them.

189
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:50,710
Of course, Ms. Park Noona is not someone who would do something like that when she has children to look after.

190
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:55,370
Ms. Park Noona?

191
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,880
Chairman.

192
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,900
What brings you here again?

193
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,260
What a coincidence!

194
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,490
I was meeting up with Lawyer Koh nearby,

195
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:08,340
and we were talking about serious company issues and about to go home.

196
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,030
How could we run into each other like this?

197
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:15,190
Since we did, let's go home together.

198
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:18,010
Chairman, why don't you go home first? I have somewhere to go.

199
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,630
Where do you have to go?

200
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:24,610
I have to buy picture books for Se Jong and workbooks for Jenny.

201
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:25,740
Then, let's go together.

202
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,550
No, I prefer to go by myself.

203
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,870
Please go home first, Chairman.

204
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,840
I cannot do that.

205
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,680
Buying books for my children is an important matter. I must go with you.

206
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,340
Let's go together.

207
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,510
Ms. Park Noona, how about these books?

208
00:14:54,510 --> 00:15:00,560
At Se Jong's age, it's important to encourage creativity and imagination.

209
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,940
Yes, it's good.

210
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,660
See? You can pick the book faster with me.

211
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,810
Yes.

212
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,420
Ah, I suddenly feel hungry.

213
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,980
Did I spend too much energy choosing the books?

214
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,960
Aren't you hungry too, Ms. Park Noona?

215
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,650
I am okay. I can eat when I get home.

216
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,740
It'll be a while before we get home.

217
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,280
There is a very popular pork cutlet place nearby. Why don't we eat out there?

218
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,540
Why don't you go and eat? I can't go home late.

219
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,850
Why is she so strict?

220
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,850
Aren't we all living to eat?

221
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:47,090
Ms. Park Noona, let's take a taxi. I will pay for it.

222
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,530
Why don't you take a cab?

223
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,220
I feel more comfortable taking the bus.

224
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,350
If I take a cab alone when we are going to the same place, that would be a waste.

225
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,170
My goodness.

226
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:34,900
Seriously, why is he acting like this?

227
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:43,090
I bought this for Se Jong, but let's have one each.

228
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,940
It's bubble gum.

229
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,050
No, thank you--

230
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,780
Do you want to make a bet on who blows bigger bubbles?

231
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,390
I'm not good at making bubbles.

232
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:04,030
No way, everyone knows how to do that. It's very easy.

233
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,990
I will show you how to do it.

234
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,140
Seriously, what's wrong with him?

235
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,450
I lost the air.

236
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,420
CEO Anna, thank you for coming all the way here.

237
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,260
No problem. If you have any difficulties, please feel free to contact me anytime.

238
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,590
It's great that feedbacks are good.

239
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,660
Thank you, have a great day!

240
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,060
Are you done for the day, CEO Anna?

241
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,830
Yes, this was my last one.

242
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,930
We can go back to Seoul now.

243
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,560
Yes, I will get us going.

244
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:41,300
CEO Anna, your face doesn't look good. Are you okay?

245
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,960
Do you want me to stop the car?

246
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,980
No.

247
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:49,050
I can rest when I get home.

248
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,770
Please, just keep driving.

249
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,760
Yes.

250
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,390
CEO Anna, we are here.

251
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,870
Are you okay, CEO Anna?

252
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,510
Yes, I'm sorry.

253
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,500
CEO Anna, are you okay?

254
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,520
Should I pat on your back?

255
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,520
No. I am okay.

256
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,200
Here.

257
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,810
Thank you.

258
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,250
Driver Park, I am sorry,

259
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,980
but can you help me go inside?

260
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,740
Yes, let's go in.

261
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,960
I don't think you're okay.

262
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,640
How about going to a hospital? I'll go with you.

263
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:42,370
No, it's okay. I think I have indigestion from what I ate at the event.

264
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:45,850
I'll be okay once I rest.

265
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:50,230
Then, I will go and buy the medicine for you.

266
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:52,660
Yes. Thank you, Driver Park.

267
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,670
Not at all. Wait a few minutes.

268
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,850
I didn't want to be like this in front of him.

269
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:08,050
Wonder what's going on with me.

270
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:23,820
CEO Anna, please take this medicine.

271
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,360
Here.

272
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,480
Thank you, Driver Park.

273
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,010
I'm really sorry that you have to see me like this.

274
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:58,150
I've made it too hard for you today.

275
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,650
Not at all.

276
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:04,440
CEO Anna, you need to get better soon.

277
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:11,750
Yes, since I took medicine, I will be okay.

278
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:15,430
Please go to the hospital tomorrow.

279
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:21,150
Yes, thank you. I will do that.

280
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,370
I will get going now.

281
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,760
Driver Park, please wait a minute.

282
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,750
Here.

283
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:51,050
I almost forgot to give you this when you worked so hard for me.

284
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:56,010
No, I can do this for you.

285
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:59,360
You've been so good to my Dan Dan all this time.

286
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,690
No. Please accept it.

287
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:04,620
If you don't, I will feel terrible.

288
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,880
Please don't.

289
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,370
Then, have some rest.

290
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:12,790
If you have any other issues, please call me.

291
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:21,410
I wanted to go on a drive with him

292
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:24,690
and eat something nice.

293
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:28,240
I wanted to have a good time with him.

294
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,710
That's strange.

295
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:47,010
Wonder where she's sick.

296
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:51,320
She was like that when she first came back to Korea as well.

297
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,330
Yes, it's me.

298
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,010
Where are you, Honey?

299
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,330
Let's have a party tonight.

300
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:03,200
Sister-in-law and everyone else is coming.

301
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,870
Are you not done with work yet?

302
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,720
No, I'm done. I'm on my way.

303
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,800
What about Dan Dan?

304
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,370
She's on her way.

305
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:14,700
Okay, I will be home soon.

306
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:27,610
Dan Dan and your niece are here.

307
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:30,520
But where is the eldest son of the family?

308
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,180
Pardon?

309
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:36,200
I'm talking about Dae Beom. Our family's eldest son.

310
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,270
He's been busy with work lately.

311
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:45,150
So he took time off and went on a vacation.

312
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:51,120
You have to travel a lot when you are young to broaden your worldview.

313
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:56,160
Ask him to come by my store when he comes back.

314
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,050
Yes, I will.

315
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,360
I'm home!

316
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,560
- Welcome home.
- Dad!

317
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,190
Congratulations on getting a business!

318
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,560
Thank you, my daughter.

319
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,270
- Congratulations, Uncle!
- Thank you, Mi Rim.

320
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,120
I'm sorry for being late.

321
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,790
It's okay. Please sit.

322
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:14,670
We've all been waiting for you.

323
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:22,100
Son-in-law Park, your sister brought this expensive beef for you! So we were about to have a grill party.

324
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,470
Now that the main star is here let's eat.

325
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,340
Please sit, Honey.

326
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,360
- Please help yourself.
- Yes, it's good. The stew is good too.

327
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,870
Mi Rim, you're good at grilling!

328
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,980
- It looks good.
- It tastes good.

329
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,340
Eat as much as you want.

330
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:42,930
But Noona, Noona, hold on a second.

331
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:47,680
Shouldn't we stop to celebrate my Brother-in-law's big day?

332
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,690
That's right. We should.

333
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:53,060
I was too busy eating.

334
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,020
Here. Ta-da! Everyone!

335
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,490
Please look at this.

336
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,700
This is our store lease contract.

337
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,940
And look at this as well.

338
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,260
The leaseholder, Park Soo Chul!

339
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,490
It feels real now.

340
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:17,390
Boss Park Soo Chul, please say a word.

341
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:23,180
You're making me embarrassed. I didn't open the store yet.

342
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,660
Thank you for gathering here to congratulate me.

343
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,680
For my sister, who trusted me and helped,

344
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,970
I will work hard and make sure to be successful.

345
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,830
Boss! Boss!

346
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,080
Yes, Soo Chul. You can do it!

347
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,710
Yes.

348
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,760
Thank you, Aunt.

349
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,770
Thank you very much.

350
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,910
- Thank you.
-Thank you.

351
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,210
Thank you.

352
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:55,180
Why are you all saying that?

353
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,760
It's nothing.

354
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:03,160
Honey...

355
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,930
Please, have some more.

356
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,920
Okay, everyone!

357
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,200
To wish my brother-in-law big success,

358
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,090
let's all cheer shouting "Family Chicken Daebak."

359
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,140
Did you all get your glass?

360
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,550
One, two, three.

361
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:25,130
Family Chicken Daebak!

362
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,510
Have a good night.

363
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,620
Please stay healthy.

364
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,190
Thank you.

365
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,140
Come to my house sometime, Dan Dan.

366
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,400
Yes, Aunt.

367
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,010
Mi Rim, please come to my house with Dan Dan.

368
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:52,200
Yes, thank you.

369
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,870
- Good night.
- I will walk you to the car.

370
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,930
Have a goodnight. Goodbye.

371
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:00,030
Good night.

372
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:03,420
Yes, please do not come out.

373
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:09,140
Really? Did you get a job, Uncle?

374
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:13,510
Yes, he did. He's a big company's driver now.

375
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:16,360
Congratulations, Uncle.

376
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,810
I should've talked about this when our in-law was here.

377
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:22,360
I forgot all about it.

378
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,830
My mom can't stop bragging about Geon.

379
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,930
You really are awesome, Uncle.

380
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:33,290
- Uncle, which company is it?
- What?

381
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:38,390
It's Dan Dan's Chairman's company. The FT Group.

382
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:41,250
What? The FT Group?

383
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,230
I didn't know until I got the job.

384
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,840
I only knew it after your father told me.

385
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,520
Dan Dan, would that make you uncomfortable?

386
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,270
No, there's no reason for me to be uncomfortable.

387
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,210
You're working at the office.

388
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:01,010
It's fine with me, so don't worry.

389
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:04,270
Thank you, Dan Dan.

390
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:07,010
It's late already.

391
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:10,360
Are you not staying here tonight?

392
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,270
I have to go.

393
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:16,250
Dad, I will get going now.

394
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:20,190
Right, hurry up and go. You'll be late.

395
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:24,570
Dad, please take this.

396
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:28,710
I'm sure you spent a lot of money to open the restaurant.

397
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:32,420
I hope this helps a bit.

398
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,190
I'm so proud of you!

399
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:40,900
Dan Dan is the only one who thinks of us.

400
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:45,670
How much is this?

401
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:48,400
It's ten million won.

402
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:52,740
Ten million won?

403
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,280
Give it to me.

404
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,520
Why? Dan Dan gave it to you in the thought of you.

405
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,040
Just give it to me.

406
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,580
What money do you have?

407
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,720
Take it back and spend it for yourself.

408
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,940
Dad, I have no need for money.

409
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,390
- So please--
- No, just take it back.

410
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:17,290
Let's go. I will walk you to the bus stop.

411
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:20,030
Bye, Dan Dan.

412
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:24,660
How could he embarrass me like that?

413
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:29,860
Seriously, it's ridiculous.

414
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:41,220
Honey, how can you humiliate me like that in front of the family?

415
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,500
Did I ask Dan Dan for money?

416
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,270
I took what she wanted to give us. But how can you take that away like that?

417
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,210
Did I take something I shouldn't have?

418
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:52,730
Why do you make me a bad person?

419
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:55,240
Okay, I'm sorry about that.

420
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,330
But how could we take that money?

421
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:01,270
You borrowed money from your sister, who you reunited with fifty years.

422
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,220
Why can't you take money from Dan Dan?

423
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,460
It's the reward for raising her.

424
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,050
What? A reward for raising her?

425
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:11,390
Listen to yourself.

426
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:14,300
That's hard-earned money from looking after three kids in a stranger's house.

427
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,850
How can a parent accept that money from their child?

428
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,180
Why can't you?

429
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,840
Dan Dan is not a stranger.

430
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:23,740
Besides, she's giving it to you as a good daughter, so why not?

431
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:26,830
Do we become bad parents for accepting it?

432
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:31,170
We could pay it back if we succeed later.

433
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:34,990
We could pay it back when she gets married!

434
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,860
Where are you going at this hour?

435
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,970
What did I do wrong?

436
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:48,890
It's past midnight.

437
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:51,730
Why is Ms. Park Noona not home yet?

438
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:54,720
It's dangerous to go around this late at night.

439
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,710
What if she runs into a scum on her way home?

440
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,680
I'm worried.

441
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:06,880
I've no choice. I will have to set a curfew from now on.

442
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,680
Are you coming home now, Ms. Park Noona?

443
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,260
Yes, I'm sorry I'm late.

444
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,910
Don't be.

445
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,420
You are a bit late, but it's okay.

446
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,380
Did you have a good time at home?

447
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,870
Was everything good?

448
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,620
Yes.

449
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,930
Then go upstairs and go to sleep.

450
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:38,380
Yes. Good night.

451
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:50,440
I can go to sleep now.

452
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,920
I'm tired.

453
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,480
- I'm going to work, Mom.
- Sarah!

454
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,910
Drink this first.

455
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:01,370
What is it?

456
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:04,140
Don't ask about it and just drink it.

457
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,870
It's good for you.

458
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:08,570
Still, I should know what it is.

459
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:11,470
It's called medicine for keeping your youth.

460
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:17,840
If you drink it consistently, you will have rejuvenated skin.

461
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,510
Really?

462
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:23,790
Didn't you say you wanted to look younger? I searched everywhere for it.

463
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:28,130
Hurry up and drink it. It's expensive, so don't leave a drop.

464
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,150
Okay.

465
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,800
Get younger! Get younger!

466
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,180
Mom, what's wrong with the taste?

467
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,430
It's a bit fishy and makes me nauseous.

468
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,380
What's wrong with that?

469
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,450
Hold your nose and just swallow it.

470
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:46,970
Get it all down.

471
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,060
There you go.

472
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:53,140
There you go, Sarah.

473
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,590
That's right!

474
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,340
That's right.

475
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,600
Don't leave any drop.

476
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,640
Yes, Driver Kang.

477
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:15,060
Chief Jo, I injured my arm during the vacation, so I couldn't come to work.

478
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,160
I'm sorry.

479
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,290
Is your arm okay?

480
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,890
The doctor said it'll take two weeks to get treated.

481
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:24,180
What should I do?

482
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:27,500
Two weeks? I get it.

483
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,320
I will ask for a driver from the office.

484
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,850
Don't worry and receive your treatment well.

485
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:34,580
Yes.

486
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,430
He should have been careful.

487
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:41,750
Madam will not be happy about this.

488
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:51,130
What's wrong with my stomach?

489
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:55,690
Is it because I forcefully drank that earlier?

490
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,900
It doesn't feel okay.

491
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,330
You stay like this, and when you hear the starting gun,

492
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:06,720
you sprint out like this.

493
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,030
Then you will get first place in running for sure. Did you get it?

494
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,470
Dad, that's not the pose.

495
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:14,400
We do it this way to start.

496
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,380
Ah, is that so?

497
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,780
I guess they do an easier start pose for kindergartners.

498
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:23,160
The important thing is, the start is crucial for a race.

499
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,740
The moment you hear the bang, you have to sprint. Got it?

500
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,220
Yes.

501
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,120
Chairman.

502
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,680
Why, Chief Jo Noona?

503
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,190
Driver Kang took two weeks of sick leave due to an injury.

504
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:39,530
So we will have a temporary driver from the company.

505
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,610
Is that so? I get it.

506
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:46,460
Dad, let's go to the yard and practice running.

507
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,630
I want to get first place.

508
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:51,260
Yes, just trust me. Let's try it.

509
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:54,640
Get ready. Bang!

510
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,960
Chief Jo.

511
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,290
Madam.

512
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:06,410
Please call Driver Kang. I have to go to the department store.

513
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:09,700
Driver Kang took two weeks off due to an injury.

514
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:14,670
Sick leave? What do I do then? I'm meeting the lady of Sunny Department store for lunch today.

515
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,230
I can't miss it.

516
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:20,260
Right. You can drive me there.

517
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,660
Madam, today I have to go to Se Jong's athletic competition.

518
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:27,600
That's in the afternoon. It won't take long.

519
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,500
Besides, Ms. Park will be there, so no need to worry. I'll be late, let's go!

520
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,210
Yes.

521
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:45,560
It's a fantastic sunny day today.

522
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,520
It's a day you want to travel.

523
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,260
Before it gets too cold, maybe I should visit Se Ryun in New York.

524
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:56,620
It's no good if it gets too cold in New York.

525
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:00,960
Oh my, what are you doing?

526
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,200
Chief Jo, how can you drive like that?

527
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,890
I'm sorry, Madam.

528
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:14,540
My stomach hurt so much.

529
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,990
Madam, I think I'm going to die.

530
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:19,500
What's wrong, Chief Jo?

531
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,620
Chief Jo? What's going on?

532
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:26,890
Oh, my! What should I do?

533
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,960
Sarah, what happened?

534
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,710
- You're here.
- Dae Ran, what happened to my daughter?

535
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,610
What happened to her?

536
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:40,410
I don't know. Her face suddenly got pale while driving.

537
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:44,630
She said her stomach was aching so much, so we got an ambulance, and they said she had food poisoning.

538
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,570
Food poisoning? Sarah!

539
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:50,060
It's not even the middle of summer. What did she eat this morning?

540
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,990
This morning?

541
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,180
She didn't eat anything unusual.

542
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:58,730
Mom. That stuff this morning.

543
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,610
What was that?

544
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:03,980
That stuff I drank.

545
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,400
That's something good! It's medicine.

546
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,140
I'm asking what was in the medicine! You must know.

547
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:14,280
Yes. It has frogs,

548
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,220
- slugs, snakes,
- Slugs...

549
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,150
and also...

550
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:23,310
It has centipedes and black goats.

551
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:30,240
Did I put in too many things?

552
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,180
Hey, all of that is good for your body!

553
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,770
Chairman.

554
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,670
Are you going somewhere?

555
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:46,890
What do you mean? I'm going to Se Jong's Athletic competition.

556
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,690
- Are you coming too?
- Of course!

557
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,910
It's my Se Jong's event. I should go.

558
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:55,460
There will be games for fathers, and there is a game to play with the father and child together.

559
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:58,130
Of course, I should go.

560
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,330
But Chief Jo said I should go alone.

561
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:06,040
Since other people don't know about your memory loss,

562
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:10,520
just in case you make a mistake.

563
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,380
I won't make a mistake. Don't worry about that.

564
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,980
Let's go.

565
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:18,910
Still, what if something happens?

566
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:21,910
Especially when Chief Jo can't come with us.

567
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:25,150
Ms. Park Noona. Please don't worry about things like that.

568
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,590
I have a good sense now.

569
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:33,720
If I don't go to things like this, Se Jong will be discouraged.

570
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,270
Then, Chairman, you must be very careful.

571
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:40,280
My goodness! Ms. Park Noona.

572
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,210
Do you think I'm stupid? Let's go!

573
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:46,150
Our Se Jong's waiting.

574
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,370
What do I do? Would it be okay?

575
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,370
Se Jong, don't worry. I'll win it all for you. Do you trust me?

576
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:02,550
Dad, fighting!

577
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:05,950
Yes, fighting!

578
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,030
Ms. Park Noona, watch what I do.

579
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:12,720
I have a strong arm strength than I look.

580
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,870
Fighting!

581
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,630
Okay, The blue team!

582
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:18,400
Please come in!

583
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,960
Fighting!

584
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,470
The red team, please come in!

585
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,860
Okay. Fathers, please get ready.

586
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,670
Play it fair and square.

587
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:23,910
- Go, blue team!
- Go, red team!

588
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:26,890
Ready, set, go!

589
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:30,640
- Go, blue team!
- Go, red team!

590
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,940
It's okay, Se Jong.

591
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,720
Se Jong.

592
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:01,850
Don't cry. I will win it for you.

593
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:05,760
- Really?
- Of course.

594
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,934
Don't worry.

595
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,740
[Family Chicken]

596
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:20,020
Mom, it's here. Here.

597
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:23,430
The neighborhood looks so clean. The business will do well.

598
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:25,010
Mom, let's go in.

599
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:27,940
Mi Rim, let's go in.

600
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:32,200
My goodness! Hey!

601
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,010
We will be getting customers shortly.

602
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,650
What are you looking at instead of getting ready?

603
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:42,480
Hyung. That new Boss Park from the Family Chicken restaurant.

604
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,310
It looks like he has a large family.

605
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:47,730
I'm envious.

606
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,200
There's no need to be jealous.

607
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:59,780
Imagine how hard he has to work to feed all those families?

608
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:04,200
You have a better life. Come inside and chop the meat.

609
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,200
Hurry.

610
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:16,880
Oh my. Did you make all these?

611
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,770
Yes.

612
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:20,810
When did you learn to do this?

613
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:23,380
I learned a bit when I worked at the market.

614
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,980
I'm learning everything from Sergeant Heo at the moment.

615
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,190
Mi Rim, try it. Please have some, Mother-in-law.

616
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:30,720
- Yes.
- Mom, here you go.

617
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:37,100
Uncle, it's delicious.

618
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:41,350
Maybe because you made this, it tastes great!

619
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:43,810
- It's delicious.
- Really?

620
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:46,250
Does it really taste okay?

621
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:49,360
Yes, it's okay.

622
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:56,430
The store is nice and neat, too.

623
00:43:56,430 --> 00:44:00,860
Where is the owner? I wanted to thank him.

624
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:04,770
He's gone to the bank. He will be back soon.

625
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:07,360
It wouldn't need a lot of renovations either.

626
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,360
It looks like they took good care of it.

627
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,610
I think we just need to change the utensils to new ones.

628
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:17,490
Why don't you work part-time here when we open, Mi Rim?

629
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:22,190
I will think about it if you pay me more than other places.

630
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:24,700
Mi Rim, you are not giving an inch.

631
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:30,260
Of course, you should. You have to make sure of those to become successful.

632
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:35,310
By the way, I have something to tell you.

633
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:36,920
What is it?

634
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,410
I am moving in with a friend.

635
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:42,220
Are you moving out?

636
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,950
Which friend?

637
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:48,100
My friend from the academy. We will pay half and half.

638
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:51,720
Still, you should live with me.

639
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,740
Otherwise, you won't eat well.

640
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,650
I should get the certificate soon and get a job.

641
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:00,780
And I wanted to live with a friend too.

642
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:04,240
Sure. If you're living with a friend,

643
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,280
you can share information, and it can be a bit of good competition.

644
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:11,990
Sure. Okay.

645
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:15,940
Since you will be eating poorly from now on, eat some more.

646
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:18,290
Yes, Grandma.

647
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:21,660
Mom, you should eat too. Here's a big one.

648
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,330
It's really good.

649
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:27,230
It's really good. You're amazing!

650
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,220
Boo!

651
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,940
Ta-da!

652
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,800
What is all this?

653
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,720
I couldn't just let our first day go by.

654
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:44,670
I bought the cake and flowers and brought the other stuff from home.

655
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:47,700
What? I'm touched.

656
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,460
Really? I succeed then.

657
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,860
Have a seat.

658
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:58,040
I didn't bring anything but my clothes. Thank you.

659
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:02,210
The cake is really pretty. It's nice.

660
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:05,670
Let's take photos to mark our first day.

661
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,730
Sure.

662
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:13,380
It's so pretty.

663
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:30,210
Friend, how do you feel on our first day of living together?

664
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:36,270
I'm not sure, but I think it will be fun.

665
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:43,330
I hope we have a happy relationship.

666
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:45,070
It's your turn.

667
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:46,890
Okay.

668
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:54,650
Okay, Mi Rim, how do you feel about our first day together?

669
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:56,880
I'm excited.

670
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,940
And I think a lot of good things will happen.

671
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:06,310
Let's have a good relationship for a long time.

672
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,740
Get ready.

673
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,030
Play it fair and square.

674
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:17,640
- Go, blue team!
- Go, red team!

675
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,050
Go, Park Dan Dan!

676
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:20,850
Ready, set, go!

677
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:24,220
- Go, blue team!
- Go, red team!

678
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:30,340
Yes!

679
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:42,490
Fighting!

680
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:45,550
Fighting! Park Dan Dan!

681
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:48,740
Ready! Set!

682
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:53,240
- Go, blue team!
- Go, red team!

683
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,210
Park Dan Dan! Park Dan Dan!

684
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,380
Didn't I do good?

685
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:10,110
This is the last round.

686
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:13,960
Both competitors, please come out.

687
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:18,900
Ms. Park, if you beat her, we win.

688
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:21,670
The thing about arm wrestling,

689
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:24,420
it's not about strength but strategy.

690
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,550
You have to overpower them with your gaze.

691
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:28,630
Keep your eye on her, and don't lose confidence.

692
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:31,320
Good luck.

693
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,570
Go, Ms. Park...

694
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:52,170
Oh, no. We're going to lose to that family again.

695
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:57,220
Se Jong, don't worry. I will be sure to win.

696
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,050
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

697
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,460
Get ready!

698
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:07,650
- Go, blue team!
- Go, red team!

699
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:09,110
Play it fair and square.

700
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:10,940
- Go, blue team!
- Go, red team!

701
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:13,180
Ready, set, go!

702
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,160
- Go, blue team!
- Go, red team!

703
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,440
Park Dan Dan!

704
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,120
Park Dan Dan!

705
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,760
- Go, Ms. Park!
- Yes!

706
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,710
- Go, Ms. Park!
- Go, Park Dan Dan!

707
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:35,600
- Go, Ms. Park!
- Stay strong! You can do it.

708
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,700
You did it!

709
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:58,850
♫ A smile blooms in every step ♫

710
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:02,650

711
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:05,720
- Yes.
- Yes.

♫ Strangely, I'm drawn to you ♫

00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,520

715
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,710

It's okay, Dad and Ms. Park.

721
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:46,700
We can win the next one.

722
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:57,260

744
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:39,890
- Chairman!
- Dad!

745
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,680
Chairman, your nose is bleeding.

746
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,350
You have a nosebleed.

747
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:49,650
You're bleeding! What should I do?

748
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:54,560
Did you do well today, Se Jong?

749
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,860
Yes. It was so much fun.

750
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:00,620
Ms. Park won the arm wrestle contest.

751
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:05,020
But she's now a stone head Ms. Park.

752
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:07,800
Stone-head Ms. Park? What is that?

753
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,690
While Ms. Park and Dad were in the cookie-eating race,

754
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:15,150
she bumped my dad's nose with her head

755
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,380
and made his nosebleed.

756
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:21,660
So my dad called her head is a stone head.

757
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:24,560
What?

758
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,210
Are you going to tease me too?

759
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:31,670
I'm sorry, but it's too funny.

760
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:34,320
What about the Chairman? Why isn't he coming in?

761
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,550
Did he go to the hospital for a nose bleed?

762
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:39,960
He's going to get ice cream.

763
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,710
His nose bleeding was minor.

764
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:46,510
Se Jong, let's go upstairs and wash up.

765
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:48,300
Yes.

766
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:56,380
Se Jong must have had a great time. He's so excited!

767
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:10,130
You scammer thief!

768
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:12,770
You parasite bastard!

769
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:14,070
You!

770
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:16,390
You come here!

771
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:17,860
Mom, Mom, Mom!

772
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:20,610
How dare you grab my son's head!

773
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:22,410
Mom. Mom!

774
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:24,450
Grandma!

775
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:30,560
The company sent me, so I'm here. But what should I do?

776
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:33,730
Am I getting fired on the first day of work?

777
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:37,520
The world is filled with landmines.

778
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,910
Nothing is simple.

779
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:43,450
It's driving me crazy!

780
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:48,970
Okay, even if I get fired,

781
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:51,410
let's face it.

782
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:53,560
Hyung!

783
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:58,150
It's you from the convenience store.

784
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:01,930
Yes, right. But what are you doing here?

785
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:04,730
What are you doing at my house?

786
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:06,840
Did you come to see me?

787
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,760
Your house?

788
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,110
What are you all doing!

789
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:14,850
Stop right now!

790
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:19,790
I thought he looked familiar, but he's the Chairman.

791
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:23,070
That is... Sir.

792
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,120
I've been sent here by the office.

793
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,330
I'm here as a temporary driver.

794
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:29,890
Temporary driver?

795
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:35,500
- Yes, I've heard about it. Was it you?
- Yes, sir.

796
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,170
Then we should go inside.

797
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:41,720
It's just great that it's you.

798
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:46,240
What do you mean?

799
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:51,960
You are Park Dan Dan, our Ms. Park Noona's uncle?

800
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,350
Yes.

801
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:59,640
What sort of a fate is this? It's crazy!

802
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:04,050
I've heard he lost memory. He does seem strange.

803
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:07,430
It's like he's missing a screw.

804
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:10,030
That must be why he doesn't recognize me.

805
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:15,100
But still, why is he calling Dan Dan, Ms. Park Noona?

806
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,560
Uncle.

807
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,900
Yes, Dan Dan.

808
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,680
Ms. Park Noona. I heard he's your uncle.

809
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,650
Yes.

810
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:33,180
But what brought you here, Uncle?

811
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:37,810
He's been temporarily posted here while Driver Kang is on sick leave.

812
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:40,530
Is that true, Uncle?

813
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:43,850
Yes. That's how it turned out.

814
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:48,880
What? Who's doing our driver?

815
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,950
Hey! How dare you come here?

816
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:54,500
Get out, now!

817
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,790
How dare you come back here, you parasite dirtbag!

818
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:02,230
Ajumma, what are you doing to the person I've hired?

819
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:04,040
Who do you think you are, Ajumma?

820
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,830
Young Gook, it's not like that.

821
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:08,660
Get into your room, now.

822
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,220
You need to hear me, Young Gook!

823
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:13,000
Get into your room, now!

824
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:37,820
It'd be better if his memory came back.

825
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:41,530
Even if I'm a mistress, I'm his sister's mother.

826
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:48,070
How can he humiliate me like that in front of a stranger? I can't live like this.

827
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:52,610
Rather than getting a ride in a car driven by that bastard,

828
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:55,260
I'd ride a bike.

829
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:57,220
I can't live like this.

830
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:59,100
This is really getting on my nerves.

831
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:03,040
I can't do this.

832
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,560
I can't live like this.

833
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,050
Hyung, please come in.

834
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,440
Yes, sir.

835
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:12,010
Hyung, I'm the owner of this house.

836
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:14,390
So don't worry about that Ajumma earlier.

837
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:18,460
- While you are here, make yourself at home.
- Yes, sir.

838
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:20,300
I was already happy that it was you.

839
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:25,400
And knowing that you are Ms. Park Noona's uncle makes me trust you even more.

840
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,710
Hyung, let's get along well from now on.

841
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:31,720
Yes, sir.

842
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:34,760
Ms. Park Noona. Since Chief Jo Noona is not here,

843
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:38,700
please explain the stuff around our house to him.

844
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,450
Yes, Chairman.

845
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:43,490
Then, I will leave it to you two.

846
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:45,200
Yes.

847
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:51,360
Dan Dan.

848
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:56,650
I was told by the secretary to keep his memory loss a secret.

849
00:58:56,650 --> 00:59:01,240
But he's acting much more strange.

850
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:06,490
He's calling me Hyung even though he's much older than me. What's going on?

851
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:11,100
Chairman thinks he is 22 years old.

852
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:14,680
He's lost all the memory after that age.

853
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:18,630
What? How did that happen?

854
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:23,680
Actually, this is something only the family and immediate people know.

855
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,860
So you should be careful too.

856
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:30,330
Okay, I got it.

857
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:33,440
I can't quit when I'm already here.

858
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,670
I only need to be here for two weeks. So I will keep my head down until I go back to the office.

859
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:40,110
So don't worry too much, Dan Dan.

860
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:42,320
Yes, Uncle.

861
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:45,950
Don't worry about me.

862
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:49,590
But wasn't that Madam too much?

863
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:56,940
She knows Dae Beom wasn't mooching off, and how can she still act like that?

864
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:05,870
You look good in anything you put on.

865
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:10,060
It feels great to try different clothes on you.

866
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:13,100
I do have a good body.

867
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,500
And you're cute as a puppy, too.

868
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,970
You are cute and handsome.

869
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:19,780
You are everything.

870
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:25,300
Now that you said all that, I can't stop myself.

871
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:26,590
It's nice.

872
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:29,970
Hey! You're mine. Don't forget!

873
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:34,890
Okay, okay. I will tattoo "Se Ryun's" right here if you want.

874
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:38,390
What are you saying? Will you do that for real?

875
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:40,790
For real, of course. I'm not joking.

876
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:43,230
Right, right. Look at this.

877
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:45,380
This is yours.

878
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,300
What is it?

879
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:51,570
It goes so well with your clothes right now.

880
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:52,690
Try it on.

881
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:53,870
A watch?

882
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:55,650
This can do that, too.

883
01:00:55,650 --> 01:01:00,610
Look. If I press it here.

884
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:02,690
Look at here.

885
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:04,160
It shows the same thing with the phone!

886
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,050
Wow!

887
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:08,320
I will be back.

888
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:13,150
Wait a second. Don't forget to take this with you.

889
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:15,140
Have a good visit.

890
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:17,550
Thank you, Se Ryun.

891
01:01:18,910 --> 01:01:20,420
Call me when you are coming back.

892
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:22,590
I will be back.

893
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:30,330
He's so handsome.

894
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:32,270
He's so cute!

895
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:39,250
What's this?

896
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:44,660
Why there's such a nice car in front of our house?

897
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:53,200
What's all this?

898
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,230
Oh, my goodness.

899
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:58,770
These are all expensive luxury brands goods. Who brought it here?

900
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:00,070
Mom.

901
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:04,170
Dae Beom. What's going on? When did you come?

902
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:06,040
A few minutes ago.

903
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:09,740
What are all these? Did you bring these?

904
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:12,090
Yes, these are gifts for you and Dad.

905
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:15,460
And those are for Grandma, Mi Rim, Uncle, and Dan Dan.

906
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:20,250
How did you buy all these? Where did you get the money?

907
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:24,200
Mom, I'm back together with Se Ryun.

908
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,060
What? Who?

909
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:28,280
Do you mean that house's daughter?

910
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:31,090
Are you crazy? No way.

911
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:33,810
It doesn't matter even if you oppose. I've made up my mind.

912
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:37,720
Wake up, you fool! Not with that woman.

913
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:42,380
She's much older than you and once married.

914
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:46,150
She didn't get married, and we are not having an affair.

915
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:50,830
There are no legal problems for me to date her. So don't worry.

916
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:54,090
Dae Beom, you can't date that family's daughter.

917
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:57,220
You know how that family treated us.

918
01:02:57,220 --> 01:03:02,180
Why don't you work at Dad's new chicken place?

919
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:04,260
What? Chicken place?

920
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:09,700
Yes. Your dad is starting a chicken business. So forget about Se Ryun.

921
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:12,660
Let's run the chicken place together, okay?

922
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:15,740
Mom, I don't want to do stuff like that anymore.

923
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:18,360
- What?
- I don't want to live like that anymore.

924
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:21,370
How much money can you make with that?

925
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:26,450
I didn't take a day off selling chicken skewers and made no money.

926
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:28,630
I don't want to live a pathetic life anymore.

927
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:32,590
I will live next to Se Ryun, in the same class of life as her.

928
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:33,650
Dae Beom.

929
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:35,140
Why? Am I not allowed to do so?

930
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:39,910
Why can't I have a lot of money, spend it freely and drive a nice car?

931
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:41,930
I'm going to live like that, so accept it.

932
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:45,880
Hey, Park Dae Beom. Get yourself together.

933
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:52,340
Please use this money to buy things you need and for the store.

934
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:55,640
And please, do not call me.

935
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,340
Nor text me.

936
01:03:57,340 --> 01:04:00,070
I'll live my life on my own.

937
01:04:04,810 --> 01:04:06,970
Dae Beom. Dae Beom.

938
01:04:06,970 --> 01:04:09,300
Park Dae Beom!

939
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:15,720
Dae Beom, Dae Beom!

940
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:19,620
She must have bought him that car too.

941
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:23,230
What should I do with him now?

942
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:53,040
How many one million won checks are these?

943
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,330
What are you doing?

944
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:58,780
What are all these?

945
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:02,210
What are those checks?

946
01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:06,480
I'm asking you what those are!

947
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,990
Honey.

948
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:12,690
Actually, Dae Beom came by.

949
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:16,690
What? Dae Beom?

950
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:29,770
You did it!

951
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:45,350
Chairman! Your nose is bleeding.

952
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:47,930
What should I do?

953
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:55,460
Ms. Park Noona really has a stone head.

954
01:05:55,460 --> 01:06:00,270
I've never seen a woman with such a hard head.

955
01:06:04,650 --> 01:06:07,680
Hyun Bin Sunbae.

956
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:11,980
That hotel? Yes, I know that place.

957
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:15,040
Are we meeting there? Sounds good.

958
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,220
Yes.

959
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:20,150
It's my first time, so I'm very excited.

960
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:22,340
- It's been a while.
- What?

961
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:24,890
Hotel?

962
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:31,660
Is Ms. Park Noona going to a hotel with that guy?

963
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:40,480
[YNB Language Academy]

964
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:06,470
Sunbae, shouldn't we get a bottle of wine?

965
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:07,960
Or maybe some flowers.

966
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:10,340
It's all spent by the club fees.

967
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:12,550
Let's go in.

968
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:17,310
But still.

969
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:19,700
It's okay, I said.

970
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:32,540
I wondered about it, but how can she do this to me?

971
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:36,500
How can Ms. Park Noona do this to me?

972
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:42,460
- Sunbaenim!
- Dan Dan!

973
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:44,100
It's Dan Dan.

974
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,980
Congratulations on your wedding, Sunbaenim.

975
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:48,000
Thank you.

976
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,040
But is everyone leaving already? I don't think it's started.

977
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:53,990
Her brother rented a big club room. Let's go there.

978
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:57,750
I see. It sounds good.

979
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:59,860
Let's go.

980
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:02,040
Have you been well?

981
01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:07,450
I have to save my naive Ms. Park Noona.

982
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:12,830
He definitely forced her in when she didn't want to go.

983
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:19,800
Chairman..?

984
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:41,600
♫ Woo, it's a happy day like a dream, yeah ♫

985
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:03,430
♫ A smile blooms in every step ♫

986
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:06,610
[Young Lady and Gentleman]

987
01:09:06,610 --> 01:09:10,920
Let's focus and try to like Chief Jo Noona. That could help me get the memory back quickly too.

988
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:12,470
Sure, I'm leaving this house.

989
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:14,930
I can't stand living in this house anymore.

990
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:16,350
- Open that safe now.
- What did you say?

991
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:19,260
Give my gold bars and money back!

992
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:20,480
This Ajumma!

993
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,390
Why are you acting like this? This is not you.

994
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:24,810
- What have you done for me?
- Dae Beom.

995
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:26,820
I'm not your real son anyway!

996
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:27,930
Yes, please come in.

997
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:29,280
- Ajussi!
- Sokcho Night Beach.

998
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,550
Did you dig on my back? Are you crazy?

999
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:32,700
- Please quit this job.
- What?

1000
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:35,340
Why do you care if Ms. Park Noona is single or not?

1001
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:37,880
What is he doing to our naive Ms. Park Noona?

1002
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,690
What are you doing?

1003
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:40,950
I didn't know you were there.

1004
01:09:40,950 --> 01:09:42,990
This is not something that's within my power.

1005
01:09:42,990 --> 01:09:44,370
I will have to ask her to quit.

1006
01:09:44,370 --> 01:09:48,290
Do you have something to tell me?
