[Episode 32]

2
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,650
Who are you? What's your true identity?

3
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,670
Who are you?

4
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,610
Soo Chul.

5
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,960
What's going on? Are you angry at me a lot?

6
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,230
Please sit down first. Let's have tea and talk it over.

7
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:56,760
No, thank you. I've told you I would not go to the US with you.

8
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,500
I've said all I've come to say. I'll get going now.

9
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,300
I will not come back here.

10
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,970
Please do not see my wife again. I'm begging you.

11
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:14,620
Please stay healthy. Goodbye.

12
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,210
Soo Chul!

13
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,160
What am I thinking?

14
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:38,180
She can't be Ji Young. They look totally different.

15
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,170
What nonsense...

16
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,510
Sarah, what are you doing?

17
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:56,070
Why are you scarfing down so much food?

18
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:02,120
Mom. I'm hungry. No matter how much I eat, I feel hungry.

19
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,110
Hey, stop that.

20
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,620
This is so upsetting!

21
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:14,860
Here, drink some water. Oh, my! Hey!

22
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,370
Sarah, why are you doing this?

23
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,150
Get yourself together, Sarah.

24
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,690
Sarah, let's stop this and leave.

25
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:31,500
We could move abroad or move to deep in mountain Jirisan.

26
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,290
Let's throw everything away and start fresh.

27
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,790
Hey, Sarah. Houses are too expensive in Seoul anyway.

28
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,870
Let's end it here and go.

29
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:48,500
Mom, I can never end it. You know it well.

30
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:54,660
The reason why I can't end it, you know better than anyone else.

31
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:01,580
Why can't you end it? Why? You just have to end it. Why not?

32
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,650
My goodness! Seriously!

33
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,670
Se Chan.

34
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,760
Se Chan. Please give me a few minutes to talk.

35
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,680
What is it about? But first, please let go of my hand.

36
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,830
Okay, I'm sorry.

37
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:35,950
Se Chan, when I scolded you before, it wasn't because I didn't like you.

38
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,970
You're the eldest son of this house, the heir of the FT Group.

39
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:45,660
That's why. I wanted to get you on the right path so that you don't veer off.

40
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,090
It's not because I treat you differently from Se Jong. It was for you.

41
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:57,520
But I went overboard. I want to apologize. I'm so sorry.

42
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,320
Okay, then.

43
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:05,240
Se Chan, can you please tell your dad? Ask him to forgive me, please.

44
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:11,590
I don't like getting in the middle of adults' conversations. Please tell him yourself, directly.

45
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,420
Se Chan, please?

46
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,250
Please stop doing this. I will go inside now.

47
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,810
Chairman.

48
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,490
Chief Jo, what are you doing here?

49
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:43,030
Chairman, I was very wrong to lock up Se Chan in the storage room.

50
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,430
But it wasn't because I didn't like him.

51
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,270
It's to put him on the right path and raise him well.

52
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:54,260
He will be the heir of the FT Group. He can't be on the wrong track.

53
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,740
That's why I was overly strict with him. I won't do that again.

54
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,700
Please give me another chance, Chairman.

55
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:09,230
No, Chief Jo. It's over. Please don't do this.

56
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,810
Chairman.

57
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:19,500
How can you be like this? Do you know how much the 22-year-old you loved me?

58
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,130
When your memory of that time comes back, you will regret how you are now.

59
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:30,620
All the words you said and the promises you made, what do they all mean?

60
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,890
Please!

61
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:37,650
Stop telling me about the 22-year-old me I have no memory of. I don't want to hear it anymore.

62
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,040
Even if I liked you then,

63
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,700
I, of now, can't be with you.

64
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,720
Please do not come back like this.

65
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,180
Chairman.

66
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,390
Chairman. Chairman!

67
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,800
Chairman.

68
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,720
Ajussi.

69
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,460
Why are you going this far?

70
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,360
Why are you throwing away your self-respect?

71
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,460
People live on with self-respect.

72
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,860
If you throw even that away,

73
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,790
you won't be able to get back up again.

74
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:58,610
Let's go. I will buy you food.

75
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,880
Stop drinking. You will get an upset stomach.

76
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:54,210
You heard it too, didn't you? That he called off our engagement.

77
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,850
And also, I got fired.

78
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:05,450
I'm sure the rumor has spread around the office already.

79
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,570
I heard that the engagement got called off.

80
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:15,500
So you should get yourself together.

81
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:21,580
And go on your way, instead of drinking like this.

82
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:34,390
I like you because you always say nice things to me, Teddy bear Ajussi.

83
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:40,380
But, even if we know what is right,

84
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:46,360
we can't always act accordingly. That's why we drink.

85
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,000
I know I'm calling you Teddy bear Ajussi,

86
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,660
but you do say something slow like a bear.

87
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:03,300
Okay. Then, at least have some food with it.

88
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,560
Please eat this and then drink.

89
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,860
Ajussi, let's go for a second round. Let's go karaoke.

90
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:20,160
I want to sing and dance tonight. It's a bit stuffy here.

91
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,980
Let's go.

92
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,860
Chief Jo. Chief Jo!

93
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:30,080
Hurry up! Let's go to the karaoke.

94
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,840
I don't think so. You should go home. I will take you home.

95
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,370
I said I would go to karaoke!

96
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:49,870
I want to have fun singing and dancing.

97
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,950
Chief Jo.

98
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:04,550
Sokcho Night Beach lady, how about if you forget the one who hurt you like this

99
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:10,180
and start over with me?

100
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:17,880
I will heal you and fill the hole in your heart.

101
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,850
So why don't you start over with me?

102
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:31,830
Ajussi, do you want me to slap you so you can come to your senses?

103
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,870
Are you mocking me too? Do I look like a joke to you?

104
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,870
Are you eyeing me because I got dumped by my fiancé?

105
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:45,700
Ajussi, do you have a house? A car? How much money do you have in the bank?

106
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:51,330
How dare you? How dare you try to hit on me!

107
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:24,960
♫ You're inside of fantasy that I can't reach ♫

108
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:33,050
♫ Show you to me ♫

109
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,650
Ajussi...

110
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:41,640
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...

111
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:47,410
I am really sorry.

112
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,070
It's okay.

113
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,260
It's me who's sorry.

114
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,510
I...

115
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:00,820
I expect not a thing from you.

116
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:08,300
So please, unburden everything on me.

117
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,750
And forget all that I said.

118
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,700
♫  It feels like a ray of light in the darkness,  ♫

119
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:24,830
♫ My love. I can feel all of you that I love  ♫

120
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:32,320
♫  Like the light in the darkness  ♫

121
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:39,650
I want to congratulate you on calling off the engagement.

122
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,840
It was an engagement that should've not happened.

123
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,470
I still feel bad.

124
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:54,250
Too much responsibility, duty, and worry about what others think of us

125
00:12:54,250 --> 00:13:01,900
torture us and make us unhappy.

126
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:08,640
As long as it's legal, I'd say do what you want to do. That's what I'll tell my kids.

127
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,300
Why not?

128
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,320
You are no longer engaged, and your memory is back.

129
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:28,320
Will you be seeing that young lady you were talking about before?

130
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,200
No, I've ended it.

131
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:39,950
Why? You liked her a lot. You worried about it a lot too.

132
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:43,960
I got engaged with Chief Jo in between,

133
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,450
and when I think of her future, I can't be with her.

134
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:52,110
What are you saying? What's the problem when you are no longer engaged?

135
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:57,840
Are you still worried about the age gap?

136
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,930
I will say it again. Who cares about the age gap these days?

137
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:11,080
Besides, I know many couples who live happily with an age gap of over twenty years.

138
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,730
That's different from me.

139
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:18,420
Besides the age, I have three children.

140
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:25,580
I can't make a young lady with a bright future their mother.

141
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:31,370
Lee Young Gook. You really love her, don't you?

142
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:54,120
My heart is full of you, Ms. Park.

143
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,720
I don't know why I made the mistake of getting engaged to another woman. I want to know the reason so bad.

144
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:05,090
But because I don't know why and I'm incredibly frustrated.

145
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:09,470
I can't forgive myself.

146
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:14,690
Why did I do such a stupid thing when I lost my memory?

147
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:18,100
You should have stopped me, Ms. Park.

148
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:28,140
That's right. I won't do something I'll regret. Not ever again.

149
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:46,730
Ms. Park. What are you doing out in the cold?

150
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,200
I was waiting for you.

151
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,810
Were you waiting for me? Why?

152
00:15:54,810 --> 00:16:00,700
Chairman, I heard everything.

153
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,060
I heard that you called off the engagement.

154
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:16,470
Yes, I did. But that has nothing to do with you.

155
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:21,520
It's between me and Chief Jo. Please do not misunderstand.

156
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:27,240
You can keep paying your attention to my children as you always have.

157
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,200
Then, excuse me.

158
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,920
One moment please, Chairman.

159
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,790
Chairman, all this time,

160
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:42,870
I held myself back because you were engaged.

161
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:48,580
But I will not hold back what I want to say anymore.

162
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,360
Something to say?

163
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,080
What do you want to say to me?

164
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,470
Chairman, you and I,

165
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:04,540
we agreed to have a relationship. We never broke up.

166
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,730
What did you say?

167
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:13,880
Also, now I'm telling you, but the time when you lost your memory and you were 22-year-old,

168
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:21,180
you liked me. I will show you the proof.

169
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:26,780
Read this. It's a text you sent me.

170
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:32,630
Park Dan Dan, I know you like me, too. This is our last chance. Let's be honest with each other.

171
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:40,680
If you have any feelings for me, please meet me at Namsan tonight at 8 pm. I will be waiting for you.

172
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,820
This is what you told me. I'm sure you have the text too.

173
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:49,030
Did you erase all the texts?

174
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:54,920
I don't want to talk about things I don't even remember.

175
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,290
I mistakenly believed that you were two-timing then.

176
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:02,160
I couldn't trust you, so I couldn't accept your feelings.

177
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,350
But you are no longer engaged, so I want to start being honest.

178
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:13,050
From now on, nothing can stop our relationship.

179
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:19,860
No, even if that's so. Things are different now.

180
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:26,740
I was in an accident and got engaged in between then and now. A lot happened that I don't remember.

181
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:32,350
I've already told you clearly. I've ended my feelings for you.

182
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:38,050
I only think of you as my children's tutor.

183
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:42,800
So you should do the same, please.

184
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:53,830
That's a lie. He's lying right now.

185
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:17,150
Dan Dan. Dan Dan!

186
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,200
Dan Dan, please don't.

187
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:29,120
You! Why are you here? Kim Ji Young!

188
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,890
By what right are you taking Dan Dan? With what nerves?

189
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:58,770
Why do I see Ji Young on CEO Anna's face?

190
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:03,790
What horrible nightmare was that?

191
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,820
Are you CEO Anna?

192
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,770
Yes, I'm Anna...

193
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,330
CEO Anna!

194
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:22,490
Why did I cause them so much pain and suffering?

195
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:26,040
Am I getting punished for that?

196
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:35,280
There was something strange about CEO Anna from the beginning.

197
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,250
I went to CEO Anna Kim's home today.

198
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:47,020
But while I was there, I saw pictures from when Dan Dan was a baby.

199
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,810
What are you saying right now?

200
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,850
Look here.

201
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,250
This picture is so similar! No, I think it's the same.

202
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,700
Right.

203
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,740
There is something about CEO Anna.

204
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,680
There is something.

205
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,250
Yes, I'm leaving now.

206
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,300
I'll meet you in the meeting room.

207
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,650
Isn't this my Dan Dan?

208
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:29,220
Why are Dan Dan's photos here?

209
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,380
Why does CEO Anna have them?

210
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,340
Ms. Park is so cute the more I see her.

211
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,370
You've raised her very well indeed.

212
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:46,940
Soo Chul, let's invite Dan Dan too.

213
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,580
Oh my, did I just call her Dan Dan?

214
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:55,110
I think it's because I feel comfortable around her.

215
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,860
Is it...

216
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,150
Is CEO Anna Ji Young?

217
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,180
No way.

218
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,550
They look totally different.

219
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:22,910
What's going on here?

220
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:59,260
- Dad.
- Yes, Dan Dan.

221
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,850
What brings you all the way here?

222
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:08,730
I just wanted to see my daughter.

223
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,810
Right.

224
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:17,800
Drink this. It's your favorite, Strawberry Latte.

225
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,800
Are you feeling better now?

226
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:30,040
I'm very sorry.

227
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,960
No, I'm more sorry, Dad.

228
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,100
I spoke to you very rudely.

229
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,760
I know you didn't do it on purpose to make me suffer.

230
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,780
I won't do that again.

231
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,410
Okay.

232
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:50,220
Thank you.

233
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,120
Please drink.

234
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,250
When can I get the result?

235
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:08,260
We are open 24 hours, so it will be ready at about 10 pm tonight.

236
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,540
Yes, I'll come by then.

237
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,610
It won't be true.

238
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,170
I doubt it.

239
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,840
Welcome.

240
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,280
Hey, Joon Oh.

241
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,810
What's wrong with your face? It's ruddy and blue!

242
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:37,140
I rode a bike, and the wind froze my face.

243
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,860
Did you ride a bike in this weather?

244
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,200
Yes, from Banpo to Haengju Fortress and returned.

245
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,660
Oh my, you must be mad.

246
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:49,110
On a cold day like this, why would you go all the way there on a bike?

247
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:52,610
Mom. I'll make my body in the best shape and show it to you.

248
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:55,060
Aspiring actors have to work on their bodies.

249
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,100
I heard that body is the weapon for an actor.

250
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,280
I don't know what I'll do with you.

251
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,630
Rather than going back to school as I asked.

252
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:04,030
Mom. I'm hungry from exercising.

253
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,540
Can you grill some meat for me?

254
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:10,460
What are you saying to me? My goodness.

255
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,230
Joon Oh, have you met our in-law young lady?

256
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,390
Come over here.

257
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:19,700
I wanted to introduce you to her, but you left too soon.

258
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,160
Say hi. She's your aunt's niece.

259
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,290
Her name is Kang Mi Rim.

260
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,840
And this is my son.

261
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,110
Bong Joon Oh. Say hi to each other.

262
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,420
Hello.

263
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,040
I'm Bong Joon Oh.

264
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,460
Yes, hello.

265
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,700
- I'm Kang Mi Rim.
- Right, since you've met,

266
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,890
if you run into each other,

267
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:46,010
say hi to each other, okay?

268
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,640
Okay, Mom.

269
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,210
I will go and eat with my son.

270
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,980
So when the next staff shows up, you can go home.

271
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:57,060
Okay? Oh, actually!

272
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,870
Why don't you join us for lunch?

273
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,940
No, no. I'm okay.

274
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,790
Let's go eat together...

275
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:10,260
Please. We live close by.

276
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,200
- Hello, Boss!
- Oh!

277
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,870
You came in perfect timing.

278
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:16,560
We are going for lunch, so please take good care.

279
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,670
Thank you.

280
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,400
Mom, grill beef sirloin, please.

281
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,540
I'm craving sirloin, okay?

282
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,620
♫ Let's go to our house. ♫

283
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:29,500
What is going on with him? Why is he so happy?

284
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,820
Hurry and get changed.

285
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:37,570
My son! My son, my son!

286
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:41,020
What should I do now?

287
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:44,700
I didn't know you were left-handed.

288
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,620
Eat as much as you want, young-lady-in-law.

289
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,050
Yes, thank you.

290
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,580
And, my Joon Oh too.

291
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,520
Eat as much as you want.

292
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,150
Thank you, Mom. You should eat, too.

293
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,830
Please eat as much as you want, Ms. Mi Rim.

294
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,370
Yes.

295
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:15,180
It tastes much better since we are eating altogether.

296
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,140
Don't feel like a stranger, and please eat lots.

297
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,080
Yes.

298
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,640
What's this? Hey!

299
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,830
Why are you kicking me while eating?

300
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,450
It's nothing.

301
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:33,380
I kicked you accidentally while moving my feet.

302
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,050
Mi Rim, eat some more meat.

303
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,580
I mean...

304
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,610
Joon Oh, how can you call your in-law by their name?

305
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:46,370
What..?

306
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:50,810
Did I do that?

307
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:54,210
There is someone named Mi Rim in my school.

308
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,450
So it just popped out.

309
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,490
You have to call her Ms. Mi Rim since you are in-laws.

310
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:02,200
Okay, Mom.

311
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,910
Please eat lots, Ms. Mi Rim.

312
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:10,200
- Eat more. Have some more meat.
- Okay.

313
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,750
Dad!

314
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:16,150
Se Chan. What brings you here?

315
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:19,080
I have a favor to ask you.

316
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,880
What is it? Tell me.

317
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,210
Dad, you know about the five brothers, right?

318
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,830
Of course, I do.

319
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,980
The dads of the five brothers

320
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,270
take turns buying us pizzas.

321
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,020
It's my turn this time.

322
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,380
Can you buy us pizzas?

323
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:40,580
I have a reputation to protect. I can't mooch off of them all the time, right?

324
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,730
No, you can't.

325
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:47,030
Let's go. I will buy pizzas.

326
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,860
How about this and that?

327
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,350
And then?

328
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:56,220
Let's get this one, too.

329
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,860
Lee Se Chan, did you plan this again?

330
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,340
Yes, that's right.

331
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,680
For you and Ms. Park to have a date naturally,

332
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,570
I set this up.

333
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,310
I'm sorry about lying.

334
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,970
But it's not cheating anymore.

335
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,540
You're single now, Dad.

336
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:19,570
You are single, and Ms. Park is single, too.

337
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,720
Se Chan, I explained to you already why you shouldn't be doing this.

338
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,210
You told me you understood what I said.

339
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:29,970
Yes, I did. But when I thought about it carefully,

340
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,830
that didn't make sense.

341
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,250
Dad, why do you want to send her away when you love her?

342
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,180
Love is about fighting for it.

343
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:39,060
And only the brave can earn the beauty.

344
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,750
Dad, let's go!

345
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:48,110
Dad!

346
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:51,120
You've come too, Dad.

347
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:55,900
Yes, Se Chan asked me to come with him.

348
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,940
Please order what you want to eat.

349
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,150
- Yes!
- Yes.

350
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,010
It's good.

351
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:14,950
Since we are out, shall we play board games too?

352
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:17,300
- Yes!
- I like it!

353
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:22,350
Hello. You were the family who came here before, right?

354
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,680
Yes, we are.

355
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:28,350
I'm really sorry for thinking of the teacher as the eldest daughter.

356
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,960
You look like their teacher to me now.

357
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,420
I didn't wear my contact lenses and made a mistake.

358
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,940
No, it's okay.

359
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:42,240
If you need anything, please tell me any time.

360
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,060
Eldest daughter. It was really funny.

361
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:52,080
Maybe our dad really looks like an Ajussi.

362
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,660
No, he doesn't, Noona.

363
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,490
No, he doesn't, Jenny.

364
00:31:55,490 --> 00:32:00,370
He doesn't look like a dad, but an Oppa.

365
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:03,740
Oppa?

366
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:10,310
You must be happy, Dad. Ms. Park said, you look like an Oppa.

367
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:15,660
But what sort of an Oppa is he?

368
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,160
Oppa.

369
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:25,640
Ms. Park, thank you for thinking I'm that young.

370
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,780
I'm going to wash my hands.

371
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:47,900
Ms. Park. Please see me without letting the children know.

372
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:58,090
Chairman, why did you want to see me?

373
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:01,950
Ms. Park. Why are you acting like that in front of the children?

374
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,890
What did I do?

375
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,250
You keep looking at me unnecessarily.

376
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:10,670
And you just said I look like an Oppa.

377
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:19,560
Chairman, I didn't keep looking at you.

378
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,440
So I don't know why you think that.

379
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,370
And because you look young,

380
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:29,420
I meant you look young like an Oppa.

381
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:32,750
If you don't like it, okay, I got it.

382
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:36,900
I will say you are like an Ajussi from now on.

383
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,990
No, that's not what I am saying.

384
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:46,830
The children will figure out what you are doing.

385
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,690
Please be careful in front of the children.

386
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:57,550
And don't cross the line.

387
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,840
He likes me, too, but he pretends not to.

388
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,550
Besides, when did I cross the line?

389
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,010
He's annoying.

390
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:25,230
Oh, that's good.

391
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,630
It's Se Jong's turn.

392
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,720
Now it's your turn, Noona.

393
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,290
Please, please, fall. Collapse!

394
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:46,210
Do you want to die? Keep your mouth shut.

395
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:48,300
You are making me hard to focus.

396
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,640
- Oh, yes!
- That's a shame.

397
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,700
Okay, it's your turn, Ms. Park.

398
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:58,580
I will not collapse either.

399
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,920
It's your turn, Dad.

400
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:07,470
If you make it fall, you'll get Indian Bop.

401
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:13,070
But it doesn't look too easy this time.

402
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:17,700
Don't worry. I will never fall.

403
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:23,270
Dad, not that one. Pull this one out.

404
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:25,890
No, no. Not that one.

405
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,930
- Try this one here.
- No, no. This one.

406
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:32,330
- This one.
- Okay, I've decided.

407
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,030
Is that going to work?

408
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,250
Please fall down.

409
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,830
Let's go!

410
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:01,050
Dad, please get down.

411
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:04,170
Indian Bop!

412
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:11,070
That hurt. Who hit me so hard?

413
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:19,430
I'm sorry. I did it unintentionally.

414
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:23,750
Ms. Park. Do you have a grudge against my dad?

415
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:29,220
It's not that. I got too excited while playing the game.

416
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:33,230
I'm sorry, Chairman. It hurt a lot, didn't it?

417
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:37,080
No, it could happen while playing a game.

418
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,820
- Should we go another round?
- Yes!

419
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:44,680
- I have to revenge.
- All right!

420
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,210
Yes, it's me.

421
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,380
Where are you now?

422
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,380
Now? I'm at home.

423
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:16,620
Will you eat it if I send you my new recipe chicken now?

424
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:21,550
I can't. I'm on my way to see my friend. Thank you, but later.

425
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:25,010
Okay. I'll come by when I'm done with work.

426
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:28,550
Tonight? My mom's coming later.

427
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:31,310
I will call you then.

428
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,370
Okay.

429
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,870
I've not prepared anything.

430
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:57,880
I've regretted splitting Seung Ho and Se Ryun fifteen years ago.

431
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,590
I wanted to apologize for it.

432
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:03,970
But that's all in the past. You don't have to do this.

433
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:06,100
Thank you very much.

434
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:11,620
Thank you for forgiving me of the past wrongdoings and giving us another chance.

435
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,030
This is all thanks to you, Mrs. Jang.

436
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,190
Thank you, Mrs. Jang.

437
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:18,210
I didn't do anything.

438
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:25,760
I think they are meant to be together that they've finally met again after meandering for a while.

439
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:32,310
I'm so happy that they are going out golfing and horseback riding right after reuniting.

440
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:36,180
I really hope it will work out between your son and my Se Ryun.

441
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,940
Now I'm at this age, and I don't think there's much to life.

442
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,540
What else is there?

443
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,680
Other than meeting someone you love and living happily.

444
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,240
That's right. Yes.

445
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,010
- Right?
- Yes, yes!

446
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:51,800
That's right.

447
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,640
Since Se Ryun is hanging out with Seung Ho now,

448
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,540
I wonder if she finished with that gigolo.

449
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:02,750
I have to make sure they get married this time. No matter how.

450
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,940
So I can get the company shares.

451
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,840
Thank you.

452
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,160
Thank you, Seung Ho.

453
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,280
It was so much fun today, thanks to you.

454
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,780
I had so much fun too.

455
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:37,110
It also reminded me of us 15 years ago.

456
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:40,590
We were too young and pure at that time.

457
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,420
Oh, right.

458
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,600
Here. I almost forget about it.

459
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,260
What is it?

460
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:50,200
I went to the Cheongdam-dong store with my mom for work and bought one for you.

461
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,880
I think it will look good on you.

462
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,800
Earrings!

463
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,430
Why did you get me a gift too? Gosh...

464
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:01,470
I don't feel comfortable with you doing this.

465
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:04,970
Please don't feel that way. It's nothing much.

466
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:07,800
Thank you.

467
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:11,700
Thank you.

468
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:15,190
Se Ryun. It's been a while, but...

469
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,600
Can we hug?

470
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,020
Sure!

471
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,210
Se Ryun, it's good to see you again.

472
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:29,250
Let's see each other often.

473
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,660
Okay.

474
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:35,180
- Go home safe.
- I'll get going then.

475
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:49,610
It's so cold!

476
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,020
Where did he buy this from?

477
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,090
Oh, Dae Beom!

478
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:23,300
What brings you here unannounced?

479
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:27,700
I came to have fried chicken and beer with you while watching TV.

480
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,180
What did you do today?

481
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:36,060
I met my friend earlier today and just stayed home.

482
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,510
You stayed home?

483
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:41,890
I just saw you get off from some guy's car.

484
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,990
Why would you lie?

485
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:46,490
Oh, he's an old friend.

486
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:49,600
- I haven't seen him in a while.
- Right, you say he's your friend,

487
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,600
but then why would you lie about meeting him?

488
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,210
What are you trying to say, Dae Beom? I feel offended.

489
00:41:55,210 --> 00:42:00,860
I just said that because I felt bad hanging out with friends while you were working hard.

490
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,730
I wasn't lying.

491
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:06,170
Also, if you saw me, you should've just said so.

492
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:09,270
Why did you trick me like that?

493
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:13,080
O-Okay. I'm sorry for tricking you without saying it directly.

494
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,110
Sure, you can meet a friend.

495
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:19,120
But Se Ryun, I'd like for you to not lie.

496
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,210
If you lie,

497
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:26,310
I start getting anxious because it feels like something is wrong in our relationship.

498
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:29,780
All right. I'm really sorry about that.

499
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:33,290
I won't lie ever again.

500
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:41,300
I like you meeting your friends.

501
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,740
Meet your friends and have fun.

502
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,740
Just because I work at a chicken restaurant

503
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,150
doesn't mean you have to do the same.

504

I'm sorry for hitting you so hard today.

507
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:11,630
I'll buy you a can of beer from the convenience store as an apology.

508
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,400
I have something to tell you too.

509
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:21,080
It's fine. I have nothing to talk about with you separately.

510
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,050
I understand.

511
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:32,330
I'll go by myself then.

512
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:37,430
Oh, gosh.

513
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:41,500
Why is she going to drink at this hour by herself?

514
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,200
It's been over an hour. Why isn't she back yet?

515
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,070
It's so late.

516
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:57,990
Is she still drinking by herself until now?

517
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,390
Why isn't she here?

518
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:15,350
I'm sure she said, convenience store.

519
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:18,180

Ms. Park!

522
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:32,080
Chairman. You came looking for me because you were worried, right?

523
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,020
No.

524
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,350
I had something to buy,

525
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:40,360
and I came out for a walk.

526
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,250
Oh, I see.

527
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:45,920
Then hurry up and buy what you need.

528
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,850
No. I can buy it another time.

529
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:53,530
Let's go since it's late, Ms. Park.

530
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:09,520
Chairman, look! It's snowing!

531
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,930
It's so pretty.

532
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:15,020
It's snowing pretty heavily!

533
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,060
It is.

534
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:23,960
It feels like the snow is falling for us right now.

535
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:32,170
I guess I can say it's snowing to congratulate us on our future.

536
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:36,390
Don't go saying stuff like that elsewhere, Ms. Park.

537
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:40,070
The Weather Center will laugh at you.

538
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:46,000
Do you have to talk like that when it's snowing so beautifully?

539
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,440
It's cold, and you might catch a cold. Let's go quickly.

540
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,920
But Chairman, it was so obvious just now,

541
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,370
when you came looking for me because you were worried.

542
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:55,860
It wasn't like that.

543
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:58,530
- I said, it's not.
- No, I don't think so!

544
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:02,740
It's no use saying 'no' a hundred times. It's so obvious!

545
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,180
Ms. Park!

546
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,720
This sound right now...

547
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:41,650
Is it the sound of your heart beating?

548
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:44,970

It's not the sound of my heartbeat.

No, it is!

554

Then let me check once!

555
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:05,230

00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:16,860
By the way, what brings you here?

645
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:20,450
I made some Yakbap for you.

646
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:23,780
I made it with chestnuts, dates, pine nuts, and Ginko.

647
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:26,340
I packed it with everything that's good for you.

648
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,910
I wanted to give you some.

649
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:31,850
No, thank you. Please don't bring stuff like this.

650
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:35,040
- Then, excuse me.
- Wait!

651
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,770
The truth is, I just felt terrible.

652
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:44,300
You scouted my husband with great benefits, but things fell through like this.

653
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:51,970
So if you give me some time, I'll try to persuade my Soo Chul again.

654
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:55,200
No, it's over now.

655
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,720
We've concluded that Driver Park won't be going to the US anymore. So please go home now.

656
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:04,720
Also, I ask that you don't come here anymore.

657
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,230
But...

658
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:16,280
You're back?

659
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,240
Why? What's wrong?

660
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:22,940
Couldn't you see the CEO?

661
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,600
The annual salary of 200,000 dollars is a goner now.

662
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,520
It's all over now.

663
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,860
What? Did she find someone else?

664
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:35,420
Her face seemed like she was totally done with Soo Chul.

665
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:38,150
She was talking so coldly to me too.

666
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:40,810
She said it's over, so I shouldn't bring it up anymore.

667
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:43,780
Sure, I'd do the same thing if it were me too.

668
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:49,100
Who in the world would double a personal driver's salary?

669
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:52,200
He rejected an exceptional offer like that.

670
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,130
I'd be offended too!

671
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:59,000
I'm so upset, Mom!

672
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:05,840
But Mom. One side of the CEO's face was bruised badly!

673
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:08,320
- I think she got hit by someone.
- Gosh!

674
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:11,550
A sophisticated woman like that wouldn't get hit by anyone.

675
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:14,050
She probably just fell somewhere.

676
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:15,280
Do you think so?

677
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,360
How did she fall for one side of her face to get badly bruised like that?

678
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:22,270
Did she bump it like this?

679
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:25,970
Here comes the remarkable person!

680
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:28,180
What's so special about you to act so hard to get?

681
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,310
It's all over for you now!

682
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:36,790
No matter how much we beg to CEO to send you to the US, it's irretrievable now.

683
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:39,750
Don't tell me you went there.

684
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:42,780
I thought just in case you changed your mind,

685
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:46,570
I went to see her and to ask for her to wait, but she told me not to come anymore.

686
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:48,480
I guess she found someone else.

687
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,720
Listen carefully.

688
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:55,110
If you go there again, I'll divorce you!

689
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:00,570
- Did he say divorce to me?
- Oh, dear...

690
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:03,720
Don't say anything further.

691
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:07,230
I think it must be foul money.

692
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:11,020
It's not like Son-in-law Park is afraid of working.

693
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:13,830
Is there really something to it?

694
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:16,930
I wonder what?

695
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:19,550
What shall I cook today?

696
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:23,890
Should I make spicy braised cutlassfish with daikon?

697
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:30,500
Dae Beom's mom? Aigoo, it's me!

698
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,950
Next door neighbor from Sanggi-dong?

699
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:35,710
Yes, it's me!! Your next door neighbor!

700
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:37,570
Gosh, it's been so long!

701
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:41,830
- It's been about 15 years, I think?
- Probably.

702
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:44,700
Oh gosh, it's been so long.

703
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:46,580
But why are you here?

704
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:50,870
I went to see my sister and came to buy some stuff. I can't believe I bumped into you like this!

705
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:54,850
I've been curious about you! Do you live in this neighborhood?

706
00:59:54,850 --> 00:59:56,740
We run a chicken restaurant around here.

707
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:59,350
You should go with me! My mom will be so happy to see you.

708
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:01,200
I'll treat you today!

709
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,640
Oh, I can't come with you today. But I'll make sure to go next time.

710
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:07,080
Well then, ta-da!

711
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,320
This is our restaurant.

712
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:11,180
- You should definitely visit us!
- I will!

713
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:12,550
It's so good to see you!

714
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:14,420
- Me, too. Tell your mom I said hi!
- I will.

715
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:16,990
- Goodbye!
- Okay!

716
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,770
Ji Young...

717
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:42,780
Please hurry up. Take me far away from here.

718
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:45,180
Quickly!

719
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:12,820
Yes, Ms. Park. It's me.

720
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:16,540
CEO Anna, are you at the studio right now?

721
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:21,480
I have something to tell you. I would like to see you for a moment.

722
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:24,980
What should I do? I'm in Jeju right now.

723
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:29,050
Can't you say something over the phone if you have something to say?

724
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:32,830
I wanted to tell you in person.

725
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:34,890
When will you get back?

726
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:38,120
I don't think I will be able to go to Seoul for the time being.

727
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:42,410
It's fine, so just tell me over the phone.

728
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:48,000
Well, my father said that he couldn't go to America,

729
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:54,210
and I'm in a situation where I can't go either.

730
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,670
Is it about that?

731
01:01:56,670 --> 01:01:59,490
I had already heard from Driver Park.

732
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:02,290
Ms. Park, don't worry about it too much.

733
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:06,360
You said you couldn't come, so I hired someone else.

734
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:10,430
Oh, I see.

735
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:20,820
Since you are a good and diligent person, a better opportunity will come in the future.

736
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:25,060
Stay healthy and safe.

737
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:30,070
I understand.

738
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:33,210
Goodbye then.

739
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:57,250
CEO, you have treated me so well all this time,

740
01:02:57,250 --> 01:03:00,490
so I am sorry that this is all I can do.

741
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:03,130
If you come to Seoul, call me.

742
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:08,180
I really want to see you in person...

743
01:03:10,910 --> 01:03:15,200
What should I do?

744
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:30,150
Dan Dan.

745
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:33,770
I'm sorry.

746
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:37,020
I am so sorry.

747
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:08,160
Soo Chul, I have something I have to tell you.

748
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,580
Please meet with me once. Please.

749
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:13,850
Otherwise, I will go to your store to find you.

750
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:24,640
What did you say? You'll come to where?

751
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:30,080
I'm sorry... I was wrong.

752
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,730
I was wrong.

753
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:47,950
I was wrong. It's my fault.

754
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:52,420
I have nothing to say even if I die by your hands.

755
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:58,490
You may not believe me, but I never forgot about you and Dan Dan.

756
01:04:58,490 --> 01:05:03,070
I was so sorry and regretful.

757
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:10,340
- What?
- I didn't change my face on purpose to deceive you.

758
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:15,820
This is because I got punished by leaving you and Dan Dan.

759
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:20,830
I got in a car accident in America and almost died.

760
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:23,740
My face got ruined,

761
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:28,180
so I had no choice but to have plastic surgery over ten times and ended up like this.

762
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:31,600
How could I dare appear in front of you?

763
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:35,650
That's not it. That's not it...

764
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:37,070
That's really not it.

765
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:42,550
It was really a coincidence that I reunited with you and Dan Dan.

766
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:48,650
And because you couldn't recognize me, that's how it ended up this way.

767
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:53,210
I wanted to stay by you and Dan Dan's side.

768
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:56,820
I don't want to even talk with someone as inhuman as you.

769
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:59,900
Leave immediately.

770
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:01,540
Soo Chul.

771
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,910
Soo Chul Oppa, wait a moment.

772
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:08,160
I... I don't want anything from you.

773
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:13,190
I'll even pretend to be dead if you want me to.

774
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:20,810
But now I can do a lot for you and Dan Dan.

775
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:25,780
So... So,

776
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:37,640
please let me make it up to you and Dan Dan for what I did.

777
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:46,130
What? If you even knew what you did wrong,

778
01:06:46,130 --> 01:06:48,390
you wouldn't be able to say that.

779
01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:50,920
If you really have a conscience,

780
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:56,090
if you really feel sorry towards Dan Dan at all, disappear immediately.

781
01:06:56,090 --> 01:06:59,200
Leave here right now.

782
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:08,970
I'm sorry...

783
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:20,970
Thank you.

784
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:22,460
Have a good day.

785
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:24,510
I'll come again!

786
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:30,490
Are you the Ajumeoni that lived next door where we used to live?

787
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:33,250
You must be Dan Dan.

788
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:38,120
I just met your mom earlier. I hear your family runs a chicken restaurant nearby.

789
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,190
Yes.

790
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:44,380
You grew up pretty and well.

791
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:50,610
You grew up just like your mom. Do you see your birth mother often?

792
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:54,800
My real mom?

793
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:59,370
Yes. She came to see you then. Didn't you see her after that?

794
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:04,240
Well, she went to America, so she can't come often.

795
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:15,580
Ajumeoni, what are you talking about?

796
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:20,310
My birth mother came to find me?

797
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:24,230
Does my mother live in America?

798
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:27,730
My mother didn't die?

799
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:32,260
I must have said something I shouldn't have. What should I do?

800
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:35,770
Dan Dan, pretend you didn't hear what I told you.

801
01:08:35,770 --> 01:08:40,230
Something urgent came up, so I'll be on my way.

802
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:48,190
Ajumma, wait a moment!

803
01:08:53,870 --> 01:09:00,420
Dad! I heard my birth mother is still alive.

804
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:05,170
Why did you lie and say she died? Why?

805
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:10,060
What?

806
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:30,530
♫ Why do you run away, love
?
Like a shy child ♫

807
01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:37,090
♫ In case I lose it, I hold it tight
 ♫

808
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:44,330
♫ But love always runs away, chased by longing ♫

809
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:51,090
♫ It would be nice to take a break
 ♫

810
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:59,040
♫ I have to abandon the longing and the grieves ♫

811
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,810
♫ What am I looking for ♫

812
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:04,940
[Young Lady and Gentleman]

813
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:08,930
Dan Dan knows that her mom is still alive, you should tell her everything.

814
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:10,630
Do you know what kind of woman she is?

815
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:12,650
I think something must have happened to Ms. Park.

816
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:14,220
What happened to Ms. Park?

817
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:16,100
Se Ryun, I'm here.

818
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:18,270
How dare you come in here by pressing the passcode?

819
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:19,930
She doesn't need this crap! Get out!

820
01:10:19,930 --> 01:10:25,740
My mother is alive. Would it be hard to find someone that gave birth 27 years ago to a daughter named Park Dan Dan?

821
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:27,920
Like you said, should we give it a try?

822
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:30,460
I don't have a house or a car, but do you still want to?

823
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:32,960
We're just staying silent, not lying.

824
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,360
You two look so good together. I thought you were a couple.

825
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,760
They're not a couple. They're in-laws.

826
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,370
Do you know where my mom is?

827
01:10:39,370 --> 01:10:41,220
I could tell she wasn't an ordinary woman.

828
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:43,960
That's why she abandoned her husband and child and ran away.

829
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:46,060
Is that true?
