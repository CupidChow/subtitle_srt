[Episode 42]

2
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,080
[Probability of Biological Mother: 99.999%]

3
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,290
No way.

4
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:33,350
CEO Anna is my biological mother?

5
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,800
How could she do this after abandoning my dad and me?

6
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,050
I have to tell my dad as soon as possible.

7
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,550
I need to tell my dad about this!

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,610
Yes, it's me.

9
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,630
Are you still not able to get in touch with Dan Dan?

10
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,420
She's not answering her phone.

11
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,600
Not yet.

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,440
Do you think Chairman Lee told Dan Dan?

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,710
I don't think so.

14
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,220
Young Gook said he won't tell her until the end of today.

15
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,820
We don't have much time if we want to depart today.

16
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,970
I will call you as soon as Dan Dan gets here.

17
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,030
Who were you whispering with?

18
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,470
Was it that Anna woman?

19
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,350
I had to talk to her about Dan Dan.

20
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:22,520
You could do that in the living room. Why were you hiding here?

21
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,540
You promised not to communicate with her behind my back.

22
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,040
So why are you talking to her in secret here when it's about Dan Dan?

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,310
Dad! Where is my dad?

24
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:35,520
- Dad!
- Uncle, Dan Dan is here.

25
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,340
Dan Dan, where have you been?

26
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,800
Why weren't you answering your calls?

27
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,740
Calls? I put my phone on silent.

28
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,850
That's not important right now.

29
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,530
Dan Dan, get ready. Make sure you're not missing anything.

30
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,200
You were supposed to leave tomorrow.

31
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,030
But, due to CEO Anna's urgent matter, you have to leave now.

32
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,440
- You have to depart today. Let's go now.
- Dad.

33
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,410
I can't go to the US with CEO Anna.

34
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,520
What are you talking about right now?

35
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,650
What do you mean you can't go to the US with her?

36
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,930
Dad, something huge happened.

37
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,640
Look at this, Dad. Look!

38
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,490
What is it?

39
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:20,490
Dad, don't be shocked.

40
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:26,830
We've all been fooled. All of us!

41
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,100
I was wondering about it, so I did the test.

42
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,490
It turns out CEO Anna is

43
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,130
the woman who gave birth and abandoned me.

44
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,930
The result came out that she's my biological mother.

45
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,040
She's my biological mother.

46
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,960
What?

47
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,940
Dan Dan, how did you...?

48
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,420
CEO Anna has been very strange.

49
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,340
And I saw my baby photos in her possession.

50
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,720
But still, there was no way you couldn't recognize her.

51
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,650
So I assumed she wasn't.

52
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,950
But apparently, when she was in America,

53
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,290
her face was severely injured from an accident.

54
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,690
And her face completely changed due to plastic surgeries.

55
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,250
So just in case, I had a DNA test done.

56
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,510
This is the result that came out.

57
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,190
Well...

58
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,550
This has to be wrong. How could it be?

59
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:36,250
Dad, they told me a DNA test is error-proof.

60
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,050
You just didn't recognize her because of the plastic surgeries.

61
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:43,180
She deceived you and all of us!

62
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,310
How can I go to America with someone like her?

63
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,980
Just knowing that CEO Anna is my mother gives me a chill down my spine.

64
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,140
I can't go to the States.

65
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,000
I knew this would happen.

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,190
Since it came all down to this,

67
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:02,220
you have to tell her the truth--

68
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:11,500
Mom, what did you mean by that?

69
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,440
Tell me the truth?

70
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,660
You've known this all along, Mom?

71
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,690
You've known it too, Dad?

72
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:44,940
You all knew that that woman was my mother all along?

73
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,590
How am I the only one who didn't know?

74
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:56,600
How... How can you do this to me?

75
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,780
We thought if you knew you wouldn't go to America.

76
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,660
We wanted to send you to America.

77
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,840
If you lived in Korea, you couldn't break up with Chairman Lee.

78
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:17,960
You didn't tell me because you wanted to send me to the US?

79
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,100
Even though you knew who that woman was, you still wanted to send me to the US?

80
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,250
Is this true, Dad?

81
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,720
Dan Dan.

82
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,100
I only found out not long ago, myself.

83
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,040
That CEO Anna was your mother.

84
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,540
I was very shocked at first, too.

85
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,070
I didn't want you to be shocked, that's why I couldn't tell you.

86
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:49,690
Dan Dan. She's still the mother who gave birth to you.

87
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,460
She'd be better than any other people.

88
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,480
So please go to America with CEO Anna.

89
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,780
Dad.

90
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,930
How can you say such things to me?

91
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:09,070
CEO Anna, that woman...

92
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,730
She abandoned you and me.

93
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:20,140
That's why you've hated her all your life.

94
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:26,450
When I wanted to find my mom because I missed her,

95
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,110
you wouldn't even give me a photo of her or tell me where she was buried.

96
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:34,300
And now you want me to go to the US with someone like her?

97
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,340
Dad, out of all people, how can you do this to me?

98
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,300
I...

99
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,920
Do you have any idea how I feel right now?

100
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,020
I was abandoned by my mother as a baby.

101
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:56,530
I feel like I've been abandoned by you now, Dad.

102
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:59,400
Dan Dan.

103
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,180
Dad, I don't think..

104
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,250
I don't think I could ever forgive you in my lifetime.

105
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,920
Dan Dan. Hey, Dan Dan!

106
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,760
Dan Dan. Dan Dan!

107
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,550
What should we do with Dan Dan?

108
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:27,330
Dan Dan! Hey!

109
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,550
Where did she go, Dae Beom?

110
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,310
She went that way in a taxi.

111
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,650
What?

112
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,960
Father, are you okay?

113
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,680
[My Dad]

114
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,670
What? What did you say?

115
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,830
Dan Dan found out who I am?

116
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,290
Does she find out that I am her mother?

117
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,810
Yes.

118
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,200
How? Did Young Gook tell her?

119
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,540
He said he would wait for us to tell her, but did he tell her?

120
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:28,830
That's not it. I don't know what she was suspicious about.

121
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,850
But Dan Dan had a DNA test done.

122
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,320
A DNA test?

123
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,000
Me and her?

124
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,530
Dan Dan got shocked and ran away, saying she won't go to America.

125
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,940
She may go to your place.

126
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,960
If Dan Dan comes, hold onto her and call me.

127
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,110
Okay.

128
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,380
Okay. I got it.

129
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,380
What do we do?

130
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,680
What should I do with my Dan Dan?

131
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,840
Dan Dan.

132
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,080
Dan Dan.

133
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,550
CEO Anna.

134
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,330
Did you really give birth to me?

135
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,040
Is that true?

136
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,800
Dan Dan.

137
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,090
I will explain everything.

138
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,730
Why don't we sit down?

139
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,580
I guess it's true.

140
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,910
Since you do not deny it.

141
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,760
Dan Dan.

142
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,640
I'm sorry.

143
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,140
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

144
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,980
What are you most sorry about?

145
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,780
That you birthed and abandoned me?

146
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,900
Or...

147
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,990
After doing so,

148
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,760
you found me after changing your face

149
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,660
and tricked me by my side

150
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,020
and deceived me? Which one?

151
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,390
I am sorry.

152
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,230
I'm sorry...

153
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,620
I think it was when I was in the first grade.

154
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,160
When I found out that my mom was not my biological mother,

155
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,320
since then and until now,

156
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,680
I've...

157
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,740
I've missed my birth mom all of my life.

158
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,240
Even though my dad would not give me one photo of her,

159
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,450
in my imagination,

160
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,780
my mother was such a beautiful person.

161
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,110
But you...

162
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,850
You destroyed my imagination so despicable.

163
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:27,390
I never imagined such a horrible person would be my mom.

164
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:31,070
I am sorry. I'm sorry.

165
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,590
You abandoned me.

166
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,820
And then you totally deceived me.

167
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,280
How can you think of taking me to America?

168
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,420
The fact that a person like you

169
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,160
is my mother makes me sad.

170
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,730
I'm sorry, Dan Dan.

171
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:56,240
I wanted to do for you what I couldn't before.

172
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,940
That's why I did it.

173
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,050
It was all for you.

174
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,000
Did you...

175
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,870
Did you just say it was for me?

176
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:15,220
All of this is for me? How!

177
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,370
I'm sorry, Dan Dan.

178
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,710
I don't want to say anything anymore.

179
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:25,910
I came here to ask you one thing.

180
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,100
Why...

181
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,680
Why did you abandon me?

182
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,980
I'm sorry.

183
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,650
I did wrong.

184
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,650
I was too young then.

185
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,440
Living like that...

186
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,640
Living like that was too hard and suffocating.

187
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,460
At the time, my dream was too important.

188
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:29,000
It wasn't for a reason beyond your control.

189
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,430
But because you were too young.

190
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,560
You abandoned a baby because you were too young?

191
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,210
Because your dream was too big.

192
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,170
So you abandoned me?

193
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:43,000
That's the reason why you threw me away? Is that it?

194
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,230
Why didn't you just lie that my dad was such a bad person

195
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,640
that you got scared and had to run away?

196
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,240
If you said so!

197
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:00,220
I would've not felt this miserable.

198
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,860
Don't you ever...

199
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,070
Don't you ever show your face in front of me again.

200
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:22,150
No, Dan Dan!

201
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:26,930
Dan Dan! Dan Dan!

202
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,400
Dan Dan!

203
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,260
Chairman Lee!

204
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,630
What brings you here at this hour?

205
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:06,310
I came to see if my Dan Dan came here.

206
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,600
Why would Ms. Park come here?

207
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:17,480
Did you tell her that CEO Anna is her biological mother?

208
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,400
Before we could've told her,

209
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,660
Dan Dan figured it out herself.

210
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,600
How did she?

211
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,050
Dan Dan did a DNA test with CEO Anna in secret.

212
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:40,030
After learning that CEO Anna was her mother,

213
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:43,980
she left home in shock, but I couldn't get in touch with her after that.

214
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,940
That's why I came to check to see if she's here.

215
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,250
She didn't call me either.

216
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,180
One moment, please.

217
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,250
Yes, Mrs. Yeoju, it's me.

218
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:03,650
Did Ms. Park come to our house or call today?

219
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,890
I see. Yes.

220
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,120
She didn't come here either.

221
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,780
Chairman.

222
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,880
If she calls you,

223
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,210
please let me know.

224
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,660
Yes, I will.

225
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:28,590
Ms. Park!

226
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,860
Ms. Park!

227
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,980
Ms. Park!

228
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,820
Ms. Park!

229
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,730
Where did she go?

230
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,790
[Lawyer Koh]

231
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:19,140
Yes, Lawyer Koh, what did you find out?

232
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,650
Young Gook, we've found out Ms. Park's location.

233
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,000
What? Where is it?

234
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,250
Ms. Park!

235
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,690
Ms. Park!

236
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,910
Ms. Park!

237
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,770
Ms. Park!

238
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,720
Ms. Park!

239
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,950
Ms. Park. Ms Park!

240
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,700
- Ms. Park.
- Do you know her?

241
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,690
She's been lying here for a while. Her body is as cold as ice.

242
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,210
911. Please call 911.

243
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,850
We've called already.

244
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,590
Ms. Park. Ms. Park.

245
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,250
Ms. Park. Ms. Park.

246
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,930
Please wake up, Ms. Park!

247
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:42,830
[Emergency Center]

248
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,150
Doctor, why is she still unconscious?

249
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,100
Is there some problem?

250
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,230
She's fatigued from extreme stress and hypothermia.

251
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,430
Had she been found any later, it would have been critical.

252
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,200
It's good that she got found on time.

253
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,720
She will regain her consciousness soon. So don't worry.

254
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,890
She will need a few days of rest.

255
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,340
Yes, thank you.

256
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,740
Thank you.

257
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,720
Chairman.

258
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,000
Ms. Park.

259
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,510
Are you awake?

260
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:05,070
Chairman.

261
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:10,190
Yes, it's me.

262
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:14,820
Ms. Park. You should have come to me if you were having a hard time.

263
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,310
Why did you come all the way here alone?

264
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,310
You could've been in danger.

265
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:23,780
I'm going to go with you now.

266
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,980
Chairman.

267
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,730
I am going to be by your side from now on.

268
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,700
Yes.

269
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,420
Come with me.

270
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,030
Stay with me.

271
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,960
Did you find Dan Dan?

272
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,640
Where is she right now?

273
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,550
She is at our home now.

274
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:07,040
At your place?

275
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,820
Thank you so much for contacting me, Chairman.

276
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,770
I will head over now to pick up Dan Dan.

277
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,410
No.

278
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,910
Ms. Park is not in the condition to move.

279
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:23,150
She has hypothermia and symptoms of exhaustion, so she's receiving an IV drip.

280
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:27,760
Her conditions have to stabilize for now. I will contact you again.

281
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,650
I will hang up now.

282
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:40,030
Honey. Is Dan Dan at the Chairman's place now?

283
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,540
Yes.

284
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:46,860
She has hypothermia and exhaustion, so he said she's getting an IV drip.

285
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,970
My goodness. It's so cold.

286
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,550
She must've fainted while crying outside.

287
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:55,480
Hypothermia and exhaustion?

288
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,060
That poor thing. What are we going to do?

289
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,320
Dan Dan could've been in serious trouble.

290
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,080
I heard hypothermia is dangerous.

291
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,650
Gosh, of course! Do you know how dangerous that is?

292
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:09,090
A lot of drunk people die from sleeping outside in winter.

293
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:12,630
That's enough. Everyone, just go to bed.

294
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,370
Please go to bed, too, Mother-in-law.

295
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:22,640
I guess Dan Dan Unni was really in unbearable pain.

296
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,570
How couldn't she be? After experiencing something so shocking like that.

297
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,760
He refused to listen to me and look what's happened now.

298
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,440
I told him he shouldn't send Dan Dan with Anna Kim without telling her.

299
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,780
He tried to separate Dan Dan and Chairman Lee, but they ended up together!

300
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,450
Gosh, Mom! Be quiet, Father may hear you.

301
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,460
- Why did you hit me?
- Watch your mouth.

302
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,440
Gosh, be quiet.

303
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,440
Jenny! Se Chan and Se Jong!

304
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,390
Ms. Park!

305
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:19,540
You're really in front of our eyes, right?

306
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:22,280
Why are you here, Ms. Park?

307
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,420
Weren't you supposed to go to America today?

308
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:31,120
Are you living here with us again now, Ms. Park?

309
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,640
I decided not to go to America.

310
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,790
I will stay with you, Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong now.

311
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,730
Wow, nice!

312
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:45,410
Kids. Ms. Park isn't feeling too well.

313
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:48,080
So, how about we talk about it in detail with me,

314
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,160
so that Ms. Park can rest?

315
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,410
- Okay!
- Okay!

316
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,710
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

317
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:59,470
Rest a little more, Ms. Park.

318
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:16,110
I'm sure you heard everything just now, but Ms. Park has decided not to go to America anymore.

319
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:19,840
- Awesome!
- Sweet!

320
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:23,060
But Dad. Ms. Park looked very sick.

321
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,440
Is something going on?

322
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,010
I think Ms. Park experienced serious stress from many things.

323
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,100
So Dr. Kim said her condition got a little bad.

324
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,460
So, she needs a few days of rest.

325
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,620
Which is why, Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong...

326
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,730
I know you probably want to talk to Ms. Park and play with her.

327
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,940
But could you help her so that she can recover quickly?

328
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,040
- Yes!
- Yes!

329
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,820
Of course! What's there to even ask?

330
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,610
Oh, Dad. I have a study group with my friends, so I'm going to get going.

331
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,530
All right.

332
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,930
But, Dad. What does it mean that Ms. Park came back?

333
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:09,550
Does that mean that you and Ms. Park are boyfriend and girlfriend again?

334
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,030
Yes.

335
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:15,750
That's why I'm not going to let Ms. Park go anywhere now.

336
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,720
Then Dad...

337
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:25,090
Are you going to marry Ms. Park?

338
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,090
Probably?

339
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:33,780
Then announce it to Noona, Dad!

340
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,820
Tell her everything!

341
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:40,240
I was planning to tell your sister once Ms. Park gets better.

342
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,900
Then Dad! That means we're finally a complete family of five!

343
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:50,540
You can't break up with Ms. Park anymore. Okay, Dad?

344
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,640
Yes, I won't.

345
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,820
- Yes!
- Wow, awesome!

346
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,410
- Wow!
- Yes!

347
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:09,130
Mrs. Yeoju, Dr. Kim said Ms. Park has to rest and eat well for a few days.

348
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:13,580
Please prepare food that's good for her health so that she can recover faster.

349
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,920
Okay. Don't worry, Chairman.

350
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:21,070
Chief Kim. Please take care of Ms. Park well also so that her condition can stabilize.

351
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,440
I will, Chairman.

352
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,210
Please help out too, Se Ryun.

353
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,490
Yes, Oppa.

354
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:32,880
What is this? Is that girl the lady of this house or something?

355
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,010
Why are you asking the entire family to attend to her?

356
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,420
Mom!

357
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:41,120
I clearly told you not to call her "that girl."

358
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,800
I'm holding in a lot right now.

359
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,360
I'm doing it for Se Ryun.

360
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,280
Oh, my goodness! What are you going to do if you don't hold in? Tell me!!

361
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:54,070
I want to see what you'll do. Don't hold back!!

362
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,770
Gosh, Mom! Why are you doing this?

363
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,910
What? What's the problem? I'm just talking.

364
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:03,120
- What else would I call that girl?
- Seriously!

365
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,400
Come here. Follow me.

366
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,430
Seriously, Mom! Please!

367
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,520
What, what? Did I say something wrong?

368
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,810
Is Ms. Park his wife? Or does she have a terminal disease?

369
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:16,970
How could he call the entire family and ask us to do this and that?

370
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:20,380
Why is Young Gook acting like a stupid fool like that?

371
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,870
And you want me to do nothing about it?

372
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:28,260
Mom, I think Oppa must have gotten back together with Ms. Park.

373
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,930
Because he just couldn't break up with her.

374
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,650
Think about yesterday.

375
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:36,020
He publicly announced that Ms. Park is a precious person.

376
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,950
Did the plan to go to America fall through?

377
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,130
Is she not going to go?

378
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,310
I think so.

379
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:47,160
In my opinion, I think Oppa is

380
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,820
thinking of marrying Ms. Park too.

381
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,830
If you want to live in this house receiving allowances,

382
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,700
you better pick the right team to join and stop calling Ms. Park "that girl."

383
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,110
Did you get it?

384
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,890
"Marry?"

385
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:06,100
This is exactly why you shouldn't have given your share. Why did you?!

386
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,370
If it weren't for that, I would have no reason

387
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:11,240
to live here and walk around on eggshells. You brat!

388
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:16,110
You have to forget about what's been done. Just forget about the past, Mom.

389
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,800
Just think that's your fate, Mom.

390
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,720
Gosh, that brat!

391
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,240
She's worse than that jerk, Young Gook!

392
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,440
Gosh, how will I live?

393
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,480
I should pick "the right team?"

394
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,110
But no matter what the situation,

395
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:37,200
how can I kiss up to that girl?

396
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,490
- I'm going to go to my class.
- Okay.

397
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:44,630
I'm here, Lady-in-law.

398
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:47,950
- Oh, hello.
- Aigoo, you're here!

399
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,920
But what is the doctor carrying?

400
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,240
Oh, that. Someone sent over some Hallabong from Jeju.

401
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,860
I brought some over for you to eat.

402
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,770
Aigoo, thank you so much.

403
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,360
Why don't you sit down too, Joon Oh?

404
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,100
Oh, no. I have plans, so I have to get going.

405
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,410
Grandma and Aunt.

406
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,260
- I'll see you later.
- Leave it over there and go.

407
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,350
- I'll be back.
- All right.

408
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,300
- Okay, see you later.
- Okay!

409
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:22,260
Did Soo Chul lose his mind or something?

410
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:27,350
How could he think to send Dan Dan to America when he knows everything?

411
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,210
That's why we all disagreed with it, Sister-in-law.

412
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:33,160
Me, Mom, Cha Geon, and Dae Beom. We all disagreed with him.

413
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,870
But he was so stubborn about it and now look what happened!

414
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,410
Dan Dan said she wouldn't forgive him and left.

415
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:41,350
They're on the verge of cutting ties as father and daughter.

416
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,470
No, no.

417
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:45,400
Anna Kim, that woman is the problem in this.

418
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,620
No matter how much Soo Chul told her to take her,

419
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,320
she shouldn't have agreed to it if she had a conscience!

420
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,240
That's what I'm saying!

421
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,200
She appeared after changing her entire face,

422
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,020
and then tried to seduce Soo Chul and Dan Dan to take them to America.

423
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,320
That wench is like a shameless thief!

424
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,020
After abandoning Soo Chul and newly born Dan Dan before, how could she do this?

425
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:08,500
Sister-in-law, you know where that woman lives, right? Lead the way. Let's go.

426
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,090
Aigoo, Lady-in-law!

427
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:11,750
Just leave her alone.

428
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:16,530
Yeon Sil already went and gave her a beating twice.

429
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:23,640
Sister-in-law! How could you go somewhere like that by yourself? You should've gone with me!

430
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,790
Gosh, seriously. I have never seen a minx like her anywhere,

431
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:32,060
not even in a movie or TV show!

432
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:36,600
Gosh, she's scary. This wench is a real scary one.

433
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,560
Ms. Park, did I wake you up?

434
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,110
I shouldn't have come in.

435
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,230
I'll leave, so get some more rest.

436
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:04,650
No, Chairman. I am okay now.

437
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,480
Are you really okay?

438
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,870
Yes, really.

439
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:16,620
I'm completely fine now.

440
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,510
Then do you want to eat some porridge?

441
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:24,430
Mrs. Yeoju made delicious mushroom oyster porridge. Should I bring you some?

442
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,390
No, I'll have it later.

443
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,810
I'm not hungry right now.

444
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:32,900
You didn't eat anything since yesterday, yet you're not hungry?

445
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,840
Yes.

446
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:41,750
Because I'm with you, I'm full even if I haven't eaten.

447
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:45,640
Being with you like this

448
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,920
makes me feel like I'm alive.

449
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:55,490
Ms. Park. You haven't eaten anything, but how can you say being with me makes you full?

450
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:58,480
That's ridiculous.

451
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,040
That's true.

452
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,520
I think it's because my heart and

453
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:08,460
my mind are happy so I forget that I'm hungry.

454
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,440
I'm really not hungry.

455
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:15,300
Yes?

456
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:21,110
Chairman and Ms. Park.

457
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:24,290
Well... Ms. Park's father is here.

458
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,990
He came to take Ms. Park.

459
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:28,750
Should I let him in?

460
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,650
No. Please tell him to just leave.

461
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,820
I'm not going with him.

462
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,130
I'm really not going. I don't want to see him.

463
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:42,980
Chairman, please just tell him to leave.

464
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:46,380
And tell him never come here again.

465
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,100
Ms. Park, calm down.

466
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,710
I'll go out.

467
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:09,260
Hello.

468
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,600
Where's Dan Dan?

469
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:22,230
Father. Ms. Park is not feeling great and needs to stabilize for a few days.

470
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:27,340
Also, Ms. Park does not want to see you yet.

471
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,810
I think it would be best to leave for today.

472
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:34,530
When Ms. Park gets better, I will talk to her.

473
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:38,250
What do you mean I should just go? I can't do that.

474
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:43,350
I can't leave Dan Dan here.

475
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:46,130
I will just see her once before I leave.

476
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:48,760
Please call her out.

477
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:54,520
Father, Ms. Park does not want to see you right now.

478
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,460
I think she needs some time.

479
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:00,090
She's not feeling well either. I will take you home.

480
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:02,670
Why would I ride in your car?

481
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:08,570
I can take a taxi or a bus.

482
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,460
So just call Dan Dan.

483
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,490
Father.

484
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:15,880
Are you trying to split Dan Dan and me?

485
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:20,430
Who are you to stop me from seeing Dan Dan?

486
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:26,690
I'm not the one stopping you from seeing her, but Ms. Park does not want to see you.

487
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,240
I told you clearly.

488
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:33,580
That you should tell Ms. Park that CEO Anna is her biological mother.

489
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,310
How could you let this happen?

490
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:39,110
Ms. Park almost died yesterday.

491
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:44,210
Because you and CEO Anna gave her such a big shock and hurt her.

492
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:48,350
She became unconscious on the freezing beach and almost died!

493
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,840
Either way, I am taking her.

494
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,190
She's my daughter, so I'm taking her with me.

495
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:57,910
Dan Dan is my daughter!

496
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:00,030
Father!

497
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,620
Is Ms. Park your property?

498
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:09,170
She said she did not want to go with you.

499
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:17,380
Do you still not know what wrong you did to her?

500
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,710
Or are you pretending not to know?

501
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:24,820
After hurting her like that, how can you be acting like this?

502
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:34,270
I will not send Ms. Park away anymore.

503
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:37,040
Please back off.

504
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:42,030
From now on, I will take care of Ms. Park.

505
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,920
Chairman, did you see my dad?

506
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,360
Yes, I did.

507
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,340
What did he say?

508
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:24,970
He wanted to take you with him, but I said no.

509
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:33,760
I told your father that I would take care of you from now on.

510
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,220
Chairman.

511
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,780
Ms. Park,

512
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:48,770
I won't let you go anywhere.

513
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:54,010
Ms. Park, stay by my side.

514
00:36:55,790 --> 00:37:00,120
Yes. I won't go anywhere.

515
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,230
I will stay here.

516
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:06,510
I'll be next to you and the children.

517
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:31,400
Why is he still standing there? It's so cold.

518
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,320
Mrs. Yeoju, what's wrong?

519
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,490
Look.

520
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,640
What's going on? What is that?

521
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:46,260
[Se Ryun]

522
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,480
It's me.

523
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,040
What? My father?

524
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,050
Father.

525
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:06,740
Ms. Se Ryun. I'm glad I ran into you.

526
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,600
Because Dan Dan isn't answering my calls,

527
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:14,330
could you tell her that I would like to speak to her for a moment?

528
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:17,930
I have already asked Ms. Park to come out with me.

529
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:21,030
But she said she doesn't want to see you right now.

530
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:26,460
Does she really not want to see me?

531
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,220
Yes.

532
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:31,000
I don't know what exactly happened,

533
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,440
but I think it would be best to wait until she feels better.

534
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,980
Then, could you

535
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:46,590
tell her this?

536
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:50,750
That I'm sorry that I disappointed her.

537
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:54,210
That I was wrong

538
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:58,170
and that I'll wait. Please tell her.

539
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,170
Father.

540
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:06,960
Dae Beom.

541
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,380
Father, let's go.

542
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:11,360
Dan Dan said she doesn't want to see you. Why are you doing this?

543
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,000
I can't leave.

544
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,350
I have to take Dan Dan with me.

545
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:19,790
Father. You deceived Dan Dan.

546
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:26,560
You wronged her. Do you think she would want to talk to you?

547
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,860
Dae Beom.

548
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:33,690
Dan Dan will close off her heart more if you act stubbornly like this.

549
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:37,280
So, let's go for now.

550
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,760
As time passes,

551
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,920
Dan Dan will understand you.

552
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,220
Please, Father.

553
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,190
Let's go.

554
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:10,480
Se Ryun, thank you for calling me.

555
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,090
It's nothing.

556
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,290
Dan Dan.

557
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:24,230
Thank you for coming out to see me.

558
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,040
Are you feeling better now?

559
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,240
Why did you come here?

560
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,980
Dan Dan.

561
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,610
I'm sorry for everything.

562
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:42,150
So, please come with me.

563
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,350
You can't be here.

564
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:48,780
Go inside, pack your bags and come out.

565
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,830
Dad.

566
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:53,710
I will be staying here now.

567
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:56,120
I will be by Chairman's side from now on.

568
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:00,580
Dan Dan, why are you doing this?

569
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:03,940
This is not where you should be.

570
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,530
I think you're in shock because you learned everything all at once--

571
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:16,660
When I first figured out that CEO Anna was my mother,

572
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:20,510
I thought how much you'd be shocked when you hear of this.

573
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:24,870
How much you would be hurt to learn that she even did plastic surgeries and deceived us.

574
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:27,790
I worried for you.

575
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,960
And yet, you knew all of that,

576
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,990
but you deceived me

577
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:38,560
and tried to send me to America with that woman.

578
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,890
Just to separate me from the Chairman.

579
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:46,380
Dan Dan.

580
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:53,620
It was very, very difficult for me to break up with the Chairman.

581
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,220
I felt like my heart was ripping out.

582
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,210
But I still left him.

583
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:59,920
Do you know why?

584
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,040
Because you are the one I love the most in the world.

585
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,620
Even if my heart breaks, I don't want to hurt you ever.

586
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:10,650
So even though my heart was tearing apart,

587
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:13,260
I broke up with the Chairman.

588
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:18,530
But... you deceived me.

589
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:21,820
I can't trust you anymore.

590
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,350
I'm only going to trust the Chairman from now on.

591
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:30,050
If he asks me to marry him,

592
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:32,010
I will marry him.

593
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:35,780
So please don't come to see me like this.

594
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:40,430
Dan Dan.

595
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:49,400
It's all over now.

596
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:54,990
Dan Dan doesn't want to see me anymore.

597
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:01,560
I don't know what to do from now on.

598
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:06,710
I don't know if I should let her stay in that house like that.

599
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:11,430
This is all my fault. All of it.

600
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:14,860
I'm sorry.

601
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:21,690
If I hadn't appeared in front of you and Dan Dan, this would've not happened.

602
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:26,460
I'm the one responsible, so I will go see Dan Dan.

603
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,520
I'm the one who caused all of this.

604
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:33,400
It was me who suggested I would take Dan Dan to America.

605
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:38,140
I will go see Dan Dan and try to convince her.

606
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,900
Soo Chul.

607
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,680
I'm sorry.

608
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,830
Welcome, CEO Anna.

609
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:58,850
How have you been?

610
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:00,770
I've come to see Ms. Park.

611
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:02,680
- Is she upstairs?
- Yes.

612
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,850
She's resting because she's not feeling well. But you can go upstairs.

613
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:08,180
Thank you.

614
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:13,780
It's been a while she's been here. What tea should I prepare for her?

615
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:16,370
Mrs. Yeoju.

616
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:18,330
Why did that woman come to our house?

617
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:20,540
Why is she going upstairs?

618
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,450
She came to see Ms. Park.

619
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,030
Ms. Park?

620
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:27,820
Wonder if she came to talk about going to the US.

621
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:33,470
I wish she would take Ms. Park and go quickly!

622
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:40,030
Yes.

623
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:52,750
What are you doing here?

624
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:56,230
Please leave right now. I don't want to see you.

625
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:59,000
Dan Dan.

626
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,890
I know I have no qualifications to be your mother.

627
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:10,300
After I left you like that,

628
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:13,960
I regretted it so much.

629
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,110
And I felt sorry toward you.

630
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:20,680
I lived only thinking of you.

631
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:24,490
I don't know what you would think of me.

632
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:30,480
But I've never forgotten you even for a moment.

633
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:35,080
That's why...

634
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:39,770
I wanted to pay you back for all the wrong I had done.

635
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:43,080
That's why I stayed near you.

636
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:47,160
Because I feel sorry for you,

637
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,300
I couldn't tell you I was your mother.

638
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:53,030
That's why I didn't tell you.

639
00:46:54,550 --> 00:47:03,860
So please, let's go to America together.

640
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:06,790
So I can pay you back.

641
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:10,280
Please get out.

642
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,690
I don't even want to hear your voice.

643
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,620
All right.

644
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:23,930
Okay, I understand.

645
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:26,390
I will leave.

646
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:30,890
But Dan Dan.

647
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:33,310
Please don't be mad at your dad.

648
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:37,760
He didn't do anything wrong.

649
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,790
It's me who abandoned you.

650
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:47,440
And it's me who deceived you.

651
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:53,390
It's also me who tried to take you to the US, not your dad.

652
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:56,570
So, please, Dan Dan.

653
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:59,720
Please don't hate your dad.

654
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,630
Why are you doing this to me?

655
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:10,900
Why are you... Why...

656
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:24,900
Mrs. Yeoju, so Anna Kim is the birth mother of Ms. Park, right?

657
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:28,470
Yes. I think so.

658
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:31,620
Oh, my world. Isn't this Daebak like what kids say these days?

659
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:34,630
So Anna Kim gave birth to Ms. Park

660
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:36,560
and then abandoned her.

661
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,160
Oh my, how can anyone abandon her own baby? Oh, my world.

662
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,750
Madam.

663
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:46,880
Mr. Yeoju, what are you doing here?

664
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,300
Chief Kim.

665
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:51,660
Oh, my goodness. That woman, CEO Anna,

666
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:54,820
gave birth to Ms. Park and then abandoned her.

667
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:56,630
She's Ms. Park's biological mother!

668
00:48:56,630 --> 00:49:02,240
She's been so conceiting toward me, but isn't she total trash?

669
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:07,510
So, you've been eavesdropping on Ms. Park?

670
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:10,400
I will report to the Chairman.

671
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,630
Chief Kim, seriously!

672
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:14,770
Why are you doing that?

673
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:17,460
She's such a treacherous subject of him!

674
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:20,290
My goodness!

675
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:25,670
What did you just say, Chief Kim?

676
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:27,440
CEO Anna Kim came over?

677
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,750
Yes. She just left after meeting Ms. Park.

678
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:36,890
But, Chairman... Ms. Park cried a lot.

679
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:39,090
All right.

680
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:49,280
I wanted to see you.

681
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:56,230
Noona. I heard you came to my home and met Ms. Park.

682
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:57,960
What was it about?

683
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:07,190
Young Gook. I want to make my Dan Dan happy, at least if I can now.

684
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:12,000
I want to do everything that I couldn't do for her until now.

685
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,520
I want to let her live according to her age...

686
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,890
like a bright young lady without any worries.

687
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:29,840
So, Young Gook, can't you help me so that Dan Dan can go to America with me?

688
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,810
I'm begging you.

689
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:37,380
I'm asking because I think Dan Dan will listen to you.

690
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:40,350
Ji Young Noona.

691
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:47,210
Don't you think you wronged her too many times to ask that kind of favor?

692
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:48,670
Young Gook...

693
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:54,320
Before Ms. Park was even three months old, you abandoned your newborn and left.

694
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:59,750
I still don't understand why you made that kind of decision.

695
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:04,860
Although, I'm sure you had your own reasons.

696
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:08,250
Young Gook.

697
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:12,440
Noona. You have no rights with Ms. Park.

698
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,040
You know that, right?

699
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,090
Yes.

700
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:20,700
I know. I do.

701
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,730
I'm going to marry Ms. Park.

702
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:26,460
I'm going to protect Ms. Park from now on.

703
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:32,130
Also, if Ms. Park wants to further her studies or go study abroad, I will do it for her.

704
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:36,330
So don't tell Ms. Park to go to America with you anymore.

705
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:37,560
Young Gook.

706
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:41,110
You and Mr. Park hurt Ms. Park.

707
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:45,140
I'm going to make the scarred Ms. Park happy.

708
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,410
And that's final.

709
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:51,050
If you really feel even the slightest remorse towards Ms. Park,

710
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:54,350
I hope that you will wish for her happiness now.

711
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:56,950
Don't get involved anymore.

712
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,990
I'll get going.

713
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,670
Young Gook.

714
00:52:20,172 --> 00:52:24,462
You said you wanted to talk about something. Where are we going?

715
00:52:24,462 --> 00:52:28,002
Where are we?

716
00:52:28,002 --> 00:52:32,452
This is my home.

717
00:52:32,452 --> 00:52:35,972
I want to introduce my mom to you.

718
00:52:35,972 --> 00:52:38,012
Ajussi.

719
00:52:38,012 --> 00:52:43,542
Although I insisted that we're friends, I like you, Sarah.

720
00:52:43,542 --> 00:52:49,322
You like me too, Sarah. We like each other.

721
00:52:49,322 --> 00:52:51,902
So stop holding out and come to me.

722
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:55,372
Don't get swayed by that punk who only makes your life harder.

723
00:52:55,372 --> 00:53:00,652
Forget all your bad memories too. Let's start over again.

724
00:53:00,652 --> 00:53:05,132
Geon! Cha Geon!

725
00:53:05,132 --> 00:53:08,252
Who is this lady?

726
00:53:09,642 --> 00:53:13,392
Sarah. This is my mom.

727
00:53:13,392 --> 00:53:16,152
Oh, hello.

728
00:53:16,152 --> 00:53:20,722
Hold on. The reason you wanted to see me, Geon...

729
00:53:20,722 --> 00:53:23,242
Was it because of this lady?

730
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:26,762
Because you wanted to introduce this lady to me?

731
00:53:26,802 --> 00:53:28,182
Yes.

732
00:53:28,182 --> 00:53:31,822
Aigoo, Geon! You should've told me beforehand then.

733
00:53:31,822 --> 00:53:35,432
What do I do? I don't have anything prepared.

734
00:53:35,432 --> 00:53:38,182
But still. Come on in for a bit,

735
00:53:38,182 --> 00:53:41,992
and have a cup of coffee at least.

736
00:53:41,992 --> 00:53:44,422
Wait, I...

737
00:53:45,672 --> 00:53:47,852
Here, come here.

738
00:53:47,852 --> 00:53:52,132
Sit down for just a moment with Geon.

739
00:53:52,132 --> 00:53:55,032
I'll hurry up and make you some coffee.

740
00:53:55,032 --> 00:53:57,182
It will only take a moment. Just a moment.

741
00:53:57,182 --> 00:53:59,932
Have a seat, okay?

742
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:06,092
Please have a seat, Sarah.

743
00:54:15,762 --> 00:54:20,092
I'm sorry, Ajussi. I'm going to get going.

744
00:54:20,092 --> 00:54:23,532
S-Sarah. Sarah!

745
00:54:23,532 --> 00:54:26,012
Well...

746
00:54:27,302 --> 00:54:30,692
What? Where did they go?

747
00:54:32,482 --> 00:54:34,762
Sarah.

748
00:54:34,762 --> 00:54:38,572
Are you surprised because I suddenly brought you over to my home?

749
00:54:43,632 --> 00:54:48,222
Ajussi. We need to talk.

750
00:54:57,872 --> 00:55:03,472
I'm really sorry for bringing you over without any notice like this.

751
00:55:03,472 --> 00:55:09,312
It's because it's clear that you like me too, Sarah.

752
00:55:09,312 --> 00:55:12,202
That's why I wanted to introduce you to my mom.

753
00:55:12,202 --> 00:55:16,622
I'm sorry, Sarah. I was being too hasty.

754
00:55:19,842 --> 00:55:24,672
Ajussi. It's true that I like you.

755
00:55:24,672 --> 00:55:28,602
You're a very good person.

756
00:55:28,602 --> 00:55:35,732
So I was thinking of getting back together with you.

757
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:38,422
But I can't.

758
00:55:38,422 --> 00:55:41,772
Ajussi, I...

759
00:55:41,772 --> 00:55:44,952
I...

760
00:55:44,952 --> 00:55:48,562
I can't live in a house like that.

761
00:55:48,562 --> 00:55:51,472
Sarah...

762
00:55:51,472 --> 00:55:53,942
Ajussi.

763
00:55:53,942 --> 00:55:58,242
Have you ever lived in a home without a bathroom?

764
00:55:58,242 --> 00:55:59,502
What?

765
00:55:59,502 --> 00:56:07,102
At first, my dream was to live in a house with a flushing toilet.

766
00:56:07,102 --> 00:56:10,102
Then it was my dream to live in a house where there were no cockroaches.

767
00:56:10,102 --> 00:56:15,072
After that, it was my dream to live in an apartment.

768
00:56:15,072 --> 00:56:18,002
I was like that.

769
00:56:18,002 --> 00:56:22,452
I'm only born into this world once. I want to live well just once before I die.

770
00:56:22,452 --> 00:56:26,682
I don't want to become poor again.

771
00:56:29,422 --> 00:56:32,472
Sarah...

772
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:35,042
I...

773
00:56:35,042 --> 00:56:39,222
I don't have anything right now.

774
00:56:39,222 --> 00:56:43,702
But if we work hard together, we can buy a house and live happily too.

775
00:56:43,702 --> 00:56:49,012
We... We're still young and healthy.

776
00:56:49,012 --> 00:56:53,922
Sure. We can probably start off together.

777
00:56:53,922 --> 00:56:56,782
Because I like you right now.

778
00:56:56,782 --> 00:57:02,322
But Ajussi, I'll probably run away from you before a year even goes by.

779
00:57:02,322 --> 00:57:08,312
The only thing that can change my pathetic life is to meet a rich man and marry him.

780
00:57:08,312 --> 00:57:11,532
I have been working hard for that until now.

781
00:57:11,532 --> 00:57:17,522
I don't want to bet the last opportunity in my life on you.

782
00:57:19,262 --> 00:57:24,282
I told you that I didn't want to hurt you anymore!

783
00:57:24,282 --> 00:57:28,152
So don't ever come to see me again,

784
00:57:28,152 --> 00:57:31,892
and meet a nice woman that suits you.

785
00:57:33,822 --> 00:57:36,872
I'll get going.

786
00:57:51,152 --> 00:57:53,372
Are you home, Sarah?

787
00:57:53,372 --> 00:57:56,102
Hey, Sarah. What's wrong?

788
00:57:56,102 --> 00:57:59,132
Did something happen?

789
00:57:59,132 --> 00:58:01,292
What's wrong?

790
00:58:01,292 --> 00:58:03,622
Hey! Sarah!

791
00:58:03,622 --> 00:58:07,062
Sarah! Hey! Open the door!

792
00:58:09,232 --> 00:58:12,212
Open the door, Sarah! Come on.

793
00:58:12,212 --> 00:58:14,392
Sarah!

794
00:58:28,592 --> 00:58:32,882
Why is she like that again all of a sudden?

795
00:58:32,882 --> 00:58:36,612
Did she go see Se Jong again?

796
00:58:51,292 --> 00:58:55,142
What are you doing here, kids?

797
00:58:55,142 --> 00:58:57,282
You're sick right now, Ms. Park.

798
00:58:57,282 --> 00:59:01,352
Dad said not to bother you so you could rest.

799
00:59:01,352 --> 00:59:05,982
But... we missed you.

800
00:59:05,982 --> 00:59:08,722
That's why we were secretly looking at you.

801
00:59:10,082 --> 00:59:11,952
I'm all better now.

802
00:59:11,952 --> 00:59:13,492
I'm fine now!

803
00:59:13,492 --> 00:59:16,422
Then can we play with you now, Ms. Park?

804
00:59:16,422 --> 00:59:17,702
Of course!

805
00:59:17,702 --> 00:59:21,722
I've only been in bed, so I'm itching to move.

806
00:59:21,722 --> 00:59:23,382
Let's go get some fresh air!

807
00:59:23,382 --> 00:59:25,962
- Okay!
- Yes! Nice!

808
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:29,092
What? You're going to get some fresh air?

809
00:59:29,092 --> 00:59:31,982
You can't go out yet, Ms. Park.

810
00:59:31,982 --> 00:59:33,842
Of course, I can.

811
00:59:33,842 --> 00:59:35,132
Let's go, kids!

812
00:59:35,132 --> 00:59:36,572
- Okay!
- Okay!

813
00:59:36,572 --> 00:59:38,922
- Nice!
- Sweet!

814
01:00:33,642 --> 01:00:36,542
I did it! I did it!

815
01:00:36,542 --> 01:00:39,372
Dad, you are a genius at this.

816
01:00:39,372 --> 01:00:40,722
Daebak.

817
01:00:40,722 --> 01:00:42,912
Now that I've succeeded on this,

818
01:00:42,912 --> 01:00:46,872
you guys have to treat me today, okay?

819
01:00:54,072 --> 01:00:56,012
Lee Se Jong!

820
01:00:56,012 --> 01:00:58,142
How could you do this?

821
01:00:58,142 --> 01:01:01,002
I did this with my blood and sweat.

822
01:01:01,002 --> 01:01:05,842
Dad, you buy the tteokbokki.

823
01:01:11,122 --> 01:01:14,082
Dad, it's okay. You'll get tteokbokki for us, right?

824
01:01:14,082 --> 01:01:18,122
Dad, thank you for the food!

825
01:01:18,122 --> 01:01:21,892
- Thank you!
- Dad, fighting!

826
01:01:24,842 --> 01:01:26,612
The tteokbokki was really good.

827
01:01:26,612 --> 01:01:29,962
It was extra good because you bought it, Dad.

828
01:01:29,962 --> 01:01:32,962
Chairman, please do this for us in the future too.

829
01:01:32,962 --> 01:01:35,192
Yes, as much as you'd like.

830
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:39,972
It was so much fun playing the Dalgona game.

831
01:01:39,972 --> 01:01:43,812
Dad, let's play that again next time.

832
01:01:43,812 --> 01:01:45,842
Yes, let's do it again.

833
01:01:45,842 --> 01:01:51,032
Se Jong. We almost made it except for one mistake.

834
01:01:51,032 --> 01:01:53,062
- You, too, right?
- Yes!

835
01:01:53,062 --> 01:01:55,092
Next time, I will get that umbrella.

836
01:01:55,092 --> 01:01:57,522
Me, too!

837
01:01:59,262 --> 01:02:02,222
I will make it next time.

838
01:02:11,772 --> 01:02:16,232
Chief Jo, how can you come back here when we agreed you wouldn't come?

839
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:18,592
The owner, Ms. Jung, was supposed to come.

840
01:02:18,592 --> 01:02:22,552
Chief Jo, if you keep acting like this, it'll be a problem.

841
01:02:22,552 --> 01:02:26,302
I will have to report to the Chairman.

842
01:02:26,302 --> 01:02:30,162
Chief Kim. My boss has gone on a business trip.

843
01:02:30,162 --> 01:02:32,502
That's why I had to come.

844
01:02:32,502 --> 01:02:35,722
Also, I only come during the day, so I won't be running into the Chairman.

845
01:02:35,722 --> 01:02:37,432
Why would you worry?

846
01:02:37,432 --> 01:02:41,022
Then Chief Jo, let's do it just today.

847
01:02:41,022 --> 01:02:45,852
Chief Kim, can we let it slide for today?

848
01:02:51,352 --> 01:02:54,382
Chief Jo.

849
01:02:54,382 --> 01:02:58,012
What are you doing here?

850
01:02:58,012 --> 01:03:01,482
Hello, I've come to do the flower arrangements.

851
01:03:01,482 --> 01:03:03,492
What?

852
01:03:03,492 --> 01:03:05,792
Flower arrangements?

853
01:03:07,192 --> 01:03:09,232
What's going on here?

854
01:03:09,232 --> 01:03:15,752
Chairman, the fact is Jo Sarah started working at the flower shop we work with.

855
01:03:15,752 --> 01:03:19,332
So, she's been coming here twice a week to do the flower arrangements.

856
01:03:19,332 --> 01:03:22,152
I should have reported it to you.

857
01:03:22,152 --> 01:03:26,022
It got delayed due to my mistake. I am sorry.

858
01:03:27,612 --> 01:03:29,802
Chief Kim.

859
01:03:29,802 --> 01:03:34,602
Do you think it makes sense that Chief Jo doing flowers arrangements in our house?

860
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:37,392
I'm sorry.

861
01:03:37,392 --> 01:03:39,082
Chief Jo.

862
01:03:39,082 --> 01:03:41,172
Please don't come here anymore.

863
01:03:41,172 --> 01:03:45,382
Chief Kim, please take care of it.

864
01:03:53,482 --> 01:03:56,152
Jo Sarah!

865
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:03,962
Chief Jo.

866
01:04:03,962 --> 01:04:06,142
What do you think you are doing?

867
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:10,052
I am still your fiancée.

868
01:04:10,052 --> 01:04:16,112
No matter what anyone says, I'm your fiancée!

869
01:04:16,112 --> 01:04:20,202
- What did you say?
- You called off the engagement unilaterally.

870
01:04:20,202 --> 01:04:23,932
I never agreed to it. So, please!

871
01:04:23,932 --> 01:04:26,792
Do not tell me what to do condescendingly.

872
01:04:26,792 --> 01:04:31,282
Do not contempt me like that!

873
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:35,622
What is going on?

874
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:39,052
Isn't that Chief Jo's voice? Who is she yelling at like that?

875
01:04:39,052 --> 01:04:43,142
Is she yelling to Young Gook?

876
01:04:48,612 --> 01:04:51,292
Chief Jo.

877
01:04:51,292 --> 01:04:55,052
What are you saying right now?

878
01:04:55,062 --> 01:04:57,412
We already called off our engagement.

879
01:04:57,412 --> 01:05:00,662
It's been a long time since you received the compensation as a settlement.

880
01:05:00,662 --> 01:05:04,272
So what's this nonsense about?

881
01:05:04,272 --> 01:05:06,032
Chairman.

882
01:05:06,032 --> 01:05:10,562
You're claiming we broke up because of the tiny compensation you gave me?

883
01:05:10,562 --> 01:05:13,552
I didn't ask you to give me money.

884
01:05:13,552 --> 01:05:17,482
I haven't used a single penny of it!

885
01:05:17,482 --> 01:05:19,992
I'm waiting day after day...

886
01:05:19,992 --> 01:05:23,672
for your memories to come back.

887
01:05:23,672 --> 01:05:27,512
I was only waiting for that day to come!

888
01:05:30,752 --> 01:05:34,882
I'm just arranging flowers for you at least, Chairman.

889
01:05:34,882 --> 01:05:37,112
Don't you think you're being too harsh to me?

890
01:05:37,112 --> 01:05:41,012
How could you do this to me?!

891
01:05:41,012 --> 01:05:43,362
What?

892
01:05:43,362 --> 01:05:45,652
You're waiting for my memories to come back?

893
01:05:45,652 --> 01:05:48,502
Yes. Chairman...

894
01:05:48,502 --> 01:05:50,642
You liked me.

895
01:05:50,642 --> 01:05:52,942
We really loved each other!

896
01:05:52,942 --> 01:05:56,652
That's why we got engaged. How could I forget that?

897
01:05:56,652 --> 01:06:00,812
How can I not wait for that moment to come back?

898
01:06:00,812 --> 01:06:05,902
I can never accept calling off our engagement.

899
01:06:05,902 --> 01:06:08,382
Chief Kim.

900
01:06:08,382 --> 01:06:12,272
Chief Kim! Driver Kang!

901
01:06:15,362 --> 01:06:17,982
Take this woman out.

902
01:06:17,982 --> 01:06:20,732
And never let her come to our home again.

903
01:06:20,732 --> 01:06:23,042
Take her out immediately!

904
01:06:23,042 --> 01:06:25,282
Yes, sir!

905
01:06:29,692 --> 01:06:32,912
Chief Jo, let's just go.

906
01:06:32,912 --> 01:06:34,852
Just wait and see, Chairman.

907
01:06:34,852 --> 01:06:37,732
I'm sure you will regret this later.

908
01:06:37,732 --> 01:06:39,912
Once your memories come back...

909
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:43,102
you'll kneel down and apologize to me!

910
01:06:43,102 --> 01:06:45,832
Ch-Chief Jo. Let's go!

911
01:07:00,252 --> 01:07:02,672
How could you do this to me?

912
01:07:02,672 --> 01:07:05,722
Do you think it's over if you say you can't remember?

913
01:07:05,722 --> 01:07:11,442
Then what about me? The one who remembers all of our memories together!

914
01:07:11,442 --> 01:07:15,532
Gosh, Chief Jo! Why are you doing this?

915
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:19,262
Madam. Could you at least please talk to him?

916
01:07:19,262 --> 01:07:21,772
You know everything, Madam!

917
01:07:21,772 --> 01:07:23,422
Chief Jo.

918
01:07:26,092 --> 01:07:31,572
How could you do this after taking me around when you reverted to 22 years old?

919
01:07:31,572 --> 01:07:35,532
How could you do this after living like a married couple with me!

920
01:07:35,532 --> 01:07:38,962
Please talk to him, Madam! Please!

921
01:07:38,962 --> 01:07:40,962
- Let's go.
- Follow me.

922
01:07:40,962 --> 01:07:42,772
Madam!

923
01:07:42,772 --> 01:07:45,952
My gosh. What's wrong with Chief Jo?

924
01:07:45,952 --> 01:07:49,672
Has she lost her mind?

925
01:07:54,212 --> 01:07:56,802
Madam!

926
01:07:59,312 --> 01:08:03,982
Jo Sarah. Don't ever come here again.

927
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:17,542
That bastard. Bastard!

928
01:08:17,542 --> 01:08:21,132
How could he treat me like this?

929
01:08:21,132 --> 01:08:23,632
I was still his fiancée once.

930
01:08:23,632 --> 01:08:28,242
How could he be so cold to me like this? How?

931
01:08:28,242 --> 01:08:34,132
What did I do so wrong? How could he not look back at me once?

932
01:08:41,512 --> 01:08:43,502
Yes.

933
01:08:51,352 --> 01:08:54,272
Are you okay, Chairman?

934
01:08:54,272 --> 01:08:56,442
I'm okay.

935
01:08:56,442 --> 01:08:58,422
You must've been really startled.

936
01:08:58,422 --> 01:09:00,612
No, I'm fine.

937

- What brings you all the way here?

949
01:10:34,322 --> 01:10:36,512
Since you're in a relationship with Young Gook...

Don't come to see us anymore.
