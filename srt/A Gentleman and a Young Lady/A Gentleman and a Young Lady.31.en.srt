[Episode 31]

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,340
Chief Jo.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,920
Let's call off our engagement.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,350
Excuse me?

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,640
Break our engagement?

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,680
Chairman!

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,230
No matter the reason, I'm the one who's calling off the engagement,

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,970
so I'll ask Lawyer Koh to arrange financial compensation.

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,330
Why are you acting like this to me suddenly?

10
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,530
What did I do wrong?

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,740
You are the one at fault!

12
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,630
Pushing your fiancée aside, you took Ms. Park to the vacation home.

13
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,300
You spent the night with Ms. Park when the kids were there too,

14
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,890
and now you want to cancel the engagement with innocent me?

15
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,440
Chief Jo. I didn't call Ms. Park to come over.

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,440
Se Chan called Ms. Park to bring his cell phone.

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,990
The children set the storage on fire while playing in it,

18
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,590
so Ms. Park got injured while saving them, so she stayed over with us.

19
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,230
Are you expecting me to believe that story?

20
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,560
Don't lie like that to me.

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,070
Listening to you talking now,

22
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,380
it's clear why I need to call off our engagement.

23
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,890
Chairman, it's not like that...

24
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,400
I really wanted to go to the vacation house with you and the children,

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,670
but Ms. Park was the one who went instead.

26
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,770
So I got very upset and said such nonsensical things.

27
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,720
But you don't understand my feelings.

28
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,450
How can you be like this to me when I devoted myself to you and the children all this time?

29
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,050
Have you devoted yourself to the children?

30
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,750
Is that why you locked up my children in the dark storage?

31
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,370
With what right!

32
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,520
Pardon?

33
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,980
- That was...
- That is enough reason

34
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:59,340
to disqualify you from becoming my children's mother.

35
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,120
I'm sorry, Chairman.

36
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,880
I went overboard. I will apologize to the children and get along better with them.

37
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,110
Even if the children did it wrong,

38
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:13,870
you couldn't have acted that way if you had any affections for them.

39
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,750
Chief Jo. Until now,

40
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:23,310
though I have no feelings for you or the memory of the last three months,

41
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:28,420
I tried to keep our engagement while waiting for the memory to come back.

42
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:34,310
But there is no reason for that anymore. Let's end it here.

43
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:40,110
Chairman. I'm sorry. I will not act like that again.

44
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,450
Chairman, please.

45
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,780
You are only making it harder for yourself.

46
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:18,260
Acting like that to the Chairman's fiancée was wrong on my part.

47
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,610
I deserved to be slapped.

48
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,040
But what do I do now?

49
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,940
How do I face Chief Jo every day from now on?

50
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,320
Ms. Park. The Chairman just called.

51
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,470
He wants you to take a week of sick leave and have a good rest.

52
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,870
Sick leave?

53
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,640
Yes. You need to rest from being injured while saving Se Jong and Se Chan.

54
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,470
You haven't had a break all this time either.

55
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,170
You should take advantage of it and visit your family and spend time with your friends.

56
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:55,690
Don't worry about anything here. Rest well and come back.

57
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,870
Yes, I will.

58
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,200
- Dan Dan.
- Hey, Park Dan Dan.

59
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,260
What's up with the bag?

60
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,270
Did you get fired, Dan Dan?

61
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:16,560
Or did you quit already to get ready to go to the US?

62
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,400
No, it's not that. I got time off.

63
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,510
Since I haven't had a break, the Chairman gave me a few days off.

64
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:28,200
I see. It's no use quitting early. You have to make as much money as possible.

65
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,750
You still have time.

66
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:35,320
Dan Dan, what happened to your hand?

67
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,670
This? I got a slight burn.

68
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,880
While I was boiling water for coffee.

69
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,230
It's nothing, Dad.

70
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:46,380
Ah, honestly. You should have been careful.

71
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,400
But, we are all leaving for work.

72
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,220
What are you going to do all by yourself?

73
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,190
It's okay. I will stay home and rest.

74
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,870
Right. If you are bored, come to the restaurant.

75
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:04,210
If you get bored, come and wait tables, if you like.

76
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:09,190
What are you saying to someone who's on a break? Don't you see the bandage on her hand?

77
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,780
Right. She's here to take a break.

78
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:17,640
Dan Dan, go to my room and sleep and rest.

79
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,460
Yes, Grandma. I will rest a bit and go to the restaurant in a little while.

80
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,310
No, no.

81
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,200
You don't need to.

82
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,570
Let's go then.

83
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,250
Have a rest.

84
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,270
Is it you, Sarah?

85
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:54,580
What's wrong with you?

86
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,720
Hey, Sarah.

87
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,380
Oh, my! Sarah!

88
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,710
Hey, Sarah! What's going on? What happened?

89
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,250
Why are you like this?

90
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:13,690
Mom. What do I do now?

91
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:19,150
My Se Jong... What should I do with my Se Jong now?

92
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,990
Chairman wants to call off the engagement!

93
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,810
What do I do now, Mom?

94
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,940
Call off the engagement?

95
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:35,430
Did his 22-year-old time's memory come back?

96
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,390
No.

97
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,760
His memory hasn't come back.

98
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,970
But he says I'm not qualified to be his children's mom.

99
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,980
He used that as an excuse to call off the engagement.

100
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,590
What?

101
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,940
What should I do now, Mom?

102
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:56,800
Should I get a lawyer? This is very unfair, Mom!

103
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,780
After all this, he said, what?

104
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,700
It's still an engagement.

105
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,530
How can he do that overnight?

106
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,760
That bastard...

107
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,990
Hey, Wang Dae Ran!

108
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,170
What are you going to do with my Sarah?

109
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,310
What are you going to do now!

110
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:19,560
What are you saying, Gi Ja? What is this all about?

111
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,460
My daughter is on her death bed from the engagement getting canceled.

112
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,800
Here you are, napping in the middle of the day!

113
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,680
Do you feel fine all yourself?

114
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,770
What? What do you mean the engagement got canceled?

115
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:38,410
Did Young Gook's memory come back?

116
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,730
His memory didn't come back.

117
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,330
But he wants to cancel the engagement out of the blue.

118
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:51,950
Why did he get engaged in the first place when he will call it off unilaterally?

119
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,720
Hey, you, Wang Dae Ran.

120
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,420
You take responsibility. Take responsibility for my Sarah!

121
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,750
Madam, Madam! The Chairman is home.

122
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:06,850
Is that so? That bastard is home.

123
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,080
Where's Chairman Lee?

124
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,570
- Hey, you! Come out!
- Please don't do this, Chief Jo's mother!

125
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,630
- Driver Kang!
- Please stop, ma'am.

126
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,160
Let me go.

127
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,430
Let go of me!

128
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,200
What's going on?

129
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,830
Please let go of her since she seems like she has something to say.

130
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:33,550
My Sarah. What are you going to do about my Sarah?

131
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:39,290
Everyone in the nation knows that you and my Sarah are engaged.

132
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:44,230
You had all the fun taking her to an island and the vacation home.

133
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,180
Why did you call off the engagement?

134
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,550
Why did you get engaged with her if you were going to do this?

135
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,620
How can you do this to her!

136
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,570
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,500
But I've talked to Chief Jo about this aplenty.

138
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,230
I have nothing more to say about it.

139
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,300
Driver Kang, please escort her out.

140
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,280
- Hey!
- Please leave now.

141
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,720
Hey, Chairman Lee, what?

142
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,140
You have nothing more to say?

143
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,620
When you ruined my Sarah's future like this?

144
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,180
What makes you so arrogant?

145
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,600
Hey, what's so great about you!

146
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,620
- Who do you think you are!
- Stop it, please!

147
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,490
- Hey, you!
- Please, let's go!

148
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,670
I will make you pay for this!

149
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,890
What calamity is this when everything was fine until this morning?

150
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,510
I don't think his memory has come back.

151
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,750
What is Chief Jo going to do now?

152
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,380
You bastard!

153
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,920
This damn household...

154
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:56,270
I've been feeling guilty and sorry about stealing money and gold bars.

155
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,670
Not anymore.

156
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,250
Let's call it even with this.

157
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:06,070
It's even now!

158
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,390
Ms. Park got time off?

159
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,880
Yes, she's at home.

160
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,620
Soo Chul, then let's invite Dan Dan too.

161
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,330
What did I say? Did I call her Dan Dan?

162
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:27,950
Perhaps I'm feeling very comfortable around her.

163
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,920
He doesn't think that's strange, does he?

164
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,670
Would that be okay?

165
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,260
Of course. We need to talk about going to the US together.

166
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:42,320
And listen to what she has in mind again as well.

167
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,810
Okay, let's do that.

168
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,230
Yes, CEO Anna.

169
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,940
Now?

170
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,030
Ms. Park, what happened to your hand?

171
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,750
Did you get hurt?

172
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,870
She burned it slightly while boiling water for coffee.

173
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:18,750
You should have been careful. I hope it doesn't leave a scar.

174
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,830
The doctor said not to worry.

175
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:24,050
As long as I take the medication and put the ointment.

176
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,050
That's fortunate.

177
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,660
You must be hungry.

178
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,890
Let's eat, Driver Park.

179
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,450
Yes.

180
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,570
Eat as much as you want.

181
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,830
Please, start first.

182
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,520
You are not eating much today, Ms. Park.

183
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,460
I've eaten a lot.

184
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,390
Everything tasted great.

185
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,100
So, Ms. Park.

186
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,810
Have you decided about going to the US?

187
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,580
The US?

188
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:16,230
We need to get a passport and apply for a visa.

189
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:20,600
We are going together, right?

190
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,800
Well, about that...

191
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:29,660
I'm still thinking about it.

192
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:34,810
Whether I should leave here,

193
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:38,740
I don't know yet.

194
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,620
- Ms. Park.
- What's wrong, Dan Dan?

195
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,540
I'm sorry, CEO Anna.

196
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,350
Please excuse me first.

197
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,410
I'm sorry, Dad. I'll get going first.

198
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,760
- Dan Dan.
- Ms. Park.

199
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,520
I wonder why she's acting like that.

200
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,560
I think it's because of her boyfriend.

201
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,620
Pardon?

202
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,770
A boyfriend?

203
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:15,270
Does she have a boyfriend?

204
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:20,300
Yes. I asked her if she had one when I stayed at Chairman Lee's house.

205
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,740
And she said she had a boyfriend.

206
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,780
Really? Who is it?

207
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,300
She didn't tell me who he was.

208
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,860
And later, when she came over to see me,

209
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,410
she cried a river saying she had broken up with her boyfriend.

210
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,740
My Dan Dan did so?

211
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,560
I had no idea.

212
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,110
I'm wondering if she's having issues with that boyfriend.

213
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:52,760
It's just my hunch, but I wonder if the boyfriend is stopping her from going to the US.

214
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,260
If not that, why would she act like that?

215
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:00,010
It makes no sense for her to be like that over the Chairman's children.

216
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,860
Right.

217
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,690
- Ms. Park!
- Ms. Park!

218
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,890
Ms. Park!

219
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,560
Jenny, Se Chan, Se Jong. What are you doing here?

220
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,150
We've come to visit you because you're on sick leave.

221
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,990
Because I'm on sick leave?

222
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,280
Here, it's a cake.

223
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,590
Is it really that good?

224
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,600
Yes. It's daebak delicious.

225
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,490
It's so good!

226
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,990
Ms. Park, please make this for us at home, too.

227
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,790
Okay, I will.

228
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:55,210
But there are carrots Se Jong dislikes and spinach that Se Chan doesn't like.

229
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,700
Is it still good?

230
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,430
I know. I don't like the taste when it's a side dish.

231
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,960
But they taste delicious like this.

232
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,460
Me, too. Carrots don't taste like poop.

233
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:13,310
Hey, Lee Se Jong, how can you talk about poop while eating?

234
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,840
I'm so exhausted.

235
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,680
Yes, Dae Beom, it's me.

236
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,250
Are you feeling better, my baby Bambi?

237
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,430
Have you been sleeping all this time?

238
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:54,090
Yes, I rested a bit, and I feel better now.

239
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,080
Don't come here to work anymore.

240
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,330
I don't like seeing you having a hard time here.

241
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:05,180
Let's find other ways to get my father's recognition.

242
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,040
Okay, I got it.

243
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,220
I will do as you say.

244
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,010
Thank you, Se Ryun.

245
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:15,280
- I'll call you when I'm done with work.
 - Okay.

246
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,780
Kiss kiss?

247
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,690
It's too difficult to get along with his family.

248
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,580
What do I do?

249
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:35,890
Is there no way to get Dae Beom out of there somehow?

250
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,850
Yes, Seung Ho.

251
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,010
What? Golf?

252
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,070
Nice shot!

253
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:18,340
I'm playing well even though it's been a long time.

254
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,150
I taught you how to golf.

255
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,360
We went out golfing together.

256
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,240
That's right. We did.

257
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,410
It's been such a long time for me to come out like this.

258
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,900
I feel refreshed and alive.

259
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,840
It feels so liberating.

260
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,090
Really?

261
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,350
Let's come out often.

262
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,520
Okay.

263
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,730
It feels so great!

264
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,030
- Mom.
- Oh, you startled me.

265
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,190
My goodness, who are you?

266
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,780
Who are you to call me mom?

267
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,470
Mom. How can you say that to your one and only son?

268
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,700
Mom, let's go get something to eat.

269
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,450
Your son will buy your favorite udon.

270
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,460
Let's go on a date arm in arm.

271
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,240
How about that?

272
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,770
What?

273
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:13,660
Okay, then tell me what you plan to do going forward.

274
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:19,750
Once I hear it, I will decide whether I will go on a date with you or not.

275
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,980
Mom.

276
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,110
Should I try acting?

277
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:28,750
I think I have a talent that cannot be controlled inside.

278
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,980
What?

279
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,400
I'll become an actor.

280
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,020
I'll learn how to dance. You told me I was handsome.

281
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,900
I feel like I will succeed as an entertainer.

282
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,430
Do you want to see me dance?

283
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,580
Watch me.

284
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:51,190
♪ It's alright, let's go to my house. ♪

285
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,560
♪ In 10 minutes, I'll be waiting for you over there. ♪

286
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,990
- Hey!
- ♪ It's alright, let's go to my house. ♪

287
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,890
- Get out. Get out!
- Mom, it hurts!

288
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:05,070
Are you hanging onto a false dream now?

289
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:08,700
Are you really going to give up the medical school that everyone wants to go to?

290
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,970
If that's the case, you end your relationship with me.

291
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,130
- Mom.
- What?

292
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,230
How can you talk about ending our relationship that easily?

293
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,140
Can you live without me?

294
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:21,500
Hey, you. Let go of me. Let go.

295
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,550
Mom, I love you.

296
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,840
Stop it!

297
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:53,800
Mi Rim, how can something so crazy like a TV drama happen to us?

298
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,090
If you are my aunt's niece,

299
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:01,110
that means we're in-laws.

300
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:04,610
Then what should we do now?

301
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,420
I'm going blank suddenly.

302
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:10,930
Me, too. I don't know what to do as well.

303
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:15,490
Are you going to tell your mom about us seeing each other?

304
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:21,310
How can I? She'll go berserk if she finds out about us.

305
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:25,380
I don't know why but I feel like the bloody wind is coming our way.

306
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,040
Joon Oh.

307
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:34,560
Why don't we each take time to think about what to do now?

308
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,390
What do you mean by that?

309
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,770
What are you saying?

310
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:45,000
I don't know. I just feel like we need to think about things.

311
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,760
I feel like I've been hit by a bomb.

312
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,430
Seriously, what should we do now?

313
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,450
I know.

314
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,440
What should we do?

315
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,560
Ajumeoni, I don't see Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong.

316
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,610
I was going to tell you.

317
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:13,550
The children went to see Ms. Park at her house.

318
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,400
What?

319
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,860
Three, Six, Nine! Three, Six, Nine! Three, Six, Nine!

320
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,240
- One!
- Two!

321
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,260
Three....

322
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,260
You got that wrong.

323
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,000
I've lost my wits. Okay, you can hit me!

324
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,140
Don't whine that it hurts!

325
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,190
One, two, three!

326
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:34,980
Aigoo, you're going to kill my son.

327
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,860
- Wow, these kids are strong..!
- Why are you so bad at this?

328
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,720
You just wait. I will get my chance.

329
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,400
You worry for yourself.

330
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,840
Three, Six, Nine! Three, Six, Nine!

331
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,750
- One.
- Two!
- Three!

332
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,260
Grandma, you got it wrong!

333
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:56,190
Why am I wrong? Aren't you supposed to shout three, six, and nine?

334
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,510
Mom, you have to clap when three, six, or nine comes around.

335
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:02,590
Since Grandma didn't get it this time, let's call it a practice.

336
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,950
Let's do it again.

337
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,490
Grandma, fighting!

338
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,850
You have to get it right, Mom.

339
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,470
Don't worry about me.

340
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:13,250
I was good at studying when I was in school.

341
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,360
Three, Six, Nine! Three, Six, Nine!

342
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,600
- One!
- Two!

343
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,780
- Four!
- Five!
- Six!

344
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,160
You got it wrong again, Grandma.

345
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,850
I can't live because of my mom.

346
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:29,750
Why did you say Six when you should have just clapped?

347
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,000
- You're driving me crazy.
- Are you guys having fun?

348
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,250
- Have some snacks.
- I want to play too.

349
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:38,550
Okay, we will change the players now.

350
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,420
Have a seat here. Three, Six, Nine! Three, Six, Nine!

351
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,450
- One!
- Two!
- Three!

352
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:49,210
It's a complete mess! What is this?

353
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,260
Let's just eat the cookies.

354
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,060
Hyung, it was so much fun.

355
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,730
Yes, it was.

356
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,550
But I feel sad we can't play some more.

357
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:06,250
We can come back again.

358
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,390
- Dad!
- Dad!

359
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:11,340
- Dad.
- Yes, children.

360
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,980
Did you come to pick them up? I was about to take them home.

361
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:20,130
No, you are on your break. Of course, I should come to pick them up.

362
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,270
I guess you couldn't have a rest because of the kids.

363
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,560
No, it wasn't like that.

364
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,020
Then, have a goodnight. Bye-bye, children.

365
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,950
Ms. Park, how can you betray us like this?

366
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:35,530
We promised to get some Bungeo-ppang together.

367
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:40,650
I will buy you some, Jenny.

368
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:45,450
Okay, it's on you, Dad. Ms. Park, let's go.

369
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,230
Dad, let's go.

370
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,930
Hurry, hurry.

371
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,190
Let's go!

372
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,310
Hyung ate the tail first.

373
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:05,780
Noona ate the fin first.

374
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:09,400
Where should I eat first?

375
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,770
You can start with the head.

376
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,930
I think it'll hurt the fish.

377
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,320
I don't think I can eat this because I feel sorry.

378
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,210
Give it to me then. I'll eat it for you.

379
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,490
No!

380
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:27,820
Ms. Park, why aren't you eating?

381
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,820
It's because I'm full. Do you want it, Se Chan?

382
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,150
Yes, I'd love to!

383
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:41,530
Ms. Park. Did you go to the hospital?

384
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:46,580
Yes, it's okay now. Please don't worry.

385
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,870
Ms. Park, please eat this.

386
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,980
You didn't have much dinner either.

387
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:00,070
I'm okay. Please have as much as you want.

388
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,810
What did you do at Ms. Park's house?

389
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:16,590
Ms. Park made us big bibimbap.

390
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:19,970
In a bowl this big, she mixed carrots, spinach, and eggs.

391
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:25,890
She made bibimbap with a ton of vegetables, and it was delicious.

392
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:26,930
Really?

393
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:31,590
And we played the game of yut, ddakji, and the three-six-nine game!

394
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,990
Dad, it's so much fun at Ms. Park's house.

395
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:39,530
It's a hundred, thousand times more fun than our house.

396
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:43,160
Who did you play with? With Ms. Park?

397
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:48,330
We played it with her uncle and grandma. Ms. Park couldn't play because she was sick.

398
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:53,240
I've never seen her be like that all this time she's been with us.

399
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,260
I think she's really not feeling well.

400
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:00,130
She didn't eat bibimbap nor play games with us.

401
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:04,640
She had no energy at all.

402
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:08,420
She seemed to be worried about something.

403
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:14,260
What's up with you guys? Do you know about something?

404
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:18,250
No, we don't know anything.

405
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,150
It's very suspicious.

406
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:24,950
Lee Se Jong. Won't you tell your Noona?

407
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:30,140
Noona, please don't ask anymore. It's painful.

408
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,720
What the heck are you saying? I don't want to ask as well.

409
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,040
Ms. Park, you didn't look too well today.

410
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:01,390
I will make an appointment with Dr. Kim tomorrow. Why don't you get a thorough exam?

411
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:06,790
I feel bad since you got injured because of Se Chan and Se Jong.

412
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,820
It's okay. I'm sure I will feel better after a few days of rest.

413
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:17,510
Thank you for your generosity.

414
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,470
Are you sure you will be okay?

415
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:36,900
[Are you sure you will be okay?]

416
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,610
Se Jong.

417
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:54,600
Don't be sick.

418
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,010
Stay healthy and well.

419
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:03,280
Your mom will come back...

420
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:08,510
to you for sure.

421
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:22,310
Aigoo, aigoo. All of my body hurts.

422
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:27,520
I told you to take this regularly.

423
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,880
You should have given me that earlier. You are just nagging at me without giving me a massage or so.

424
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,310
Here, take this. I get it!

425
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,900
Everybody loves good stuff.

426
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,920
- Is Dan Dan out?
- Yes.

427
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,760
She just went out.

428
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,530
She said she'd see her friend after going to the hospital.

429
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:52,100
But Mom, is it okay for me to do nothing?

430
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:56,620
Don't you think I should go thank CEO Anna in person?

431
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:01,920
Yes, you should. Bring her some marinated crab I made with you.

432
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,060
Right?

433
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:09,550
Can you imagine how many people are sucking up to her?

434
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:16,870
What if those suckers make the CEO's mind change and cancel Soo Chul's job?

435
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:19,010
I have to get on her good side

436
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:23,130
and make sure to take Soo Chul with her to the US.

437
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,520
Isn't that what a supportive partner should be doing?

438
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,480
That's right.

439
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,000
You should go and thank her.

440
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,880
Tell her how much we appreciate her.

441
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,890
Okay.

442
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:39,620
Please keep drinking that.

443
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,800
I drank it all.

444
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,190
This is where I left it.

445
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,150
My Dan Dan...

446
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:02,280
She was so cute even as a baby.

447
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,480
My Dan Dan and Soo Chul...

448
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,350
I'll make sure to take them to the US with me,

449
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:15,660
and let them live a new and better life.

450
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:18,600
My Dan Dan.

451
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,210
This person...

452
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:35,830
Why did she come here?

453
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,750
Hello, CEO Kim.

454
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:50,110
We met last time. I'm Park Soo Chul's wife.

455
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,290
Yes, hello.

456
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,180
But what brings you here?

457
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:57,050
I feel so grateful and thankful for what you've done.

458
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,470
So I came to show you my gratitude.

459
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:02,470
It's okay if I go in for a moment, right?

460
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,730
Oh, wait...

461
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:06,010
I'm not good at other things, but I can cook.

462
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:08,450
So I brought some side dishes I made.

463
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:11,620
My mom's Kimchi is truly mind-blowing.

464
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,370
Give it a try.

465
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,820
Where's the fridge?

466
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,790
It's over there!

467
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:23,020
- You don't have to do that.
- Oh, no.

468
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,300
I heard you were living alone.

469
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,500
People who live alone tend not to eat very well.

470
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:34,260
You should eat proper meals from now on, okay?

471
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,030
Just a moment.

472
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:41,600
Don't mind me and take your call.

473
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,040
Yes, CEO Jung? Hello.

474
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,320
It's Anna Kim.

475
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:55,870
Gosh, what a nice home.

476
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,970
It's the kind of home I see in dramas or movies,

477
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:00,570
where a career woman lives.

478
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:03,260
Gosh, I'm jealous.

479
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:07,890
I should clean the place for her since I'm here.

480
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:10,720
Let's see.

481
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,310
Oh my, there's a lot of stuff.

482
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,510
Why are there so many pencils out?

483
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:19,130
Oh, no!

484
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:24,750
Oh, baby photos!

485
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,750
Is she the CEO's daughter?

486
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:36,520
But the photos are very similar to Dan Dan's...

487
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,640
What are you doing right now?

488
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,950
Oh, I just wanted to clean for you since I'm here.

489
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,280
No, you don't have to do that.

490
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,550
No, please. You can go back to work.

491
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:53,130
I'll clean this all up so that it's squeaky clean.

492
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,000
No, I said it's fine.

493
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,080
I have to go out now because of work.

494
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,490
Oh, I see. All right.

495
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:04,520
I'll get going then.

496
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,550
Thank you so much, CEO Kim,

497
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,910
for scouting my husband.

498
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,870
Please contact me whenever you need me.

499
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:18,170
I'll do whatever you need, whether cleaning or running errands for you.

500
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,190
Okay.

501
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:25,080
Then, have a good day, CEO.

502
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:29,740
Please take care of my husband.

503
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,130
How could she...

504
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:49,780
I mean, how could she just come all the way here without notice?

505
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:55,420
She won't show up like this again, will she?

506
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:05,880
I feel so much better after showing my face to her, at least.

507
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:11,650
But I'm pretty sure that was Dan Dan's baby pictures.

508
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:22,080
They look so similar!

509
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,440
They seem to look the same from some angles.

510
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,670
Honey?

511
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,990
Why are you looking at Dan Dan's baby pictures?

512
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:39,440
Honey, I went to CEO Anna Kim's home today.

513
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,020
What?

514
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,970
Why would you go there?

515
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:46,800
Well, I was grateful that she hired you,

516
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,910
so I brought over some homemade side dishes to thank her.

517
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:54,630
But while I was there, I saw pictures from when Dan Dan was a baby.

518
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:57,630
What are you saying right now?

519
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,450
Take a look.

520
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,480
Look here.

521
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,110
This picture is so similar!

522
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:08,210
No, I think it's the same.

523
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:12,170
Why would Dan Dan's picture be there? You're not making any sense.

524
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:16,530
Stop talking nonsense, and don't ever go there again.

525
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:19,820
It's her workplace too.

526
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,330
All right.

527
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,350
Why would you go to her workplace?

528
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:28,840
You're so thoughtless.

529
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:33,730
What? I went for you!

530
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,400
My gosh!

531
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:47,490
What is this, Madam?

532
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:51,010
As you know, my safe has been completely emptied out.

533
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,960
I'm penniless now.

534
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,640
But I tried my best to rake in as much, so take it.

535
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,220
It's a token of my feelings for you.

536
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,510
Madam...

537
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:06,160
I really thought of you as my own daughter.

538
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,820
I sincerely hoped for you to become my daughter-in-law.

539
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:14,770
I believe you know that is my sincerity.

540
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,970
I really couldn't sleep a wink last night.

541
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:30,830
The house feels so empty without you, Chief Jo.

542
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:34,300
My gosh, I'm so upset.

543
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,820
But no matter how much I thought about it all night,

544
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,720
there was no way to change Young Gook's mind.

545
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,770
If Young Gook were my biological son,

546
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:44,140
I would've even pretended to die or something.

547
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:48,800
But you know if it comes from me, Young Gook won't listen even more.

548
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:54,900
Chief Jo. Both you and I,

549
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,820
we've done all that we could, didn't we?

550
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:03,180
Which is why you should go your own way now, Chief Jo.

551
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:07,000
Young Gook isn't the only man in the world, right?

552
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,090
No. I can't, Madam.

553
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:12,630
I can't give up like this.

554
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,840
What? If not, what are you going to do?

555
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,580
- What are you thinking of doing?
- When I got fired that time,

556
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,280
it seemed like everything was over, but it wasn't.

557
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,100
It will be the same this time too.

558
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,520
So please help me.

559
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,410
If you help me, I'm sure I can go back to Chairman.

560
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,250
Please, Madam?

561
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,630
H-help you with what again?

562
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,680
I can't make Young Gook lose his memory again.

563
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,650
Aigoo, Chief Jo. We shouldn't go any further.

564
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:41,170
A person needs to know when to give up, too, when it's not working out!

565
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:43,690
No. I can't give up.

566
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:46,470
I can never give up!

567
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,830
Oh, my...

568
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,820
I can't.

569
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,110
It's ridiculous.

570
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:59,120
What is she going to do if she can't give up?

571
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,910
Both Gi Ja and Chief Jo,

572
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,990
I know they're mother and daughter,

573
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:06,120
but they're clones! Exactly the same!

574
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,580
Leeches!

575
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,980
The way they latch on like leeches is exactly the same too!

576
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,300
Oh, gosh! I'm exhausted.

577
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,480
I'm so exhausted, gosh!

578
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:19,010
Did you hear the news? The Chairman called his engagement off.

579
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:21,050
Remember what I said when the article on his engagement came out?

580
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:23,040
That his fiancée wasn't good enough for him.

581
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,290
She wasn't a good match for him.

582
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,220
You're right. Chairman has standards too.

583
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:30,300
How could he marry his butler who works for his household?

584
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:42,690
At least you should've told me that your father remarried.

585
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:45,910
I thought Younger-sister-in-law was your biological mother all this time.

586
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:49,290
Dae Beom too. I thought he was your biological brother.

587
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:54,240
I thought you knew about everything.

588
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,950
I didn't know.

589
00:38:56,950 --> 00:39:01,590
I recently found out about it by accident.

590
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,960
I'm really upset.

591
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,210
You're suffering away from home, working as a private tutor for someone else's household.

592
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:12,700
Your dad is breaking his back, working to fend for his step-family.

593
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,380
What's the point of me being upset now.

594
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,300
But Dan Dan.

595
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,020
Where did your mom go?

596
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,630
Do you talk to your biological mother often?

597
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:34,720
I wanted to ask all this to your dad,

598
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,090
but I felt like he wouldn't tell me honestly.

599
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:40,050
That's why I'm asking you.

600
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:42,740
- My mom?
- Yes.

601
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:46,060
Your biological mother who gave birth to you.

602
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,480
Where is she living right now?

603
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,810
Why did she break up with your dad?

604
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:56,500
I heard she passed away when I was young.

605
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,210
What?

606
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:01,800
Did she pass away?

607
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,830
Yes...

608
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:05,940
Oh, my goodness.

609
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:12,550
H-How did she pass away at such a young age?

610
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:17,300
Aunt, can you ask my dad for me?

611
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:22,000
He won't even tell me my mom's name,

612
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,560
he doesn't even have a single photo,

613
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:29,820
and I have no idea where my mom was buried.

614
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:34,840
I've been so upset all this time.

615
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:42,060
Aunt... I want to see my mom's face, at least.

616
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:45,630
Oh, Dan Dan!

617
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,850
Wipe your tears. Don't cry, Dan Dan.

618
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:50,040
What in the world is all this?

619
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,710
Tell me calmly and clearly.

620
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,780
Hello, Noona.

621
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:10,960
Did you kick out Dan Dan's mom because you had an affair with Dae Beom's mom?

622
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,230
Is that why Dan Dan's mom died? Did you really do that?

623
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:16,400
Why are you suddenly being like this, Noona?

624
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,240
I'm coming back from meeting Dan Dan just now.

625
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,700
Dan Dan?

626
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,840
No matter how much you liked Dae Beom's mom,

627
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,440
how could you forget your kid, Dan Dan?

628
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,040
You leaving Dan Dan's mom because you had an affair with a woman who has a son,

629
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,240
let's just say that's all in the past.

630
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:37,340
But how could you not give Dan Dan a single photo of her mom?

631
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:42,250
Dan Dan is crying her eyes out, saying she at least wants to see her mom's face.

632
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:47,420
You can't do that to Dan Dan out of all things!

633
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:51,070
You're wrong, Older-sister-in-law! We didn't have an affair!

634
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:54,740
Dan Dan's mom abandoned her newborn and ran away.

635
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,160
He didn't leave her!

636
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,810
Don't get involved in this!

637
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,670
W-what are you saying?

638
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:11,060
Dan Dan thinks that Soo Chul had an affair with you, and that's why her mother died.

639
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:14,050
You got it wrong.

640
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:18,010
Dan Dan's mom abandoned her and Soo Chul.

641
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:21,630
I was the one who saved Soo Chul when he was going to kill himself. Me!

642
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:25,490
Mom, say something. You saw everything.

643
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:27,350
Why aren't you saying anything?

644
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,820
We can tell her honestly.

645
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:33,930
Why are you making me the bad person to your sister as well?

646
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:40,020
Father...

647
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,990
What's going on?

648
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:46,040
Then...

649
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,780
Then, Dan Dan's mom...

650
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:53,290
Did she abandon our Dan Dan and Soo Chul? Is that what you're saying?

651
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:57,410
Is that what you're saying, Younger-sister-in-law?

652
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:00,070
Yes.

653
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:02,510
He felt bad for Dan Dan,

654
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:07,400
so he didn't let me say anything because she'd get hurt if she found out her mother abandoned her.

655
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,910
That's why we kept it a secret until now.

656
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:14,950
If you open up my heart,

657
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:18,220
it's probably all rotten inside.

658
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:22,710
Dan Dan misunderstanding me all this time was so tough and heartbreaking for me.

659
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:27,180
But I'm going to vindicate myself now.

660
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:32,100
It's true. Son-in-law Park and my Yeon Sil didn't have an affair.

661
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,030
Absolutely not!

662
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:38,200
Son-in-law Park asked that we wouldn't tell Dan Dan at least that

663
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,800
because she'll get hurt if she finds out her mother abandoned her.

664
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,870
That's why my Yeon Sil took the blame for everything!

665
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:54,310
Then Dan Dan's mom... Where is that woman now?

666
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:58,060
I heard she abandoned her kid and left for the US.

667
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:03,070
We haven't heard anything from her, so we don't know if she's alive or not.

668
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:08,440
Oh, my goodness! What in the world...

669
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,170
Soo Chul! Soo Chul!!

670
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:15,610
Soo Chul!

671
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:28,550
How can there be such a vile and evil wench like that?

672
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:33,230
Dan Dan was crying out, saying she didn't even know her mom's face.

673
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:36,620
I really thought my heart was going to break.

674
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:39,470
I think Dan Dan has a lot of deep resentment.

675
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:43,310
Why didn't you just give her some random photo and say it's her mom?

676
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:45,930
I wanted to do that too.

677
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:51,520
But then she would've looked at that photo every day.

678
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,220
Also, if I tell her I sprayed her ashes in the Han River,

679
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:58,420
she'd go there whenever something happens and sit there.

680
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:02,870
How could I stand watching that?

681
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:07,460
What do we do with our poor Dan Dan?

682
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:14,750
How hurt would Dan Dan get if she finds out her mother abandoned her?

683
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:19,610
It's better to think she's dead.

684
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:26,490
Do you know how that woman's doing?

685
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:30,130
I don't know. I don't even want to know.

686
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:33,850
Don't talk about that woman anymore, Noona.

687
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:37,560
Okay, I won't.

688
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:42,920
After that day, I hated Younger-sister-in-law a lot the past few days.

689
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,270
I'm so grateful to her now that I've found out the truth.

690
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:49,120
She hasn't said a word to Dan Dan all this time.

691
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:54,660
The fact that she's stayed silent until now, it seems like she has a kind side too.

692
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:59,860
Yes. She has a lot of flaws, but please view her in a good light.

693
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:03,920
She still tried to raise Dan Dan well.

694
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,510
If it weren't for my Dae Beom's mom, Dan Dan and I...

695
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:14,240
At least because I had her,

696
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,770
I was able to raise Dan Dan and live until now.

697
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:25,560
All right. I got it.

698
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:37,630
Let's tell Dan Dan now.

699
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:46,800
Think about just now. If I didn't say anything, I would've been hated by your sister for the rest of my life.

700
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,420
In your case, at least you're her biological father.

701
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,890
You need to look at it from Yeon Sil's standpoint too.

702
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:59,710
The child she raised herself resents her every day.

703
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:02,780
Don't you think this isn't right?

704
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,940
I'm sorry, Mother-in-law.

705
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:14,840
I may seem selfish to you,

706
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:20,610
but I can't stand watching my Dan Dan's heart getting shattered.

707
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:28,890
Also, if she finds out her mom is alive, she'll go searching for that so-called mom of hers.

708
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:32,350
I won't ever let that happen.

709
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,240
Please understand me, Mother-in-law.

710
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:42,310
I'm truly grateful that you haven't said anything until now.

711
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:48,620
Honey. I'm so sorry to you,

712
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:54,270
but just once. Please just understand me on this.

713
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:56,800
All right.

714
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,210
I said, all right.

715
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:07,440
I won't say anything to Dan Dan as well, Father. Don't worry.

716
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,700
Okay. Thank you, Dae Beom.

717
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:15,330
All right. I understand.

718
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:22,940
They say, "Blood is thicker than water." For a moment, I only thought about Yeon Sil's case.

719
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:28,380
I haven't said anything until now, so it's not hard to do the same.

720
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:32,050
Don't worry. I won't tell her.

721
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:34,810
Nothing happened today.

722
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:40,990
Thank you, Mother-in-law.

723
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:46,810
I'm sorry, Mother-in-law.

724
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,350
Dan Dan?

725
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:07,280
Her bag is not even here. Where did she go?

726
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:21,270
The number you have called is currently unavailable. Please leave a message after the beep.

727
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:38,250
Chief Jo will be there if I go in.

728
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:42,150
Should I just go to Eun Ju's place?

729
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,890
Dad?

730
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,050
Why did you come here when you're still on vacation?

731
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:00,640
Let's go home.

732
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,640
I don't want to go to your home, Dad.

733
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:10,270
I don't want to see your face for a while too.

734
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:14,740
I'm just going to go to my friend's house. Just go, Dad.

735
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:21,910
You met your aunt today, right?

736
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:24,710
I heard.

737
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:29,740
Are you going to show my mom's picture then?

738
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:32,630
Or where my mom was buried?

739
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:35,980
If yes, then I'll go home with you.

740
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:37,890
Why are you acting like this, Dan Dan?

741
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:41,170
I should be saying that to you, Dad!

742
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:44,720
Why won't you show it to me or tell me?

743
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,690
How can there not be a single photo of my mom who gave birth to me?

744
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:52,070
How can I not even know where she was buried? How can you do this?

745
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:54,190
In this entire world,

746
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:59,840
I'm probably the only one who doesn't know her mom's face.

747
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:04,120
Do you know, Dad?

748
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:10,790
When I'm sick and tired, I want to go to where my mom is buried

749
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:16,550
and call "Mom" just once.

750
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:21,970
But no matter how sick and tired I am, I have nowhere to go!

751
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:28,580
Dan Dan. After I broke up with your mom,

752
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:32,320
I haven't heard anything about her and found out way later that she passed.

753
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,920
That's why I don't know where your mom is.

754
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,990
Are you saying that's an excuse, Dad?

755
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:42,030
I don't know how much you hate my mom,

756
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:45,270
but to me, she's my mom!

757
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:48,360
I want to know my mom's face, at least.

758
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:52,920
Did you ever once think about how I would feel?

759
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,260
Dan Dan!

760
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:22,160
Ms. Park!

761
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,810
Chairman!

762
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,870
Ms. Park...

763
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:36,030
Come with me.

764
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,350
To where?

765
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:41,120
Let's just go.

766
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:49,770
Let's go.

767
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:06,670
Chairman?

768
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:09,770
I wasn't trying to eavesdrop,

769
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,370
but the conversation you had with Driver Park in front of the house,

770
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:15,120
I overheard it accidentally.

771
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:21,340
I had no idea that you had a hurtful past like that all this time.

772
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:25,540
Ms. Park.

773
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:28,920
On days like this, you have to lift up your mood by riding on a bicycle.

774
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,910
The weather is a little cold,

775
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:32,860
but let's ride this bicycle.

776
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:37,580
I'll especially ride 100 laps for you.

777
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,940
Get on.

778
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:47,030
I said hurry up and get on!

779
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:49,700
Quickly.

780
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:56,040
♫ When I walk this road, ♫

781
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:59,610
♫ it makes me cry  ♫

782
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:01,320
♫ It reminds me of that person's touch ♫

783
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,680
Hold on tight!

784
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,690
Chairman... Just today,

785
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:11,920
I'll lean on you like this just until today.

786
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,620
Thank you so much.

787
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:20,850
♫ My beautiful love ♫

788
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:25,060
♫ It seems like ♫

789
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:27,420
♫ love is bitter ♫

790
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,360
I'll start peddling now.

791

♫ The more I try to grasp it ♫

792
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:35,550

00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:43,160

♫ Why do you run away, love ♫

797
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:57,690
♫ Like a shy child ♫

00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,610
♫ chased by longing ♫

802
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:13,760
I'll take my bag now, Chairman.

803
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:19,960
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

804
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,280
How are you, Ms. Park?

805
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:26,330
Don't you feel a little better after riding on the bicycle?

806
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:27,750
Yes.

807
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:32,170
I feel a lot better thanks to you, Chairman.

808
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:39,410
I'm just a private tutor who teaches your children.

809
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:43,580
But thank you for treating me so warmly like this.

810
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:48,080
I'll do my very best for the children during my remaining time.

811
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:52,070
♫ I couldn't forget ♫

812
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:55,630
♫ and buried in my heart ♫

♫ Why do you run away, love ♫

815
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:10,380
I'm not leaving because you did something wrong.

816
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:13,260
I just feel like I'm going to suffocate!

817
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,620
This isn't living. It feels like a prison.

818
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:19,930
It's like a dark cave where you can't see anything!

819
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:24,830
What about me then? What about our Dan Dan?

820
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:27,850
Just think that I'm dead.

821
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:34,270
Wait, Dan Dan's dad!

822
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,490
Dan Dan's dad!

823
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:43,970
The two of us... Let's not die and raise the kids together.

824
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:49,690
I'll be Dan Dan's mom.

825
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:52,470
So don't do this.

826
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,720
♫ Why do you run away, love ♫

827
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,530

828

829
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:07,360
My precious family, who's been by my side until now...

830
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:10,040
My wife...

831
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:15,630
What in the world did I do to them?

832

833

834
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:30,540
CEO?

835
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:33,830
It's me.

836
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:37,620
I'd like to meet you now for a moment.

837
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:04,600
Soo Chul, you should just come in using the passcode from now. You know the password.

838
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,380
I guess it's very cold outside.

839
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:09,150
Hold on, Soo Chul. I'll hurry up and prepare a warm cup of tea for you.

840
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:11,860
No, CEO.

841
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:14,970
I don't need tea.

842
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:18,280
I came because I had something to tell you.

843
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,280
What is it?

844
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,940
CEO...

845
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:25,010
I'm sorry.

846
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:27,110
I'm really sorry.

847
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:30,990
I don't think I can go...

848
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:33,760
to the US with you.

849
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,540
No, I can't go.

850
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:39,200
Soo Chul?

851
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:44,160
What are you saying?

852
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,200
I'm already looking into a house and a car for you.

853
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,090
I'm sorry.

854
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:56,040
I can never leave my family.

855
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,130
But I got confused.

856
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:01,940
I made a huge mistake.

857
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:04,000
From now on, even if you're sick,

858
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,200
I won't come here.

859
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,250
Why are you suddenly doing this, Soo Chul?

860
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:12,360
Thank you for everything until now.

861
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:16,280
I won't forget your generosity.

862
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,350
Goodbye.

863
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:21,480
Soo Chul! Why are you doing this?

864
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:25,740
Why are you doing this to me, Soo Chul? Did I make a mistake?

865
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:28,770
Or did I do something wrong?

866
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:32,470
Please don't do this, Soo Chul.

867
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:34,690
No! That's not it.

868
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:38,100
You didn't do anything wrong.

869
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:39,670
No matter how tough it is,

870
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:42,820
I need to stay here with my family.

871
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:46,880
But I forgot my place and got in over my head.

872
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,440
I committed a wrong that I shouldn't have!

873
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:55,210
Please understand me.

874
00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:58,150
Soo Chul.

875
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,000
Please think about it one more time.

876
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,850
If you go like this,

877
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:07,250
what am I going to do by myself?

878
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:14,000
I'm sorry.

879
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,660
Goodbye.

880
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:30,950
Why is he suddenly being like that?

881
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:34,450
How can he do this to me?

882
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:46,280
I'm going to do whatever it takes

883
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:49,730
to bring my Dan Dan and Soo Chul to the US.

884
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:52,130
I'll do whatever it takes.

885
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:55,700
I'll make sure we go together.

886
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,940
My Dan Dan...

887
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,690
I'm back.

888
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:05,070
Ms. Park! When did you get here?

889
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:06,660
Your vacation isn't over yet.

890
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:10,240
Yes. But I just came back because I was worried about the children.

891
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:14,880
I'm saying hello now because I got back so late last night.

892
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:19,690
Oh, my goodness! How infuriating!

893
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,860
Nothing happened, right?

894
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:29,110
On the contrary, something huge happened.

895
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:34,800
"Something huge?" What happened?

896
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,770
Ms. Park.

897
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:40,730
Chairman called off the engagement.

898
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:44,860
What? Did he call off the engagement?

899
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:47,670
Did Chairman do it?

900
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:55,790
What? My husband said he wouldn't go to the US?

901
01:01:55,790 --> 01:02:00,090
That's right. He suddenly said he couldn't go.

902
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:05,410
I'm also very confused now, honestly.

903
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:10,020
Is there a problem that's stopping Driver Park from going to the US?

904
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:14,220
Oh, no! Not at all. There's absolutely no problem.

905
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:17,730
Oh, gosh. Is he crazy? Why is he suddenly saying he won't go to the US?

906
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:21,420
I'll raise his salary to 200,000 dollars then.

907
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:24,710
I just ask that you'll persuade him for me.

908
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:28,010
T-Two hundred thousand dollars?

909
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:29,780
Are you serious?

910
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,920
- Yes.
- Oh, then...

911
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:38,170
Will you still provide the house and a car you promised on top of that?

912
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:41,600
Yes, of course.

913
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:47,190
If I knew the reason why he couldn't go to the US, I would compensate him accordingly.

914
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:52,560
But since I don't know the reason, I thought it might be because of his salary.

915
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:57,840
The truth is, if I have to hire someone else instead of Driver Park, I'll need to invest that much more time,

916
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:03,530
and there's no guarantee that I'll meet someone as diligently and trustworthy as him either.

917
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:05,750
That's why I'm doing this.

918
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:07,360
Oh, yes. I understand.

919
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,470
I'll do my best to persuade him.

920
01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:11,970
Don't hire anyone else until then.

921
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:14,170
My Soo Chul will go for sure!

922
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:18,560
Don't you worry, CEO!

923
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:21,920
Okay. I'm counting on you.

924
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:25,810
What?

925
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:27,840
200,000 dollars?

926
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:32,250
Yes. It's over 230 million won with the exchange rates from today.

927
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:36,270
He'll also get a house and a car as originally planned.

928
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:42,440
How can his salary blow up to double like that?

929
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,910
Is this all true, Aunt?

930
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:49,350
Why are you even asking? She's so excited she's spitting as she talks.

931
01:03:49,350 --> 01:03:53,760
An annual salary of 200,000 dollars is at the level of what board members from big companies get.

932
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,600
My Older-brother-in-law is amazing!

933
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:02,660
Hold on a minute. What if he said he wouldn't go so that she'll raise his pay?

934
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:06,270
- My father isn't someone who conjures up tricks like that.
- That's true.

935
01:04:06,270 --> 01:04:10,460
But the salary is way too high for him to say he won't go.

936
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:11,830
- Honey!
- Oh!

937
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:13,100
Older-brother-in-law!

938
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:16,150
What is it? You said it was urgent.

939
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:21,730
What's up with you all? Did something happen?

940
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:23,520
Well...

941
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:29,290
Honey! Did you tell CEO Anna that you won't go to the US?

942
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:31,180
Did you go there again?

943
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:35,570
I didn't go there. CEO Anna came to see me instead!

944
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:40,720
She said she'll raise your salary to 200,000 dollars!

945
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:48,570
Did you maybe say you wouldn't go so that she'll raise your salary? Was that it?

946
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:52,940
If CEO Anna asks you to meet, don't meet her from now on.

947
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:56,600
Also, I'm not going to the US. That's final.

948
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,070
What?

949
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:02,500
Why won't you go? She's saying she'll double your salary!

950
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:07,400
It's not as if you'll be doing physical labor, like carrying bricks on your back.

951
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:12,150
It's a comfortable job where you only need to drive her around and manage money. What's the issue?

952
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:16,970
There are even men who go to the desert in the Middle East to work!

953
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:19,620
Stop it, Honey.

954
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:23,280
I'm just going to focus on the chicken restaurant here.

955
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:27,640
Don't tell me to go to the US anymore, all right?

956
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:30,570
Oh, gosh.

957
01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:36,510
Hey, Geon! What's wrong with him?

958
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:40,700
Am I the weird one, or is it him?

959
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:43,910
His salary will be 200,000 dollars!

960
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:46,500
It's over 230 million in Korean money!

961
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:50,640
Why is he saying he won't take it?

962
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:59,260
You're right. I also don't think it's smart for him to turn down such an amazing offer.

963
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:01,550
It's absurd!

964
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:06,060
Seriously, why wouldn't he?

965
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:21,570
CEO Anna... Why are you going this far?

966
01:06:21,570 --> 01:06:24,790
I'm not worth that much.

967
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:45,850
Soo Chul.

968
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:47,810
Take a seat first.

969
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:54,260
CEO. I clearly explained to you that I couldn't go to the US.

970
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:58,660
But why did you see my wife again and say strange things?

971
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:01,810
Why are you confusing my family?

972
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:05,850
That's because you suddenly said you couldn't go to the US with me.

973
01:07:05,850 --> 01:07:11,900
Is that why you met my wife and talked about money?

974
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:16,110
Me doing that shows you mean that much to me.

975
01:07:16,110 --> 01:07:22,050
If your feelings for me were true, at the very least,

976
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:26,160
you shouldn't play with my family's feelings with money like that.

977
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:32,000
Are you saying that you'll buy my heart with money?

978
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,240
I'm disappointed.

979
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:37,470
No, Soo Chul. That's not what I meant.

980
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:45,600
I did it because I wanted to go to the US with you and Ms. Park. I made a mistake.

981
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:48,250
I'm sorry.

982
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:50,830
I understand where you're coming from.

983
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:58,010
So why don't you take a seat and talk about it over tea with me?

984
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:34,670
Isn't this Zucchini Kimchi soup?

985
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:36,680
Yes, that's right.

986
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,690
This is my mom's specialty.

987
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:41,350
Other people don't really know this Zucchini Kimchi soup.

988
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:46,840
I once missed the bus because I liked this rest stop udon so much.

989
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,270
Are you CEO Kim?

990
01:08:48,270 --> 01:08:51,720
Yes, that's right. I'm Anna...

991
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:55,660
CEO!

992
01:09:08,490 --> 01:09:14,570
Who are you? What's your true identity?

993
01:09:14,570 --> 01:09:17,380
Who are you!

994
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:48,540
♫ Please be my strength ♫

995
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:55,890
♫ So I can find the way that's given to me ♫

996
01:09:55,890 --> 01:10:03,280
♫ Please open a way for me ♫

997
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:10,500
♫ The hidden road of mine ♫

998
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:20,640
[Young Lady and Gentleman]

999
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,490
- You came to see me because you were worried about me, right? It's all so obvious!
- That's not it.

1000
01:10:24,490 --> 01:10:26,580
- Let me check just once!
- I told you, that's not it!

1001
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:28,820
- Just once!
- I'm telling you, it's not!

1002
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:31,840
Thank you, Seung Ho. I had a lot of fun today, thanks to you.

1003
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,610
- What did you do today?
- I was home.

1004
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:35,340
I saw you get off from a guy's car just now.

1005
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:38,460
Why did you trick me? I'm offended.

1006
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:41,920
- The children will figure out if you're acting like this.
- Are you upset with our dad or something?

1007
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:43,410
Please be careful in front of the children.

1008
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:46,190
How about starting it over with me again, Chief Jo?

1009
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:49,330
You dare to think you can date me because my fiancé dumped me?

1010
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:51,390
How dare you hit on me!

1011
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:53,560
This is our Dan Dan. Our Dan Dan!

1012
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,540
Why is my Dan Dan's photo here?

1013
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:57,160
Ji Young!

1014
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,930
You... You are Ji Young.

1015
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:04,070
Kim Ji Young!
