00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,250
[Episode 26]

2
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,990
Oh, no, what's going on?

3
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,430
Young Gook, what's wrong?

4
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,830
Chairman.

5
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:01,330
I don't know. All of a sudden, it felt like my head was getting pressured.

6
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:05,450
Many scenes just passed inside of my head.

7
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,690
Like a movie scene.

8
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,460
It might be a memory from the past.

9
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,960
Oppa, is your memory coming back?

10
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:35,060
Chairman. What kinds of scenes were they?

11
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,030
What did you remember?

12
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,870
They were...

13
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,620
It's nothing.

14
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,350
Young Gook, please. Try to remember.

15
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,160
What were they?

16
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:04,280
Jung Woo. I can't tell if it's a memory or not.

17
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,430
I just feel dizzy.

18
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,860
Were they really the memory I've lost?

19
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:41,040
Or was it just my imagination?

20
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:49,480
Chairman. Do you still have a headache? Should we stop by the hospital?

21
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:55,600
It's okay. I'll feel better once I have a rest at home.

22
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:03,270
Did you remember something from the past?

23
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:09,160
No, I think I might have been confused because of a headache.

24
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,370
Okay.

25
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,120
Maybe you were stressed from preparing for today's party.

26
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,920
I was so nervous and excited I couldn't sleep all night either.

27
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,810
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,190
The event was ruined because of me.

29
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,750
No, it wasn't.

30
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:43,120
We exchanged our rings to promise to marry each other in front of everyone.

31
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,000
When you go home and rest, everything will be fine.

32
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,940
We didn't even share a glass of wine at the ceremony.

33
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,920
Why don't we go on a date tonight? And have some wine too.

34
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,330
If it's okay with you, I love the idea.

35
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,930
How was the ceremony? Did it go well?

36
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,920
- But it ended earlier than I expected.
- Don't even mention it.

37
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,100
We didn't cut a cake or drink champagne because the Chairman came down with a headache.

38
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,770
Things got very chaotic at the end.

39
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,200
Did Chairman come down with a headache?

40
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,920
Mrs. Yeoju, can you make some festival noodle? We barely ate today.

41
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,370
I'm sure the kids are hungry too.

42
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,990
- Yes, Madam.
- I'm going to my room.

43
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,480
Chairman and Chief Jo.

44
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,830
Congratulations on your engagement.

45
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,500
Thank you.

46
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,930
Dad, are you feeling better?

47
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,300
Yes, I'm fine. Don't worry.

48
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,470
We will go upstairs. Se Chan, Se Jong, let's go upstairs.

49
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:35,310
Se Jong. I heard you didn't eat much at the ceremony.

50
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,390
Do you want me to bring you some of your favorite chocolate cake?

51
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,730
I have no appetite. I don't want to eat.

52
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:48,510
How about if I make some spicy rice cakes to entice your appetite?

53
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:52,520
No, thanks. It's okay.

54
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,550
I don't want to eat anything.

55
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:01,690
I just want to sleep for a while.

56
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,170
Okay. I get it.

57
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,390
Now I can think clearly.

58
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,140
Oppa, are you really okay?

59
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:25,030
Has your headache gone away?

60
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,690
Yes, I'm okay.

61
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,280
Oppa, don't try to force yourself to remember.

62
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,950
It happened because of the stress you put on yourself.

63
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,690
Okay.

64
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,230
Oppa, since you are now engaged,

65
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,430
think of it as starting a new relationship with Chief Jo, even if you don't remember.

66
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,260
And relax.

67
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,390
When I think about it, Chief Jo is not so bad.

68
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:56,100
She knows the best about our household, and she seems good to the children.

69
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,840
Didn't you come to discuss something?

70
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,340
Well, actually...

71
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:06,340
I have someone I want to marry.

72
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,610
What? Get married?

73
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,500
I love him. I love him so much.

74
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,090
The thing is, my mom doesn't like him.

75
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:22,560
But if you give me the approval, mom might not reject him anymore.

76
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,800
Oppa.

77
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,840
Why does your mother oppose the marriage?

78
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,020
It's because he's not very well off.

79
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,200
There is a huge gap financially between us.

80
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,710
That's why.

81
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,630
But we are well off.

82
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,080
So how could that be a reason to oppose?

83
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,460
What's wrong if they have financial hardship when we have lots of money?

84
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,860
- Right?
- Of course.

85
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,400
The important thing is whether you two love each other sincerely or not.

86
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,920
Then, you've given us approval.

87
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,350
Hey, Lee Se Ryun. Why would you need my approval to live your own life?

88
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,630
Since I've lost my memory,

89
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,500
success is not losing the memory in my book.

90
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,420
Live your life the way you want to.

91
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,270
Oppa. Thank you.

92
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:18,610
I have your approval now. Don't deny it later. Okay?

93
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,420
So who is the guy?

94
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:29,830
The man I want to marry is Ms. Park's older brother.

95
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:35,470
What? Ms. Park's brother?

96
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,920
If that's the case,

97
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,960
I think he'll be a good person.

98
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:46,780
Oppa. Thank you so much for saying that.

99
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:52,350
How can he not remember anything at all?

100
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,400
His forty-one-year-old self was opposed to Dae Beom.

101
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,560
Should I be happy about this or not?

102
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,690
Why don't you knock? Where are your manners! What's good about studying abroad?

103
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:15,260
Mom, Oppa approved of Dae Beom.

104
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,900
I will marry Dae Beom.

105
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,160
What? Do what with who?

106
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,380
Are you going to marry that player?

107
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,790
You've gone insane.

108
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,950
Mom, whether I'm insane or not, it's my life.

109
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,940
He told me this,

110
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,280
why do I need my mom's permission at my age?

111
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,240
So I don't need your permission.

112
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,370
Even if you don't allow me to get married, I'm going to.

113
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:46,320
With whose consent? Do you want to see me die?

114
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,360
Mom, if you're really going to be like this,

115
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,290
I won't marry anyone other than Dae Beom.

116
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,400
Which means you will never get the company shares.

117
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,380
Would that be okay with you?

118
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,020
Are you threatening me with the shares now?

119
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,060
Because of that beggar?

120
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,610
Seriously! From now on, you are not my daughter.

121
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,450
Do you have any idea how hard my life has been?

122
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,440
How hard it was to raise you?

123
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,600
I was seduced at the tender age of 20 by your father.

124
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,390
Mom, seriously! Please stop that already.

125
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,720
I have scabs in my ears from hearing that so many times.

126
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,030
How you were seduced and connived by my father,

127
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,180
and how your life has been because of it.

128
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,620
That repertoire does not work on me anymore.

129
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:34,740
So you choose. Do you want the shares or not?

130
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:41,460
Okay, marry that bastard! Do whatever you want.

131
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,410
Instead, give me your entire company shares. Give them all to me!

132
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:49,500
Mom, those shares are mine. Why do you get them all?

133
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,650
Are you planning to support that family with the shares?

134
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,520
I did all the work, but you're giving it to someone else.

135
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,740
How can you act like this to me?

136
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,450
Okay then. I will give you half. Isn't that enough?

137
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,170
Okay. Good.

138
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:13,250
Write the agreement here and leave me the evidence that you'll give me half of your shares.

139
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,300
When you marry that bastard and leave me half of the shares,

140
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,940
that will be the end of you and me.

141
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,240
There is no betrayal like this.

142
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,010
This hurts more than the betrayal your father put me through!

143
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:33,670
How can you do this to me out of all people?

144
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:38,490
How can you pound a nail on my heart like this?

145
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,390
So what's this all about?

146
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,450
I love him, I said!

147
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:52,240
Why can't you just give me a blessing? Seriously!

148
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,100
As soon as I get those shares,

149
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:01,130
that's the last day of me with this family!

150
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,390
Madam.

151
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,180
Chief Jo, Chief Jo.

152
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,830
I have no one but you, Chief Jo.

153
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,860
There is no one else but you, Chief Jo.

154
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,660
Chief Jo...

155
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,830
[It's delicious because it's clean: 60th Chicken]

156
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,820
Hello, we've opened a new chicken restaurant. Please visit us.

157
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,120
Please come.

158
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,950
Hello, we've opened a new chicken restaurant.

159
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,480
We will serve you well. Please come by.

160
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,810
We've opened a new chicken restaurant. Please come by.

161
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,040
Father!

162
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,190
Why are you doing that? I will pass out the flyers.

163
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:02,750
No, we get them out more doing it together. It's hard to do on your own.

164
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,460
It will be hard on your legs if you distribute all of those.

165
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:12,310
How about I do this side, and you take the other side?

166
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,490
Okay.

167
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:18,560
Let's not encroach upon each other's territory.

168
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,400
Okay.

169
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,370
Hello! We've opened a new chicken restaurant.

170
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:39,870
Father, the chicken definitely fries better with fresh oil. The color is better, too.

171
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:45,070
We must change the oil every day for better-tasting chicken.

172
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:01,550
- It smells good.
- The aroma is savory. I think it'll be good.

173
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,270
Here are the chickens.

174
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:07,750
- Let's see.
- Yes, try some.

175
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:15,150
It's Dae Beom's idea to add spicy pepper sauce. Mother-in-law, what do you think? How about you, Honey?

176
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,410
These are delicious!

177
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:24,080
Maybe it's because of the spicy peppers. It's spicy and does not taste greasy.

178
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:30,530
Yes! I think, like what Geon said, this recipe will attract customers from other neighborhoods, too.

179
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,720
- Really, Mom?
- Yes!

180
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,930
This is really good. It's a great flavor.

181
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:39,400
Of all the chickens I've had,

182
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,130
this is the first time I've had such a clean-tasting, tasty chicken.

183
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:48,740
The color looks soft and pretty, too.

184
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,020
That should be good.

185
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,970
Yes.

186
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:01,430
- Is it done?
- Yes, it's done.

187
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,030
It looks nice.

188
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:06,770
With the new signage, it looks like a completely different store.

189
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,810
It looks trendy. I think it will be a hit.

190
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,890
- Really? Do you really think so?
- Yes!

191
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:16,450
Right, Mi Rim? It makes our restaurant stand out a bit.

192
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:20,860
Now it feels like a new start.

193
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,900
Brother-in-law! Noona!

194
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,470
- Mom!
- Yes, yes!

195
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:29,810
I guess I'm not late. I can't miss out on the day you put up the new sign.

196
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:34,500
Of course, we can't do this without you, Geon.

197
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,570
Brother-in-law, let's say "fighting" for the new beginning.

198
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,360
That sounds good.

199
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,020
Go up, up.

200
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:48,990
One, two, three. Fighting!

201
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,850
It'll be a success! Mom, don't worry!

202
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,050
Aigoo.

203
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:58,640
It's been so noisy on this street since they opened their store.

204
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,790
Park Dae Beom will not fail!

205
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,140
That's because they have a large family.

206
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:10,550
They have a strong spirit. It looks good to me!

207
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:26,910
The wine tastes so good.

208
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:34,290
Yes. Maybe because I'm with you. I feel the same.

209
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,960
The wine goes down so smoothly today.

210
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,180
Maybe that's why alcohol is called like that.

211
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,590
I will pour it for you.

212
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:47,800
Then I'm grateful.

213
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:01,560
You seem like a very good Noona.

214
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:07,650
Chairman. Why are you saying that?

215
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:13,780
To be honest, when I saw you for the first time in our garden, I fell head over heels.

216
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,760
You are totally my type.

217
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,880
You're sexy, pretty, and kind.

218
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,950
You're totally my dream woman.

219
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:27,660
But when I found out that I had promised to marry you,

220
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,120
wow, I thought it was the most awesome news.

221
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,420
Really?

222
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,770
Of course.

223
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,910
Chief Jo Noona.

224
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:55,160
I'll... try really hard from now on.

225
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:03,900
I want you and the kids to get along well.

226
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:09,550
That's all I wish for.

227
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:12,270
Yes, Chairman.

228
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:16,510
From now on, I'll be better to the children.

229
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,330
And to you as well.

230
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:25,090
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

231
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:47,540
My mom used to say it's all about your frame of mind.

232
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:51,320
It's not that hard to like Chief Jo Noona.

233
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,660
I just have to like her.

234
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,800
That's right.

235
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,760
Lee Se Jong, are you really going to starve?

236
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,820
Get up!

237
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:25,870
Why are you doing this to me? I want to be alone.

238
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:30,210
Lee Se Jong. You promised you wouldn't be like this.

239
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:35,190
How upset do you think our dad would be if you were like this?

240
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,370
But I feel sorry towards mom.

241
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:44,980
I miss her, what can I do?

242
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,200
Se Jong, I explained it to you.

243
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:57,010
Dad got engaged, and we might get a step-mother,

244
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:02,070
but that doesn't mean our mom gets disappeared.

245
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:12,220
Our mom will be in our hearts forever.

246
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,500
Noona...

247
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,460
Hyung...

248
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,840
Se Jong.

249
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,180
Se Jong.

250
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:28,130
Mom..!

251
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:33,120
Mom..!

252
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,460
Mom...

253
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,160
Chairman.

254
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,930
Let's play this once.

255
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:03,610
I've always wanted to play this with you.

256
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,090
Let's play the whack-a-mole.

257
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,000
Sure, let's do it.

258
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,750
Chief Jo Noona,

259
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,940
let's do it next time. I can't do this today.

260
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,200
Why?

261
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,420
If you hit the moles, the mole will be hurt.

262
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,830
What? The moles will be hurt?

263
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:39,470
That's not it. I just drank too much today.

264
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,990
I should just go home.

265
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:44,680
Is that so? You did overdo it today.

266
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,200
Let's do it next time.

267
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,360
Did the Chairman really say that? That you were his type?

268
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,690
Yes, he drank a lot and was drunk,

269
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:05,730
but he still walked me over to our front door.

270
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,530
I'm so jealous.

271
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:11,320
Hey, I know it's late,

272
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,700
but we should do congratulatory cheers.

273
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,750
Cheers!

274
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,820
My Sarah, you're so pretty!

275
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,270
Congratulations, Sarah. I mean, "Madam."

276
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:28,420
Ajumma, why are you doing that? Just call me the way you always have.

277
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:32,820
Thinking of you becoming FT Group's Madam,

278
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,100
I can't just call you by your name anymore.

279
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,050
Anyway, congratulations on your engagement.

280
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,230
Thank you.

281
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,240
But today, at the engagement party,

282
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,010
Dae Ran and Se Ryun looked furious, and they didn't even look at each other.

283
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,910
Did they have a fight?

284
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:54,440
What could've happened between them to make them so upset that not look at each other's faces at the engagement party

285
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,160
when they are mother and daughter?

286
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,510
Don't even talk about it.

287
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:05,950
The truth is, Ms. Se Ryun said that she and the son of the parasite family who was living in the Chairman's back house

288
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,500
would get married, so they had a big fight.

289
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,890
So the Madam was crying and screaming

290
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,820
and said that their mother-daughter relationship was over.

291
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,490
Oh my, that's ridiculous!

292
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,990
Is Se Ryun out of her mind?

293
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,140
But that gigolo guy,

294
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,790
what kind of spell did he put on her to where she still can't get her mind right?

295
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:32,360
I bet Mrs. Wang is so upset about this.

296
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,590
I don't understand it either.

297
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:40,810
I feel so bad for my mother-in-law.

298
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:44,320
Are you calling her your mother-in-law already?

299
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,140
My goodness.

300
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,080
Have another drink. Anyway, congratulations on your engagement.

301
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,950
- Thank you!
- Cheers!

302
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:13,840
- Sir, please stop the car here.
-Yes.

303
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,710
- It's so good.
- Boo!

304
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,880
You scared us!

305
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,560
Dad, what is this?

306
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,880
Why did you do that?

307
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,750
Dad, were you drinking?

308
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,420
What?

309
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,620
I just drank a little bit.

310
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,370
But where are you guys going this late at night?

311
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:53,280
We just had pizza and were heading to the karaoke to digest our dinner.

312
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:58,240
Karaoke? I want to go, too! Take me with you!

313
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:14,090
I wonder how my dad held it in until now when he wants to hang out like that.

314
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,850
With the excuse of being twenty-two, he's having so much fun.

315
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,960
Get up here, Jenny!

316
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,550
Okay, okay. Ms. Park, come out with me.

317
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,860
Let's go!

318
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,230
Why are there so many lights on?

319
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:05,490
Is Mi Rim here?

320
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:07,910
What is this?

321
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,470
What is all this?

322
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:15,790
Grandmother, Mother, and Father. How are you?

323
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:18,200
I'm back.

324
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:25,450
Lee Se Ryun, why are you here again? And what's all this stuff?

325
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,060
Today, I just brought something easy on your stomach,

326
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,950
so I prepared abalone porridge and salad.

327
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:37,480
And these are in gratitude for allowing me to spend the night here last time.

328
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,510
This is Grandmother's blanket,

329
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:45,140
this blanket is for Father and Mother, and this blanket is for Dae Beom.

330
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:50,570
Ms. Se Ryun, come see me.

331
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,730
Yes.

332
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:01,890
What should we do?

333
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,270
Ms. Se Ryun.

334
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,800
What exactly are you thinking?

335
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,720
Last time your mother came here and threw money at us.

336
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,320
You saw how she treated us.

337
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,340
But how can you come here as if nothing ever happened?

338
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,270
Are you disrespecting us as well?

339
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:26,260
No. I am not doing that at all.

340
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:30,580
I have great respect for grandmother, you, and mother.

341
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:34,000
I've never thought of disrespecting you ever.

342
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,780
The reason why I'm here today

343
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:42,390
is that my mother has approved my marriage to Dae Beom.

344
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:48,790
I came here to receive your permission as well.

345
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:51,500
Permission?

346
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,490
After doing that to us, she gave you permission?

347
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:58,810
Does she want to be our in-laws?

348
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,130
Father...

349
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,750
Even though we have nothing and not much to show for,

350
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,780
we still have a principle of life.

351
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,210
We have dignity as well.

352
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:13,820
After stomping all over our pride, she wants to be our in-laws?

353
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,990
We cannot do that.

354
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:19,850
Park Dae Beom, get in here!

355
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:35,200
Dae Beom, you listen closely to what I'm about to say.

356
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,940
If you marry this lady, you and I are no longer father and son.

357
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,390
That being said, you choose what's best for you.

358
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,550
Father...

359
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:59,410
Lee Se Ryun, let's go outside.

360
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:03,440
- Dae Beom...
- I said, let's go outside.

361
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:19,930
Mother, Grandmother. Can you please help me?

362
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:25,010
Look here, young lady. Since you and Dae Beom love each other so much,

363
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:28,490
I wanted to help make this work.

364
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:30,340
But now I don't want to as well.

365
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,420
Put yourself in our position.

366
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:36,110
Dae Beom's dad got slapped in the face with wads of money. Do you think that's forgivable?

367
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:40,110
Hurry up and leave. I don't want to see you as well.

368
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,320
Grandmother...

369
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,480
Everything my son-in-law said is correct.

370
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,380
They say that "a worm will squirm if you step on it."

371
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:55,520
If no one steps on us, we don't bother anyone,

372
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,820
and we don't say a word and just live our lives.

373
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:01,990
So why step on us? Why?

374
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:08,870
So what do I do now?

375
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:12,700
Seeing you cry like this is breaking my heart, so I'll say this.

376
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:18,880
If your mother comes over here, gets on her knees, and sincerely begs for forgiveness,

377
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,910
then I can try to convince my son-in-law.

378
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,490
Are you serious?

379
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,370
If my mom comes here and apologizes, would that work?

380
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:32,640
It won't be easy, but that's the only answer I can think of for now.

381
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,020
Now, young lady, you should get going. And don't come back.

382
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:42,090
Dae Beom, what are you doing? Take the lady home!

383
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,800
Yes.

384
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,110
I'll take Se Ryun home and come back.

385
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:51,080
Yes, don't come home too late.

386
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,760
Follow me.

387
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:02,460
Mom, quick, get in the car.

388
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:06,650
Why? Where are we going in the middle of the night? Tell me.

389
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:09,370
- Just get in the car!
- Oh, seriously.

390
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:16,380
What's going on? I have to know at least what's going on to either go or not.

391
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,840
Mom, Dae Beom's grandmother,

392
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,100
and Driver Park can't approve of our marriage.

393
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,740
What?

394
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,100
What the hell are you talking about?

395
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,340
Until you get on your knees and beg for forgiveness, they won't give us their blessing.

396
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,430
So come with me now and get on your knees and apologize.

397
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,400
Hurry, let's get in, Mom.

398
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,930
Hey, you crazy little brat.

399
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,410
Even if you were bitten by a rabid dog,

400
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:43,640
even if you lost your mind, but what?

401
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:48,350
You want me to go to that beggars' house and apologize? On top of that, on my knees?

402
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:52,630
Wow, now you've literally gone insane.

403
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:56,850
Mom, honestly, you've done so much wrong to that family.

404
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:59,940
Imagine how much their pride got hurt.

405
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,650
So since you've hurt their hearts,

406
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:06,050
you should be the one to make right your wrong.

407
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:12,080
Mom, I'm begging you, just once, can't you apologize just once?

408
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,620
If you don't, they won't let us get married.

409
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,900
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

410
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:27,500
Hey, I don't need those damn shares. I don't need money, either.

411
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,020
Don't you dare show your face to me ever again.

412
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:33,670
You're not my daughter! Don't you ever show your face to me again.

413
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:36,750
This is really not okay. We're done. It's over!

414
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,870
You're not my daughter anymore.

415
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:42,920
This is ridiculous...

416
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:13,910
I am so happy when I'm with the children and Ms. Park Noona.

417
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,990
I feel like the shining stars will fall from the sky.

418
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,920
Yes, they do.

419
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,510
There are so many stars tonight.

420
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:31,810
I've never seen so many stars like this in my whole life.

421
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:36,090
It's so impressive.

422
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:38,450
They are so beautiful.

423
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:42,300
What was that?

424
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,860
Ms. Park Noona and I were talking to each other.

425
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:49,100
That was not a dream or an imagination.

426
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:54,480
There was something between Ms. Park Noona and me.

427
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,510
There was something.

428
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,970
Definitely.

429
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,850
Ms. Park, I need to see you for a moment.

430
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:13,780
I have something I must ask you.

431
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,740
I just saw him.

432
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,260
Why does he want to see me again?

433
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,780
Yes.

434
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,810
I remembered a scene from the past or a memory.

435
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:37,660
I was carrying you on my back and watching the stars at night with you.

436
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:42,960
Did I carry you on my back in the past?

437
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,240
Chairman.

438
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,090
I was carrying you on my back.

439
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:50,360
You were looking at the night sky.

440
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,250
And said, "the shining stars will fall from the sky."

441
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,840
That was not a dream, right?

442
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,110
It's not something I'm saying because I'm drunk, right?

443
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,970
Yes.

444
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:04,130
I was wondering about it.

445
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:07,910
But it was a real memory.

446
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:13,550
Chairman, are your memories coming back?

447
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,800
How much do you remember?

448
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,740
What else do you remember?

449
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,120
I don't remember anything else.

450
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,890
Just that one scene.

451
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:26,720
I was carrying you on my back and looking at the night sky. I remember that one scene vividly.

452
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,340
As if it happened yesterday.

453
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,490
Ms. Park Noona.

454
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,540
Please explain it to me.

455
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,970
Why was I carrying you on my back?

456
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,830
Were we..?

457
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,280
Before you lost your memory,

458
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,140
we were at the vacation home.

459
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:47,610
I went to look for my lost cell phone at night,

460
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:50,010
and got lost and injured my leg.

461
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:54,400
So you came to look for me and carried me on your back.

462
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,200
Because I couldn't walk.

463
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:04,370
Were we at the vacation house by just two of us?

464
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,030
No. It was Se Chan's birthday.

465
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:09,910
So, we all went together, including Chief Jo.

466
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,880
I see.

467
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,290
We weren't there alone.

468
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:18,140
No.

469
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,540
Thank you for telling me the truth.

470
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:26,190
But it feels like my memory is coming back slowly.

471
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:30,410
And I want to thank you for everything.

472
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:33,200
When I was with you, Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong earlier,

473
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,250
it was a lot of fun.

474
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:38,390
Thank you for being sincere to my children

475
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:42,340
- and taking care of them--
- May I go now?

476
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:51,810
Chairman.

477
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:55,350
Congratulations on your engagement.

478
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,180
Thank you.

479
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,680
But why?

480
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:18,460
♫ I couldn't hold her and just trembled my heart ♫

481
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:25,630
♫ My beautiful love ♫

482
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:30,240
Is his memory coming back little by little?

483
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,070
♫ Like a shy child ♫

484
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:37,010
What difference does it make?

485
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:40,510
I don't want to be shaken by him anymore.

486
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:49,580
No. If Chairman's memory comes back, I must ask him.

487
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:57,860
Why he acted like that to me when he had someone to marry.

488
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:02,850
And I'll make him apologize to me.

489
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:05,020
I will.

490
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,090
Who is this?

491
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:51,720
Who are you?

492
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,000
It's me.

493
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,410
Your Bambi baby.

494
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:57,590
Lee Se Ryun?

495
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:00,720
Yes, it's me.

496
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,240
You surprised me.

497
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,940
Why are you under my blanket?

498
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,490
I almost had a heart attack.

499
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:13,150
Why? Did you think it was some other woman?

500
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,840
How did you get inside?

501
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,080
What do you mean, how?

502
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,580
I unlocked the front door with the code.

503
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:25,710
Grandmother told me when she went to the store the last time.

504
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,690
You are driving me crazy.

505
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:31,020
What are you going to do?

506
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,640
Dae Beom.

507
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:38,860
I tried to bring my mom here and make her apologize to your father, mother, and grandmother.

508
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:42,930
But my mom said she would never apologize.

509
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:46,080
What do we do now?

510
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,960
I'm scared of your father.

511
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:55,360
He would never approve of us until my mom apologized, would he?

512
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:59,480
Please do something, Dae Beom.

513
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,610
I would rather die than break up with you.

514
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:08,340
I don't know what to do either.

515
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,670
What should we do now?

516
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,710
What's going on?

517
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,740
What's wrong?

518
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:38,000
Many scenes just passed inside of my head, like a movie scene.

519
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,330
It might be a memory from the past.

520
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:56,000
Is the Chairman's memory coming back?

521
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,820
But what if his memory comes back? We're engaged.

522
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:06,770
The promise we made to get married can't be broken that easily.

523
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:57,870
Kids, kids!

524
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:00,650
Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong!

525
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:05,430
Kids, come down quickly.

526
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:08,390
Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong hurry up!

527
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:10,180
Dad, what's going on?

528
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,970
Jenny, didn't we go to an amusement park?

529
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:15,850
Ms. Park Noona, Se Chan, and Se Jong, all of us.

530
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:19,910
I was wearing a headband with big ears, and you were all wearing cute headbands, too, right?

531
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:22,830
You're right. We went to the amusement park, Dad.

532
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:24,330
Dad, do you remember that?

533
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,420
Right? This isn't a dream, right?

534
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,570
We went on really thrilling rides

535
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:32,130
and rode the merry-go-round, the kiddie roller coaster, and the bumper cars.

536
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:34,860
We went on the spinning teacups, too, right?

537
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,390
You're right, Dad! It was so much fun!

538
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:39,990
Out of all of us, you had the most fun!

539
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:42,870
Dad, do you remember anything else?

540
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:46,080
Do you remember going to the haunted house?

541
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,110
Haunted house?

542
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:53,330
I don't remember that part.

543
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:56,790
If I tell you about the haunted house, you'll remember it as well.

544
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:59,120
Wow, our dad's memory is coming back!

545
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,120
Yes, it seems like it!

546
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,350
Then let's go outside and eat breakfast

547
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:07,140
and discuss if my memory really came back. We'll do our morning exercises, too.

548
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,510
Yes, Dad.

549
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:11,970
Ajumma, we'll have a light breakfast outside today.

550
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:14,050
Okay, I got it.

551
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,780
Dad, let's go.

552
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,670
- Let's go.
- Nice!

553
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:20,810
Ms. Park, you should join us.

554
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:24,530
You went with us to the amusement park.

555
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:27,300
Okay.

556
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,510
Chief Jo, it seems like Young Gook's memory is coming back.

557
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,060
What happens now?

558
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:51,650
If he finds out that we lied and schemed this entire engagement-marriage plot,

559
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:55,160
he won't let that slide. What should we do?

560
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:00,670
For you, you can just leave the house, but for me, it's all over!

561
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:05,420
Madam, get your mind right.

562
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:08,810
This is just a fragmented memory.

563
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:11,930
Just a fragment? Do you think so?

564
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:17,240
Of course. There have been other times like these, but the Chairman's memory didn't come back.

565
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:22,240
This time is just another fleeting, meaningless memory.

566
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:26,630
A meaningless memory.

567
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:37,920
Seriously, what if the Chairman's memory comes back? Then what do I do?

568
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,100
That's right. In times like these, I have to get closer to the kids.

569
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,710
The Chairman likes me now, so I have nothing to worry about.

570
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:48,280
There's no need to fret.

571
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:57,420
Se Jong!

572
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,520
Did you come to pick me up today, Chief Jo Ajumma?

573
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:12,250
Yes, we have a good relationship, but I wanted to get even closer to you.

574
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:16,970
Se Jong, from now on, I'm going to do better.

575
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:26,110
Later on, I want to become a good mom to you.

576
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:30,400
Se Jong, do you want to go to the arcade and play a game?

577
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,310
Sure.

578
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:39,990
- Se Jong, was the game fun?
-Yes.

579
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:42,450
Let's do it again next time.

580
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:46,410
Jo Sarah!

581
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:51,260
Long time no see.

582
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:59,260
What are you doing here?

583
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:07,260
What a cute kid.

584
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,480
I guess he's the Chairman's kid.

585
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,760
Who is this guy?

586
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:18,840
Se Jong, go inside first. I'll be right in.

587
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,810
Okay.

588
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:40,670
Jin Sang Goo. How dare you come here?

589
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:43,890
I got divorced.

590
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:46,420
What?

591
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:52,800
I wanted to let you know that I got divorced, and I was curious to see where you worked.

592
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,950
That's a nice house.

593
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:58,210
It's really grand.

594
00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:01,260
You better go now. Do you want me to call the police?

595
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:05,730
Hey, Jo Sarah. What did I do for you to call the cops?

596
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:08,550
If you want to call them, call them.

597
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:11,950
Chief Jo, what's going on?

598
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:14,810
Driver Cha.

599
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:18,120
What's the matter?

600
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,230
Who are you?

601
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:23,040
Who are you to ask that?

602
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,360
I'm a person who works here.

603
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,480
Sarah, see you again later.

604
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:40,720
Are you okay?

605
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:44,250
Yes.

606
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:49,430
I'm okay, so you should go inside and attend to your work.

607
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:10,740
What if he thinks suspicious of me?

608
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:14,940
What? It doesn't matter what he thinks.

609
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:18,850
I'm already anxious because of the Chairman, now that Driver Cha.

610
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:23,610
Why is everyone giving me such a hard time? Why?

611
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:34,860
Driver Kang, when are you coming back to work?

612
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:40,020
If your leave takes any longer, just know that we'll be hiring another driver.

613
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,040
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

614
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,610
Please enjoy your meal.

615
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:16,300
Is that CEO Anna?

616
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,120
CEO Anna?

617
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:27,980
CEO Anna, are you okay?

618
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:40,330
Driver Park, can you please...

619
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:42,530
CEO!

620
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,860
Doctor, how is she doing?

621
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:03,630
We got the results from basic tests, but I think we need to do a thorough examination.

622
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:05,260
Please take the steps for the hospitalization first.

623
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:08,970
A thorough examination?

624
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:11,790
Yes, I get it.

625
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:24,900
She needs a thorough examination.

626
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,300
Is she very ill?

627
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,280
Like what you said, this is daebak delicious.

628
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,450
Right? It's daebak, isn't it?

629
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:46,040
Please drink slowly. You will get a stomachache.

630
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:50,570
It's been a while since I had this, so it is delicious.

631
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:55,240
Chairman, why are you so bad at playing this?

632
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,860
It's not as easy as I thought.

633
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:02,430
Ms. Park, please hold tightly. Otherwise, you might fall.

634
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:22,710
What is this?

635
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:26,210
What kinds of memories are these?

636
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:32,040
Chairman, what's urgent?

637
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,680
I remembered everything.

638
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:39,600
You and I drank a strawberry shake, played the whack-a-mole, and rode bicycles.

639
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,060
Wasn't there something between us?

640
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:45,130
No, I know there was.

641
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:49,970
What kind of relationship did we have?

642
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:53,580
We looked very happy.

643
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:57,700
If there was nothing between us, why were we so happy?

644
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:01,500
And smile like that to each other?

645
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,860
Please tell me.

646
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:08,030
I want to know the truth, so can you be honest with me?

647
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:11,340
Something went wrong with us, isn't it?

648
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:20,060
No, there was nothing between us.

649
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:24,220
Ms. Park Noona. Tell me the truth!

650
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:26,200
We were in a relationship, weren't we?

651
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,960
No, we weren't.

652
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,870
Then what's my memory? Tell me.

653
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:36,190
I don't know!

654
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:43,850
Also, what are you going to do now if you know about it?

655
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:50,620
It's not useful anymore, even if you know.

656
00:52:55,610 --> 00:53:02,900
Chairman, please don't act like this to me when you are engaged to someone else.

657
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:05,540
Please don't do this.

658
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:28,340
Why is he acting like that now?

659
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:31,410
What does he want me to do?

660
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:37,430
Even if his memory comes back,

661
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:42,760
I don't want to get caught between a two-timer.

662
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,310
Never.

663
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:11,170
The Chairman's memory is coming back.

664
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:14,960
It's coming back.

665
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,710
Right, I can't just do nothing and let this end.

666
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:23,940
I have to do whatever before his memory comes back.

667
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:26,500
I have to do anything.

668
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:42,540
Chairman, please don't act like this to me when you are engaged to someone else.

669
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:45,310
Please don't do this.

670
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:53,420
Is the young woman I liked that Jung Woo told me was Ms. Park Noona?

671
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:55,990
Is it?

672
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:05,230
No, no.

673
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:09,580
Even if so, what can I do at this point?

674
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:14,510
Like Ms. Park Noona says, I am already engaged.

675
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:18,880
What's the point of confirming that you were two-timing, Lee Young Gook?

676
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,760
You cannot hurt anyone anymore.

677
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:28,450
Yes. Please come in.

678
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,620
What are you doing now?

679
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:39,650
Me?

680
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:44,040
I was looking at some documents from the office.

681
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,960
I see.

682
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,050
Chairman.

683
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:51,290
Here.

684
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,480
What is it?

685
00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:00,410
It's an invitation card. Please see it yourself.

686
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:03,550
[Chairman Lee Young Gook is invited to the Hotel Chouette. at 7 pm, December 26, 2021]

687
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:07,530
Since we couldn't have the after party of the engagement because you weren't feeling well,

688
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,890
I prepared something special for you.

689
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:13,880
Let's meet there later this evening.

690
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:17,600
Okay. Let's do that.

691
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:21,170
Right, Driver Kang is back.

692
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,320
Please come in.

693
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:31,820
I'm returning to the office, Chairman. I wanted to say goodbye before I left.

694
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:35,430
We never had a chance to have a drink together.

695
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:39,890
- I will see you at the office later.
- Yes, sir.

696
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,830
Hey! You startled me.

697
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:08,240
- It was a success!
- What brought you here?

698
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:12,530
What do you mean? I came here to go home together with you.

699
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:15,850
The weather is nice, so let's hang outside before we go home.

700
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:17,910
- Really?
- Yes.

701
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:21,000
Shall we go somewhere to eat something delicious?

702
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,560
Okay.

703
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,630
Let's go.

704
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,130
It's delicious, isn't it?

705
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:44,490
Yes, it's very delicious.

706
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:46,850
It's so good.

707
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:51,670
What's wrong?

708
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:54,990
Are you crying?

709
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:58,230
Did something happen at the Academy?

710
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:02,490
The thing is, I've not eaten out much.

711
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:08,710
After my parents died when I was young, we barely went out to eat while I lived at my aunt's place.

712
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:12,300
When I did, I'd go for spicy rice cakes,

713
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:18,880
pork cutlets, or jajangmyun with friends.

714
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,440
Is that so?

715
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:31,160
From now on, I will take you to places like this often.

716
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:35,120
I'll buy you a lot of delicious food.

717
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:39,900
Please, eat some more.

718
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,280
Thank you.

719
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:47,550
It's really delicious.

720
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:54,870
It's a clean and savory taste that I can't even explain. It feels like a firework in my mouth.

721
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:59,130
- What? Did you say a firework?
- Yes!

722
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,160
Do you want some more?

723
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,180
You should have it.

724
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:07,240
Please eat a lot.

725
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,270
CEO Anna, I'm here.

726
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:29,630
Hello. You must be busy, but what brings you here?

727
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:32,190
I was in the area making a delivery and just wanted to stop by for a bit.

728
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:34,370
Have a seat on the sofa. I'll bring you a beverage.

729
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:35,900
Oh no, it's okay.

730
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,720
Have a seat.

731
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,640
Okay.

732
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:48,900
How are you feeling?

733
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:52,670
I've had an IV and taken medicine, so I'm feeling better now.

734
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:56,360
You helped me again, Driver Park.

735
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:59,790
I really didn't want you to see me this way.

736
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:02,280
Thank you so much.

737
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,330
It's nothing.

738
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:08,200
I'm thankful that I was there at the moment.

739
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:12,670
Had no one else been there, it could've been a big problem.

740
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:18,230
Honestly, I don't know how to repay this favor.

741
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:20,250
You don't have to say that.

742
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:24,540
Has the result come out from the thorough examination?

743
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:29,860
They said the results would come out today.

744
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:33,090
I'm sure it's nothing.

745
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:41,720
Doctor, have the results come out yet?

746
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43,650
Yes.

747
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,360
It's stomach cancer.

748
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:58,590
What? Stomach cancer?

749
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:06,740
I have... cancer?

750
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:29,390
Chairman, you look so handsome today!

751
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:32,700
I heard you have a date with Chief Jo. It looks like you put in some extra effort.

752
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:35,510
I hope you have a nice date.

753
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:05,170
That's right.

754
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:11,820
Chief Jo Noona and I were in love.

755
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:19,020
We were in love.

756

758
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:36,040
I really like you a lot, Ms. Park Noona.

759
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:39,420
If you like me, too,

760
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:44,400
I'll cancel my engagement.

761
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:50,900
When you were in a relationship with Chief Jo Noona and got engaged,

762
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:54,570
but on top of that, you kept pursuing and bothering Ms. Park Noona?

763
01:02:54,570 --> 01:03:01,130
Lee Young Gook, you're seriously trash.

I thought it would be nice for us to talk about our future together,

777
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:05,440
and I wanted us to have some alone time, so I put this together.

778
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:10,690
What do you think of my event? Do you like it?

779
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:14,790
Yes. I like it.

780
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:16,500
Let's do cheers.

781
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:21,940
To the two of us, the kids, and our future.

782
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:44,610
Chairman, have you never looked at me as a woman? Not even once?

783
01:05:44,610 --> 01:05:48,090
That's right. Not even once.

784
01:05:48,090 --> 01:05:50,250
Chairman...

785
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:55,370
Chairman, I've only looked at you this entire time. There's nobody but you to me.

786
01:05:55,370 --> 01:05:57,820
I'm being sincere, please...

787
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:01,630
So can't you just look at me, just once?

788
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:17,980
Chairman, what's wrong? Are you not feeling well again?

789
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:20,670
Chief Jo.

790
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:27,860
We were never in love with each other.

791
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:36,670
I was never in love with you, Chief Jo.

792
01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:40,340
Isn't that right?

793
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:42,440
Chairman...

794
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:45,360
Chief Jo.

795
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:48,750
Why did you lie to me?

796
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:52,130
We were never in love and never going to be engaged!

797
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:53,920
So why did you lie to me!

798
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,470
Why! Why! Why!

799
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:05,960
Chief Jo, don't you ever dare to show your face in front of me ever again.

800
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:09,780
Don't even dream about it!

801
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:13,050
We are no longer engaged.

802
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:45,460
Chairman, if you like me as well,

803
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:51,020
tie a handkerchief around this tree by tomorrow.

804
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:54,450
Where did that handkerchief come from?

805
01:07:54,450 --> 01:07:58,730
I'm so much older. I also have three kids.

806
01:07:58,730 --> 01:08:01,130
Chairman!

807
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:08,920
I knew it.

808
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:12,110
I knew you'd tie the handkerchief.

809
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:19,200
Starting today, you're my boyfriend.

810
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:24,980
Today, I feel like I officially became your girlfriend.

811
01:08:29,130 --> 01:08:34,230
Ms. Park, thanks to you, I feel stronger.

812
01:08:34,230 --> 01:08:38,990
And since you're next to me, I feel like I can rely on you.

813
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:42,580
♫ love is bitter ♫

814
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:49,430
♫ The more I try to grasp it, the further it gets  ♫

815
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:55,300
♫ Goodbye is easy ♫

816
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:57,820
Park Dan Dan.

817
01:08:57,820 --> 01:09:03,760
Where are you right now?!

818
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:11,420
♫ Why do you run away, love. Like a shy child ♫

819
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:18,030
♫ In case I lose it, I hold it tight  ♫

820
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:25,260
♫ But love always runs away, chased by longing ♫

821
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:30,820
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

822

[Young Lady and Gentleman]

823
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,110
What do you think you're going to do now?

824
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:37,400
All we have to do is get married. I can't just end this now.

825
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:40,190
I didn't know anything from the beginning. Leave me out of it.

826
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:43,200
Ms. Park. This isn't right. It makes no sense.

827
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:46,760
- I think Ms. Park becoming our mom is a hundred, a thousand times better.
- Me, too.

828
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:49,570
- So we need to be their "love bridge."
- Love bridge?

829
01:09:49,570 --> 01:09:53,620
What if they have a kid? Then it's a done deal.

830
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:58,230
If something happens to me, I want you to finish my work.

831
01:09:58,230 --> 01:10:00,950
- What are you talking about?
- You never know what might happen.

832
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:03,160
Can I hold you just once?

833
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,090
I'm so sorry, Dan Dan.

834
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:06,850
- Loan me some money.
- Get out of my way.

835
01:10:06,850 --> 01:10:08,960
Just lend me some money!

836
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,590
Who is this guy to keep coming over to harass you?

837
01:10:10,590 --> 01:10:12,350
I've been thinking about myself too much.

838
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:13,570
Would that be okay?

839
01:10:13,570 --> 01:10:17,930
I'll be okay.
