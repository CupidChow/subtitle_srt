[Episode 13]

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,860
Chairman.

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,200
- Why are you being so nice to me?
- Pardon?

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,770
Because you are so nice to me,

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:16,430
my heart feels like it will explode.

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,200
What did you say?

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,030
I think...

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,110
I like you, Chairman.

9
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,280
Whenever I see you,

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,470
my heart beats like crazy.

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,820
Chairman, what if I get heart disease from this?

12
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:42,540
Will you take responsibility if I get heart disease?

13
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,440
Ms. Park.

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,300
But don't worry.

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,440
I will not ask you to take responsibility for my heart.

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,770
It's not your fault

17
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,410
that my heart beats like this.

18
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,970
I think you're pretty drunk.

19
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,450
Let's go home now.

20
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,680
Chairman.

21
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,640
This is an absolute top secret.

22
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,220
The truth is,

23
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,570
you are...

24
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:30,240
my first love.

25
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,810
I think that's why

26
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,490
my heart acts like this.

27
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,680
What?

28
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,880
When I was young,

29
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,040
you gave me a ride on your bike.

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,770
At that time, I said go this way,

31
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,160
go that way,

32
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,400
and gave you a hard time.

33
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,160
But you did everything I asked you to do.

34
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,530
The way you were like a fool

35
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,170
was so cute to me.

36
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,670
- Was I?
- Yes.

37
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,520
You seemed foolish

38
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,780
and cute and nice.

39
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:18,330
On top of that, you're very handsome.

40
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,600
That's why I totally fell for you that day.

41
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,940
And I wished to see you again.

42
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,950
But who knew

43
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,450
that I would not recognize you when I saw you again?

44
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,300
How's that possible?

45
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,210
Ms. Park.

46
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:47,230
I think we need to go inside now.

47
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:59,180
Chairman, why did I not recognize you when you were the first love that I wanted to see again so badly?

48
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,210
Try to guess it.

49
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,570
Number one, because you were not wearing the military uniform.

50
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,070
Two, because your hair style had changed.

51
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,840
Three, because you became

52
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,680
so spectacularly handsome?

53
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,590
The correct answer is!

54
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,790
Number three.

55
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:28,940
It's because you became so handsome.

56
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:42,590
Chairman, come catch me!

57
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,240
It's crazy, crazy, crazy!

58
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,230
Hey, Park Dan Dan, what did you do?

59
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,510
What do I do now!

60
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,350
How do I face Chairman now?

61
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,020
Should I run away right now?

62
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:15,410
No, then what about Jenny, Se Chan, and Se Jong?

63
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,510
Should I say I'm sick and stay in bed?

64
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:23,210
No, no. How long could I do that?

65
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,790
Right.

66
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:29,030
I don't remember anything from yesterday because I was too drunk.

67
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,530
I have no memory of yesterday.

68
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,530
I was blacked out. Blacked out!

69
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,120
I must have lost my mind!

70
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,420
What should I do?

71
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,830
Chairman doesn't come out at this hour.

72
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,930
Let's quickly get some water and go back upstairs.

73
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,110
Chairman, good morning.

74
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,170
Are you going to work already?

75
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,570
Yes, I have a breakfast meeting today.

76
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,660
Chairman, I came home very late yesterday.

77
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,790
I don't know what time exactly I came home.

78
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,680
I took the last bus and got off at the stop.

79
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,320
I remember until then.

80
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,470
But I don't remember anything after that.

81
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,290
I think I was blacked out.

82
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,860
I can't remember anything at all.

83
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,260
Is that so?

84
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,490
Yes. We found our long-lost aunt.

85
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,950
I got too excited that the whole family gathered in a while.

86
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,780
So I think I overly drank a bit.

87
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:48,490
I hope I didn't do something wrong to you, did I?

88
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,070
You said you don't remember anything because you were blacked out,

89
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,420
but I guess you do remember seeing me last night.

90
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,380
No! No, I don't.

91
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,480
I don't remember a thing.

92
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:05,260
Did I run into you last night?

93
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,160
If you don't remember, that's okay.

94
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,510
It sounds like you were blacked out last night.

95
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,100
Chairman, have a good day.

96
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,070
Have a good day as well, Ms. Park.

97
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,600
I hope he believes that I don't remember anything.

98
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,780
So she was blacked out.

99
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:52,140
Chairman, why did I not recognize you when you were the first love that I wanted to see again so badly?

100
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:58,560
It's because you became so handsome.

101
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,770
Please eat some for yourself, Noona.

102
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,870
I'm very full.

103
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,820
Kyung Hoon, I mean Soo Chul.

104
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,620
I get full just watching you eat.

105
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,830
Excuse me, can we have some cold buckwheat noodles?

106
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,830
I really can't eat anymore. I'm full.

107
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,340
But they say there is a separate stomach for cold noodles.

108
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,460
You can eat it.

109
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,750
Are you going to fatten me up?

110
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,270
Yes, I am.

111
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:48,760
I am going to give you everything I wanted to feed you until now.

112
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,290
Even if you get fat, it doesn't matter.

113
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,990
Oh, Noona.

114
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,710
I forgot about this.

115
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:00,190
I asked to see you because I wanted to show you this.

116
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,640
What is it?

117
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,480
Take a look.

118
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,130
It's a photo of our mom and dad.

119
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,890
Are they my mom and father?

120
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,130
Yes.

121
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,920
They're our mom and dad.

122
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,240
Who brought you into this world.

123
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,080
Noona,

124
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,420
can I keep this photo?

125
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:59,200
Yes. Of course, you can.

126
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,040
Father...

127
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,770
Kyung Hoon...

128
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,640
I'm so sorry.

129
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,620
Kyung Hoon!

130
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,990
Kyung Hoon... Kyung Hoon...

131
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,710
I'm sorry, Kyung Hoon.

132
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,620
If I didn't lose you that time...

133
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,890
Mom, I'm sorry.

134
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,160
I'm sorry, Kyung Hoon.

135
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,240
Don't cry, I'm sorry.

136
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,320
What is this?

137
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,350
Mom! Mom?

138
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,890
Mom, mom!

139
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,960
What is it? I'm busy working!

140
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,490
The balcony here is connected to the neighbor's house!

141
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,670
Why is the balcony connected?

142
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,000
Oh, according to the Madam, no, she's my in-law's now.

143
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,340
She said they visit each other with the neighbor anytime.

144
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,590
I think they're very close to each other.

145
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,060
With the neighbor?

146
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,980
But how friendly can they be to share a balcony?

147
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,630
It's as if it's one house.

148
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:33,420
Mom, when can we live in a house like this?

149
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:38,330
Mom, I think sister-in-law's home.

150
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,830
- Welcome home!
- Hello, I came together this time.

151
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,810
Lady-in-law and sister-in-law,

152
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,290
what brings you here?

153
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,740
Were you working here?

154
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,420
You're our family now! We need to work harder, then.

155
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,240
No, that's impossible!

156
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,780
When I didn't know is one thing, but how can I ask my in-law to work for me?

157
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,630
And it's good that you're here.

158
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,270
I was going to call you, sister-in-law!

159
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:08,890
Since you're with lady-in-law, let's all go together.

160
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:12,520
Lady-in-law, let's go.

161
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,660
Go where?

162
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,340
How do I look, Mom?
 [Fantom]

163
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:23,220
It's so pretty and elegant!

164
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,490
We're trying these on because she told us to,

165
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,370
but should we be buying these?

166
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,340
Look at the price tag!

167
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,290
These are very expensive.

168
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:36,540
She's not going to give these out for free. What should we do?

169
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,360
Right, what kind of money do we have to buy these? We barely have enough to feed ourselves.

170
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,090
Mom, let's tell her we had something come up and leave.

171
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,730
Right, I think that's the right thing to do. Go take that off--

172
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,000
Oh, sister-in-law!

173
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,720
Wow! You picked the right ones!

174
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,740
They suit you very well.

175
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,780
You too, Lady-in-law, it looks great on you.

176
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,880
Did you pick some clothes for Soo Chul, Dan Dan, and Dae Beom as well?

177
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,240
And why don't you pick some more for your son as well?

178
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,920
No, how can we choose more clothes?

179
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,080
I'm getting these as a gift for you.

180
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,990
So please feel free and choose anything.

181
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,150
A-A gift?

182
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,860
Of course!

183
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,110
You're the one who found my lost brother.

184
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,180
What couldn't I do for you?

185
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,520
But still, these are so expensive, how can we take them all for free?

186
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,410
And our son-in-law Park will say something when he finds out!

187
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,480
Why would he?

188
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,840
We're not strangers anymore.

189
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,620
If Soo Chul says something, call me.

190
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,430
I'll talk to him well.

191
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:44,800
But still, how can we have this all for free...

192
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,050
Thank you so much.

193
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,590
Thank you, sister-in-law! I'll wear them well!

194
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:53,230
Choose some more! Come, choose more.

195
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,800
- Go pick more clothes.
- Shall we?

196
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,600
- Next month?
- Yes!

197
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,970
The children decided to get married. There's no reason to delay.

198
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:09,910
If we let this year pass, they will only age one more year.

199
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,850
Oh, yes.

200
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:15,090
That sounds right.

201
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:18,240
If it feels rushed, should we do it next year?

202
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,040
We don't mind,

203
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,210
but I thought it might not be okay for the bride to age another year.

204
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,270
No, next month sounds fine!

205
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,850
Since it's an unprecedented situation, let's have a small ceremony.

206
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:35,760
Of course! Who holds such grandiose ceremonies these days?

207
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,400
What's going on with Se Ryun?

208
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,190
She didn't tell me a single word about this.

209
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:44,080
Is she doing this because she really wants to get married?

210
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,400
It seems like they're meant to be together.

211
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,220
Our Kyung Seok insisted on dying single,

212
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:53,700
but he fell in love at first sight with Se Ryun!

213
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,990
I know!

214
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,930
Se Ryun, are you sure about getting married?

215
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,190
Are you really going to do it?

216
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,930
Mom, you said it's your wish to get me married.

217
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,560
Wasn't it? Should I not marry him?

218
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,080
Who said you shouldn't?

219
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,260
I'm just asking whether you're certain.

220
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,510
Are you really doing it because of me?

221
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,360
Because I said it's my wish?

222
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,550
No. I'm doing it because I want to.

223
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,200
Are you happy now?

224
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,000
Then I'm going to arrange your wedding day, okay?

225
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,210
Don't say something else later on!

226
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,060
Mom, can you give me your credit card?

227
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,870
- Why do you need my card?
- Why else?

228
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,080
I filled out the limit on my credit card.

229
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,530
My goodness... Fine.

230
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,100
Here.

231
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,610
Just use it as you wish.

232
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,380
As long as you get married, we can get the shares your father left to you.

233
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,160
Then we don't need to use credit cards with limits,

234
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,190
and we don't need to ask your brother for more money.

235
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,090
Mom. I have a plan, so I'll get going first.

236
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,330
- Don't forget to lock the door.
- Hey!

237
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:13,680
I'm going to tell your brother about setting a wedding day for you.

238
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,260
Do what you want to do. I'm leaving!

239
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,890
Why does she look like that when she says she's going to get married?

240
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,740
Is she going to say something else later on?

241
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,830
No, it's better to make her get married at least like this.

242
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:34,310
Rather than being with that playboy from that parasite household, this is better.

243
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,560
That's how we can get the shares.

244
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,580
- Thank you!
- Here's your Padak Padak, sweet and salty one!

245
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,520
- Enjoy!
- Thank you!

246
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,840
- Padak! Padak!
- Money! Money! Thank you!

247
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,620
Thank you!

248
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,120
Why is this not working?

249
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,190
Hey, hey.

250
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,710
It looks delicious!

251
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:08,120
We're meeting again here.

252
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,650
- Let's go somewhere else.
- Why, Oppa?

253
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,460
I want to eat that chicken skewer!

254
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,120
Why do you want to eat such a thing?

255
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,160
Eating things like this is the reason why you get stomachaches and diarrhea.

256
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,410
If you go over there, there's a delicious high-end handcrafted burger place.

257
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,850
Let's go eat high-end handcrafted burgers instead.

258
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,420
Oppa, wait for me!

259
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,600
He looks like an ostrich egg.

260
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,090
Hey, he's the guy who drove terribly last time, isn't he?

261
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,810
He's with a different woman already.

262
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,310
Wait. Is he two-timing right now?

263
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,800
How can a man do two-timing?

264
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,570
Dae Beom. If he's two-timing, what about Ms. Se Ryun?

265
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,930
I don't think he's two-timing.

266
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:01,550
He probably didn't go well with Ms. Se Ryun after the arranged date.

267
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,980
Padak Padak! Padak! Padak! Chicken skewers!

268
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,080
It's Hot Young Men! Welcome!

269
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,570
Oh, my eardrum hurts.

270
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:18,290
Oh, that looks good on you!

271
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,880
- It suits you perfectly.
- I think it's too expensive.

272
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,120
Today, I'll buy it for you.

273
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,520
Oh, we should get two or three more!

274
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,070
Baby!

275
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:32,220
Baby, try this on too, this too!

276
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:39,300
Baby, your body is like the sculpture in Greece.

277
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,360
In Park Dae Beom's life,

278
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,990
Se Ryun is the only woman!

279
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,120
What? Did you find your brother?

280
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,850
- The brother you lost when you were little?
- Yes.

281
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,330
We were living under the same sky of Seoul.

282
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,040
Wow. How did you find him?

283
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,930
So the grandma who is working for my house

284
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,680
saw the pictures of my brother on my dresser

285
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,480
and ran a DNA test.

286
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,940
She did it because the pictures were so similar to her son-in-law's childhood photos,

287
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,530
so she was surprised.

288
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,730
Then the results came out,

289
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,830
and the kid in the picture was my real brother.

290
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:32,990
Wow. How can you meet that way?

291
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,600
It felt like my mom and dad from heaven

292
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,980
sent that grandma to my house

293
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,550
to find my brother Kyung Hoon.

294
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:47,640
I still feel like I'm dreaming!

295
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,900
Hey, but it seems like your brother's family is struggling financially.

296
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,750
By seeing his mother-in-law is still working for other people at her age.

297
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,220
They were living in a run-down house.

298
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,210
He was supporting six family members, including his in-laws.

299
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:08,670
I got so upset just looking at it all.

300
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:11,330
But what can you do?

301
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,670
I hear there's a lot of people who regret reuniting with their families

302
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:19,100
because their lifestyle gap is significant.

303
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,570
Even if there's a huge gap in lifestyle, he's my only brother!

304
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:26,020
How can I regret it! That doesn't make any sense.

305
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,430
Besides, he's my only younger brother.

306
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:32,170
What can I not do for him?

307
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,680
Oh my god, is she going to ask me to move out of my house?

308
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,680
So that she can let her brother's family stay?

309
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,350
Oh?

310
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,410
It's from Mrs. Wang! Your friend, Gye-Ran.

311
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:48,490
Why would Gye-Ran call you?

312
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,840
Congratulations!

313
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,010
Mrs. Wang, I truly congratulate you on your daughter's wedding!

314
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,720
Oh, it's all thanks to you, Mrs. Jang!

315
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,380
Although we don't have a definite date down,

316
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,340
I can finally sleep in peace now!

317
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,720
Mi Sook, you really did a great job!

318
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,670
Dae Ran! When your daughter gets married, don't forget about us!

319
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,590
You need to buy us a meal, okay?

320
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,210
Of course, of course!

321
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,550
Gi Ja. Every time you call Madam Wang

322
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:19,160
by her name, I can't get used to it!

323
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,330
How can you call Mrs. Wang "Dae Ran?"

324
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:26,490
Dae Ran and I are friends! How else should I call her?

325
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,260
Well then,

326
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,490
Mrs. Jang, you can be friends with us! We're all the same age, after all.

327
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:35,510
If you're Gi Ja's friend, we're all friends!

328
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,710
How can I do that?

329
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:41,430
Just call her Dae Ran.

330
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:46,580
I guess you don't want to be friends with me. But I want to.

331
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,620
Let's be friends slowly.

332
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:54,380
- Oh? It's Chief Jo.
- Sarah?

333
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:58,860
- Yes, Chief Jo?
- Madam, when are you returning home?

334
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,710
I think you need to come back now.

335
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:07,180
The Chairman asked about the dementia test over the phone.

336
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,660
I told him the results will come out later for now.

337
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,830
- But what should I do? 
- What?

338
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,150
Really?

339
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,850
Okay, I'll come home soon.

340
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,040
What's going on?

341
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,930
It's nothing! Let's do cheers again!

342
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,730
Cheers!

343
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,490
You are doing very well, Se Jong. Jump like this.

344
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,550
Why don't you put that on your back?

345
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:54,360
- Noona.
- What is it?

346
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,480
About Ms. Park.

347
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,060
Do you think she has a boyfriend or not?

348
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,670
I don't know. We've never asked her. Maybe she doesn't have one?

349
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:08,060
She's always home every day.

350
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,250
That's right.

351
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:14,070
Should I ask her if she has a boyfriend?

352
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,590
But you are only a baby.

353
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,170
I am curious too!

354
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,050
Children, I brought you refreshment.

355
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,730
Yes!

356
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,800
Let's go.

357
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,760
Ms. Park, let's play truth or dare while drinking this!

358
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,020
Truth or dare?

359
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,540
- Yes.
- Yes.

360
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,170
Okay, let's do it. It sounds fun.

361
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,940
Nice!

362
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,260
Then, what should we do about the penalty?

363
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,670
Write your name with your butt.

364
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:48,380
Okay, sounds good!

365
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,980
If you don't play, you lose! Rock, scissors, paper!

366
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,820
Yes!

367
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,210
I am the captain, so I will ask you a question, Ms. Park.

368
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,680
To me?

369
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,060
Okay, ask me anything.

370
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:13,100
Ms. Park, do you have a boyfriend?

371
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,960
No, I don't.

372
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,410
Really?

373
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:23,220
I really don't have a boyfriend.

374
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,730
Ms. Park, let's do another round.

375
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:31,820
If you don't play, you lose! Rock, scissors, paper!

376
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,280
Okay!

377
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,890
I have a question for you too, Ms. Park.

378
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,220
Okay, fine.

379
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:41,930
Do you have someone you like?

380
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,080
If you don't answer, you have to write your name with your butt.

381
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,490
We will count to one, two, and three!

382
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:54,650
Okay.

383
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,680
One, two, three!

384
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,640
I have one!

385
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,970
Oh, my goodness!

386
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,950
Who is it?

387
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,080
Where did you meet him?

388
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,690
Is he more handsome than me?

389
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:14,610
Oh? Dad!

390
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,680
Children, I...have to go in.

391
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,110
Ms. Park! Where are you going?

392
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:32,210
Who's the person she likes?

393
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:43,210
How long was the Chairman standing there?

394
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:47,390
Did he hear everything I said?

395
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:55,220
Does everyone now know that I have feelings for the Chairman?

396
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,920
What do I do?

397
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:06,160
Chairman will be home soon. What should we do?

398
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:11,090
What do we tell him if he asks about the result of the dementia test?

399
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:16,000
Do we tell him you have dementia or not?

400
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,140
I know.

401
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,730
Should I say I am, or I'm not?

402
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,320
Who is it?

403
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,370
Chairman is home and looking for Chief Jo.

404
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:31,970
Okay, I'll be there shortly.

405
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,630
Should I say you have dementia?

406
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,170
But I don't have dementia.

407
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:45,580
But if we say you don't have it, then you framed Ms. Park for stealing.

408
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:49,610
I don't think Chairman will let that go.

409
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,850
Seriously!

410
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:56,620
Just tell him that I have it a little bit.

411
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,560
Just a very beginning stage.

412
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,360
It's a very early stage.

413
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,500
Yes.

414
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:14,120
Is she in the early stages of dementia?

415
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,900
Yes.

416
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:24,920
That's what I expected. That's why she treated Ms. Park like that.

417
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,980
What prescription did the hospital give her?

418
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,370
But it's at the very beginning stage.

419
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:35,820
If she takes the medication diligently, she won't get any worse.

420
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:40,890
She will be able to live a normal life like now.

421
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,140
That's fortunate.

422
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,850
Thank you, Chief Jo.

423
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,740
You're welcome.

424
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,500
What should I do?

425
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,720
What are you going to do now, Park Dan Dan?

426
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,580
How will you face Chairman, living in the same house?

427
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,230
Who is that?

428
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,080
Yes?

429
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,730
Ms. Park, Chairman is looking for you.

430
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,880
Is Chairman looking for me? Why?

431
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:18,080
What's wrong? Did you do something wrong to him?

432
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,820
No, I didn't. It's not that.

433
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:24,970
Madam went to the hospital, and it turned out that she does have dementia.

434
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,890
He wants to talk about it to all of us.

435
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:31,430
Does Madam really have dementia?

436
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:37,510
Grandma received a diagnosis that she has an early stage of dementia.

437
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,260
Dementia?

438
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,840
Is that really true, Dad?

439
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,150
Yes.

440
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:47,850
Dad, what is dementia?

441
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:50,830
It's a disease that makes you lose memory little by little.

442
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:57,320
It can make you act strangely and not remember people later on.

443
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:03,750
I didn't know that. Is Grandma sick more because I gave her a shock?

444
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,690
That's not why, Se Chan.

445
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:11,780
Fortunately, she's at the early stage, so she will be fine as long as she takes her medication.

446
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,460
Don't worry.

447
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,470
Really?

448
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,160
Yes.

449
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:22,540
But Grandma may say something or act weirdly sometimes.

450
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,960
But please understand it's because of her illness.

451
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,170
And if something happens, tell the adults immediately, okay?

452
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,960
Okay.

453
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,460
What do we do? Things are getting out of my hands.

454
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,730
It's affecting the children.

455
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:42,680
- Chief Jo.
- Yes.

456
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,810
Please pay more attention to their Grandmother.

457
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:49,090
Report to me on any hospital visits she may have.

458
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,330
Yes.

459
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:54,010
Mrs. Yeoju, it might be more work for you, but please take good care of her.

460
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:57,460
Yes, don't worry, Chairman.

461
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,100
Ms. Park.

462
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,770
Yes, Chairman.

463
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:07,370
If something like what happened to you happens again, please tell me directly.

464
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,780
Yes, I will.

465
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:16,300
♫ I was leaving home after my breakfast ♫

466
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:20,010
♫ I feel the shimmering sun rays enveloping me ♫

467
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:23,790
♫  I feel the attention towards me  ♫

468
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:27,450
♫  I was walking arrogantly  ♫

469
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:31,200
♫ When I was leaving my house after breakfast ♫

470
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,920
♫ I love the new pair of shoes I bought  ♫

471
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,670
♫ I feel like I can fly ♫

472
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:39,260
What are we doing here, Chief Jo?

473
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,650
What do I do? Am I supposed to live as a dementia patient from now on?

474
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:46,710
♫ I was leaving my house after breakfast ♫

475
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:52,200
Just hang in there for a bit. We can just tell them you got better naturally later.

476
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:57,380
What if the rumor spreads that I have dementia? My daughter has to get married soon.

477
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,970
I can't say I'm not sick at this point.

478
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,360
This is driving me crazy!

479
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,080
♫  This little kitten is staring at me  ♫

480
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,690
♫ I can't lose the staring battle because I'm a fighter ♫

481
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,700
♫  So I'm glaring  ♫

482
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,770
- Are you home now, CEO Anna?
- Yes.

483
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,280
Have you had your dinner?

484
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,440
Yes, I have. It's late.

485
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,760
You came home late today.

486
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,620
I had to check on the samples that arrived from the U.S.

487
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,750
What's going on? Did something good happen?

488
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,600
You were right, Noona. She has dementia.

489
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,580
So children are performing to make her feel better.

490
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:40,470
Oh, no. I was wondering about it, but it turned out to be true.

491
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:45,350
But she's at the early stage, so it's possible to have a regular life as long as she takes the medication.

492
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,460
We should be careful with each other.

493
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,340
♫  Especially today, my back is not in pain at all  ♫

494
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:55,100
♫ I open up my chest, and I feel ten years younger ♫

495
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:59,760
♫ I walk in big, big, big steps ♫

496
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:05,110
She did that crazy thing when she was only at the early stage?

497
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,560
I am home.

498
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,220
Welcome home!

499
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,750
What are all these clothes?

500
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,760
Honey, take a look at this one.

501
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,970
Please sit.

502
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:20,760
Sister-in-law gave clothes for you, Dae Beom, Dan Dan,

503
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,740
and all of us.

504
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,870
She gave us all these expensive clothes for free.

505
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:30,110
Honey, please try this on.

506
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:32,720
My sister just gave these to us?

507
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,840
How could you bring all these without paying?

508
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,090
I offered to pay, but she said these were gifts.

509
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:44,640
She's said I was a savior for finding her brother. She bought us everything.

510
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,210
She kept thanking me.

511
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,160
Ah, yes.

512
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:55,950
Now that I look, we are missing one for Mi Rim.

513
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,820
I have lots of clothes. It's okay.

514
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,970
This is for Dan Dan, but you should try it on.

515
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:06,790
You and Dan Dan wear the same sizes, don't you?

516
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:10,840
No, it's okay, Aunt. I have to go to work.

517
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,790
I'm late. I'll get going!

518
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:16,090
- Okay.
- See you!

519
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:20,150
Why didn't you get one for Mi Rim?

520
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:23,490
I couldn't think of it because I was too busy picking clothes for Dan Dan and Dae Beom.

521
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:28,430
I thought you would get one for Mi Rim while picking it for Dan Dan.

522
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:31,920
How did I not think of Mi Rim?

523
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:37,100
Mom, Noona. My oldest sister in heaven must be crying now.

524
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,120
Please don't forget Mi Rim next time.

525
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,880
Okay, okay.

526
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,490
Honey, please try this one.

527
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:49,110
Here, try it on.

528
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,950
Now that I look, we are missing one for Mi Rim.

529
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:01,700
We didn't get one for Mi Rim.

530
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:15,830
♫  My heart beats louder. Suddenly love feels so easy  ♫

531
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:22,010
♫  So I fall deeper and deeper for you  ♫

532
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,510
♫ That's what you do to me ♫

533
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:28,340
♫  I am alcohol-free, but I get drunk  ♫

534
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:33,420
♫  Although I did not drink at all  ♫

535
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,950
♫  It happens whenever I'm with you  ♫

536
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,600
♪ Like this, oh yeah! ♪

537
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,800
You startled me.

538
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,210
What are you doing here?

539
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:49,010
Why did you come here?

540
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:53,070
I came to buy ramyun.

541
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,940
What's with that guy? Why is he everywhere I go?

542
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:04,630
He was at the hairdressing school as well.

543
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:08,540
How did he know that I worked here?

544
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:22,270
Did you come here because you know I'm working here?

545
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,550
No, I didn't. I live in the neighborhood.

546
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,260
It's a coincidence that I see you here.

547
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,210
It's ridiculous. He's lying.

548
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:31,400
I've never seen him before, even once.

549
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:38,640
Excuse me, I'm saying it just in case.

550
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,180
If you came here because of me, be careful.

551
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:47,810
I have an athletic cousin and two strong uncles.

552
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:51,470
If you get caught, you may not be able to save your bones.

553
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:54,660
Don't think anything strange.

554
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,880
Got it?

555
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:06,250
You really have princess syndrome.

556
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,770
Why are you so confident?

557
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:20,810
I forgot to bring water.

558
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:26,640
What if I run into the Chairman downstairs?

559
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,230
I should try not to run into him for a while.

560
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:34,180
And,

561
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:37,760
when I erase my feeling for him in my heart,

562
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,380
everything will be okay.

563
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:57,270
Isn't that the Chairman?

564
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,920
Ms. Park. I'm leaving now, so you can come out.

565
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:22,790
What am I going to do?

566
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:28,940
Park Dan Dan, why do you keep acting foolishly?

567
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,010
Chairman knows how you feel now.

568
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:34,320
All of it.

569
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:00,040
Chairman, may I see you outside for a minute?

570
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,630
I have something to tell you.

571
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:22,690
Chairman, thank you for coming out.

572
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:27,120
And I'm sorry for asking you to come out.

573
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,180
It's okay. It's nice to feel the fresh air.

574
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,280
So what is it about?

575
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,140
I have something I must tell you.

576
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,390
But just in case someone hears at home,

577
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:42,360
they might misunderstand it.

578
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,990
Okay, please tell me what you have in mind.

579
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,840
Chairman, earlier today,

580
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,400
when the children and I were playing truth or dare,

581
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,410
did you hear everything...

582
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:03,470
Did you hear everything I was saying?

583
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:06,280
Yes, I heard everything.

584
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,300
I was wondering about it, and I was right.

585
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,200
That's why I wanted to see you.

586
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,500
Because I thought you would misunderstand.

587
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,650
What kind of misunderstanding?

588
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:25,820
So yesterday,

589
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,480
when I said you were my first love,

590
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,790
it meant I liked you when I was young,

591
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,590
not that I still have feelings for you.

592
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:39,330
In other words, please don't misunderstand

593
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:41,850
because of what I told the children while we were playing truth or dare.

594
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:45,540
I didn't mean that I still like you.

595
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:50,240
So what I'm saying is,

596
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,520
from now on,

597
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,240
please don't avoid me.

598
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,700
I never tried to avoid you.

599
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:04,080
That's what I'm saying. I won't try to avoid you from now on.

600
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:08,620
And let's not be uncomfortable with each other. That's why I asked you to gather tonight.

601
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:12,260
I will try my best to look after the children

602
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:15,100
and teach them well.

603
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,910
I will just concentrate on work from now on.

604
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:21,170
- Okay.
- Yes!

605
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:23,730
I'm sorry for calling you out here at this late hour.

606
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:27,400
Then, I will go in first.

607
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,030
- Ms. Park.
- Yes?

608
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,170
Baby.

609
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,680
Baby.

610
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:12,330
Baby.

611
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,560
Baby.

612
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:08,340
Ms. Park.

613
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,690
Why was she in my dream?

614
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:25,770
Have a good day, everyone.

615
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,700
Chairman.

616
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,640
Aren't you going to have breakfast?

617
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,920
I have to go out now because of work.

618
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,670
Have a great day.

619
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:46,010
I guess he doesn't even want to see me anymore.

620
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:49,820
I understand how uncomfortable he must be.

621
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:52,580
So stupid of me!

622
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:58,550
Chairman didn't even look at her today.

623
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,110
And he only looked at me.

624
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:05,240
Was I being too sensitive about nothing?

625
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,130
Yes.

626
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:37,580
Chairman, here is the fashion editorial for the new products to be unveiled next month.

627
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,650
Thank you.

628
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:17,220
Chief Jo, what brings you here?

629
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:21,390
You came to work without eating breakfast.

630
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,040
So while I was out to buy some clothes for Se Jong and Se Chan,

631
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:28,670
I brought your favorite mushroom soup and fruit.

632
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:31,320
Please have them when you feel hungry.

633
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,060
Thank you, Ms. Park.

634
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,160
I'm sorry, Chief Jo.

635
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:45,460
I will get going now.

636
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:55,680
What's wrong with me today?

637
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:02,540
How much space does Ms. Park occupy in his brain?

638
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,180
He even called me by her name.

639
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:10,120
How could he call me Ms. Park? How?

640
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,830
Chief Jo.

641
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:24,160
What do you mean you are not going to work for our house anymore?

642
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,850
I do not have any more hope.

643
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:32,790
Or the desire to try harder.

644
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:35,820
I cannot do it anymore.

645
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,000
You can't leave, Chief Jo.

646
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,990
How can I live without you?

647
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:45,970
I rely on you even more than I do my Se Ryun.

648
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:49,220
I guess Chairman only has Ms. Park in his head

649
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:52,830
for him to call me Ms. Park.

650
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:56,430
Why are you overreacting by he called you with the wrong name once?

651
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:58,580
I do that sometimes too.

652
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:02,960
I mean to call Mrs. Yeoju but call Chief Jo, sometimes.

653
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,950
How is that the same as this?

654
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:09,560
I've worked for Chairman for more than five years.

655
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:13,280
But how can he call me by the name of a girl who's worked there not even for five months?

656
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,870
How can he do that to me?

657
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,690
Has Young Gook gone mad?

658
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:26,090
Ms. Park is so young and has nothing to see from her.

659
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:30,840
Young Gook has lost his mind.

660
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:36,960
Because of you, Madam,

661
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,140
If it weren't for you,

662
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,880
I would've not endured it until now.

663
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,160
But I can't do it anymore.

664
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:51,010
I can't do it any longer...

665
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,670
Give me your hands.

666
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:03,800
I will take care of it.

667
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:09,700
My daughter-in-law.

668
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,480
I have to act like this to get rid of Ms. Park.

669
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,630
That's the only way I can protect my Se Jong.

670
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,310
Yes, yes.

671
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:25,660
Get home now.

672
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,500
When my Se Ryun gets married,

673
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:36,910
and Chief Jo becomes my daughter-in-law, everything will be perfect.

674
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:41,360
But how could that young girl make such a mess of things?

675
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,110
Driver Park, let's go.

676
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:44,940
Yes, ma'am.

677
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,390
What?

678
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:53,600
Chairman Lee called Sarah by Ms. Park's name?

679
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,420
Did Chairman Lee lose his mind to that girl?

680
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:00,190
Otherwise, how can Sarah say she's leaving

681
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:02,800
when she's committed to staying there forever?

682
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,920
Don't get overheated and come up with some idea!

683
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,660
How can we kick Ms. Park out of the house?

684
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,870
Right, if they become a couple, everything will be ruined.

685
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:14,780
Let's think of some good ideas.

686
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:18,090
There is no need to come up with ideas to fire someone.

687
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:19,770
You just have to let her go.

688
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:21,850
Why not just ask her to leave?

689
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:24,440
It's because that hasn't worked.

690
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,750
Chairman Lee, the children, Mrs. Yeoju, and even the guest, CEO Anna,

691
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:30,230
all of them are on that woman's side!

692
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:32,260
You said she was a young lady.

693
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,520
She must be extremely capable.

694
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,960
How did she manage to capture all of their heart?

695
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,730
That's why she's not an ordinary girl.

696
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:43,100
She came in with a plan to hook the Chairman from the beginning.

697
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:47,780
That's how she won over the children's hearts right away.

698
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,680
She sounds very scary.

699
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:54,560
She's going after him with all her might because he's rich.

700
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,840
What has the world come to?

701
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,320
That's what I'm saying.

702
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,460
Are there no good ideas?

703
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:07,030
I accused Ms. Park of stealing to kick her out of the house

704
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:10,620
and ended up acting like a dementia patient.

705
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:13,770
If I were a real dementia patient,

706
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:17,010
I could do something ridiculous and kick her out.

707
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:18,970
Yes, that's right.

708
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:21,480
- That's it.
- That's it.

709
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,910
You startled me.

710
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:29,660
Does it make sense for her to ask me to go all the way to Damyang to buy grilled short rib patties at this time of the day?

711
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,790
She must have dementia.

712
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:36,950
Driver Kang could go on his own. Why do I have to go too?

713
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:39,740
Are you going somewhere?

714
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:45,440
Yes. Madam wanted to eat short rib patties all of a sudden and asked me to go to Damyang.

715
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,920
I have a lot to do and what will we do for supper?

716
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,000
Sarah is at home.

717
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,740
And I could help too.

718
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:57,340
So don't worry and think of it as a nice drive.

719
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:02,300
♫ Endlessly ♫

720
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:06,920
What's going on? Does Chief Jo think this is her house?

721
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:10,400
But something feels not right for some reason.

722
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,680
I have to go now. Will I be back by the end of the day?

723
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:24,960
Mrs. Yeoju is gone. All we have to do is to hunt the rabbit.

724
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:32,370
Did you call me, Chief Jo?

725
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:34,010
Oh, you are here.

726
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:39,790
Mrs. Yeoju is not here, can you help us?

727
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:41,420
Yes.

728
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:43,250
Can you bring this to Madam?

729
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:46,290
I have to prepare snacks.

730
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:48,220
Okay.

731
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,860
Dae Ran, why am I shaking this much?

732
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:07,610
You really have to pull this off.

733
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:11,150
Make her want to leave the house at once.

734
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:15,230
I got it. I will make her hate this house.

735
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:17,710
Don't worry.

736
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:31,480
Madam, I've brought your juice.

737
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:40,100
You horrible, despicable wench!

738
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,310
Madam!

739
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:45,070
Dae Ran, what's going on with you?

740
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:49,160
You wench, you put poison in this, to kill me. I know that!

741
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,870
Get out of my house. Now!

742
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:54,440
Madam, this is just juice.

743
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,180
Also, it's me, Ms. Park.

744
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,910
Yes, Dae Ran! It's just juice.

745
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:01,670
What's going on with you? Get yourself together.

746
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:04,280
You're not Ms. Park. You're Yang Kyung Sook.

747
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,940
You're that woman who seduced my husband! Get out!

748
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:09,750
Get out of my house, now!

749
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:12,020
Madam, please calm down!

750
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,980
Chief Jo. Chief Jo!

751
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,940
Chief Jo, nonsense. Get out now!

752
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,290
Get out!

753
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:20,050
Get out, you wench!

754
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:23,300
- I said, get out!
- Dae Ran!

755
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:28,300
Who brought her into my house! A man seducer!

756
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,220
Madam.

757
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:34,290
Please get yourself together, Madam.

758
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:37,400
You, get out of my house, right now!

759
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,970
Get out, you wench!

760
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:42,950
Madam! What the heck are you doing right now!

761
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:47,280
CEO Anna...

762
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:53,110
Ms. Park, get up. Are you okay?

763
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,150
What's going on?

764
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:57,440
I'm okay, CEO Anna.

765
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,150
But I think Madam is ill again.

766
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,780
What do we do?

767
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,460
- Dae Ran.
- CEO.

768
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,230
Madam is a little...

769
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:07,760
Chief Jo, what are you doing?

770
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,450
Get rid of that wench, Kyung Sook!

771
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:13,790
Hey, Dae Ran...

772
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,390
What are you all doing here?

773
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:23,330
Look at her.

774
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:27,350
Ms. Park. What happened to your clothes and face?

775
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:29,590
What's going on?

776
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:32,590
It's nothing.

777
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:35,440
I'm okay.

778
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,740
Madam, please don't.

779
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:39,820
Kyung Sook! Kyung Sook, you wench!

780
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:41,630
Kyung Sook, you wench!

781
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:43,870
Please go inside.

782
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,510
Ms. Park, is it--

783
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:54,590
That's right! Madam did something unspeakable to Ms. Park again.

784
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:57,300
What is this? Let's talk later.

785
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:01,730
Ms. Park is not in a good state. Let's go upstairs.

786
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:04,150
Are you okay?

787
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,930
I thought we only had to get rid of Mrs. Yeoju, but what's this?

788
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:20,240
Who would have thought the Chairman would be home early? And that woman, Anna too!

789
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,150
What am I going to do now?

790
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:24,500
Mom, I think it'd be best for you to go home.

791
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,930
Right, I will.

792
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:28,960
- Let me go with you.
- No, Madam!

793
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,800
You have to pretend to be sick and sleep.

794
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,740
Since things have come to this, I'll go and confront it with the Chairman right now.

795
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:39,270
- Mom, I told you to go.
- Okay.

796
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:42,850
Dae Ran, you got this, okay?

797
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:45,710
Madam, please lie down.

798
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:49,940
What do you mean by confronting it with the Chairman?

799
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:54,110
Whenever Madam sees Ms. Park, her symptoms get worse.

800
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:58,170
Then Ms. Park should quit. Don't you think so?

801
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,790
Yes. Yes.

802
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:03,100
Of course.

803
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:07,060
Your clothes and everything is a mess right now.

804
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,830
What kind of craziness is this?

805
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:11,400
Clothes can be washed. It's okay.

806
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,770
What do you mean by it's okay! You got attacked vulnerably.

807
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:17,290
How can you say it's okay?

808
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:20,580
It's because Madam is sick.

809
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,860
Ms. Park.

810
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:31,250
Are you working here even enduring all these things because you have nowhere else to go?

811
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:33,090
I told you.

812
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:36,770
You can work with me, so--

813
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:40,030
That's not the only reason.

814
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:42,330
I have a place to go now.

815
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:48,410
I can go home. And I have saved some money too.

816
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:52,320
It's just because...

817
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:56,990
I like working here and it gives me joy.

818
00:54:56,990 --> 00:55:03,530
It makes me happy and grateful that someone needs me.

819
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:08,720
That's why I want to stay here.

820
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:15,370
My sweet Dan Dan, if staying here makes her happy, then she should stay.

821
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:19,180
Next to me like this.

822
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:23,640
I know that Madam is not acting like that on purpose,

823
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:29,300
and it's all because of her illness, but it still upsets me.

824
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:34,950
And it makes me worry that she might get worse because of me.

825
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:37,550
So should I leave here?

826
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:41,140
I don't know what to do.

827
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:52,510
Ms. Park, don't worry.

828
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:55,360
We will find the right solutions.

829
00:55:55,360 --> 00:56:01,000
And now that Chairman knows everything, he won't let this happen again.

830
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,110
So let's get changed, Ms. Park.

831
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:07,230
And rest comfortably, okay?

832
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:10,420
Yes. Thank you.

833
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:12,920
It will be okay.

834
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:32,280
Madam's behavioral symptoms are not for early stages.

835
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,320
She can't act like this if she's at an early stage.

836
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:45,630
What do you mean Ms. Park should resign, Chief Jo?

837
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:51,560
Madam seems to act quite normal when Ms. Park is not around,

838
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:56,200
but whenever she sees her, whether because of hallucinations or unhappy memories,

839
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,130
her condition gets worse.

840
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:02,450
Even still, Ms. Park is working hard and doing well.

841
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:08,020
How about if we send her on a long vacation, so she doesn't appear in front of Madam?

842
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:11,610
Until Madam gets settled, perhaps.

843
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:21,960
I think it'd be better for Madam to go to a nursing home for a while.

844
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:26,050
A nursing home? That doesn't make any sense.

845
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:27,210
She's still at an early stage.

846
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:31,630
From what I see, she's not at the early stage but a severe stage.

847
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:33,940
You saw how Ms. Park was covered in tomato juice.

848
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:36,610
Madam did that, didn't she?

849
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:40,530
That is...

850
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:43,980
And she was telling her to get out and pushing her to the floor.

851
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:46,880
A good thing the children weren't there. What if they saw it?

852
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,300
They would have been in a big shock.

853
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:55,430
Did she really do that to Ms. Park?

854
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:58,110
If she's at the early stage of dementia, that couldn't happen.

855
00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:01,390
There must have been a mistake in diagnosis.

856
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:05,510
Chief Jo, did she get a proper dementia examination?

857
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:09,570
I know you didn't go to Dr. Kim. Where did you go for the test?

858
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:15,490
Madam didn't want to go there because she was too embarrassed.

859
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:20,570
So we went to a different, small hospital.

860
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:29,740
Young Gook. What if she gets this violent toward the children? I get the chill just imagining it.

861
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:33,870
Putting everything aside, it's in the best interest of Madam for her

862
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:36,010
to get help from specialists.

863
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:40,320
I heard there are many good nursing homes nowadays.

864
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,460
Yes, I agree.

865
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:45,120
I will go talk to her.

866
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:55,710
How long do I have to lie here like this?

867
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:05,880
If you feel okay, can you sit up?

868
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,140
Ah, yes.

869
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:10,080
Oh, my head.

870
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:13,940
Why does my head hurt so much?

871
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:17,320
Do you recognize me?

872
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:21,380
Chairman Lee! I'm at the early stage of dementia.

873
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:23,540
I am okay.

874
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:27,470
Then do you remember what you did to Ms. Park?

875
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:31,490
Ms. Park? What did I do to her?

876
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:34,370
You don't remember?

877
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:37,670
I guess I did something to her again.

878
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:40,090
Yang Kyung Sook and such.

879
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:41,840
Yes.

880
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:46,190
Oh, what am I going to do?

881
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:50,860
So please go to Dr. Kim and get a thorough examination tomorrow.

882
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:56,080
And why don't you get treatment in a good nursing home for a while?

883
00:59:57,870 --> 00:59:59,690
A nursing home?

884
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:01,810
What nursing home?

885
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:05,160
I think you are in serious condition.

886
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:08,910
We've never had anyone named Yang Kyung Sook work in our house.

887
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:12,950
Even so, you treat Ms. Park in a hostile manner.

888
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:17,920
I don't want my children to see such violent behavior.

889
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:23,520
The truth is, Chairman Lee...

890
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,770
For our children, please go to the nursing home.

891
01:00:26,770 --> 01:00:29,850
I will make sure you get the best treatment possible.

892
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:34,310
No, that's not it! What treatment do I need in a nursing home?

893
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:38,440
I'm not going to a nursing home. I'm not going there!

894
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:41,450
Please do so. I won't give you a hard time.

895
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:43,800
Chairman Lee!

896
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:49,590
Young Gook. I don't have dementia.

897
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:51,890
It was fake dementia.

898
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:55,280
I don't have dementia.

899
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,360
What?

900
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:59,360
I never went to the hospital.

901
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:02,020
Nor did I get diagnosed with dementia.

902
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:08,580
I was just acting a show. I just acted like I was crazy!

903
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:13,350
What are you saying right now?

904
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:15,760
- What kind of nonsense!
- No, no.

905
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,800
Young Gook, Young Gook.

906
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,150
Because you seem to have feelings for Ms. Park.

907
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:24,230
You shouldn't do that!

908
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:25,980
What kind of household are we?

909
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:28,870
What kind of company our FT Group is?

910
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:33,540
If a strange rumor spreads about you and Ms. Park, it's a big problem!

911
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:34,930
That's why I did it.

912
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:40,130
I wanted to kick Ms. Park out quietly.

913
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:42,340
For that reason,

914
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:44,640
that's why you pretended to have dementia?

915
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,260
Chairman Lee, I'd lost my mind.

916
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:49,840
At that time, I'd lost my mind--

917
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:52,540
Get out of my house now!

918
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:55,260
Chairman Lee, Chairman Lee.

919
01:01:55,260 --> 01:02:00,390
You lied in front of my children and accused an innocent person of stealing!

920
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:06,640
And then you pretended to have dementia. How can you humanly do that?

921
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,850
Chairman Lee, Chairman Lee. I did wrong.

922
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:14,480
I'm sorry, Chairman Lee. I was out of my mind!

923
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,160
I can't live with you anymore, no matter what you say.

924
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:20,710
So please leave. Get out right now!

925
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:23,490
Okay, I get it.

926
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:28,240
I will go.

927
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:33,990
But not until my daughter Se Ryun gets married.

928
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:36,760
Can I please stay until then?

929
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:42,820
I know you hate me, but Se Ryun is your only sister.

930
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:46,280
We can't let Se Ryun pay for my mistake.

931
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:52,710
Chairman Lee, I'm begging you like this!

932
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:56,170
I'm begging you, Chairman Lee.

933
01:02:56,170 --> 01:03:01,180
I'm sorry, Chairman Lee.

934
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:03,740
Chairman Lee.

935
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:12,120
Chief Jo!

936
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:15,260
Yes, Chairman.

937
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:18,450
Come to my study, now.

938
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:26,880
Chief Jo. That she didn't go to the hospital nor get examined,

939
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,050
is that all true?

940
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:31,650
Yes.

941
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:36,900
Are you saying you reported lies to me?

942
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,130
I'm sorry, Chairman.

943
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:43,870
I had no choice since Madam asked me to do so.

944
01:03:43,870 --> 01:03:46,410
Are you giving me that as an excuse?

945
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:48,130
I'm sorry.

946
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:52,460
I am seriously disappointed with you, Chief Jo.

947
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:56,300
Chairman, but this is my first time.

948
01:03:56,300 --> 01:04:01,240
I've never lied to you before. I swear!

949
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:04,500
That's enough. Please leave.

950
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:22,430
Why were you shouting at Chief Jo?

951
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:27,500
It's nothing.

952
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,670
What did Madam say?

953
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:34,340
Did you talk to her about the nursing home?

954
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:37,600
She will not do anything like that from now on.

955
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,530
Just leave it at that , Noona.

956
01:04:39,530 --> 01:04:44,290
What are you saying? If you leave it, she will do that again to Ms. Park.

957
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:47,680
No, she won't do anything like that again.

958
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,400
Let's leave it at that.

959
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:53,250
I will take care of this myself.

960
01:04:55,430 --> 01:05:00,470
Okay, that's good then.

961
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:04,250
Is Ms. Park okay?

962
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:07,980
She says she's okay, but I think it was very hard on her.

963
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:11,400
She even thought about quitting here.

964
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:14,790
Is that really true?

965
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:18,120
Of course. Why wouldn't she think about it when that kind of thing happened to her?

966
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:21,480
Get some rest. I'm going to my room.

967
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:44,690
Ms. Park, please come out to the front of the house for a minute.

968
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:03,660
Ms. Park, please get in.

969
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:04,710
Pardon?

970
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:07,220
Please get in first.

971
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:18,230
And put your seatbelt on.

972
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:20,380
Chairman, where are we going?

973
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:22,650
Hurry up and put on the seatbelt.

974
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:29,600
Let's go now.

975
01:06:39,790 --> 01:06:41,930
Please drink.

976
01:06:41,930 --> 01:06:44,900
Why don't you have a sip?

977
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:50,780
How is it? Does it make you feel better?

978
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:55,880
You told me once that your mood gets better when you drink this.

979
01:06:55,900 --> 01:07:01,230
Did you remember all that?

980
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:03,270
I have a very good memory.

981
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:06,440
Ms. Park, what should we do now?

982
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,890
Yes, you like playing the whack-a-mole.

983
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:12,090
Let's go catch some moles.

984
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:15,170
What are you doing? Let's go.

985
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:39,280
Come on, whack them.

986
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:53,950
How was I? I even caught your moles too.

987
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:57,950
I did better than the last time. Didn't I improve a lot?

988
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:04,810
Are you still upset, Ms. Park?

989
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:10,000
I guess it'd be hard to feel totally better with this.

990
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,460
Since we couldn't do it with whack-a-mole, how about a bike ride?

991
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:16,490
It's breezy out, perfect for bike riding.

992
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:20,320
Should we ride about thirty rounds today?

993
01:08:22,690 --> 01:08:26,240
Chairman.

994
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:29,730
Why do you act like this to me?

995
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:39,430
Do you also have feelings for me?

996
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:43,600
That's it, isn't it?

997
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:51,270
♫ Why do you run away, love. Like a shy child ♫

998
01:08:51,270 --> 01:08:58,040
♫ In case I lose it. I hold it tight ♫

999
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:05,050
♫ But love always runs away, chased by longing ♫

1000
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:11,850
♫ It would be nice to take a break ♫

1001
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:19,850
♫ I have to abandon the longing and the grieves ♫

1002
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:25,930
♫ What am I looking for on this road wandering ♫

1003
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:32,290
♫  Why am I here for what  ♫

1004
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:35,180
[Young Lady and Gentleman]

1005
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:36,730
It's my friend's story.

1006
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:40,800
- A woman with quite a bit of age gap likes him.
- Good luck!

1007
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:41,880
It's not me, I told you.

1008
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:43,830
Please take this necklace.

1009
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:45,140
Why are you giving this to me?

1010
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:46,860
It's because I'm so sorry.

1011
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:51,220
Does it make sense I can't get rid of that country bumpkin even with Madam's help?

1012
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:54,310
There is no one without a flaw. You will find something if you shake them.

1013
01:09:54,310 --> 01:09:56,790
There will be a way to kick her out.

1014
01:09:56,790 --> 01:10:00,430
We've set the wedding date. It's the second Saturday next month.

1015
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:01,290
That's good.

1016
01:10:01,290 --> 01:10:04,510
Are you really going to marry that guy? It doesn't matter for me who you marry.

1017
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:06,010
But he's not okay!

1018
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:07,390
Why do you care?

1019
01:10:07,390 --> 01:10:09,080
What does it matter to you!

1020
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:13,320
If you like me too, please hang the handkerchief on this tree by tomorrow.

1021
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,510
What should I do?

1022
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:16,500
I am back.

1023
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,290
What are you? Who are you?

1024
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:20,170
Are you really Driver Park's daughter?
