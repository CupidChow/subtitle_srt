1
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,975
(Adult Trainee)

2
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:25,421
Ugh, it stinks.

3
00:00:25,547 --> 00:00:27,587
Did you soak yourself in perfume?

4
00:00:31,294 --> 00:00:33,905
It'd be terrible if
Go-eun saw me meeting J.

5
00:00:36,029 --> 00:00:38,196
- You seem to be on cloud nine lately.
- Me?

6
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:41,603
Are you overjoyed that Kang-joon
is sitting with you at lunch?

7
00:00:41,884 --> 00:00:45,932
You're so excited during lunchtime.
You're just out of this world.

8
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,414
Don't get the wrong idea.

9
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,876
Kang-joon has such a kind heart that
he's nice to everyone and everything.

10
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:55,404
What is she talking about?

11
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:57,888
Is she admitting that
she's no one and nothing?

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,943
So, what I'm trying to say is...

13
00:01:02,983 --> 00:01:05,080
stop getting in my way.

14
00:01:05,813 --> 00:01:07,884
You're making me lose my appetite.

15
00:01:08,913 --> 00:01:09,913
Hey, what's up?

16
00:01:11,223 --> 00:01:12,579
My friends are all here.

17
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:14,778
Jin Beom is J?

18
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:18,404
Hey, Go-eun.

19
00:01:32,057 --> 00:01:35,334
- Are you J?
- Oh my god.

20
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:39,600
How'd you know my English name is Jay?

21
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:41,081
What?

22
00:01:41,573 --> 00:01:43,842
Is he saying he's J or not?

23
00:01:51,122 --> 00:01:52,122
Wow.

24
00:01:52,807 --> 00:01:54,570
I heard there's no fine dust today.

25
00:01:54,903 --> 00:01:56,339
The sky is so beautiful!

26
00:01:56,582 --> 00:01:59,788
If he's J, that means Kang-joon isn't J.

27
00:02:04,143 --> 00:02:07,120
When I studied abroad, it rained every day.

28
00:02:08,602 --> 00:02:12,444
Back then, it was my wish
to see a cobalt blue sky.

29
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,980
Eh? "Cobalt blue"?

30
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,614
I didn't speak the same
language as everyone,

31
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,614
so I had no friends or a girlfriend.

32
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,126
Every day, I was so lonely.

33
00:02:29,163 --> 00:02:31,576
But right now, I'm so happy.

34
00:02:32,056 --> 00:02:33,522
The weather is nice...

35
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:37,106
and I made a friend, too.

36
00:02:42,337 --> 00:02:45,456
Is Jin Beom really J?

37
00:02:50,234 --> 00:02:51,234
What do I do?

38
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,553
Will he be hurt if I reject him?

39
00:02:53,832 --> 00:02:56,777
No. I never know when I'll get
another chance to have my first kiss.

40
00:02:57,082 --> 00:02:59,597
Gosh, I should've at least
gargled my mouth with mouth wash!

41
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,577
What did I eat for lunch again?

42
00:03:02,095 --> 00:03:03,190
Garlic curry?

43
00:03:03,944 --> 00:03:05,261
Shit!

44
00:03:10,278 --> 00:03:11,588
What are you doing?

45
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,854
Oh my god. I'm sorry.

46
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,992
Your hand is so pretty that
I couldn't stop myself.

47
00:03:26,313 --> 00:03:27,980
Your fingers are so long.

48
00:03:28,996 --> 00:03:30,479
I love fingers so much.

49
00:03:30,721 --> 00:03:32,356
He's a bit weird.

50
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:36,725
Don't tell me... he has a fetish!

51
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,743
You didn't put hand cream on.

52
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,910
I love the smell of your bare hand.

53
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:43,073
It's like plastic.

54
00:03:43,632 --> 00:03:45,171
What a pervert!

55
00:03:50,074 --> 00:03:51,113
Yo, what's up?

56
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,631
This creep always wanted a high-five.

57
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:57,112
Wow, are your fingers really that long?

58
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,758
I totally got goosebumps!

59
00:04:12,636 --> 00:04:13,636
Oh my god.

60
00:04:18,447 --> 00:04:19,513
Are you alright?

61
00:04:28,942 --> 00:04:30,076
Let me carry you.

62
00:04:34,154 --> 00:04:35,535
No, I'm fine!

63
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,798
No. Just trust me and let me carry you.

64
00:04:39,382 --> 00:04:42,652
What? I never knew Kang-joon
has this kind of charm.

65
00:04:46,944 --> 00:04:49,088
All right. Here I go.

66
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:50,795
Okay.

67
00:04:56,677 --> 00:05:00,203
- I can seriously walk.
- No. I'll carry you.

68
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:15,838
- He cracked his back.
- Oh no.

69
00:05:15,863 --> 00:05:16,863
Kang-joon.

70
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:22,574
- What's going on?
- She's carrying him.

71
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:29,074
Sorry. I'm really heavy, aren't I?

72
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:33,317
No. You're as light as a feather.

73
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:51,114
It doesn't matter who carries who.

74
00:05:52,355 --> 00:05:57,778
I'm just happy that my body is
touching Kang-joon's right now!

75
00:06:00,237 --> 00:06:01,697
Here? Here?

76
00:06:05,854 --> 00:06:06,854
All done.

77
00:06:10,217 --> 00:06:13,320
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. It's just a bit stiff.

78
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:14,958
I'm fine now.

79
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:18,493
By the way...

80
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,176
did you send me a note?

81
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:25,921
- N-No.
- You didn't?

82
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:33,270
Jeez, I didn't know because haven't
been coming to school a lot.

83
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:36,376
But why are the students
kissing everywhere?

84
00:06:36,705 --> 00:06:38,821
At the beginning of the
semester, there weren't

85
00:06:38,846 --> 00:06:40,784
many couples,
but there are lots of them now.

86
00:06:42,846 --> 00:06:44,322
Everyone is dating but me.

87
00:06:45,587 --> 00:06:49,356
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No.

88
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,084
I guess even if you do date, you'll only
go out with people from your agency.

89
00:06:54,446 --> 00:06:57,836
I have to like someone first.
I don't like anyone there.

90
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:00,775
Then what about at school?

91
00:07:04,552 --> 00:07:05,552
I'm not sure.

92
00:07:06,586 --> 00:07:09,371
Just tell me, Kang-joon.
Tell me that it's you.

93
00:07:09,786 --> 00:07:11,001
Tell me that you're J.

94
00:07:11,477 --> 00:07:12,755
You can be honest.

95
00:07:32,137 --> 00:07:33,438
Are you heading home now?

96
00:07:33,463 --> 00:07:35,272
I'm going to the practice room.

97
00:07:35,926 --> 00:07:37,910
- Huh?
- I have to prepare for my comeback.

98
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,248
Maybe it's not a comeback.
Maybe I'm debuting again.

99
00:07:45,023 --> 00:07:46,157
It must be tough.

100
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:49,549
- Can't you play hooky just this once?
- Play hooky?

101
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:52,473
I've never done that before.

102
00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:53,809
Right...?

103
00:07:57,147 --> 00:07:59,441
Good luck. I'm off.

104
00:08:00,156 --> 00:08:01,156
Bye.

105
00:08:04,487 --> 00:08:07,603
(Garam High School)

106
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:11,939
Huh?

107
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,914
Darn it!

108
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:30,546
No way... This scene is...

109
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:42,622
Should I ditch practice just for today?

110
00:09:08,603 --> 00:09:10,588
- I'll hold it.
- No, it's fine.

111
00:09:10,996 --> 00:09:12,971
- I got it.
- No! I'll hold it!

112
00:09:24,026 --> 00:09:28,097
At this moment,
I want to be the dazzling protagonist.

113
00:09:30,825 --> 00:09:32,325
With Kang-joon.

114
00:09:45,723 --> 00:09:46,723
Na-eun.

115
00:09:47,928 --> 00:09:48,928
Na-eun.

116
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:51,259
Are you a goldfish?

117
00:09:51,284 --> 00:09:54,483
Huh? Uh... that place looks really good!

118
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,765
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

119
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:12,845
Eat up.

120
00:10:13,555 --> 00:10:16,690
Oh... I'm on a diet.
I can't eat fried food.

121
00:10:16,969 --> 00:10:17,969
I see.

122
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:23,188
Hey, I know this because
I always go on a diet,

123
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,561
but if you don't eat this
sweet and sour chicken

124
00:10:25,586 --> 00:10:27,525
today, you'll definitely
dream about it tonight.

125
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,998
It's so delicious.
Aren't you going to eat it?

126
00:10:39,034 --> 00:10:40,542
There aren't that many left.

127
00:10:40,805 --> 00:10:42,266
Then should I just have one?

128
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,536
I wasn't even thinking
of giving you two anyway.

129
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:48,811
Here.

130
00:10:56,877 --> 00:10:57,877
This is tasty!

131
00:10:57,902 --> 00:10:59,242
(Glutinous Sweet
and Sour Chicken)

132
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:00,705
I just want one more!

133
00:11:06,021 --> 00:11:07,624
Is it because it's spicy?

134
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:08,841
It's relieving my stress.

135
00:11:08,866 --> 00:11:11,444
- You get stressed out, too?
- Of course.

136
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:14,465
I hope my next album is a hit.

137
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:18,367
Honestly, I'm not sure I
can keep releasing one.

138
00:11:18,933 --> 00:11:19,933
It'll work out.

139
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:22,968
I'll bet...

140
00:11:24,738 --> 00:11:26,269
with this.

141
00:11:29,047 --> 00:11:31,080
- Thanks.
- Those aren't empty words.

142
00:11:31,105 --> 00:11:32,897
I have good intuition
about things like this.

143
00:11:32,922 --> 00:11:37,701
So instead of worrying about practice
or performing, just eat some chicken.

144
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:46,800
It's my first time coming to a
place like this after school.

145
00:11:47,858 --> 00:11:50,138
- Really?
- Yeah.

146
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,666
- Cheers to my beginning.
- Cheers.

147
00:11:54,691 --> 00:11:57,612
I was with Kang-joon in his beginning.

148
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:12,502
Wait a second. Isn't that the
lollipop that was on my desk?

149
00:12:12,786 --> 00:12:14,243
- Yeah.
- What the heck?

150
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:15,935
Why would you eat that?

151
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,031
You said you're on a diet.
I was trying to help you.

152
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:21,247
But still! How could you eat that?

153
00:12:21,272 --> 00:12:24,164
I cherished it because it
was a gift from someone!

154
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:26,550
Hey, I can't see the TV.
Get out of the way.

155
00:12:27,085 --> 00:12:29,267
And why are you pretending
you got it from a guy?

156
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:30,892
I did get it from a guy!

157
00:12:31,145 --> 00:12:32,994
- Who?
- It's not like you'd know him!

158
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,462
J gave it to me!

159
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,091
J? My friend's dog's name is J, too.

160
00:12:37,628 --> 00:12:38,849
Did our dog give it to you?

161
00:12:39,438 --> 00:12:41,024
I'm serious!

162
00:12:41,147 --> 00:12:42,964
There's a guy in my class who likes me!

163
00:12:42,989 --> 00:12:44,767
His name is J!

164
00:12:45,103 --> 00:12:47,580
He gave me perfume, too!
A really expensive one, too!

165
00:12:47,605 --> 00:12:50,630
Jeez, your owner is really scary, huh?

166
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:52,378
Right? You were shocked, huh?

167
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:57,579
You're always so nice to Mari,
but why are you always trying to annoy me?

168
00:12:57,604 --> 00:12:58,775
What are you saying?

169
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,070
Can't you at least tell me that
I'm nice and pretty at home?

170
00:13:02,343 --> 00:13:04,184
It doesn't matter if you don't mean it.

171
00:13:04,338 --> 00:13:05,338
I, too...

172
00:13:06,608 --> 00:13:08,792
I, too, want to hear those things.

173
00:13:08,817 --> 00:13:13,954
Even if people call me pig or whatnot,
can't my family say nice things to me?

174
00:13:15,557 --> 00:13:18,540
If you can't be nice to me,
then at least don't hurt me.

175
00:14:08,644 --> 00:14:09,898
Yeah. I don't need anyone else.

176
00:14:10,565 --> 00:14:12,096
I just need J.

177
00:14:13,077 --> 00:14:15,648
As long as Kang-joon likes me, it's fine.

178
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:30,228
It's okay if I break my back!

179
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:33,421
I'm going to be Kang-joon's
perfect dance partner.

180
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:39,362
And I will protect my J,
Kang-joon, from Go-eun!

181
00:14:39,995 --> 00:14:40,995
No matter what!

182
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,649
What? Am I that pretty, boys?

183
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:30,275
Na-eun, I was a bit over
the top yesterday, right?

184
00:15:30,946 --> 00:15:31,946
Sorry.

185
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:34,819
But your blush is a bit over the top, too.

186
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:37,100
Anyway, let's make up.

187
00:15:37,413 --> 00:15:38,976
Wow, he's tenacious.

188
00:15:39,182 --> 00:15:40,896
He's still trying to hold my hand?

189
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:44,101
Damn.

190
00:15:53,143 --> 00:15:57,167
I'm going to get Kang-joon really
drunk and then sleep with him.

191
00:15:57,862 --> 00:15:58,862
Hey, Kang-joon.

192
00:15:59,103 --> 00:16:02,627
Go-eun, you'll never be able
to fulfill your plan today.

193
00:16:03,081 --> 00:16:05,065
Kang-joon, let's go.

194
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:07,901
Oh. I'm going to partners with Na-eun.

195
00:16:12,393 --> 00:16:13,671
I'll do my best.

196
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,020
Follow me.

197
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,830
Let's go practice, too.

198
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:22,514
Okay.

199
00:16:22,634 --> 00:16:25,190
'Shake that booty that booty booty.'

200
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:28,011
'Shake that booty that booty booty.'

201
00:16:28,036 --> 00:16:29,648
'Shake that.'

202
00:16:30,668 --> 00:16:31,842
Hang on.

203
00:16:32,607 --> 00:16:35,432
The key point of this part is the eyes.

204
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:36,589
The eyes?

205
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,308
Eyes that seem like we
passionately want each other.

206
00:16:42,315 --> 00:16:43,582
We have to be sexy.

207
00:16:44,474 --> 00:16:46,886
My puppy was a wolf!

208
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:49,055
A very beast-like one, too!

209
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,168
We have to look at each other like
we can't handle each other's hotness.

210
00:16:52,193 --> 00:16:53,193
Try it.

211
00:16:53,616 --> 00:16:54,616
- Me?
- Yeah.

212
00:16:54,976 --> 00:16:56,682
Ready. Go.

213
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:01,456
'Shake that booty that booty booty.'

214
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:03,300
'Booty...'

215
00:17:03,325 --> 00:17:04,325
That won't do.

216
00:17:06,135 --> 00:17:07,869
Is it hard to immerse yourself?

217
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:10,689
How do you feel when you think of me?

218
00:17:11,565 --> 00:17:14,407
Nothing really...

219
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,188
I feel like I had seven shots
of espresso in my americano!

220
00:17:18,517 --> 00:17:20,950
My heart rate is shooting
up to 180 beats per

221
00:17:20,975 --> 00:17:23,248
minute because of your
unexpected sexiness!

222
00:17:26,081 --> 00:17:30,374
Then let's make eye contact for a minute.

223
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:31,647
What?

224
00:17:31,768 --> 00:17:36,811
I'm sure it'll be difficult,
but just pretend I'm a really sexy guy.

225
00:17:39,651 --> 00:17:41,762
Ready. Go.

226
00:17:45,513 --> 00:17:47,738
What? What's wrong with you?

227
00:17:49,581 --> 00:17:50,581
Na-eun.

228
00:17:51,274 --> 00:17:52,274
Smile.

229
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,886
- That's enough!
- You need to look at me.

230
00:17:55,134 --> 00:17:58,150
At this rate,
I might do something bad to you!

231
00:17:58,385 --> 00:18:02,480
More! More! Like you really want me!

232
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,112
Okay. Kang-joon is not a person.
He's a hamburger.

233
00:18:08,578 --> 00:18:10,633
He's black bean noodles.

234
00:18:11,604 --> 00:18:13,446
He's delicious.

235
00:18:13,807 --> 00:18:14,807
Okay!

236
00:18:14,832 --> 00:18:17,401
Let's practice one more
time with that kind of vibe.

237
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:19,570
- Okay.
- Good.

238
00:18:20,783 --> 00:18:23,080
("Who's Your Mama?" - JYP feat. Jessi)

239
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:32,966
("Who's Your Mama?"
- Choi Kang-joon (Feat. Son Na-eun))

240
00:18:34,311 --> 00:18:36,414
- What's your waist size?
- 36 inches.

241
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:39,941
- What's your hip size?
- 54.

242
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,601
'Since I was young,
my eyes were a bit different.'

243
00:18:43,626 --> 00:18:46,035
'No matter how pretty a girl
is, if there isn't

244
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,818
enough in the back,
she didn't catch my eye.'

245
00:18:48,843 --> 00:18:52,769
'If she has long straight
hair, skinny enough to be

246
00:18:52,794 --> 00:18:56,644
blown away by the wind,
I can't give her my heart.'

247
00:18:57,975 --> 00:19:00,007
'Your waist is so thin
but, your hips are so big

248
00:19:00,032 --> 00:19:02,000
that it's hard for you
to find pants that fit.'

249
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:06,266
'Oh, yeah.
Shake that booty that booty booty.'

250
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:10,474
'What should I do with you?
What should I do?'

251
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:14,170
'What should I do with you?
Why do I like you so much?'

252
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:19,574
'From your head to your toes,
I can't take my eyes off of you.'

253
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:27,676
'Who's your mama? Just how did
she raise you to be like this?'

254
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:31,062
'Shake that booty that booty booty.'

255
00:19:51,393 --> 00:19:52,393
Na-eun.

256
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:54,292
Son Na-eun.

257
00:19:55,675 --> 00:19:57,072
- Yeah?
- What are you doing?

258
00:19:59,337 --> 00:20:00,646
We need to practice.

259
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:26,700
God!

260
00:20:32,638 --> 00:20:33,638
What's wrong?

261
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,751
Practice by yourself for now.

262
00:20:38,256 --> 00:20:39,256
Move.

263
00:20:39,398 --> 00:20:42,445
What? How am I supposed to practice
a couple routine all by myself?

264
00:21:11,893 --> 00:21:13,814
Can I stay like this for a minute?

265
00:21:18,655 --> 00:21:21,075
Now he's cute again!

266
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:26,923
My puppy's skin is precious.

267
00:21:34,813 --> 00:21:35,813
Hey.

268
00:21:41,361 --> 00:21:42,702
Aren't you thirsty?

269
00:21:43,054 --> 00:21:45,133
What the heck?
Why would she come in here now?

270
00:21:46,486 --> 00:21:48,152
You guys are practicing
hard, too, right?

271
00:21:48,177 --> 00:21:50,852
We practiced too much, so we're tired.
We're going to take a break.

272
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:51,877
Oh.

273
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,490
- How about a game of Love Jenga?
- What's that?

274
00:21:55,622 --> 00:21:57,329
You don't know what that is?

275
00:21:57,354 --> 00:22:00,743
If you let the Jenga pieces fall or if you
don't want to answer, you have to drink.

276
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:05,168
I'm going to get Kang-joon really
drunk and then sleep with him.

277
00:22:05,904 --> 00:22:08,276
- You don't have to play
if you don't want to. - No.

278
00:22:08,698 --> 00:22:10,841
I really want to play Love Jenga, too.

279
00:22:28,203 --> 00:22:31,164
Hey. Why are you stretching your neck out?

280
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:34,104
- Because I have a severe case of
turtleneck syndrome. - Whatever.

281
00:22:38,548 --> 00:22:40,365
Okay. Kang-joon, you can go first.

282
00:22:46,413 --> 00:22:49,008
"Do you have a crush on someone?"

283
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,119
Yes, I do.

284
00:22:57,378 --> 00:22:58,941
It's your turn, Na-fatty.

285
00:23:03,432 --> 00:23:07,305
"When and where did you have
your first kiss? And with who?"

286
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,984
Gosh, I didn't have my first kiss yet!

287
00:23:10,281 --> 00:23:12,670
Go-eun will laugh at me if
I tell the truth, right?

288
00:23:13,023 --> 00:23:14,023
Darn it.

289
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:17,086
But I don't want to lie in
front of Kang-joon either.

290
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,282
"Have you watched porn recently?"

291
00:23:32,057 --> 00:23:34,557
- I don't have time to watch
things like that. - Oh, come on.

292
00:23:34,582 --> 00:23:36,402
I'm sure you've watched it before though.

293
00:23:36,427 --> 00:23:38,632
- When did you last watch it?
- Um...

294
00:23:39,478 --> 00:23:42,859
Kang-joon, don't answer if you
don't want to. I'll drink for you.

295
00:23:48,321 --> 00:23:53,376
"Sit on the lap of the person across from
you and make eye contact for 10 seconds."

296
00:23:54,651 --> 00:23:59,074
Go-eun, I'm sure it's embarrassing for you
to do that, so I'll drink for you.

297
00:24:01,436 --> 00:24:02,436
Drink up.

298
00:24:02,461 --> 00:24:03,461
Fine.

299
00:24:03,486 --> 00:24:06,252
I'll drink all the
alcohol so that that witch

300
00:24:06,277 --> 00:24:09,163
Go-eun can't even think
about seducing my puppy!

301
00:24:11,568 --> 00:24:15,211
But why is this so yummy?

302
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,119
I'll drink for you!

303
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,034
Kang Go-eun, that little...

304
00:24:35,657 --> 00:24:38,213
Stay away from my puppy, you wench!

305
00:24:38,888 --> 00:24:41,564
Hey, my friends!
What are you doing without me?

306
00:24:42,807 --> 00:24:44,069
What's wrong with her?

307
00:25:03,647 --> 00:25:04,714
What's going on?

308
00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:07,498
J! My J!

309
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,302
Where did he go?

310
00:25:26,296 --> 00:25:28,218
I thought you said we
were going to a game room.

311
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:32,237
Oh, this is a game room.

312
00:25:35,528 --> 00:25:37,060
Gosh, I'm a bit dizzy.

313
00:25:38,709 --> 00:25:42,922
- That sly wench got to him.
- Why are you so nice to Na-eun?

314
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,127
You always eat lunch with her, too.

315
00:25:46,152 --> 00:25:48,391
I'm on a diet because I'm
making a comeback soon.

316
00:25:48,533 --> 00:25:51,518
When I watch mukbang on a diet,
I feel vicariously satisfied.

317
00:25:52,031 --> 00:25:56,094
When I watch Na-eun eat when I'm
depressed, it makes me laugh.

318
00:26:00,055 --> 00:26:02,769
She is a bit funny-looking.

319
00:26:02,975 --> 00:26:05,360
But I heard you gave candy to her.

320
00:26:06,905 --> 00:26:08,105
Why'd you do that?

321
00:26:08,953 --> 00:26:09,953
Candy?

322
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:14,011
Oh, that was from my fans,

323
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,785
but I need to manage my weight.

324
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:21,432
I see. So you basically
threw it away in her mouth.

325
00:26:22,523 --> 00:26:23,880
Well, I wouldn't say that.

326
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:28,081
I was so touched when I saw
you trying to carry her.

327
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,634
You get 100 points in my book.

328
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,761
Be honest. She's freaking heavy, isn't she?

329
00:26:34,502 --> 00:26:36,367
That's why you couldn't lift her up, huh?

330
00:26:37,214 --> 00:26:39,214
Honestly, she was pretty heavy.

331
00:26:40,547 --> 00:26:41,724
I knew it.

332
00:26:43,766 --> 00:26:46,568
I'm sure she weighs a ton.

333
00:27:07,285 --> 00:27:08,485
Give me some, too.

334
00:27:12,052 --> 00:27:13,591
I'm gonna drink some, okay?

335
00:27:19,194 --> 00:27:20,694
Are you...

336
00:27:21,987 --> 00:27:23,265
using the perfume I gave you?

337
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:26,031
You're the one who gave that to me?

338
00:27:28,085 --> 00:27:31,335
I thought I had clearly
expressed how I felt

339
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,753
by putting a bottle of
perfume in your locker.

340
00:27:35,172 --> 00:27:39,648
You knew I liked you,
but you only looked at Kang-joon.

341
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,048
I seriously had no idea it was you.

342
00:27:48,207 --> 00:27:50,746
I just thought you liked my hands.

343
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:52,918
Why would you say something so upsetting?

344
00:27:55,351 --> 00:27:56,351
I...

345
00:27:58,967 --> 00:28:00,665
hoped you'd...

346
00:28:01,983 --> 00:28:03,912
look at me properly.

347
00:28:05,457 --> 00:28:06,711
I had no idea.

348
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,500
I'm sorry.

349
00:28:12,663 --> 00:28:17,712
You shouldn't apologize
to the person you like.

350
00:28:20,338 --> 00:28:21,338
Go-eun.

351
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:24,041
What?

352
00:28:25,145 --> 00:28:27,335
- Kang Go-eun?
- Kang Go-eun.

353
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,664
I love you.

354
00:28:44,285 --> 00:28:47,124
Then again, your comeback is coming
up, so you have

355
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:49,760
to take care of your
weight and your reputation.

356
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:51,401
But...

357
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:53,689
I find Na-eun charming.

358
00:28:54,272 --> 00:28:56,319
People who don't know can't see it.

359
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,677
But people who get
closer to her can see her charm.

360
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,570
What about me?

361
00:29:03,632 --> 00:29:05,931
If you get closer to me,
you'll see something amazing.

362
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,180
Want to take a look?

363
00:29:10,668 --> 00:29:13,255
You're right. You're charming.

364
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,464
Don't you...

365
00:29:20,693 --> 00:29:22,195
want to know more about me?

366
00:29:25,335 --> 00:29:28,097
Yeah. I don't.

367
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,443
- What?
- You're not my style.

368
00:29:38,095 --> 00:29:39,095
I see.

369
00:29:48,073 --> 00:29:49,073
J.

370
00:29:50,114 --> 00:29:51,514
Who on earth are you?

371
00:29:52,412 --> 00:29:55,174
I'm so desperate that I want
to ask someone to find you.

372
00:29:56,552 --> 00:29:59,018
J, the first one to notice my charms.

373
00:29:59,603 --> 00:30:02,412
Please appear in front of me now!

374
00:30:02,665 --> 00:30:04,884
(Earth Science)
(*Romanization of "Earth" starts with J)

375
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:07,003
Is it really the Earth Science teacher?

376
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:11,953
Or Kim Jun-su?

377
00:30:14,124 --> 00:30:15,124
Jung Woo-Jin?

378
00:30:25,272 --> 00:30:29,502
A few days ago, I put Jo Malone
perfume in Na-fatty's locker.

379
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:32,093
- Your perfume?
- No, the one Jin Beom gave me.

380
00:30:32,118 --> 00:30:33,300
Oh.

381
00:30:33,325 --> 00:30:35,661
I got tired of it because I have so many of

382
00:30:35,686 --> 00:30:37,566
them, so I put one in her locker as a joke.

383
00:30:37,591 --> 00:30:40,260
- Great job!
- But...

384
00:30:44,936 --> 00:30:48,848
Look at what her description says.
"Gave up dieting for J!"

385
00:30:49,376 --> 00:30:51,209
- Blech, I'm about to puke!
- What the heck?

386
00:30:51,234 --> 00:30:53,719
I even wrote a note saying
she shouldn't go on a diet.

387
00:30:53,744 --> 00:30:55,587
- She actually believed that?
- She did!

388
00:30:55,612 --> 00:30:56,944
Gosh, she's so naive.

389
00:30:56,969 --> 00:30:59,376
Jeez, she doesn't know her own place!

390
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:01,727
Do you know what's even funnier?
She thinks J is...

391
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:05,191
- Kang-joon!
- What?

392
00:31:05,408 --> 00:31:08,852
I think I understand why
people murder in this world.

393
00:31:10,447 --> 00:31:12,677
I don't see anything right now.

394
00:31:17,674 --> 00:31:21,048
Whenever I see her baby hair,
I want to tease her so badly about it.

395
00:31:24,023 --> 00:31:25,023
What the hell?

396
00:31:25,848 --> 00:31:27,888
What's your deal?
Have you lost your mind?

397
00:31:29,441 --> 00:31:32,973
Why? Are you glaring at me?
Are you crying?

398
00:31:33,296 --> 00:31:35,566
Hey, how could you cry over this?

399
00:31:36,745 --> 00:31:38,855
You're making me look like a bad person!

400
00:31:41,661 --> 00:31:42,970
- Apologize.
- What?

401
00:31:42,995 --> 00:31:44,780
- Apologize.
- You lunatic!

402
00:31:49,535 --> 00:31:51,068
I'm not imagining this.

403
00:31:51,847 --> 00:31:53,688
You shouldn't have acted out.

404
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,421
Oh my god.

405
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:58,288
This isn't an imagination, so I can't stop.

406
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:04,792
If I stop now,
I'll hate myself more than Go-eun!

407
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:07,814
- Hey.
- You freaking...

408
00:32:11,207 --> 00:32:14,272
Hey, Son Na-eun! Are you crazy? Stop it!

409
00:32:14,616 --> 00:32:16,696
What did I do? Let go of me!

410
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:20,074
- Go-eun!
- Na-eun!

411
00:32:21,724 --> 00:32:23,124
Go-eun, are you okay?

412
00:32:24,197 --> 00:32:27,321
- Hey!
- Let go of me!

413
00:32:27,346 --> 00:32:29,313
Leave me alone!

414
00:32:32,088 --> 00:32:33,699
Hey!

415
00:32:39,787 --> 00:32:43,686
- Go-eun, are you okay? Oh no!
- What's wrong with her?

416
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,719
- Are you alright?
- It hurts.

417
00:32:47,095 --> 00:32:50,801
- Did you have to go that far?
- You're too strong!

418
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:53,469
- Get up. Are you okay?
- That was harsh.

419
00:32:53,967 --> 00:32:56,181
Get up slowly.

420
00:32:58,029 --> 00:32:59,957
Na-eun, you know this is
school violence, right?

421
00:33:17,145 --> 00:33:18,684
Nice going.

422
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:22,298
You're so big,
but how come you have no brain?

423
00:33:22,611 --> 00:33:24,682
Look at her.
What are you going to do?

424
00:33:26,146 --> 00:33:28,463
Go-eun, are you okay?
Do you need to go to the hospital?

425
00:33:28,765 --> 00:33:30,719
If you want to throw
someone over your shoulder,

426
00:33:30,744 --> 00:33:32,346
you should've joined
a judo academy.

427
00:33:37,889 --> 00:33:41,123
(If you're having a
really hard time...)

428
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:44,355
I don't regret it.

429
00:33:45,747 --> 00:33:53,621
But after realizing that there's no one on
my side in school, home, or anywhere else,

430
00:33:54,373 --> 00:33:55,849
I feel lonely and sad.

431
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,496
It made me wonder what was
the point of a life like this.

432
00:34:03,503 --> 00:34:07,455
When I watch Na-eun eat when I'm
depressed, it makes me laugh.

433
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:13,239
Be honest. She's freaking heavy, isn't she?
That's why you couldn't lift her up, huh?

434
00:34:14,108 --> 00:34:16,600
Honestly, she was pretty heavy.

435
00:34:17,978 --> 00:34:19,580
I almost threw out my back.

436
00:34:57,793 --> 00:35:00,729
- No!
- Hey, you!

437
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:09,885
What if you had fallen into the water? Huh?

438
00:35:10,403 --> 00:35:14,583
Your parents are on the way, so just sit
there and think about what you did. Got it?

439
00:35:14,765 --> 00:35:18,050
But I really wasn't trying to die.

440
00:35:25,205 --> 00:35:26,205
Son Na-eun!

441
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:29,663
You little brat!
Do you know how scared I was?

442
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,559
That hurts!

443
00:35:32,584 --> 00:35:34,387
Why did you even go to the Han River?

444
00:35:34,603 --> 00:35:38,088
I failed to get into college three times,
but I'm still living, so why would you die?

445
00:35:38,113 --> 00:35:40,099
That's not what happened.

446
00:35:41,877 --> 00:35:44,300
Tell me. Did you really hit your classmate?

447
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:47,728
Gosh.

448
00:35:49,746 --> 00:35:50,746
You did the right thing.

449
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:56,043
You're not the type of person
to hurt innocent people.

450
00:35:56,068 --> 00:35:57,341
I'm sure you had a good reason.

451
00:35:57,366 --> 00:35:59,350
Seeing how my sister resorted to violence,

452
00:35:59,548 --> 00:36:02,096
I can tell she's one ugly piece of trash!

453
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:06,402
- What's her name? I'll teach her a lesson!
- Be quiet, will you?

454
00:36:10,387 --> 00:36:12,784
Let me take a look at you.
Are you safe?

455
00:36:14,182 --> 00:36:15,975
- Yes.
- You gave me a heart attack.

456
00:36:18,031 --> 00:36:21,173
I'm always on your side.

457
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,819
Mom!

458
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:26,083
My goodness.

459
00:36:31,129 --> 00:36:33,062
Get that bat out of my sight.

460
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:35,902
Come here.

461
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,758
Don't cry. You don't deserve to.

462
00:36:52,597 --> 00:36:54,677
I'm sorry for eating that
giant lollipop last time.

463
00:36:54,702 --> 00:36:57,687
Instead, I'll buy you all the
candies you'll eat in your lifetime.

464
00:36:59,287 --> 00:37:01,562
(Ja-sun)

465
00:37:02,044 --> 00:37:04,107
- Na-eun, are you okay?
- Yeah.

466
00:37:04,132 --> 00:37:08,467
I'm sorry I missed your call.
I was practicing our group dance.

467
00:37:08,576 --> 00:37:10,155
Hey, are you alright?

468
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:11,678
I'm really fine.

469
00:37:11,703 --> 00:37:15,634
God, that stupid Kang Go-eun!
Should I just kill that freaking hag?

470
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:18,718
Why would you kill her?

471
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:22,182
It wasn't true that no one's on my side.

472
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:26,947
Although I don't have many people who
have my back, I at least have three.

473
00:37:27,763 --> 00:37:30,363
Even if I'm fat, even if I'm not pretty...

474
00:37:30,835 --> 00:37:34,995
there are three people
who like me for who I am.

475
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:53,531
Starting from today,
I decided to like it a lot.

476
00:37:55,085 --> 00:37:57,743
Not Kang-joon, but myself.

477
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:01,988
Hey, Na-eun.

478
00:38:03,203 --> 00:38:04,203
What happened?

479
00:38:06,303 --> 00:38:07,660
You left first that day.

480
00:38:08,584 --> 00:38:10,517
Wow, I felt totally betrayed.

481
00:38:11,092 --> 00:38:13,053
I had an urgent matter that day.

482
00:38:13,078 --> 00:38:15,196
You should've still told
me you were leaving.

483
00:38:15,678 --> 00:38:16,678
Sorry.

484
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:18,083
But...

485
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:20,626
I have something to tell you.

486
00:38:21,097 --> 00:38:22,097
Go ahead.

487
00:38:22,584 --> 00:38:25,496
I'll do everything you want,
except not be your dance partner.

488
00:38:28,485 --> 00:38:31,470
Why not? Why can't we
not be dance partners?

489
00:38:33,537 --> 00:38:35,918
Is it because you're trying
to make a good reputation.

490
00:38:35,943 --> 00:38:39,819
Or do I look as funny
dancing as I do eating?

491
00:38:41,729 --> 00:38:45,443
- What?
- I heard everything you told Go-eun.

492
00:38:46,846 --> 00:38:49,854
If you're trying to build a good
reputation by being nice to an outcast,

493
00:38:51,116 --> 00:38:52,116
I'll pass.

494
00:38:56,412 --> 00:38:57,412
I meant it.

495
00:39:05,016 --> 00:39:07,722
I really meant the fact that
I smile when I look at you.

496
00:39:08,234 --> 00:39:09,847
It's not because you're funny.

497
00:39:10,109 --> 00:39:11,376
Looking at you...

498
00:39:12,268 --> 00:39:13,268
makes me happy.

499
00:39:14,638 --> 00:39:15,904
That's why I smile.

500
00:39:17,475 --> 00:39:21,847
And if you abandon me,
I'll really be an outsider.

501
00:39:23,146 --> 00:39:24,146
Yeah, right.

502
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,355
Why are you an outsider?
You're totally popular.

503
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:28,969
No.

504
00:39:29,551 --> 00:39:31,550
I don't have a single
friend except for you.

505
00:39:31,575 --> 00:39:35,758
While being a trainee,
I couldn't make a proper friend.

506
00:39:36,145 --> 00:39:38,403
And on top of that,
my agency is making me be in charge

507
00:39:38,428 --> 00:39:40,685
of the cute image in the group
because I look like this.

508
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:43,116
So when I come to school,
all the guys hate me.

509
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,940
But...

510
00:39:47,934 --> 00:39:50,299
you're the only one who
didn't treat me that way.

511
00:39:53,076 --> 00:39:54,076
You...

512
00:39:54,781 --> 00:39:56,630
really treated me like a friend.

513
00:39:58,915 --> 00:40:00,748
Hey, I never saw you as a...

514
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:03,869
Honestly, it's my first time saying
my inner thoughts to someone.

515
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,080
While talking with you, I realized,

516
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:13,885
"Oh. It feels really nice
to talk to a friend."

517
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,420
So...

518
00:40:21,476 --> 00:40:23,150
don't leave me, friend.

519
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:29,721
Now that I think about
it, I thought Kang-joon

520
00:40:29,746 --> 00:40:32,184
was cute because of
the filter on my eyes.

521
00:40:33,778 --> 00:40:35,178
You're very talented.

522
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:36,761
How about we pair up for the dance?

523
00:40:36,786 --> 00:40:39,485
- If you really don't know how to
dance, I'll teach you. - Okay.

524
00:40:40,681 --> 00:40:42,562
Should I ditch practice just for today?

525
00:40:42,587 --> 00:40:44,435
I'm going to be partners with Na-eun.

526
00:40:45,139 --> 00:40:49,368
The truth is, Kang-joon has been
making an effort to befriend me.

527
00:40:50,216 --> 00:40:52,016
Na-eun, what are you doing?

528
00:40:52,782 --> 00:40:54,916
- Hurry up!
- Okay, I'm coming.

529
00:41:00,474 --> 00:41:01,474
Let's go...

530
00:41:03,016 --> 00:41:04,063
friend.

531
00:41:35,782 --> 00:41:38,353
Can I just give you one advice as a friend?

532
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:39,776
Sure, go ahead.

533
00:41:40,054 --> 00:41:41,562
You know, your comma hairstyle?

534
00:41:42,269 --> 00:41:43,779
It really doesn't suit you.

535
00:41:44,306 --> 00:41:46,655
- Your previous hairstyle was way better.
- For real?

536
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,680
Yeah.

537
00:41:48,056 --> 00:41:50,834
- My agency's CEO said this looked better.
- Nope.

538
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,092
And...

539
00:41:52,904 --> 00:41:54,967
you're kinda greasy.

540
00:41:55,234 --> 00:41:56,998
- Stop staring at people like that.
- Hey.

541
00:41:57,316 --> 00:41:59,165
My gaze is my trademark.

542
00:42:01,492 --> 00:42:02,897
Flaming charisma.

543
00:42:02,922 --> 00:42:05,675
What? As if!

544
00:42:06,162 --> 00:42:07,448
You're gonna burn everyone.

545
00:42:07,473 --> 00:42:09,535
Yeah, right.

546
00:42:23,181 --> 00:42:26,435
My love story didn't get the
happy ending I had imagined.

547
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:30,883
But Kang-joon, let me warn you as a friend.

548
00:42:31,206 --> 00:42:32,206
Watch out.

549
00:42:32,286 --> 00:42:35,334
If you fall for me,
nothing will be able to help you get out!

550
00:42:58,057 --> 00:43:00,451
