1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,205
(Sweet Home)

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,658
(One More Time)

3
00:00:53,434 --> 00:00:54,601
Damn it!

4
00:01:20,256 --> 00:01:22,954
- Jae-min.
- What?

5
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:25,413
You're not doing anything strange, are you?

6
00:01:26,274 --> 00:01:27,416
Can't you see I'm studying?

7
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:30,109
- Don't draw comics again.
- Okay.

8
00:01:30,406 --> 00:01:34,192
You were always so smart!
If you start applying yourself now...

9
00:01:50,174 --> 00:01:52,657
Porn is like an eraser in my head.

10
00:01:54,654 --> 00:01:57,575
It cleanly erases all my worries.

11
00:02:10,727 --> 00:02:12,893
Hey, Jae-min. Let's go to the snack shop.

12
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:15,554
No. I'm tired.

13
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:17,324
You always say that!

14
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:19,034
Hey! Come on!

15
00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:20,796
Yamagishi Erica?

16
00:02:23,119 --> 00:02:25,508
Are you talking about that AV idol?
God, you saw porn again.

17
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,466
Right? You did, didn't you?

18
00:02:31,892 --> 00:02:33,407
This is my daily life.

19
00:02:33,798 --> 00:02:35,822
I'm a porn addict.

20
00:02:36,262 --> 00:02:39,237
I doze off at school
and watch porn at home.

21
00:02:39,812 --> 00:02:41,383
Then I sleep at school again.

22
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,836
- Give me your bag.
- Are you sure?

23
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,521
Okay, thanks.

24
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,143
You must sing with your chest...

25
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:30,124
while feeling each lyric with your heart.

26
00:04:02,288 --> 00:04:03,812
It's just the two of us right now.

27
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:06,061
Wh-what?

28
00:04:06,086 --> 00:04:07,545
We're the only ones left in class.

29
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:14,182
We have art next. Come on.

30
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:25,365
So, who will be our model today?

31
00:04:26,894 --> 00:04:28,306
No one wants to volunteer?

32
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:36,540
That means I should pick the school's most
popular girl with both brains and beauty...

33
00:04:36,565 --> 00:04:37,565
Me?

34
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:39,444
Ye-kyung, the class president.

35
00:04:39,643 --> 00:04:40,953
Oh, come on!

36
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:59,223
She's just a girl in my
class, but from some point on,

37
00:04:59,248 --> 00:05:02,300
I started to see her
in a different light.

38
00:05:36,686 --> 00:05:41,416
She added colors to my
black-and-white life.

39
00:06:01,678 --> 00:06:04,981
(Adult Trainee)

40
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:11,379
We should've skipped lunch
and had tteokbokki right away.

41
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:14,318
I know. Eating lunch just
makes you feel bloated.

42
00:06:17,102 --> 00:06:19,102
- We have to go now.
- Let's go after school.

43
00:06:20,318 --> 00:06:22,055
- Is that Ye-kyung?
- Holy crap!

44
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,870
That looks like Ye-kyung to me.

45
00:06:26,895 --> 00:06:28,199
Do you have a crush on her?

46
00:06:28,224 --> 00:06:29,390
Shut up.

47
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,940
- What's our next class?
- I'm against the idea of you two together.

48
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,715
Someone who masturbates like you is on
an entirely different level than her.

49
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:40,022
Bullshit.

50
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:49,370
All right. To celebrate the
beginning of the second semester,

51
00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:51,366
we're going to change our seats!

52
00:06:54,102 --> 00:06:55,260
Set it up.

53
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,160
We're finally going our separate ways.

54
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,100
I like sitting here though.

55
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:03,751
Who do you want to sit with?

56
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:07,547
It doesn't matter as long
as it's not Mi-kyung.

57
00:07:08,187 --> 00:07:09,324
- What?
- What?

58
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,854
What the hell? Gosh.

59
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:12,401
Ta-da!

60
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:14,912
This is a perfectly random system.

61
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,940
So you all must accept the results.

62
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:19,353
- All right.
- Got it?

63
00:07:22,892 --> 00:07:24,236
Start!

64
00:07:37,903 --> 00:07:42,030
Ye-kyung. Ye-kyung. Ye-kyung.
Please let me sit next to Ye-kyung.

65
00:07:42,146 --> 00:07:46,674
Please let me sit next to her.
Ye-kyung. Ye-kyung. Ye-kyung.

66
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,793
- (Park Ye-kyung, Seo Jae-min)
- Holy crap!

67
00:07:53,212 --> 00:07:54,942
I'm sitting next to Mi-kyung! Darn it!

68
00:08:09,326 --> 00:08:11,286
- You better watch it.
- Right back at you.

69
00:08:18,971 --> 00:08:20,542
- Hey, Jae-min.
- Yeah?

70
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,807
Aren't you gonna say hi?
We're partners now.

71
00:08:22,832 --> 00:08:24,213
Oh. Yeah, hi.

72
00:08:24,407 --> 00:08:26,105
I hope we get along.

73
00:08:30,766 --> 00:08:32,488
Yeah, me too.

74
00:08:35,656 --> 00:08:37,545
She said "we"!

75
00:09:02,318 --> 00:09:03,778
This smells really nice.

76
00:09:19,241 --> 00:09:21,685
Please! Please calm down!

77
00:09:22,888 --> 00:09:24,507
She's innocent!

Hey! Look at this!

81
00:10:26,303 --> 00:10:28,136
- Did you guys see this?
- What's that?

82
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,369
This was posted on our school's
Facebook group last night.

83
00:10:31,394 --> 00:10:32,673
What about it?

84
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,078
Great!

85
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:37,574
Wait a second!

86
00:10:39,302 --> 00:10:41,556
Shit, someone is
masturbating in the art room!

87
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:43,931
- Oh my god!
- Are you serious?

88
00:10:44,236 --> 00:10:47,061
Is he crazy? That's disgusting!
Are all boys Ike that?

89
00:10:47,086 --> 00:10:49,500
- Pervert! Why would he do that at school?
- Gimme that!

90
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,092
Ye-kyung, take a look at this.

91
00:10:52,587 --> 00:10:54,483
Hey, she's studying.
Talk to me instead.

92
00:10:54,508 --> 00:10:56,872
Piss off.
How could he do this at school?

93
00:10:58,718 --> 00:11:01,686
It's like he has an illness.
Can he even live a normal life?

94
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,419
Of course not.

95
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,988
I mean, people can masturbate,
but do they do that non-stop?

96
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,240
You need to be able to control yourself.

97
00:11:12,462 --> 00:11:15,806
They say people who get addicted
to something have no self-respect.

98
00:11:17,326 --> 00:11:20,541
It's not like he's a
wild animal or something.

99
00:11:21,576 --> 00:11:22,726
A wild animal?

100
00:11:24,564 --> 00:11:25,881
Seriously?

101
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:41,205
They say people who get addicted
to something have no self-respect.

102

Hello, friends.
It's me, your masturbating bro.

126
00:13:50,832 --> 00:13:53,310
How have you been?
Did you masturbate today, too?

127
00:13:53,948 --> 00:13:55,337
That's enough, you punk.

128
00:13:56,305 --> 00:13:58,317
For our rookies out there,
I'm going to explain

129
00:13:58,342 --> 00:14:00,875
the language of quitting masturbating.

130
00:14:01,552 --> 00:14:03,859
First off,
we're talking about quitting

131
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,766
unproductive masturbating
that is a waste of time.

132
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,244
If you masturbate every day,
you'll lose your self-respect

133
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,962
and not be able to do the
things you need to do.

134
00:14:13,056 --> 00:14:16,056
In order to do that,
you need some positive materials.

135
00:14:16,392 --> 00:14:21,284
I mean that you need to stay
away from things like porn.

136
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:24,113
After that, you'll reset.

137
00:14:24,911 --> 00:14:29,425
It's when you return to the beginning
because you can't hold back this period.

138
00:14:29,987 --> 00:14:37,169
And there are terrorists who send
porn to you to induce this reset.

139
00:14:38,576 --> 00:14:40,821
We call them "masturbate-ban."

140
00:14:42,022 --> 00:14:43,308
Those bastards...

141
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,268
(Time to calm down.)

142
00:14:46,138 --> 00:14:49,336
It's very difficult to quit masturbating.

143
00:14:49,778 --> 00:14:53,492
However, there are many people who
have achieved such a hard feat.

144
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:57,392
You'll cheer up if you
read our success stories.

Go check it out.

146
00:14:59,627 --> 00:15:02,010
Right now.

147
00:15:03,428 --> 00:15:05,602
It's already been a week
since I quit masturbating.

148
00:15:05,627 --> 00:15:07,118
I feel like I've grown a bit.

149
00:15:07,816 --> 00:15:09,702
It's been a month.
My vision got better, and

150
00:15:09,727 --> 00:15:11,695
after ten years,
I finally took my glasses off.

151
00:15:12,715 --> 00:15:17,080
It's been 50 days. I got into UC Berkeley.

152
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:22,030
It's been 80 days.
I can use magic to shorten space.

153
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,279
Use magic to shorten space?

154
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:28,841
It's been 100 days since
I quit masturbating.

155
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:33,184
I have more self-respect,
and my skin feels like a new born baby's.

156
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:39,277
I've been single for 35 years,
and I got an angel-like girlfriend!

157
00:15:39,545 --> 00:15:42,327
If you hold back for 100
days, even if you're

158
00:15:42,352 --> 00:15:44,831
a loser like me,
you'll get a girlfriend!

159
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:54,001
Just 100 days.

(Are you sure you want to permanently
delete these 45 items? Yes/No)

161

Just 100 days.

162
00:16:16,171 --> 00:16:19,464
Just like how a bear became
human after 100 days,

163
00:16:20,517 --> 00:16:23,983
I'll become someone who's
a good match for Ye-kyung.

164

(Day 1 of No Masturbating)

165
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:41,208
The effects of quitting masturbating
was bigger than I thought it'd be.

166
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:48,233
Why are you so fast?
You're like Magic Johnson.

167
00:16:48,721 --> 00:16:50,284
Yeah.

168
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:55,310
If you want to become a real man,
you should try quitting masturbating, too.

169
00:16:55,335 --> 00:16:56,335
Shut up!

170
00:16:56,642 --> 00:17:00,897
Look, it's biologically
impossible for men to quit porn.

171
00:17:00,922 --> 00:17:04,179
Stop wasting your dopamine on
useless things and save it.

172
00:17:09,035 --> 00:17:10,568
It's only been one day!

173
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,990
I'm gonna see how long you can last!

174
00:17:13,921 --> 00:17:18,507
(Day 2 of No Masturbating)

175
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:21,459
What are the positive effects
of quitting masturbating?

176
00:17:21,594 --> 00:17:23,423
You can concentrate better.

177
00:17:31,408 --> 00:17:32,874
How come he's so fast?

178
00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:34,728
It hasn't even been a minute!

(Day 3 of No Masturbating)

180
00:17:43,056 --> 00:17:45,190
- What is it?
- There's something outside.

181
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,385
It looks like our teachers are dating.

182
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,546
Seriously? You can see that?

183
00:17:53,095 --> 00:17:55,389
If you stop masturbating,
you'll have better eyesight.

184
00:17:55,757 --> 00:17:57,677
Your vision will be like a hawk's.

185
00:18:04,537 --> 00:18:05,854
It's truly amazing.

186

(Day 5 of No Masturbating)

187
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:31,696
My body became lighter,
so I'm as fast as lightning now.

188
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:33,219
Thank you so much!

189

Wow.

195
00:19:33,362 --> 00:19:35,162
Jae-min, your drawing is...

196
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,229
- It's bad?
- No, it's awesome.

197
00:19:38,475 --> 00:19:40,335
You mean it?
It's not weird?

198
00:19:40,616 --> 00:19:43,671
Yeah. You should become a webtoon artist.

199
00:19:44,882 --> 00:19:47,616
There are so many great artists nowadays.

200
00:19:48,124 --> 00:19:52,647
Your drawings kind of look like
Ha Il-geon's drawings.

201
00:19:52,863 --> 00:19:54,197
You know Ha Il-geon?

202
00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:57,089
Of course! Do you think all I do is study?

203
00:19:57,265 --> 00:19:58,733
I read webtoons, too, you know.

204
00:19:59,644 --> 00:20:01,080
But my mom is against it.

205
00:20:01,644 --> 00:20:03,963
She wants me to go college
so I can get a decent job.

206
00:20:04,983 --> 00:20:06,681
Your drawings are really unique though.

207
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,800
If you draw webtoons,
then I'll pay to read them.

209
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:16,381
- What?
- Can you draw me?

210
00:20:44,437 --> 00:20:47,294
- Hey, what's this?
- What? It looks just like you.

211
00:20:47,671 --> 00:20:49,194
Why do I look like this?

212
00:20:49,345 --> 00:20:50,662
Doesn't it look like you?

213
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,512
It doesn't look like me at all!

214
00:20:53,248 --> 00:20:55,946
The most fascinating thing
about quitting masturbating

215
00:20:55,971 --> 00:20:58,472
is that I feel like I've
gotten closer to Ye-kyung.

216
00:20:58,777 --> 00:21:00,665
- Draw it again.
- This is the best I can do.

217
00:21:01,478 --> 00:21:03,192
You're saying this looks like me?

218
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:05,648

It's been a week since
I stopped masturbating.

The girl I like accepted my
follow request on Instagram.

easily hold back for 100 days.

It's too early to celebrate now!

What the hell?

228
00:22:24,654 --> 00:22:28,702
This is nothing.

229
00:22:29,454 --> 00:22:32,117
Once it marks the 10th
day, prepare for the worst.

230
00:22:32,622 --> 00:22:35,312
We call that "withdrawal symptoms."

231

Winter is coming!

235

Back then, I had no idea...

236
00:23:04,598 --> 00:23:09,135
how terrible the symptoms would be.

You want some, don't you?
Try it.

239
00:23:30,818 --> 00:23:31,897
Touch me.

240
00:23:34,935 --> 00:23:36,521
Don't you want to get longer?

241
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,430
N-no.

242
00:23:38,763 --> 00:23:40,906
- Shake me.
- Touch me.

243
00:23:40,931 --> 00:23:43,131
- You want to get longer.
- No, I don't!

we talked about how we'll know the

other length as long as
these two don't touch.

250
00:25:03,403 --> 00:25:05,536
But why do you think I'm
going over this again?

251
00:25:05,561 --> 00:25:07,562
This will definitely be on the test.

252
00:25:07,867 --> 00:25:11,517
And let's not forget the law of cosine.

253
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:13,664
One more thing.

254
00:25:27,204 --> 00:25:29,418
Wake up. That's going to be on the exam.

255
00:25:29,985 --> 00:25:30,985
Okay.

256
00:25:34,895 --> 00:25:37,570
You can solve that with the law of cosine.

257
00:25:38,002 --> 00:25:39,485
A is B.

258

00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:01,875
Shut up.

- I've come this far.
- Come on.

So you've truly entered the
path of quitting masturbating.

Do you want to overcome it?
Then keep this in mind.

272
00:26:43,514 --> 00:26:46,983
If you want to get closer to her,
you must keep your distance from her.

273
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:50,393
Keep my distance from her?

00:26:59,675 --> 00:27:02,190
Don't touch her. Don't even let
your skin brush against hers.

277

Stay at least a meter away from her.

Why are you sitting so far away?

279
00:27:20,051 --> 00:27:22,244
I played basketball,
so I probably smell sweaty.

It's fine.

281
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:31,279
Better?

282
00:27:53,803 --> 00:27:55,390
It smells nice, right?

283
00:28:04,409 --> 00:28:05,809
Try harder next time.

284
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,745
Jae-min, what's this?
Please do better!

285
00:28:09,202 --> 00:28:10,202
Gosh.

It's just like I warned
you about this test.

Jae-min, are you free after school today?

295

Um... why?

296
00:28:45,584 --> 00:28:47,333
There's somewhere I want to go with you.

297
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,503
I didn't drag you here, did I?

298
00:28:57,403 --> 00:29:01,101
No. I like karaoke.

299
00:29:01,637 --> 00:29:02,906
Nice! Come on!

300
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:20,104

Don't touch her. Don't even let
your skin brush against hers.

"Just only you."

317

Why the heck do we have to
come here during this time?

318
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:20,101
This dance is honestly foul play!

319
00:31:30,386 --> 00:31:32,719
Jae-min, let's walk a while longer.

320
00:31:32,981 --> 00:31:34,163
- Okay?
- Okay.

321
00:31:37,678 --> 00:31:41,694
The more I try to stay away from
her, the closer I'm getting to her.

322
00:31:43,177 --> 00:31:46,377
But the closer I am to
her, the riskier it gets.

323
00:31:46,862 --> 00:31:50,179
Like Icarus who got too close to the sun.

324
00:32:01,974 --> 00:32:04,418
- Did the photos come out nicely?
- Yeah.

325
00:32:05,645 --> 00:32:07,573
- Y-You look pretty.
- What did you say?

326
00:32:09,045 --> 00:32:10,235
N-Nothing.

327
00:32:11,783 --> 00:32:12,783
Wow.

328
00:32:13,571 --> 00:32:15,906
Send these to me.
I'll upload them on Instagram.

329
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,481
- You better like them.
- Of course.

330
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:20,927
We're both following each other.

331
00:32:29,527 --> 00:32:31,956
Why? You don't think
someone like me would vape?

332
00:32:32,848 --> 00:32:33,848
No.

333
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:37,167
It's not that.

334
00:32:38,163 --> 00:32:40,266
Hey, don't pick this up.

335
00:32:40,847 --> 00:32:42,125
This is my last day, too.

336
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,564
Okay, I won't smoke.

337
00:32:45,735 --> 00:32:49,854
Up until middle school,
I would go out every day.

338
00:32:50,238 --> 00:32:51,238
Really?

339
00:32:51,367 --> 00:32:54,788
There wasn't anything I
liked or wanted to do.

340
00:32:56,198 --> 00:32:58,690
Honestly, I still have
no idea what to do.

341
00:32:59,568 --> 00:33:01,091
There's nothing I really want to be.

342
00:33:02,713 --> 00:33:04,451
Then why do you study so hard?

343
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,985
Well, I do that in order
to make time on my side.

344
00:33:09,665 --> 00:33:12,672
- What? - I won't figure out
what I want until later.

345
00:33:13,113 --> 00:33:14,858
And I could change my mind next year.

346
00:33:16,712 --> 00:33:20,916
But I need to do my best to
win this fight against time

347
00:33:20,941 --> 00:33:24,920
in order to gain more time
and opportunities later on.

348
00:33:26,195 --> 00:33:27,195
That's cool.

349
00:33:27,648 --> 00:33:30,356
It's not. I'm dying trying to
hold myself back from having fun.

350
00:33:37,525 --> 00:33:40,199
I won't lose this fight with myself either.

351
00:33:41,997 --> 00:33:44,274
Not until I become someone
who is good enough for you.

352
00:33:48,886 --> 00:33:50,211
Hey, Jae-min.

353
00:33:51,412 --> 00:33:52,610
Can you draw me?

354
00:33:53,477 --> 00:33:54,477
Um...

355
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:58,369
I guess.

356
00:34:06,215 --> 00:34:09,135
Hey, you better do a proper job this time.

357
00:34:11,011 --> 00:34:12,011
Alright.

358
00:34:33,299 --> 00:34:34,299
What's wrong?

359
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:48,009
Jae-min, what do you
think about the color of my lips?

360
00:35:06,493 --> 00:35:08,476
Do you want to know what they taste like?

361
00:35:17,391 --> 00:35:19,756
Let's stop being friends.

362
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:51,915
Don't tell me...

363
00:35:52,738 --> 00:35:53,738
I reset.

364
00:36:01,558 --> 00:36:04,367
