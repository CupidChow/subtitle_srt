1
00:00:00,762 --> 00:00:06,253
It's normal for the ring
to go outward like this.

2
00:00:06,442 --> 00:00:10,998
The protruding part is the air bag.

3
00:00:11,351 --> 00:00:14,509
This air bag is filled with semen.

4
00:00:14,816 --> 00:00:17,562
Hold this place and take out the air.

5
00:00:18,026 --> 00:00:22,516
Sex education for someone who's never
dated before is totally useless.

6
00:00:23,659 --> 00:00:27,071
How would it feel if it was useful?

7
00:00:28,607 --> 00:00:30,536
Would it be like a new world?

8
00:00:30,618 --> 00:00:32,800
Contraception is the easiest
way to prevent sexually

9
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,221
transmitted diseases.
It's not an option, but a necessity.

10
00:00:35,384 --> 00:00:37,273
Your bodies are very precious.

11
00:00:37,467 --> 00:00:42,840
My body is precious, so I want my
first time to be with a guy like him.

12
00:00:43,758 --> 00:00:44,758
First love.

13
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:46,266
First kiss.

14
00:00:47,012 --> 00:00:48,012
First...

15
00:01:16,263 --> 00:01:21,167
Na-eun, I'll protect your precious body.

16
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:25,640
Let's use all of these together.

17
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,311
Okay, after you open it,
check the front and back.

18
00:01:36,336 --> 00:01:39,283
Check for any tears.

19
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,001
And just like that...

20
00:01:43,108 --> 00:01:45,399
Kang-joon is a member
of Boy of the Month, a

21
00:01:45,424 --> 00:01:47,664
rookie idol group
composed of handsome guys.

22
00:01:48,105 --> 00:01:52,597
He's in charge of cuteness in the group.

23
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:56,480
Unfortunately, the debut stage
soon became a retirement stage due

24
00:01:56,505 --> 00:01:59,533
to the controversy over the school
violence of the main vocalist.

25
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:03,586
So they were literally just
the "boys of the month."

26
00:02:04,464 --> 00:02:06,503
But I, Son Na-eun,

27
00:02:06,998 --> 00:02:10,386
became a huge fan of his cute nature

28
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:15,149
in that short time.

29
00:02:15,491 --> 00:02:17,332
Hey, Na-fatty!

30
00:02:19,447 --> 00:02:21,050
I told you not to call me that!

31
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:22,868
Wanna go eat after class?

32
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,322
I'm on a diet.

33
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,161
You always say that.

34
00:02:27,186 --> 00:02:28,623
I'm serious this time.

35
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,448
I'm going to be born again after
losing 10 kilograms of body fat.

36
00:02:31,683 --> 00:02:34,277
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

37
00:02:34,638 --> 00:02:38,630
- Are you kidding me?
- I can't believe this.

38
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,358
Put it on so that it doesn't
rip and push it down.

39
00:02:44,862 --> 00:02:47,744
And that's how you wear it.

40
00:03:05,282 --> 00:03:08,393
(Adult Trainee)

41
00:03:08,418 --> 00:03:09,904
(Yummy Chicken:
Diet Ramen)

42
00:03:16,985 --> 00:03:19,953
Gosh, you eat so well.

43
00:03:20,178 --> 00:03:21,496
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

44
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:24,030
Sung-mi is gonna set me up
on a blind date next week.

45
00:03:24,055 --> 00:03:25,753
If it goes well, I'll hook you up, too.

46
00:03:26,027 --> 00:03:28,272
We'll be seniors next year.
Why are you dating now?

47
00:03:28,297 --> 00:03:30,564
Seriously? Is that what you think?

48
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:35,350
What if cutie Kang-joon was your
blind date? You don't be interested?

49
00:03:42,457 --> 00:03:43,607
Look at you smiling.

50
00:03:43,632 --> 00:03:45,513
God, I feel ridiculous
for even saying that.

51
00:03:46,205 --> 00:03:49,270
I think it would be more realistic for
us to get a perfect score on the SATs.

52
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,535
- Hey!
- What?

53
00:03:51,059 --> 00:03:53,750
By any chance, is it just you two?

54
00:03:55,828 --> 00:03:56,828
Yeah.

55
00:03:57,447 --> 00:03:59,161
Then do you want to eat ramen together?

56
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:02,696
I came with my friend, too,
but there are no empty tables.

57
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:06,043
There are a lot of empty tables.

58
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,017
He just went to the store.
He's gonna bring a lot of food.

59
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:15,394
- And you know that Mark Meal, right?
- Of course.

60
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:18,553
My friend is really good at making it.
It'll be delicious.

61
00:04:21,211 --> 00:04:22,719
I'm a bit uncomfortable.

62
00:04:24,493 --> 00:04:25,993
Just this once.

63
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:40,831
Hey, let's go to coin karaoke.

64
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:45,118
- Are you paying?
- Of course.

65
00:04:45,444 --> 00:04:47,436
- Isn't this funny?
- What are they doing?

66
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:50,056
It cracks me up!

67
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:52,687
Isn't that Na-fatty?

68
00:04:52,864 --> 00:04:54,798
- Yeah, I think so.
- Right?

69
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:59,502
- Na-fatty!
- Na-fatty!

70
00:05:02,517 --> 00:05:03,850
It really is her!

71
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,160
It's so nice to see you here!

72
00:05:07,335 --> 00:05:12,534
(Kang Go-eun: God-like
looks, dog-like personality)

73
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:14,041
Who did you come here with?

74
00:05:14,688 --> 00:05:17,331
- Ja-sun.
- Ja-sun.

75
00:05:17,356 --> 00:05:19,388
Oh, the girl with the weird hairstyle?

76
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:24,530
- Look at her teeth.
- What the heck?

77
00:05:24,555 --> 00:05:26,498
She's probably saving it for later.

78
00:05:26,523 --> 00:05:30,534
Stop eating, will you?
You're even eating lip tint now?

79
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:33,681
- Goodness.
- Stop eating already.

80
00:05:33,706 --> 00:05:36,430
If you were gonna do your makeup,
you should've done it properly.

81
00:05:37,044 --> 00:05:39,529
You should contour your jaw line.

82
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,557
You have a huge double chin.

83
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:47,114
Doesn't she look like Jack Black?

84
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,650
You're right! She looks exactly like him!

85
00:05:49,675 --> 00:05:51,978
- They look so similar!
- Right?

86
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:54,520
- That's enough.
- Did you see that?

87
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:58,676
She has a triple chin!

88
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:01,606
- It's like pork belly!
- How can anyone have three chins?

89
00:06:01,631 --> 00:06:04,158
You'd better now.
I'm on an empty stomach.

90
00:06:04,286 --> 00:06:05,676
"I'm on an empty stomach."

91
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,728
You're on an empty stomach?

92
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:11,468
- Then what's this?
- Oh my god.

93
00:06:11,493 --> 00:06:13,001
Is it a portable airbag?

94
00:06:13,592 --> 00:06:15,449
Even if you get in an
accident, you won't die.

95
00:06:15,474 --> 00:06:17,674
I said, that's enough, you tramp.

96
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:24,703
What?

97
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:38,163
Repeat what you just said.

98
00:06:38,372 --> 00:06:39,999
What did you call me?

99
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:43,033
Did you know your other nickname
besides "tramp" is "bus"?

100
00:06:43,146 --> 00:06:44,836
I heard all the boys rode you once.

101
00:06:44,861 --> 00:06:46,521
You're not even a countryside bus!

102
00:06:46,546 --> 00:06:48,394
Good for you for being such a huge-ass bus!

103
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:50,700
- Hey!
- Hey!

104
00:07:11,054 --> 00:07:13,459
Hey, Na-fatty. What are you doing?

105
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,139
- What is she doing?
- Is there something behind us?

106
00:07:19,342 --> 00:07:22,405
Anyway, the next time you do your
makeup, do it properly.

107
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,916
- Contour your jawline, okay?
- Please.

108
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,577
You need some extra contour. Later.

109
00:07:27,602 --> 00:07:29,469
- Bye.
- See you at school.

110
00:07:29,494 --> 00:07:32,392
- Make sure you do your makeup.
- Bye, Na-fatty.

111
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:33,417
Bye.

112
00:07:33,594 --> 00:07:36,205
I've never seen anyone with a triple chin.

113
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:39,591
Left three times, right three times.

114
00:07:39,616 --> 00:07:41,657
That way, the sauce can mix well.

115
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,357
Once you eat this, you won't be
able to eat your mom's cooking.

116
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:46,948
- It smells so good.
- It needs to be microwaved for exactly...

117
00:07:46,973 --> 00:07:48,583
3 minutes and 30 seconds.

118
00:07:48,608 --> 00:07:51,079
- It'll be complete then.
- It looks so good!

119
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:53,152
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Oh, Na-eun!

120
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:09,604
- Hello.
- Why is this seat so tiny?

121
00:08:09,751 --> 00:08:12,727
- We should eat somewhere else.
- Where?

122
00:08:12,752 --> 00:08:15,230
Let's go. You saw how I made it, right?
That's how you do it.

123
00:08:15,255 --> 00:08:17,780
- This table is too small.
- What do you mean? It's perfect.

124
00:08:17,805 --> 00:08:20,397
- Wait a minute! Okay, okay!
- Bye!

125
00:08:20,422 --> 00:08:21,809
- Hold on!
- See ya!

126
00:08:25,474 --> 00:08:28,307
- They weren't bad-looking.
- Forget it.

127
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,947
Just look at them. They're not even tall.
Only their heads are big.

128
00:08:31,972 --> 00:08:34,838
They look like lollipops.
They're freaking disproportionate.

129
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:36,921
Ja-sun, let's raise our standards, okay?

130
00:08:37,696 --> 00:08:40,275
Look who's talking.
You're the one who caked your face.

131
00:08:40,841 --> 00:08:42,908
- Did you put makeup on?
- No!

132
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:44,066
Gosh!

133
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:45,511
Hey, I have to go on a diet.

134
00:08:45,536 --> 00:08:48,036
Why did they buy so much?
It's not like we can throw them away.

135
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,896
This is bad for the environment.

136
00:08:50,483 --> 00:08:51,483
Gosh.

137
00:08:57,889 --> 00:08:59,048
This is freaking delicious.

138
00:08:59,073 --> 00:09:02,773
Hey, let's do mukbang on YouTube.
You'll be a hit!

139
00:09:07,703 --> 00:09:09,503
You're home.
Come and eat.

140
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:20,355
Come on. It hasn't even been a day
since she said she's going on a diet.

141
00:09:20,605 --> 00:09:22,764
She won't even be human if
she eats pork belly now.

142
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,958
Right? Don't you agree?

143
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,651
This is your favorite.
Are you sure you're not going to eat?

144
00:09:28,676 --> 00:09:30,743
You shouldn't starve like that.

145
00:09:30,768 --> 00:09:34,237
You need to eat some greasy
food to be smart and study well.

146
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:52,214
I know what it takes like.
I already ate it before.

147
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:58,093
You eat it because you
know what it tastes like!

148
00:09:58,118 --> 00:10:00,627
Honestly,
you only had 1,000 calories today.

149
00:10:02,252 --> 00:10:04,474
No, Son Na-eun! You must hold back!

150
00:10:05,514 --> 00:10:06,776
Don't be a pig!

151
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:11,689
If you wrap it in organic vegetables,
you won't gain any weight. Here, open wide.

152
00:10:11,714 --> 00:10:13,829
What are you doing?
I'm not going to eat.

153
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:16,870
If it's delicious, it's zero calories.
Open up. Come on, try it.

154
00:10:17,093 --> 00:10:18,093
Knock, knock.

155
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:31,338
- It's delicious, isn't it?
- Yeah.

156
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:33,047
- Eat a lot.
- Wow.

157
00:10:33,248 --> 00:10:35,057
I'm jealous of your thick legs.

158
00:10:35,082 --> 00:10:38,036
With one low kick,
you'll be able to break someone's bones.

159
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:40,071
Shut up, beanpole.

160
00:10:40,096 --> 00:10:41,699
Mom, make her do martial arts.

161
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,359
Look at her arms. She doesn't work
out, but she has mean triceps.

162
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:47,974
At that rate, she'll be able to bench press
500 kilograms in all three areas.

163
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:49,599
- I'm done!
- Just eat.

164
00:10:49,876 --> 00:10:53,083
- Once you go to college, you'll lose
weight. - Why didn't you lose weight then?

165
00:10:53,108 --> 00:10:56,633
Because I had you two!
When I was young, I wasn't like you.

166
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:01,677
Yeah, right. I'm fat because of your DNA!

167
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,738
This isn't the time for
you to worry about dieting.

168
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,382
Just eat and study!

169
00:11:05,407 --> 00:11:07,781
Don't end up skinny and failing
thrice like your brother.

170
00:11:07,806 --> 00:11:09,721
Why are you bringing me into this?

171
00:11:09,746 --> 00:11:13,121
She keeps saying she'll go on a
diet because you keep provoking her.

172
00:11:13,146 --> 00:11:16,331
- All I did was say I'm jealous of her.
- Shut up and go study.

173
00:11:16,356 --> 00:11:17,722
Take a look at her body.

174
00:11:17,747 --> 00:11:19,714
That's enough!
Turn the massage chair off.

175
00:11:21,188 --> 00:11:24,323
Why'd you stop eating? Eat some more.
I grilled all of this.

176
00:11:37,547 --> 00:11:40,618
'Calorie, Calorie, Calorie.'

177
00:11:40,643 --> 00:11:43,310
'Are you eating black bean noodles now?'

178
00:11:43,943 --> 00:11:46,625
'Calorie, Calorie, Calorie.'

179
00:11:47,231 --> 00:11:49,453
'How about a glass of beer?'

180
00:11:50,012 --> 00:11:52,591
'Calorie, Calorie, Calorie.'

181
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,751
'I just stuffed myself with pork belly.'

182
00:11:57,407 --> 00:11:59,274
'Calorie, Calorie, Calorie.'

183
00:12:01,508 --> 00:12:02,762
Darn it.

184
00:12:06,816 --> 00:12:08,664
I shouldn't have eaten it.

185
00:12:35,728 --> 00:12:37,011
(Son Na-eun)

186
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:57,101
(Na-eun, don't go on a diet.
Your hips are a masterpiece. - J)

187
00:13:17,001 --> 00:13:19,525
Is his name J?
Or maybe his last name starts with J.

188
00:13:21,116 --> 00:13:22,814
Don't tell me it's Jung Joon-ha.

189
00:13:23,425 --> 00:13:25,981
(Jung Joon-ha)

190
00:13:26,191 --> 00:13:28,463
No. He's not my type.

191
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,270
- Kim Sung-joon?
- (Kim Sung-joon)

192
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:37,115
He looks like a squid.

193
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:42,820
- (Park Jin-hyuk)
- Don't tell me it's Park Jin-hyuk!

194
00:13:42,845 --> 00:13:45,186
Gosh, he's like an octopus.

195
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:52,003
All the guys with "J" in their names
look like they came out of the sea.

196
00:13:52,522 --> 00:13:55,935
Gosh, speaking of seafood, I'm hungry.

197
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,831
Wow, are your fingers really that long?

198
00:14:10,636 --> 00:14:12,081
Your hands are really pretty.

199
00:14:20,457 --> 00:14:23,147
What? Are they really?

200
00:14:24,954 --> 00:14:26,382
I do have slender hands.

201
00:14:28,783 --> 00:14:31,195
(Jin Beom)

202
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:37,002
(3rd place in the high school
fashion audition program)

203
00:14:37,027 --> 00:14:38,201
(Studied abroad)

204
00:14:38,226 --> 00:14:40,053
(Greasy like butter)

205
00:14:41,574 --> 00:14:46,630
Dude, girls don't like flowers or dolls.

206
00:14:48,027 --> 00:14:50,050
Then what do they like?

207
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:51,891
They like...

208
00:14:53,771 --> 00:14:55,886
perfume.

209
00:14:58,688 --> 00:14:59,688
J?

210
00:15:02,757 --> 00:15:06,542
Don't tell me the most popular and
stylish guy in our school is J!

211
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,057
Then again, since he studied
abroad, he could be more

212
00:15:10,082 --> 00:15:12,396
attracted to glamorous girls
like me than skinny girls.

213
00:15:16,117 --> 00:15:17,348
That's impossible.

214
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:21,542
(Mid-term practical test:
"Playing instruments that I'm good at."

215
00:15:28,114 --> 00:15:29,114
Next.

216
00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:38,314
Gosh, you should've practiced.

217
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:40,683
No. 24. Son Na-eun.

218
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,985
She brought a guitar?
That's random.

219
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,051
Did she steal her brother's?

220
00:15:48,744 --> 00:15:53,385
- Does she even know how to play it?
- 1, 2. 1, 2, 3, 4.

221
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:35,875
Bravo!

222
00:16:42,648 --> 00:16:45,591
She brought a guitar just to show off.

223
00:16:46,961 --> 00:16:50,436
- Then again, she has to be
good at one thing. - Yeah.

224
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:57,359
Right on!

225
00:16:58,616 --> 00:16:59,751
Yes!

226
00:17:01,727 --> 00:17:03,984
I hate dodgeball the most.

227
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,701
Because it's time for
Go-eun to mess around.

228
00:17:07,137 --> 00:17:08,137
Out!

229
00:17:08,443 --> 00:17:09,443
One more time!

230
00:17:16,984 --> 00:17:19,404
Okay! Nice blocking!

231
00:17:24,896 --> 00:17:26,070
(First J Candidate)

232
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:29,343
Na-eun, don't go on a diet.
Your hips are a masterpiece.

233
00:17:30,888 --> 00:17:32,174
Give it to Go-eun.

234
00:17:52,904 --> 00:17:55,348
- Her nose is bleeding.
- Poor thing.

235
00:18:01,088 --> 00:18:03,770
Gosh. Kang Go-eun, that awful witch.

236
00:18:04,504 --> 00:18:06,084
I thought my nose was broke.

237
00:18:10,082 --> 00:18:14,645
But did Jin Beom block the ball for me?

238
00:18:40,383 --> 00:18:41,692
Oh my gosh.

239
00:18:42,684 --> 00:18:44,772
How could he look so
cute when he's sleeping?

240
00:18:46,523 --> 00:18:47,523
Look at his skin.

241
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:49,829
Is he a baby or what?

242
00:18:50,368 --> 00:18:53,011
He looks like he won't even
sweat a bit during the summer.

243
00:19:00,975 --> 00:19:03,300
Doesn't Kang-joon look so cute today too?

244
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:05,104
Are we allowed to do this during class?

245
00:19:05,129 --> 00:19:07,231
We can't help it if we wanna see him.

246
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:19,991
Gosh, I don't think my nose
will stop bleeding all day long.

247
00:19:20,178 --> 00:19:24,283
- Let's go!
- Come on!

248
00:19:25,776 --> 00:19:27,483
Are you sure Kang-joon is here?

249
00:19:27,508 --> 00:19:29,705
- What the heck?
- What are you doing?

250
00:19:31,744 --> 00:19:33,894
Huh? Just getting some sun.

251
00:19:34,906 --> 00:19:37,549
- Have you seen Kang-joon?
- No, I haven't.

252
00:19:39,488 --> 00:19:41,273
- Bye.
- Sorry.

253
00:19:41,298 --> 00:19:44,444
- Let's come back next time.
- I thought he'd be here.

254
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:03,101
Thanks.

255
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:06,929
It's nothing.

256
00:20:09,101 --> 00:20:10,101
By the way,

257
00:20:11,283 --> 00:20:13,021
you're really popular.

258
00:20:15,862 --> 00:20:17,139
And you're really talented.

259
00:20:17,742 --> 00:20:20,602
- What?
- You're good at the guitar.

260
00:20:21,575 --> 00:20:22,717
No.

261
00:20:23,344 --> 00:20:27,051
I'm not that good at it.

262
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,500
Do you want this?

263
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:39,558
Huh?

264
00:20:41,331 --> 00:20:44,213
- Why would you give me that?
- Because I liked your guitar performance.

265
00:20:44,238 --> 00:20:46,202
Consider it a gift from a fan.

266
00:20:47,036 --> 00:20:48,036
A fan?

267
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:52,899
Thanks!

268
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,726
I should thank you, Na-eun.

269
00:21:04,302 --> 00:21:07,373
Kang-joon knows my name!

270
00:21:12,642 --> 00:21:13,642
J?

271
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:15,957
Isn't it Jin Beom?

272
00:21:16,463 --> 00:21:18,201
- Definitely not.
- Then who is it?

273
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:22,502
Maybe one of the guys
on the wrestling team?

274
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:24,837
They really wanted you to join.

275
00:21:25,475 --> 00:21:28,237
They could be approaching you
through this creative method.

276
00:21:30,742 --> 00:21:32,052
But still,

277
00:21:33,306 --> 00:21:35,681
would they give me such
an expensive perfume?

278
00:21:36,455 --> 00:21:37,455
Gosh.

279
00:21:38,775 --> 00:21:41,227
But where'd you get those lollipops from?

280
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:46,263
It's a secret.
Let's just say a boy gave it to me.

281
00:21:46,862 --> 00:21:51,640
- Kang-joon! You're so handsome!
- Please wear this once!

282
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:55,366
- Oh my gosh! He's so cute!
- They eventually got him.

283
00:21:56,331 --> 00:22:00,111
- His popularity hasn't died down yet.
- Thanks.

284
00:22:02,053 --> 00:22:05,283
You know it's impossible to close your
left eye and poke your right cheek, right?

285
00:22:05,308 --> 00:22:07,888
Close your left eye and
poke your right cheek?

286
00:22:10,306 --> 00:22:12,639
- Oh my goodness!
- Thanks.

287
00:22:14,463 --> 00:22:16,709
Kang-joon, can you give me your autograph?

288
00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:20,950
- Where?
- Um, here!

289
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,628
- Your PE uniform?
- Yes!

290
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:23,909
Sure.

291
00:22:24,124 --> 00:22:25,132
What's your name?

292
00:22:25,157 --> 00:22:27,090
- It's Myung-ji!
- Myung-ji.

293
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:34,402
- Even his autograph is cool!
- Oh my god.

294
00:22:34,427 --> 00:22:36,006
Kang-joon is J?

295
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:39,057
That's totally impossible.

296
00:22:39,982 --> 00:22:41,249
Could I be so sure?

297
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,087
Nothing is impossible in the world.

298
00:22:50,223 --> 00:22:54,397
Na-eun, don't go on a diet.
Your hips are a masterpiece.

299
00:22:59,027 --> 00:23:02,693
"Na-eun, don't go on a diet.
Your hips are a masterpiece."

300
00:23:03,254 --> 00:23:06,770
Finally, a guy who noticed my
charming hips has appeared!

301
00:23:06,795 --> 00:23:11,671
Guys with poor tastes
would never notice them!

302
00:23:12,254 --> 00:23:15,628
Only sensible guys like Beom
or Kang-joon would know.

303
00:23:21,455 --> 00:23:23,820
(Strong suspects to be J)

304
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:28,046
(1. Jin Beom
2. Choi Kang-joon)

305
00:23:28,071 --> 00:23:32,645
When you called my name,
I came to you and became a flower.

306
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:36,245
Kang-joon, I'm already your flower!

307
00:23:37,004 --> 00:23:40,130
A flower that wants to dig
through your nostrils with scent.

308
00:24:04,462 --> 00:24:05,462
Kang-joon.

309
00:24:11,636 --> 00:24:12,636
Na-eun,

310
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:14,219
don't go on a diet.

311
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:19,077
Your hips are a masterpiece.

312
00:24:28,621 --> 00:24:29,621
It's good.

313
00:24:31,743 --> 00:24:32,973
You should try some, too.

314
00:24:35,747 --> 00:24:36,747
Not that.

315
00:24:44,791 --> 00:24:45,791
Na-eun,

316
00:24:46,467 --> 00:24:49,086
I don't eat one candy at a time.

317
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:51,709
I eat two at a time.

318
00:24:58,183 --> 00:24:59,699
I eat three at a time.

319
00:25:00,783 --> 00:25:04,679
We melted all that candy all day long.

320
00:25:18,874 --> 00:25:19,874
Huh?

321
00:25:21,757 --> 00:25:22,757
I'm not ready.

322
00:25:25,189 --> 00:25:26,935
Not yet.

323
00:25:28,304 --> 00:25:30,828
Actually, I've been ready for a long time.

324
00:25:30,853 --> 00:25:32,687
You said you're going on a diet!

325
00:25:32,943 --> 00:25:37,311
- I can't believe you!
- That hurts!

326
00:25:37,823 --> 00:25:41,298
You said you were on a diet,
but you ate a bag of candy at night?

327
00:25:41,678 --> 00:25:44,728
It's because I was sleepy while studying
for exams. I needed something sweet.

328
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:46,447
Just brush your teeth and go to bed!

329
00:25:47,226 --> 00:25:48,293
Just leave that.

330
00:25:48,765 --> 00:25:51,005
You said you don't get fat
eating organic vegetables.

331
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,689
Go ahead. Enjoy.

332
00:25:53,224 --> 00:25:54,565
Goodness.

333
00:26:09,186 --> 00:26:12,130
- 6, 7. Time for your arms.
- Raise them up.

334
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:14,514
- 1, 2.
- To the front.

335
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:16,581
- 3, 4.
- To the side.

336
00:26:16,606 --> 00:26:18,819
- 5, 6.
- Lower them.

337
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:23,982
7, 8. Time for your arms.
1, 2, 3, 4.

338
00:26:40,234 --> 00:26:42,435
- Hey. Hey!
- You scared me. What?

339
00:26:42,714 --> 00:26:47,753
Don't tell me you think Kang-joon is J.

340
00:26:48,514 --> 00:26:50,863
Come on! That's not even
possible in your dreams!

341
00:26:51,287 --> 00:26:55,183
J... J... It'd be more possible for
the earth science teacher to be him.

342
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:58,219
- Gosh, what are you saying?
- All righty.

343
00:26:58,244 --> 00:27:01,090
The final evaluation will be a group dance.

344
00:27:01,115 --> 00:27:02,574
- What?
- Awww.

345
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:05,338
What's up with the reactions?
You know this is important, right?

346
00:27:05,969 --> 00:27:08,420
How will the groups be chosen?
By the order of our numbers?

347
00:27:08,445 --> 00:27:10,154
To be fair, we're going to draw lots.

348
00:27:10,481 --> 00:27:11,918
Four people per group.

349
00:27:11,943 --> 00:27:16,876
But if you're confident, you're welcome
to do individual or couple dances.

350
00:27:19,742 --> 00:27:21,647
God, why are even doing this?

351
00:27:23,231 --> 00:27:25,441
(Drawing lots for the final
performance evaluation)

352
00:27:38,526 --> 00:27:39,526
What's up?

353
00:27:41,822 --> 00:27:43,536
We're totally screwed.

354
00:27:44,286 --> 00:27:46,810
Why the hell does someone like
her need to be in our group?

355
00:27:47,089 --> 00:27:48,422
This is so annoying.

356
00:27:49,689 --> 00:27:51,956
No way! Kang-joon is in our group!

357
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:53,708
Is fate playing a joke on me?

358
00:27:54,343 --> 00:27:56,485
Jin Beom and Kang-joon?

359
00:27:58,554 --> 00:28:00,363
Both J candidates are in my group!

360
00:28:03,085 --> 00:28:05,331
There's no meat in this beef side dish.

361
00:28:05,588 --> 00:28:07,429
Do they expect us to eat this or what?

362
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:10,795
Don't you think so?

363
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:15,341
Na-eun? Hello?
Who am I talking to?

364
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,590
Huh?

365
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,994
What are you thinking about?
I really hate today's lunch.

366
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,342
Did you see him?

367
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,771
Hey, it's Choi Kang-joon!

368
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:37,967
- Can I join you guys?
- Of course!

369
00:28:39,233 --> 00:28:40,233
Have a seat.

370
00:28:42,436 --> 00:28:43,436
Thanks.

371
00:28:50,413 --> 00:28:53,469
I was thinking about it,
and you know our PE evaluation?

372
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:56,785
There are two girls and
two guys in our group.

373
00:28:57,912 --> 00:29:00,872
So how about we do a couple dance?

374
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:04,711
Excuse me.
A couple dance?

375
00:29:08,242 --> 00:29:10,098
I really suck at dancing.

376
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,774
No, it's fine.
I used to suck at dancing, too.

377
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,071
- You?
- Yeah.

378
00:29:14,096 --> 00:29:15,096
No way.

379
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:16,510
Did you think...

380
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,348
I was born into the world like this?

381
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:24,424
You're hilarious, Kang-joon!

382
00:29:31,075 --> 00:29:32,733
Or I could teach you.

383
00:29:33,466 --> 00:29:35,266
Okay? Come on, let's do it.

384
00:29:39,234 --> 00:29:40,234
Sure.

385
00:29:40,726 --> 00:29:41,726
Yes!

386
00:29:45,835 --> 00:29:48,327
I think Kang-joon is J.

387
00:29:49,411 --> 00:29:51,395
You saw the way he sweetly looked at me!

388
00:29:51,661 --> 00:29:54,407
Why else would he ask to
do a couple dance with me?

389
00:29:54,432 --> 00:29:57,528
It's because he wants to touch my hips!

390
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,946
Hey, have some conscience and
don't mess with Kang-joon.

391
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,990
I almost hit your philtrum. Gosh.

392
00:30:09,631 --> 00:30:12,297
Then who do you think J is?

393
00:30:12,857 --> 00:30:15,365
That again? I'm sick and
tired of talking about this.

394
00:30:16,012 --> 00:30:17,996
What if this is just a delusion?

395
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,903
You don't hear voices, do you?

396
00:30:19,928 --> 00:30:21,990
You saw the perfume and card yourself.

397
00:30:22,015 --> 00:30:23,787
Did you gift them to yourself?

398
00:30:23,812 --> 00:30:24,812
What?

399
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,426
I'm just afraid you'll take
the SATs in the mental ward.

400
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,563
As your friend,
I'm genuinely concerned for you.

401
00:30:31,702 --> 00:30:32,702
What should we watch?

402
00:30:33,575 --> 00:30:35,188
- Something romantic?
- Yes.

403
00:30:35,213 --> 00:30:36,213
Got it.

404
00:30:36,673 --> 00:30:38,109
- This one?
- No.

405
00:30:38,134 --> 00:30:39,134
No? That one?

406
00:30:41,808 --> 00:30:43,617
What? You don't have a condom?

407
00:30:43,931 --> 00:30:45,597
Not right now.

408
00:30:46,098 --> 00:30:47,962
I'll just take it out before I do it.

409
00:30:48,553 --> 00:30:51,735
- Oh my god! They're going to do it!
- Be quiet!

410
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,500
I'm really good at controlling myself.

411
00:30:54,425 --> 00:30:56,599
You can't even make ramen properly.
I'm out.

412
00:30:56,624 --> 00:30:58,442
Okay, fine. Wait here.

413
00:31:00,781 --> 00:31:02,717
That's Kang Go-eun's voice, right?

414
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,340
Hush!

415
00:31:05,032 --> 00:31:07,072
I guess that's what she always does here.

416
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:10,723
Last time, I found a used condom in here.

417
00:31:10,748 --> 00:31:12,081
- For real?
- Yeah!

418
00:31:15,956 --> 00:31:16,956
Hello?

419
00:31:17,225 --> 00:31:19,749
Yeah, my boyfriend stepped out.
Let me tell you real quick.

420
00:31:20,215 --> 00:31:23,262
I'm in the same group as Kang-joon.

421
00:31:25,386 --> 00:31:29,395
Yeah! That idol.
The one with the white face.

422
00:31:29,796 --> 00:31:33,447
This Saturday, we're going to get
together at my place and practice dancing.

423
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:37,959
I'm going to get him drunk and...

424
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:41,328
sleep with him.

425
00:31:43,274 --> 00:31:46,032
- Keep it down!
- He's not that great.

426
00:31:46,719 --> 00:31:49,234
If I make up my mind to seduce
him, he'll fall for me.

427
00:31:49,259 --> 00:31:50,259
That damn witch!

428
00:31:50,651 --> 00:31:52,770
It's about time I got a new boyfriend.

429
00:31:52,795 --> 00:31:54,873
I've been drawn to cute guys lately.

430
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:18,438
Kang-joon, who really is your mother?

431
00:32:19,172 --> 00:32:20,926
I want to get on my
knees and bow to her.

432
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,273
That was amazing!

433
00:32:32,735 --> 00:32:34,750
What do you think?
It's not that hard, right?

434
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,062
Not at all.

435
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:40,033
I'm screwed. I can't pass this evaluation.

436
00:32:41,229 --> 00:32:44,650
You can practice while watching
the YouTube video I sent you.

437
00:32:44,675 --> 00:32:46,348
But we're pairing up for the dance.

438
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:49,204
We should choose our partner.

439
00:32:50,246 --> 00:32:51,246
Right.

440
00:32:51,794 --> 00:32:52,969
How should we decide?

441
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:56,583
I want to be with you.

442
00:32:57,539 --> 00:32:59,459
- Um...
- Can't we partner up?

443
00:32:59,484 --> 00:33:02,112
Why the hell is she sticking
out her lips like that?

444
00:33:02,137 --> 00:33:05,580
No matter what kind of
tricks you have up your

445
00:33:05,612 --> 00:33:09,231
sleeve, Kang-joon, my J,
has only me in his heart.

446
00:33:16,473 --> 00:33:18,416
Hey, why aren't you eating?

447
00:33:18,649 --> 00:33:21,434
I can't eat the drumstick
because it looks so pretty.

448
00:33:21,803 --> 00:33:23,144
I'll save it for last.

449
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,963
I wouldn't expect anything
less from a gourmand.

450
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,716
Kang-joon, over here!

451
00:33:32,473 --> 00:33:34,226
Sit with me.

452
00:33:40,315 --> 00:33:41,941
Hey, Kang-joon. Have a seat.

453
00:33:43,411 --> 00:33:44,411
Thanks.

454
00:33:55,895 --> 00:33:57,628
Na-eun, you can have this.

455
00:33:58,334 --> 00:34:00,445
Hey, this is really special.

456
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,947
Eat this and do the couple dance with me.

457
00:34:06,582 --> 00:34:08,676
I'm down! I'm totally down!

458
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:13,131
But I really suck at dancing, so I
think I'll only cause trouble for you.

459
00:34:13,156 --> 00:34:14,927
I told you. I'll teach you.

460
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:16,399
Okay?

461
00:34:22,891 --> 00:34:25,311
What? Why aren't you eating this?

462
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:27,703
Don't tell me you're on a diet.

463
00:34:28,746 --> 00:34:29,746
I am.

464
00:34:31,423 --> 00:34:32,690
Don't go on a diet.

465
00:34:33,693 --> 00:34:35,703
You're perfect just the way you are.

466
00:34:36,754 --> 00:34:40,166
Don't go on a diet.
Your hips are a masterpiece.

467
00:34:41,307 --> 00:34:42,307
Kang-joon.

468
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:48,461
Do you like girls who are fat and chubby?

469
00:34:49,928 --> 00:34:52,840
Yeah, I do like girls who look healthy.

470
00:34:56,743 --> 00:34:58,847
Girls who eat everything well.

471
00:35:25,514 --> 00:35:28,299
I gave up dieting for J.

472
00:35:31,346 --> 00:35:34,599
Na-eun, shall we dance?

473
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:37,295
I'm talking about the couple dance.

474
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,263
Can you be my partner?
I'm confident that I can do a good job.

475
00:35:42,482 --> 00:35:46,070
Well, Kang-joon just asked me...

476
00:35:52,596 --> 00:35:53,596
What is it?

477
00:35:55,382 --> 00:35:56,734
I like your perfume.

478
00:35:58,529 --> 00:35:59,529
High-five.

479
00:36:41,258 --> 00:36:44,791
(Come to the rooftop after class. - J)

480
00:36:52,685 --> 00:36:54,867
Look at page 34 of your textbook.

481
00:36:54,892 --> 00:36:57,092
It's all in the textbook.

482
00:36:57,516 --> 00:36:59,444
The internal structure of minerals.

483
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:01,875
1. Crystalline and amorphous.

484
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,068
Crystalline.

485
00:37:03,093 --> 00:37:06,767
The atoms that make up minerals
in an orderly manner...

486
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,748
Na-eun, come to the rooftop after class.

487
00:37:35,674 --> 00:37:37,975
Come to the rooftop after class.

488
00:37:41,269 --> 00:37:44,967
That's it for today.
Make sure you check the major points.

489
00:37:44,992 --> 00:37:46,259
Class is dismissed.

490
00:37:46,447 --> 00:37:51,012
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

491
00:38:12,077 --> 00:38:15,001
(Come to the rooftop after class. - J)

492
00:39:54,798 --> 00:39:55,965
Go-eun?
