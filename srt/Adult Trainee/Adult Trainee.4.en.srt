1
00:00:17,047 --> 00:00:19,719
(Adult Trainee)

2
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:34,619
What?

3
00:00:37,108 --> 00:00:38,918
- Huh?
- Why are you staring at me?

4
00:00:38,943 --> 00:00:41,690
Because I'm amazed that you have
something like that in your backpack!

5
00:00:41,715 --> 00:00:44,502
- Do you think this is your gym?
- I have muscle aches 'cause of you!

6
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:56,840
Hurry up, will you?
Gosh, you all really need to be on time!

7
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:00,831
Let's see...

8
00:01:01,691 --> 00:01:05,294
There are no specific
school announcements today.

9
00:01:06,235 --> 00:01:07,895
Let's keep it peaceful like this, okay?

10
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:11,324
Ever since I saw Nam-ho's
savage body last night,

11
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:16,408
I sensed dirty changes to my pure soul.

12
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:54,024
I keep seeing things.

13
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:20,848
My vision became sharper.

14
00:02:36,675 --> 00:02:38,516
And now, I'm even seeing hallucinations.

15
00:02:52,786 --> 00:02:54,063
Hey, pass me the ball.

16
00:02:54,088 --> 00:02:55,221
Give me the ball!

17
00:02:55,735 --> 00:02:57,402
I said, give me the ball.

18
00:02:57,665 --> 00:02:59,260
S-Sure.

19
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:03,764
- The water is spraying very well today!
- What's your problem?

20
00:03:06,848 --> 00:03:10,588
According to Epicurus,
there are three types of desires.

21
00:03:11,435 --> 00:03:15,929
Natural and necessary desires,
natural but non-necessary desires,

22
00:03:16,588 --> 00:03:20,087
and vain and empty desires.

23
00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:23,467
Then what are natural
and necessary desires?

24
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,670
They're desires that
humans need to survive.

25
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:29,911
Like hunger and sleep.

26
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,415
It's so weird.

27
00:03:33,027 --> 00:03:36,147
I see other guys realistically
without any filters.

28
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,944
So why do I only see Nam-ho differently?

29
00:04:07,827 --> 00:04:09,708
At this rate, it's like I have a virus!

30
00:04:10,274 --> 00:04:13,488
Because of that bastard Nam-ho,
my mind is getting all dirtied up!

31
00:04:13,977 --> 00:04:16,018
I can't do this anymore.
I need to stop.

32
00:04:16,312 --> 00:04:18,566
I quit this fake relationship!

33
00:04:18,844 --> 00:04:19,844
Jeez!

34
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:25,667
I have something to tell you.

35
00:04:26,873 --> 00:04:28,560
Meet me in front of the academy.

36
00:04:36,557 --> 00:04:38,604
Who the hell is that girl with pink hair?

37
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:40,763
Look at this.
Awesome, huh?

38
00:04:45,532 --> 00:04:47,166
Hey!

39
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,082
What are you guys doing?

40
00:04:56,642 --> 00:04:57,642
What's your deal?

41
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:00,359
You guys are athletes!

42
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:02,645
- What about your lungs?
- This is a vape pen.

43
00:05:03,402 --> 00:05:06,405
I-It has nicotine!
That's like a drug!

44
00:05:06,462 --> 00:05:08,643
What the heck are you talking about?

45
00:05:23,638 --> 00:05:24,638
Who is she?

46
00:05:25,496 --> 00:05:26,504
That girl from earlier.

47
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:28,219
- You mean Se-young?
- Yeah, her.

48
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,706
The one who caked her face.

49
00:05:29,731 --> 00:05:32,382
- Just a girl from my academy.
- Your academy is weird.

50
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,761
Do people there show their
collarbones to each other?

51
00:05:34,886 --> 00:05:37,054
Isn't that only possible if
you're talking to someone?

52
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,737
What's it to you anyway?

53
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,355
- You should tell me if you're
talking to someone! - Why?

54
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,572
Because we're dating...

55
00:05:46,842 --> 00:05:48,575
People think we're dating.

56
00:05:48,832 --> 00:05:51,149
If you flirt with girls,
what does that make me?

57
00:05:51,174 --> 00:05:52,794
It's not like we're really dating.

58
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,334
So what if I'm talking to
girls or flirting with them?

59
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:58,473
Wow. You're a really promiscuous
guy, aren't you?

60
00:05:58,498 --> 00:06:01,206
Wow, and you're a really shameless psycho.

61
00:06:01,496 --> 00:06:04,702
Do you need to call me names after all
the crap you've made me gone through?

62
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:10,121
Forget it. I don't need that
autographed ball. Let's call it quits.

63
00:06:12,823 --> 00:06:13,823
Damn it.

64
00:06:15,948 --> 00:06:18,661
Hey! I was going to break it off first!

65
00:06:19,489 --> 00:06:20,489
Darn it.

66
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:25,800
That little punk!

67
00:06:30,884 --> 00:06:34,455
God, I can't believe I even thought of that
barbaric jerk! I'm freaking embarrassed!

68
00:06:39,876 --> 00:06:41,955
Just look at him.
Even his room is a mess.

69
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,291
- Let's go there later.
- Okay!

70
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:07,301
Hey, Yu-Ra!
What's up with your skin?

71
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:11,290
I'm not feeling well,
so it probably doesn't look great.

72
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:12,315
Let me see.

73
00:07:12,674 --> 00:07:14,246
Yeah, it doesn't look that nice.

74
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:19,902
Wow, they're so passionate this morning.

75
00:07:20,494 --> 00:07:22,890
God, it's like they're
filming porn or something!

76
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:25,711
But why are you alone?
Where's Nam-ho?

77
00:07:26,221 --> 00:07:28,547
Oh, we decided to come separately.

78
00:07:29,352 --> 00:07:31,344
What's going on?
Did you two fight?

79
00:07:31,728 --> 00:07:33,346
Is there a problem
in your relationship?

80
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:35,831
It's not that.
It's just that I woke up late.

81
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,522
So I told him to leave first.

82
00:07:39,631 --> 00:07:41,013
Huh? Isn't that Nam-ho?

83
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:57,809
Yu-Ra, are you sick?

84
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,017
My stomach hurts.
I feel nauseous, too.

85
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,766
Ma'am, Yu-Ra has to go to the infirmary!

86
00:08:06,955 --> 00:08:11,724
Ooh-la-la! Is Nam-ho taking his
girlfriend to the infirmary again?

87
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:13,450
Is he?

88
00:08:19,523 --> 00:08:20,935
All right, settle down.

89
00:08:27,453 --> 00:08:31,056
Yu-Ra can go to the infirmary,
and the rest of you can start over.

90
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:53,196
I've been experiencing
strange symptoms lately.

91
00:08:53,527 --> 00:08:54,660
Strange symptoms?

92
00:08:56,206 --> 00:09:00,865
My face feels hot out of nowhere, my
heart beats quickly, and I feel nauseous.

93
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,718
- I see.
- And I'm usually down-to-earth.

94
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,293
But for some reason, I keep getting angry,

95
00:09:06,503 --> 00:09:10,034
and I can't stop looking
at this dirty creature.

96
00:09:10,443 --> 00:09:14,332
I keep seeing this disgusting
creature - no, more like insect,

97
00:09:14,357 --> 00:09:15,724
in a beautiful light.

98
00:09:15,861 --> 00:09:17,488
Seems like premenstrual syndrome.

99
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,125
Oh!

100
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,040
It's just PMS.
It's because or hormonal changes.

101
00:09:22,385 --> 00:09:24,773
Your temperature increases,
and you experience irritability.

102
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:27,664
And you suddenly start getting angry.

103
00:09:28,415 --> 00:09:29,978
I'm the same way.

104
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,097
That's it. I think that's what I have.

105
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:36,126
- Rest up. Call me if you're in any pain.
- Will do.

106
00:09:40,134 --> 00:09:41,149
- Enjoy.
- Enjoy.

107
00:09:41,174 --> 00:09:42,174
Jinx!

108
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:45,626
- Do you want this?
- Let's eat it like this.

109
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:50,392
That reminds me.

110
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:53,628
My brother reserved a vacation home but
couldn't cancel it, so he gave it to me.

111
00:09:53,653 --> 00:09:55,249
- Do you want to go?
- A vacation home?

112
00:09:55,274 --> 00:09:57,355
Yeah, let's go! There's a pool, too!

113
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:01,422
- You two can go by yourselves.
- Come on, let's go together!

114
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,879
I've always wished to go
on a trip with couples!

115
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,380
- I'm not interested.
- Why not?

116
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:08,367
I don't think my mom will let me go.

117
00:10:08,884 --> 00:10:10,542
And I'm voluntarily not going.

118
00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:15,230
Baby, let's leave them out.
They're probably bored of each other.

119
00:10:15,505 --> 00:10:16,505
Already?

120
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,791
- You guys must not know yet. We broke...
- Okay, let's go.

121
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,167
Woohoo!

122
00:10:23,798 --> 00:10:25,735
I'll just lie that it's a girls' trip.

123
00:10:36,312 --> 00:10:38,637
I clearly told you we should call it quits.

124
00:10:40,102 --> 00:10:43,467
I wasn't myself,
so I got nosy about your love life.

125
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:45,803
But I learned it was a physical condition.

126
00:10:45,828 --> 00:10:47,035
What are you talking about?

127
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,775
Let's start over.
I'm talking about our fake relationship.

128
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,930
I told you.
I don't need the autographed ball.

129
00:10:56,651 --> 00:10:59,826
When my brother comes back from the
military, Son Heung-min is going to invite

130
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:02,984
our family to England so that we can
watch his soccer game from the VIP stand.

131
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:05,053
You have one reckless imagination.

132
00:11:07,053 --> 00:11:10,722
Jeez, I didn't know I'd
have to show you this.

133
00:11:12,313 --> 00:11:14,995
This is his handwritten
letter to my brother.

134
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:19,596
He's world-class.

135
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:22,605
You recognize your precious Son
Heung-min's handwriting, right?

136
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:28,289
You can go...

137
00:11:29,781 --> 00:11:31,815
to England instead of me.

138
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,516
This isn't a lot?
I'm carrying all this though.

139
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,683
We might not have any there,
and it'd be sad if we're missing it.

140
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:47,361
- No. There's a lot.
- There is? Okay!

141
00:11:58,315 --> 00:12:00,552
Hey, I'm here.
This place is lit!

142
00:12:06,331 --> 00:12:08,831
By the way, how many rooms are there?

143
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,602
- I believe there are two.
- I see.

144
00:12:10,684 --> 00:12:12,906
- Let's quickly change and go swimming!
- Sure.

145
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:23,481
- What's wrong?
- Yu-Ra...

146
00:12:24,406 --> 00:12:27,230
Yi-joon wants to share a room with me.

147
00:12:27,255 --> 00:12:29,264
- Then what about me?
- You can room with Nam-ho.

148
00:12:29,338 --> 00:12:31,743
- This is a couples' trip, after all.
- Oh, right.

149
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:35,064
I was just going to check out
all the rooms before picking one.

150
00:12:35,361 --> 00:12:38,020
- All right then. You two can use that one.
- Okay!

151
00:12:57,821 --> 00:12:59,027
Are you an exhibitionist?

152
00:12:59,672 --> 00:13:01,061
You're the one who's looking.

153
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:04,381
You better not look at me, you psycho!

154
00:13:04,423 --> 00:13:08,354
You're on the floor. I'm on the bed.
If you cross that line, you're dead meat.

155
00:13:09,063 --> 00:13:11,500
You really know
how to build up a wall.

156
00:13:25,575 --> 00:13:26,841
What are you doing?

157
00:13:27,258 --> 00:13:29,629
Lunges.

158
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:31,594
You're a nutcase.

159
00:13:41,827 --> 00:13:42,827
Darn it!

160
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,829
- You lunatic! Give it back!
- No!

161
00:14:05,331 --> 00:14:06,898
(3 hours ago)

162
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:31,869
- Minors can't buy the functional kinds.
- Sorry?

163
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,880
Please get the regular ones instead.

164
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,592
Gosh. This one lasts long though.

165
00:14:44,409 --> 00:14:46,737
(It's your lucky day.
With love comes responsibility!)

166
00:14:47,994 --> 00:14:50,111
Do you even know what this is for?

167
00:14:50,136 --> 00:14:52,249
It's not like that!

168
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,227
"It's your lucky day..."

169
00:14:58,027 --> 00:14:59,627
You're out of your mind.

170
00:15:02,055 --> 00:15:03,564
Oh my god.

171
00:15:46,134 --> 00:15:47,848
God, that bastard.

172
00:15:48,538 --> 00:15:50,498
He's not having weird thoughts, is he?

173
00:16:02,506 --> 00:16:03,601
What the heck?

174
00:16:07,974 --> 00:16:08,974
What's this?

175
00:16:15,219 --> 00:16:17,710
What's wrong with me?
What's happening? What's going on?

176
00:16:22,577 --> 00:16:25,259
You must be going crazy!
Are you really doing this again?

177
00:16:25,593 --> 00:16:26,593
Argh!

178
00:17:19,863 --> 00:17:20,982
Yu-Ra.

179
00:17:24,805 --> 00:17:26,170
I have a question.

180
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:29,251
- How did you end up dating Nam-ho?
- What?

181
00:17:29,276 --> 00:17:30,754
You two were just friends.

182
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:35,026
When did you start seeing him as a man?

183
00:17:35,308 --> 00:17:36,609
Why would you ask me that?

184
00:17:36,634 --> 00:17:39,556
Come on! It's the first time
we both have boyfriends.

185
00:17:39,821 --> 00:17:41,757
I wanted to talk about
things like this with you.

186
00:17:41,782 --> 00:17:42,942
Gosh, I don't know.

187
00:17:43,514 --> 00:17:46,148
I thought you liked
sweet guys like Yi-joon.

188
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:49,122
Nam-ho is a bit...

189
00:17:49,718 --> 00:17:50,918
What about him?

190
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,670
What's wrong with him?

191
00:17:53,526 --> 00:17:56,089
He may not get good grades,
but he's good at everything else.

192
00:18:01,844 --> 00:18:04,265
- Nam-ho, you should eat.
- Go ahead and eat first.

193
00:18:04,942 --> 00:18:05,942
Sure.

194
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,563
He's sincere about the smallest things.

195
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:12,305
I'm fine.

196
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,948
He may be mean at times,
but he has good manners.

197
00:18:17,781 --> 00:18:19,661
And he's got guts!

198
00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:22,593
Even when his eyebrows are about
to burn off, he doesn't flinch.

199
00:18:22,618 --> 00:18:25,890
On top of that, he knows how to cook.
Haven't you heard of "sexy cooking men"?

200
00:18:25,915 --> 00:18:27,929
He's totally sexy.

201
00:18:31,969 --> 00:18:33,207
That's freaking hot.

202
00:18:38,545 --> 00:18:40,021
I'm talking about the pork belly.

203
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:49,991
How could I say that?

204
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:52,598
Aren't these expensive?

205
00:18:52,623 --> 00:18:56,805
- I brought everything at home!
- I've never thought Yi-joon was sexy.

206
00:18:57,023 --> 00:18:58,476
I don't drink.

207
00:18:59,829 --> 00:19:01,844
Aww, come on. Are you a light drinker?

208
00:19:02,012 --> 00:19:03,545
No. I just don't drink.

209
00:19:04,238 --> 00:19:06,690
But we came to have fun!
Let's just have one shot.

210
00:19:08,662 --> 00:19:09,757
Enjoy it without me.

211
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:13,995
He looks like a heavy drinker,
but I guess he can't drink at all.

212
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,937
Oh, he doesn't know how to drink.

213
00:19:16,283 --> 00:19:19,258
Nam-ho doesn't look like that
type, but I guess he can't drink!

214
00:19:23,552 --> 00:19:27,505
Then let's play the King Game.
That way, we can drink a lot.

215
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,120
Sure, let's do it.

216
00:19:29,924 --> 00:19:33,360
- Hey, you can't drink.
- One shot is fine.

217
00:19:38,361 --> 00:19:40,726
No. 1 will sit on No. 3's lap and...

218
00:19:43,205 --> 00:19:45,305
exchange sweet eye contact
with them for a minute.

219
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,043
- Damn it.
- If you laugh, you gotta drink.

220
00:19:47,068 --> 00:19:49,084
Why would you make us
do something like that?

221
00:19:49,109 --> 00:19:51,039
You're No. 1, right? And you're No. 3?

222
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:54,375
Awww, Yu-Ra can't do cringey things!

223
00:20:00,304 --> 00:20:01,359
Start!

224
00:20:20,364 --> 00:20:21,920
Yo, why are your nostrils so...?

225
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:25,442
- Get off.
- Darn you.

226
00:20:25,467 --> 00:20:26,467
Drink up.

227
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,794
Okay, who's the next king?

228
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,677
Me. No. 1 needs to drink.

229
00:20:32,926 --> 00:20:34,664
No. 2 and No. 3 should drink.

230
00:21:01,105 --> 00:21:02,296
Hey!

231
00:21:04,027 --> 00:21:05,027
Are you okay?

232
00:21:11,294 --> 00:21:13,888
Why would they suggest this game
when they're light drinkers?

233
00:21:14,391 --> 00:21:15,391
Jeez.

234
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,310
Hey! Give me that!

235
00:21:23,265 --> 00:21:24,868
Let's head back inside. It's late.

236
00:21:24,893 --> 00:21:26,173
No way!

237
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,865
I'm the king!

238
00:21:29,304 --> 00:21:35,571
No. 2 and No.3 need to
kiss deeply for a minute!

239
00:21:35,596 --> 00:21:39,397
Kiss! Kiss!

240
00:21:40,324 --> 00:21:41,613
I can't kiss.

241
00:21:41,638 --> 00:21:44,420
Do it now! Do it now!

242
00:21:44,527 --> 00:21:45,527
Just go inside.

243
00:21:45,693 --> 00:21:47,416
They're too drunk to remember anyway.

244
00:22:05,978 --> 00:22:06,978
No.

245
00:22:07,986 --> 00:22:09,719
I shouldn't be doing this.

246
00:22:10,578 --> 00:22:11,768
I can't do this!

247
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,252
I need to stop!

248
00:22:17,609 --> 00:22:18,696
Da-hyun!

249
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,359
How's Da-hyun?
Is she okay?

250
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,840
She totally blacked out.

251
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,134
Jeez, this trip is a waste.

252
00:22:55,283 --> 00:22:56,283
God.

253
00:22:56,357 --> 00:22:58,261
Wow. We just brushed fingers!

254
00:22:59,622 --> 00:23:03,217
I don't like touching other girls
beside Da-hyun either, you know.

255
00:23:05,153 --> 00:23:08,517
Back then, I only wanted to
touch you because I liked you.

256
00:23:09,912 --> 00:23:12,689
Yeah, right. Are you sure you didn't
like me so that you can touch me?

257
00:23:12,714 --> 00:23:13,976
The order isn't important.

258
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:18,923
When you like someone, you keep thinking
about them and want to be with them.

259
00:23:21,956 --> 00:23:25,058
Don't tell me you put up a wall
between you and Nam-ho, too.

260
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,014
- I don't. - You saw the chemistry
between Da-hyun and me, right?

261
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,541
We're on blazing fire!
Even the firefighters might come for us.

262
00:23:30,902 --> 00:23:33,219
But you two are more like... how I put it?

263
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:38,675
You guys are like butane
gas that is about to go out.

264
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:41,132
What are you saying?

265
00:23:41,611 --> 00:23:43,754
Yu-Ra, hear me out.

266
00:23:46,005 --> 00:23:49,925
This year, my dad was too busy to come
to my grandmother's birthday party.

267
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,730
So do you know what she did?

268
00:23:53,124 --> 00:23:55,504
She got freaking ticked off.

269
00:23:56,055 --> 00:23:57,484
What are you trying to say?

270
00:23:57,509 --> 00:24:02,255
Even when they get older,
people are timid beings who get hurt.

271
00:24:03,301 --> 00:24:05,808
After being alive for 18 years,
I can tell what life is like.

272
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:10,835
For the rest of our lives,
we're going to be knocked around and hurt.

273
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:14,817
So what's the big deal about making
mistakes and getting hurt now?

274
00:24:16,569 --> 00:24:19,521
Is that why you do whatever you want?
Why you date girl after girl?

275
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,469
Yeah. What's wrong with being
honest about my feelings?

276
00:24:23,091 --> 00:24:27,863
I'm way better than those people who
pretend to be something they're not.

277
00:24:29,456 --> 00:24:30,773
So what I'm saying is...

278
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:35,758
stop thinking about what you should
do and what's going to happen.

279
00:24:35,783 --> 00:24:38,127
If you like him, just go for it.

280
00:24:38,354 --> 00:24:40,933
The worst thing you can
experience is a heartbreak.

281
00:24:42,787 --> 00:24:44,096
Make it work out this time.

282
00:24:44,604 --> 00:24:48,106
If a conservative girl like you is willing
to publicly kiss someone deeply like that,

283
00:24:48,629 --> 00:24:50,560
then it must mean you really love Nam-ho.

284
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:55,867
Gosh!

285
00:25:26,989 --> 00:25:28,870
It must mean you really love Nam-ho.

286
00:25:29,668 --> 00:25:31,953
No way.

287
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:42,909
Why are his lips so pretty?

288
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,666
What are you doing?

289
00:27:02,686 --> 00:27:04,344
I dare you to touch me.

290
00:28:10,718 --> 00:28:12,623
How far is his hand going up?

291
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,012
What's going on?
I can't do this.

292
00:28:21,547 --> 00:28:22,920
Wait. What's this hard thing?

293
00:28:24,312 --> 00:28:25,312
Is it that?

294
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,174
Are we allowed to do this in public?

295
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:32,986
I think someone's going to see us!

296
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,526
That's right! I wore mismatched underwear!

297
00:28:37,017 --> 00:28:40,461
But if he goes too far up,
does that mean he thinks I'm easy?

298
00:28:41,195 --> 00:28:43,671
What do I do?
What should I do?

299
00:29:18,821 --> 00:29:21,472
