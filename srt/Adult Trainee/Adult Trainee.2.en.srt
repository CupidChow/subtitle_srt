(Adult Trainee)

2
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:31,129
Don't tell me...

3
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,920
I reset.

4
00:00:37,134 --> 00:00:39,085
I was doing fine,
but then I had a wet dream.

5
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,125
Is this a reset?

6
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:52,194
(Someone left a comment on your post.)

7
00:00:55,367 --> 00:00:57,311
Wet dreams are fine.

8
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:00,092
Fine! Fine!

9
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,610
He said it's fine!

10
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:05,277
Don't worry and don't give in.

11
00:01:07,196 --> 00:01:11,594
But you can't have two successive
wet dreams, so be careful.

12
00:01:24,358 --> 00:01:25,609
(Regular meetings)

00:01:25,634 --> 00:01:29,548
(Offline Regular Meetings)

14
00:01:30,887 --> 00:01:32,506
No way.

15
00:01:43,361 --> 00:01:45,838
We will secretly meet up
with you in the

16
00:01:45,863 --> 00:01:48,053
human body section of
the library at 4:50 p.m.

17
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,547
So this really exists?

18
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:03,235
(Day 13 of No Masturbating)

19
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:13,908
Look at you! Come here!

20
00:02:14,654 --> 00:02:15,654
What is it?

21
00:02:16,342 --> 00:02:18,809
Why do you need so much toilet paper?

22
00:02:18,923 --> 00:02:20,208
I need to poo!

23
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:22,835
You better not do anything weird in there!

24
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,860
Go!

25
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,326
- What's wrong with him?
- Someone got caught masturbating again.

26
00:02:28,497 --> 00:02:29,497
Again?

27
00:02:34,653 --> 00:02:36,972
That's why the principal
gave him a hard time.

28
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:40,500
Hold it right there.

29
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:42,365
What kind of sick bastard is doing it?

30
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,850
He should do it at home.

31
00:02:57,122 --> 00:02:59,344
I'm sorry for dreaming about you like that.

32
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:05,765
- I had a dream...
- What?

33
00:03:06,432 --> 00:03:07,670
About you.

34
00:03:12,345 --> 00:03:14,630
You were making another
weird drawing of me.

35
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,841
Please draw me properly.

36
00:03:22,595 --> 00:03:23,967
Can you draw me again?

37
00:03:24,485 --> 00:03:26,358
This is dangerous. This is dangerous.

38
00:03:27,437 --> 00:03:29,366
This is dangerous. This is dangerous.

39
00:03:31,524 --> 00:03:34,240
The person sitting next
to me isn't Ye-kyung.

40
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:37,390
It's the teacher.

41
00:03:50,749 --> 00:03:51,749
Sure.

42
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:54,989
3D = 6. Then what's d?

43
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,675
It's 2, isn't it?

44
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,027
Then we have our value.
Let's write it down.

45
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:03,183
But what are we looking for?

46
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,224
A2 + A3.

47
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:07,970
So if we add these two, we'll get 8.

48
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:10,078
That's our answer.

49
00:04:14,022 --> 00:04:17,625
Listen up. This is going
to be on the final exam.

50
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:19,685
You must pay attention.

51
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,425
- He said it'll be on the test.
- This is very important.

52
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,689
He said it's important.

53
00:04:23,714 --> 00:04:26,357
- Put a star on it.
- It even has a star on it.

54
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:29,894
Sir!

55
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,203
You scared me.

56
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:32,866
I have a question.

57
00:04:33,175 --> 00:04:35,596
You've never asked any questions before.
What is it?

58
00:04:36,704 --> 00:04:38,625
Which class gets to eat lunch first today?

59
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,317
- Go stand in the back.
- Yes, sir.

60
00:04:43,987 --> 00:04:45,503
Let's continue then.

61
00:04:47,223 --> 00:04:49,119
We're looking for the value of A-N,

62
00:04:49,304 --> 00:04:53,470
where A8 - A4 is 28.

63
00:04:59,972 --> 00:05:01,655
(4:40 p.m.)

64
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,211
We will secretly meet
up with you in the human

65
00:05:04,236 --> 00:05:06,166
body section of the
library at 4:50 p.m.

66
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,650
(Human Body)

67
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,212
By any chance...

68
00:05:35,695 --> 00:05:37,651
are you in the Quitting Masturbating club?

69
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:39,122
What?

70
00:05:39,678 --> 00:05:41,568
The club that helps you stop masturbating.

71
00:05:41,593 --> 00:05:42,696
What a lunatic!

72
00:05:54,084 --> 00:05:55,084
Are you...

73
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:56,949
from the club?

74
00:05:57,859 --> 00:05:59,651
Let me check if you're really a member.

75
00:05:59,676 --> 00:06:01,781
Chul-soo had wet dreams
for two days in a row.

76
00:06:01,806 --> 00:06:03,884
- Is he resetting then?
- What?

77
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:06,936
- Five, four, three...
- Yes!

78
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:09,003
Two consecutive wet
dreams symbolize a reset.

79
00:06:09,028 --> 00:06:10,999
What do you lose the
most when you masturbate?

80
00:06:11,024 --> 00:06:12,024
What?

81
00:06:14,948 --> 00:06:15,948
Protein?

82
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:18,061
Last question.

83
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,367
What do you call those
who send you porn to try

84
00:06:20,392 --> 00:06:22,508
to terrorize you as you
try to quit masturbating?

85
00:06:24,378 --> 00:06:26,560
We call them "masturbate-ban."

86
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:29,110
- Masturbate-ban!
- You have proved yourself.

87
00:06:52,564 --> 00:06:53,831
We have a new member.

88
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,976
Jae-min, what are you doing here?

89
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,753
Aren't you the vice class president?

90
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:17,727
Not here.

91
00:07:17,752 --> 00:07:21,348
Here I'm the president of our
Quitting Masturbating club.

92
00:07:21,645 --> 00:07:23,739
You're the president of this school's club?

93
00:07:24,155 --> 00:07:25,155
Yup.

94
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:27,061
My nickname is Five Freedoms.

95
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:30,739
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yeah. I'm Picaseo.

96
00:07:30,973 --> 00:07:33,242
Oh, I'll use my right hand.

97
00:07:33,734 --> 00:07:35,903
I used my left hand when I watched porn.

98
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,041
I see.

99
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:45,039
- Let me know if you run into any problems.
- Sure. Thanks.

100
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,679
There's someone else you
might recognize here.

101
00:07:53,044 --> 00:07:54,044
Joon-ha?

102
00:07:54,647 --> 00:07:56,122
What the hell are you doing here?

103
00:07:56,147 --> 00:07:58,657
Sorry. I envied you for
holding back so well.

104
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,740
How many days have you gone without
doing it? 30 days? Or 100 days?

105
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,864
- It's only been a day.
- What?

106
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:06,151
His nickname is Mayfly.

107
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:08,400
He can't go a day without doing it.

108
00:08:08,425 --> 00:08:09,654
So you reset every day?

109
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:13,054
- What about you? How many
days has it been? - Me?

110
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:16,399
- 13.
- 13 days?

111
00:08:17,109 --> 00:08:19,037
Whoa, that's awesome!

112
00:08:19,993 --> 00:08:23,341
I'm going to quit masturbating for
100 days and confess to my crush.

113
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,380
(I've regretted masturbating, but I've
never regretted not masturbating.)

114
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:32,352
(100 points for 100 days
of non-masturbating)

115
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:36,371
(Obey the rules of non-masturbating)

116
00:08:42,326 --> 00:08:44,239
I haven't been doing it for 86 days.

117
00:08:44,264 --> 00:08:47,653
I'm able to concentrate better,
and I have two more hours to study.

118
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:50,152
I haven't been doing it for 130 days.

119
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:52,088
I'm blocking out color
with my sunglasses.

120
00:08:52,113 --> 00:08:53,985
Black-and-white is less sexy.

121
00:08:56,388 --> 00:08:58,269
I've gone without it for 300 days now.

122
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,963
It's exhausting, but I've become
way too popular among girls now.

123
00:09:01,988 --> 00:09:04,783
Yesterday, one part-time worker
at Baskin Robbins told me this.

124
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:10,736
"I gave you more than usual."
She totally has the hots for me.

125
00:09:12,111 --> 00:09:15,044
How many days have you gone
without masturbating?

126
00:09:15,572 --> 00:09:17,778
It's a secret.

127
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:21,877
Just know that it's a four-digit number.

128
00:09:21,902 --> 00:09:22,902
No way!

129
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:25,062
Then it's been a thousand days?

130
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:29,692
I read in the reviews that
if you go that long without

131
00:09:29,717 --> 00:09:32,894
masturbating,
you can get supernatural abilities.

132
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,942
That's just a joke, right?

133
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,806
Prepare yourself. He hasn't shown
us something big in a while.

134
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:50,331
Hey, are you okay?

135
00:09:53,476 --> 00:09:55,174
Are you talking about something like this?

136
00:10:09,436 --> 00:10:11,849
I shouldn't have come here.
I shouldn't have come here.

137
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:18,358
Do you all know how Park Chan-Hong
entered the major league?

138
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,077
Picaseo?

139
00:10:21,547 --> 00:10:22,705
Because of his fastball?

140
00:10:23,555 --> 00:10:26,152
- That's right. Because he
quit masturbating. - What?

141
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:30,336
He didn't just happen to have
a fastball speed of 158 kph.

142
00:10:30,516 --> 00:10:33,999
He went 1,000 days without masturbating
and was reborn with a fireball.

143
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,344
He was actually a previous
member of our club.

144
00:10:44,404 --> 00:10:48,370
(Hall of Fame)

145
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:56,363
(Park Chan-Hong, Choi Hyun-seok,
Kim Dae-ju, Yoo Jin-Hui)

146
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:03,960
As you can see from them,

147
00:11:04,432 --> 00:11:06,257
quitting isn't just about not masturbating.

148
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:10,531
It's about becoming strict with yourself.

149
00:11:10,884 --> 00:11:15,304
If you don't want to get hurt but
gain self-respect in this cruel world,

150
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:19,785
if you want to have confidence
in studying and dating,

151
00:11:20,465 --> 00:11:23,457
then quitting masturbating
is the first step.

152
00:11:24,144 --> 00:11:27,858
Therefore, let's shout our slogan.

153
00:11:31,326 --> 00:11:33,302
- Stop...
- Masturbating!

154
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:34,955
Louder! Stop...

155
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,034
Masturbating!

156
00:11:36,225 --> 00:11:37,296
Stop.

157
00:11:41,837 --> 00:11:42,837
So...

158
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:47,707
you recently had a wet dream, right?

159
00:11:50,228 --> 00:11:52,037
That's fine, so don't worry too much.

160
00:11:52,402 --> 00:11:54,751
Anyone can dream.

161
00:11:55,018 --> 00:11:58,628
You talk about wet dreams
in a really nice way.

162
00:12:00,492 --> 00:12:02,196
Anyway, thanks.

163
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,821
Then why do you study so hard?

164
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:17,149
In order to make time on my side.

165
00:12:18,424 --> 00:12:21,987
I need to do my best to
win this fight against time

166
00:12:22,262 --> 00:12:25,293
so that I can gain more time and
opportunities in the future.

167
00:12:25,724 --> 00:12:27,193
Don't you think so?

168
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:45,357
(Thump, thump
Glance)

169
00:12:45,382 --> 00:12:47,084
(I can't approach her.)

170
00:12:49,425 --> 00:12:50,988
If time is on my side,

171
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:58,047
then I'll give my all to the thing
that excites me the most right now.

- Hi.
- Hey.

175
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:24,376
What's wrong with me?

176
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,222
I keep dozing off.

177
00:13:26,865 --> 00:13:29,837
I was even late to the academy yesterday
because I fell asleep on the bus.

178
00:13:44,467 --> 00:13:47,173
If you're tired, it's okay to rest.

179
00:13:47,506 --> 00:13:49,562
What's this?
Thanks.

180
00:13:56,501 --> 00:14:00,973
(If you're tired, it's okay to rest.)

181
00:14:09,635 --> 00:14:11,786
There's definitely gum...

182
00:14:12,882 --> 00:14:14,706
I mean, something between us.

(Day 41 of No Masturbating)

184
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:22,296
Ever since I've stopped masturbating,
I've become a morning person.

185
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,062
All righty, folks, this is
important, so pay attention.

188

When you want to watch porn, a cold
shower will instantly curb your cravings.

189
00:15:03,796 --> 00:15:04,996
Stop masturbating!

190
00:15:06,049 --> 00:15:07,249

(Arriving soon: 15)

192
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:15,638
Take a good look at this!
It's really important!

193
00:15:15,992 --> 00:15:18,404
Because of the right supporter...

194
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,419

because I fell asleep on the bus.

197
00:15:35,956 --> 00:15:38,553
That's how the game rolls...

198

- Sorry, let me borrow this real quick!
- What? You crazy jerk!

199
00:15:41,802 --> 00:15:44,825
Hey! You moron!

200
00:15:59,467 --> 00:16:03,118
Thank God. Because I've stopped
masturbating, I've gotten faster.

201
00:16:50,264 --> 00:16:52,081
- Your stop is next!
- What?

202
00:16:53,536 --> 00:16:55,171
Your! Stop! Is! Next!

203

Picaseo has something to share with us.

211
00:18:25,793 --> 00:18:30,419
It has actually been 99 days
since I stopped doing it.

212
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:33,735
Go, Picaseo!

213
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,358
That reminds me. You said you're gonna
confess to your crush after 100 days.

214
00:18:38,694 --> 00:18:40,274
Did you prepare a gift for her?

215
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:41,299
Of course.

216
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:43,689
I prepared something extra special.

217
00:18:44,382 --> 00:18:45,453
Look at this punk!

218
00:18:45,478 --> 00:18:49,519
He's not thinking of confessing
with a comic book, is he?

219
00:18:49,668 --> 00:18:53,104
- Of course not!
- No way!

220
00:18:53,129 --> 00:18:55,383
Wait a minute. Hang on.

221
00:18:56,024 --> 00:18:58,095
Picaseo? Picaseo?

222
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,026
What's with that look on your face?

223
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:06,449
- You didn't actually make a comic
book, did you? - O-Of course not!

224
00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:12,220
- I-I didn't!
- Right?

225
00:19:13,518 --> 00:19:14,716
I just...

226
00:19:15,343 --> 00:19:16,739
Jeez.

227
00:19:18,379 --> 00:19:19,879
don't know how to confess to a girl.

228
00:19:21,881 --> 00:19:24,589
The truth is,
I've never dated anyone before.

229
00:19:24,614 --> 00:19:26,974
Seriously?

230
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:29,326
Man, he's driving me nuts!

231
00:19:30,344 --> 00:19:33,939
- He's never had a girlfriend before?
- That's cute.

232
00:19:34,977 --> 00:19:37,556
Honestly... I've never had one either.

233
00:19:39,258 --> 00:19:40,258
Me neither.

234
00:19:40,903 --> 00:19:41,903
Same here.

235
00:19:42,318 --> 00:19:43,612
I've never had one either.

236
00:19:43,637 --> 00:19:44,866
I'm in the same boat.

237
00:19:44,891 --> 00:19:47,292
Gosh, you guys suck.

238
00:19:47,317 --> 00:19:51,014
Does that mean I'm the only one
with dating experience here?

239
00:19:52,701 --> 00:19:54,495
You dated before? When?

240
00:19:54,718 --> 00:19:56,043
How'd you meet her?

241
00:19:57,794 --> 00:19:59,446
I met her at the park.

242
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,782
The Henesys Park in Maplestory.
There are a lot of hot girls there.

243
00:20:03,807 --> 00:20:06,395
Although I've never seen her
in real life before. Anyway...

244
00:20:06,892 --> 00:20:08,217
you want a girlfriend, right?

245
00:20:08,892 --> 00:20:10,543
Then ask her out like this.

246
00:20:14,653 --> 00:20:18,781
By any chance, did you just fart?

247
00:20:19,063 --> 00:20:20,435
Oh my god! No!

248
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:24,422
Because you blew me away.

249
00:20:27,094 --> 00:20:28,911
What kind of pick-up line is that?

250
00:20:29,892 --> 00:20:31,225
Oh, what about this?

251
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,330
Do you have a twin?

252
00:20:34,604 --> 00:20:37,786
- No. - That means you're the
prettiest girl in the world.

253
00:20:42,372 --> 00:20:44,167
You're the first person to fall for me!

Thank you. How much is it?

265
00:22:20,413 --> 00:22:21,722
Just $38.

266
00:22:22,502 --> 00:22:23,569
Cheap, isn't it?

267
00:22:24,657 --> 00:22:27,196
- No, not at all.

That's the end of the preview.
If you want more, go to the library.

Jae-min, what's going on?

276
00:24:14,116 --> 00:24:16,441
Where do I have to go if
I want to see more?

277

Here's a hint.

278
00:24:35,384 --> 00:24:36,451
The answer is...

279
00:24:37,966 --> 00:24:39,227

Wow, now you're even trying
to do it in the library!

287
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:26,717
Excuse me?

288
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:29,121
- What are you talking about?
- Follow me.

289
00:26:29,146 --> 00:26:31,743
- What's wrong?
- Come with me!

290

It hurts!

291
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:48,610
Look at you enjoying yourself.

292
00:26:51,307 --> 00:26:53,148
Don't you know this is a crime?

Yeah, right! That's you right there!

295

It's really not me!
I was just shaking a protein drink!

296

That's the only excuse
you can come up with?

It's not me. Please believe me.

298
00:27:07,356 --> 00:27:09,522
Why on earth would you
do this in public places?

299
00:27:09,547 --> 00:27:11,159
I told you! It's not like that!

300
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:15,377
I can't let this slide.
We'll discuss this later.

301
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,829
- Seo Jae-min is the guy who was
jerking off in art class! - Oh my god.

302
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,420
Shut up. It's not me.

303
00:27:24,445 --> 00:27:26,595
Gosh, this is the group chat.
Sorry, my bad.

304
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,670
We'll pretend we didn't hear anything.

305
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:29,958
Hey.

306
00:27:36,514 --> 00:27:39,847
Make sure you're ready to
practice the song for music class.

- Hi.

308
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,284
I'm sorry about yesterday.

309
00:28:16,086 --> 00:28:19,253
- So...
- Jae-min, can you move?

310
00:28:20,711 --> 00:28:22,402
Starting from today, this is my seat.

311
00:28:22,705 --> 00:28:24,237
- Get up.
- What are you talking about?

312
00:28:24,262 --> 00:28:27,200
That's what our homeroom teacher said.
You can go to my seat over there.

313
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:31,807
But... it's not like that...

314
00:28:47,748 --> 00:28:50,281
Jae-min, the teacher wants to see you.

315
00:28:56,774 --> 00:28:59,551
A disciplinary committee
will be held at school.

316
00:28:59,689 --> 00:29:02,117
- God, I really didn't do that!
- Jae-min.

317
00:29:03,213 --> 00:29:04,547
I'm sorry for accusing you.

318
00:29:07,197 --> 00:29:08,745
We caught the real culprit.

319
00:29:10,018 --> 00:29:11,748
Someone came forward with the truth.

320
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:17,221
It's definitely not Picaseo.

321
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:21,684
The unnatural angle of his arm
means he jerks with his left hand.

00:29:22,229 --> 00:29:23,625
Oh, you're a genius!

323
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:25,602
Picaseo is right-handed.

324
00:29:25,923 --> 00:29:28,772
The incident happened at 5
p.m., which means it was sunset.

325
00:29:28,797 --> 00:29:35,919
The length of his shadow means he's between
174 and 175 centimeters tall. Hence...

326
00:29:35,944 --> 00:29:38,148
- Picaseo is over 180 centimeters tall.
- That's right.

327
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:41,079
- Wait a minute! Pause the screen!
- What's wrong, Hawk Eyes?

328
00:29:41,796 --> 00:29:43,613
I just saw his shoes.

329
00:29:44,931 --> 00:29:46,567
The color of his sneakers are....

330
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,202
red!

331
00:29:50,974 --> 00:29:53,601
For the last time, I said no!
Go back to your studies!

332
00:29:56,057 --> 00:29:58,962
Sir, you know "Miss Trot," right?

333
00:29:58,987 --> 00:30:02,204
My uncle is the producer of that show.
I'll let you meet her.

334
00:30:02,229 --> 00:30:04,045
Song Ga-in.

335
00:30:07,586 --> 00:30:08,586
You mean it?

336
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:17,338
Let's search the files,
starting from August 25 at 5 p.m.

337
00:30:17,363 --> 00:30:19,670
Okay, look for someone
between 174 and 175

338
00:30:19,695 --> 00:30:22,161
centimeters tall who is
wearing red Converses.

339
00:30:22,816 --> 00:30:24,888
Focus. This is for Picaseo.

340
00:30:25,295 --> 00:30:26,533
For Picaseo.

341
00:30:26,804 --> 00:30:29,034
Hold it! No, wait.

342
00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:30,663
- What?
- Sorry.

343
00:30:30,688 --> 00:30:31,688
Hold on!

344
00:30:32,601 --> 00:30:33,839
It's hot. Let go.

345
00:30:33,864 --> 00:30:35,892
- Can you even see anything?
- Yup, I can see well.

346
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,773
Sorry for doubting you, Hawk Eyes.

347
00:30:45,325 --> 00:30:46,515
Wait! Stop right there!

348
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:50,518
- I think that's him!
- Hang on.

349
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,776
But I can't see his face.
The camera's too far.

350
00:30:55,931 --> 00:30:56,931
Wait a second!

351
00:30:57,131 --> 00:30:58,456
That white Avante!

352
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:01,276
That's the math teacher's car!

353
00:31:01,478 --> 00:31:02,478
And?

354
00:31:02,644 --> 00:31:04,469
We got you now, you serial jerker!

355
00:31:09,612 --> 00:31:12,660
- What time on August 25?
- 5:25 p.m.

356
00:31:16,546 --> 00:31:17,649
There he is!

357
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:24,418
What's wrong?

358
00:31:26,494 --> 00:31:27,494
What is it?

359
00:31:34,582 --> 00:31:35,812
You may go.

360
00:31:43,624 --> 00:31:45,203
Is it really you?

361
00:31:46,317 --> 00:31:48,833
It's a lonely life.

362
00:31:51,594 --> 00:31:56,268
Cut the nonsense! How dare you
go around terrorizing the school?

363
00:31:56,293 --> 00:31:57,998
Are you a dog?

364
00:32:14,037 --> 00:32:15,712
- Great job.
- You made it.

365
00:32:15,793 --> 00:32:17,253
We believed in you.

366
00:32:18,551 --> 00:32:20,439
Thank you so much.

367
00:32:20,983 --> 00:32:24,331
Anyway, how could he do something
like that? It's freaking creepy.

368
00:32:24,356 --> 00:32:27,485
That jerk asked Ye-kyung
out, but she rejected him.

369
00:32:27,751 --> 00:32:30,417
- What? That's why he framed Jae-min?
- Yeah.

370
00:32:33,144 --> 00:32:35,748
It has actually been 99 days
since I stopped doing it.

371
00:32:37,697 --> 00:32:41,094
- Go, Picaseo! - You said you're
gonna confess to your crush.

372
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,967
His nickname is Five Freedoms.

373
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:50,811
- If you say it in a different
way, it means... - My cock...

374
00:32:51,251 --> 00:32:55,584
- That pervert! - I can't believe
he was our club president.

375
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:00,013
Anyway, thanks to you guys,
I was able to clear my name.

376
00:33:00,206 --> 00:33:01,206
Thanks a lot.

377
00:33:01,692 --> 00:33:03,858
Please refrain from
using words like "clear."

378
00:33:03,883 --> 00:33:06,715
- Yeah.
- Don't touch me.

379
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:13,416
"Until the East Sea's waves are
dry and Mount Baekdu wears away."

380
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:15,575
Quiet. Leave me alone.

381
00:33:25,328 --> 00:33:27,090
But I heard that wasn't Seo Jae-min.

382
00:33:27,115 --> 00:33:29,401
The teacher gave him a hard time about it.

383
00:33:29,562 --> 00:33:32,443
You guys heard, right?
Jae-min isn't the culprit.

384
00:33:32,514 --> 00:33:35,040
He only jerks off at home.

385
00:33:35,233 --> 00:33:36,273
- And...
- Hey!

386
00:33:36,298 --> 00:33:37,522
He didn't do it for 100 days.

387
00:33:37,547 --> 00:33:40,102
You guys know that's impossible, right?
He's freaking awesome.

388
00:33:40,127 --> 00:33:41,713
Shut your mouth!

389
00:33:46,604 --> 00:33:48,104
Come on, man. Don't be mad.

390
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:15,722
- Honey, my legs are killing me.
- Really?

391
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:19,299
Jeez, it'd be nice if
someone gave up their seat!

392
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:21,116
I know! Gosh!

393
00:34:21,557 --> 00:34:23,937
- Your legs hurt, huh?
- Yes, I'm in so much pain.

394
00:34:24,347 --> 00:34:26,965
- You can sit here.
- Thanks.

395
00:34:27,794 --> 00:34:29,492
That bench is taken.

396
00:34:33,124 --> 00:34:34,124
Let's go.

397
00:34:35,857 --> 00:34:36,857
Ye-kyung.

398
00:34:39,957 --> 00:34:40,957
Sit down.

399
00:34:47,093 --> 00:34:48,293
This is me, right?

400
00:34:48,318 --> 00:34:50,076
(Hoping To Not Reach You)

401
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:54,869
And you're the male lead?

402
00:34:57,397 --> 00:35:00,040
So you didn't watch porn for 100 days?

403
00:35:00,448 --> 00:35:05,749
Yeah, you said guys who do
that are like wild animals.

404
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:07,772
That's why I stopped.

405
00:35:10,856 --> 00:35:12,483
But why do I look like this?

406
00:35:13,102 --> 00:35:16,239
- You don't like it?
- No, it's pretty.

407
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:18,482
And the story is nice.

408
00:35:22,855 --> 00:35:25,399
But the last bubble is empty.

409
00:35:29,424 --> 00:35:32,352
Wh-What do you think she'll say?

410
00:35:33,706 --> 00:35:36,880
I'm not sure.
I don't think I'd say anything.

411
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:38,843
Then what would you do?

412
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,380
Kiss!

413
00:35:58,087 --> 00:35:59,087
What?

414
00:35:59,197 --> 00:36:00,920
I'd kiss him like this!

415
00:36:07,614 --> 00:36:12,907
I sincerely want to be
someone good for you.

416
00:36:13,907 --> 00:36:15,359
- I really like you...
- Seo Jae-min!

417
00:36:16,116 --> 00:36:17,116
Huh?

418
00:36:17,243 --> 00:36:18,441
The truth is...

419
00:36:25,379 --> 00:36:26,490
I go for looks.

420
00:36:27,732 --> 00:36:31,533
- What?
- And I like buff guys, too.

421
00:36:31,783 --> 00:36:32,783
Oh.

422
00:36:35,931 --> 00:36:38,248
And I'm going to date in college.

423
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,037
Let's be college sweethearts.

424
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:44,596
College sweethearts?

425
00:36:45,655 --> 00:36:46,655
It's better that way.

426
00:36:48,952 --> 00:36:50,865
Which university are you going to?

427
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:53,341
Either Seoul National
University or Yonsei University.

428
00:36:55,649 --> 00:36:59,578
Oh, but we don't have to go
to the same college, right?

429
00:36:59,603 --> 00:37:01,550
Sure, you can go to
whatever college you want.

430
00:37:02,157 --> 00:37:03,664
Cool. Thanks.

431
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:06,466
Let's do our best until we take the SAT.

432
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,820
Sure.

433
00:37:09,471 --> 00:37:10,471
Promise me.

434
00:37:19,175 --> 00:37:22,396
I reached you.

435
00:37:26,164 --> 00:37:27,418

Honestly,
you won't experience a huge miracle

438
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:49,052
just because you didn't
do it for 100 days.

439
00:37:50,231 --> 00:37:51,935
But one small miracle is that...

440
00:37:52,845 --> 00:37:54,773
- 1, 2, 3, 4!
- 1, 2, 3, 4!

441
00:38:11,658 --> 00:38:15,126
I can do the stingray
dance with the girl I like.

442
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:17,948
That's good enough for me.
