1
00:00:16,747 --> 00:00:20,136
(Adult Trainee)

2
00:00:52,881 --> 00:00:56,626
What should I say at times like this?

3
00:00:58,974 --> 00:01:01,181
Say something!

4
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:03,263
It's cold.

5
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,447
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.

6
00:01:19,297 --> 00:01:21,042
What does he mean by "let's go inside"?

7
00:01:21,617 --> 00:01:22,617
Is he saying...

8
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,379
we should go do something inside?

9
00:01:27,894 --> 00:01:29,306
Why is he taking a shower?

10
00:01:30,802 --> 00:01:32,682
Did he get the wrong idea
because of the condom?

11
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:35,367
Gosh, what do I do?

12
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:12,318
What is he to me now?

13
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:14,965
A guy friend?

14
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:17,149
Friends with benefits?

15
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:19,501
Or a boyfriend?

16
00:02:22,603 --> 00:02:23,803
- Da-hyun.
- Hmm?

17
00:02:24,428 --> 00:02:27,126
I was reading online posts earlier...

18
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:31,392
but what is the physical touch that
marks the beginning of a relationship?

19
00:02:31,714 --> 00:02:38,294
For example,
what if he touched your back a bit?

20
00:02:38,428 --> 00:02:40,673
What is that? Does that mean
they crossed the line?

21
00:02:41,773 --> 00:02:43,272
Not the front but the back?

22
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:47,633
- So you mean the waist?
- A bit higher than that.

23
00:02:47,658 --> 00:02:49,041
- The spine?
- Kind of.

24
00:02:49,313 --> 00:02:51,876
It's kind of ambiguous to say
they crossed the line.

25
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:56,000
- Really?
- Yeah. I mean, unless he was kissing her.

26
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,257
They kissed, too!
That means they're dating, right?

27
00:02:59,282 --> 00:03:01,717
- If they kissed, you're definitely dating!
- Right?

28
00:03:01,929 --> 00:03:03,722
They kissed, and he touched her spine!

29
00:03:03,747 --> 00:03:07,136
So it was a silent agreement, right?
That they're starting to date, right?

30
00:03:07,673 --> 00:03:09,951
Yup. But why do you ask?

31
00:03:10,478 --> 00:03:11,803
Just curious.

32
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:23,702
What?

33
00:03:34,186 --> 00:03:37,066
But did you guys sleep outside?
There were blankets out there.

34
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,974
No! We didn't!

35
00:03:39,443 --> 00:03:42,818
What's going on?
What did you guys do?

36
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:46,544
Gosh, you already know.
Just drop it.

37
00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:57,426
- Later.
- Bye.

38
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,490
Hey.

39
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,730
Don't you have anything to say to me?

40
00:04:03,095 --> 00:04:04,095
Like what?

41
00:04:04,503 --> 00:04:05,503
Never mind.

42
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:07,813
Hey.

43
00:04:30,656 --> 00:04:32,590
What's up with my face today?

44
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,668
It's kinda glowing.

45
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:44,469
My room has a great view.
A view of Kim Nam-ho.

46
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:51,961
What are you up to?

47
00:04:56,002 --> 00:04:58,375
What was that?
Why did he read it but ignore it?

48
00:05:04,732 --> 00:05:06,431
(Ban Yu-Ra)

49
00:05:19,692 --> 00:05:22,279
Now that we kissed, I will leave you!

50
00:05:22,568 --> 00:05:24,623
What the heck?
How did it suddenly end up like that?

51
00:05:24,648 --> 00:05:25,981
It's called reality.

52
00:05:27,146 --> 00:05:28,336
You know Heo Young-ji, right?

53
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,709
Her boyfriend dumped her right
after they slept together.

54
00:05:30,734 --> 00:05:32,664
What? Why does she always get dumped?

55
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:33,689
Don't you know?

56
00:05:33,714 --> 00:05:37,304
Men are not interested in
fish that they catch once.

57
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:41,244
- What? You should apologize.
- Whatever. Apologize to your face.

58
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:42,948
Apologize for what you just said!

59
00:05:42,973 --> 00:05:44,257
Oh, there's that.

60
00:05:45,544 --> 00:05:46,773
Apologize.

61
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,424
Do you want to go eat malatang later?

62
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:09,323
I'm going to the internet cafe.

63
00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:11,563
- With who?
- My academy friends.

64
00:06:12,643 --> 00:06:13,971
Should I come, too?

65
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,450
Why?

66
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,927
Is this jerk avoiding me?

67
00:06:28,631 --> 00:06:30,258
- Sweetie, where are you?
- School.

68
00:06:30,514 --> 00:06:33,197
- I don't see any students.
- Jeez.

69
00:06:34,957 --> 00:06:36,694
I'm on my way home.

70
00:06:37,068 --> 00:06:38,647
Gosh, alright.

71
00:06:38,957 --> 00:06:41,127
I'm going to make stew,
so buy a pack of tofu.

72
00:06:41,304 --> 00:06:43,423
And tell Nam-ho to join us for dinner.

73
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:46,894
- Why?
- His mom went to Jeju Island.

74
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:51,079
He's alone, and I'm sure he won't
eat a proper meal by himself.

75
00:06:51,385 --> 00:06:52,385
Okay.

76
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:15,305
Was he disappointed we didn't
go any further that day?

77
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,682
Or was he shocked that we
kissed before we started dating?

78
00:07:19,297 --> 00:07:20,979
Gosh, I don't think that's it.

79
00:07:21,463 --> 00:07:24,074
Yi-joon dumped me because
I didn't kiss him.

80
00:07:25,891 --> 00:07:31,454
Then was he anticipating
something more than a kiss?

81
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:39,092
- Can I come over?
- Where?

82
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:42,317
- Your place.
- No one's home though.

83
00:07:42,885 --> 00:07:44,678
- I know.
- You still wanna come over?

84
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,442
- Yeah.
- Are you crazy?

85
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,072
Perhaps.

86
00:07:53,619 --> 00:07:54,761
Whatever.

87
00:09:41,128 --> 00:09:42,128
What?

88
00:09:42,525 --> 00:09:44,080
Are you sleeping?

89
00:09:44,552 --> 00:09:45,552
No.

90
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,452
Then why aren't you opening the door?

91
00:09:48,477 --> 00:09:49,841
I told you. No one's home.

92
00:09:50,662 --> 00:09:53,035
I know. I still came here.

93
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,063
What's wrong with you?

94
00:09:58,773 --> 00:09:59,773
I don't know.

95
00:10:00,345 --> 00:10:01,345
So...

96
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,529
open the door before I change my mind.

97
00:10:04,554 --> 00:10:08,019
I mean, why do you keep asking me
to open the door to an empty house?

98
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,817
Don't tell me you're not home!

99
00:10:10,842 --> 00:10:13,134
How many times did I tell you?
No one's home!

100
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,067
Wow, seriously.

101
00:10:18,873 --> 00:10:20,222
Darn it.

102
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:34,929
Hey.

103
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,529
- What are you doing here?
- Are you having fun?

104
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,497
Do you like toying with people?

105
00:10:46,443 --> 00:10:47,736
"S loves N."

106
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,445
"Se-young loves..."

107
00:10:53,981 --> 00:10:55,131
"Nam-ho."

108
00:10:58,345 --> 00:10:59,345
Are you two...

109
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:02,409
dating?

110
00:11:02,937 --> 00:11:03,937
Are you guys...

111
00:11:04,794 --> 00:11:05,898
dating?

112
00:11:23,823 --> 00:11:24,823
Hey!

113
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,504
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm freaking embarrassed!

114
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:31,529
Of what?

115
00:11:31,554 --> 00:11:34,236
It's my fault for getting tangled
up with you in the first place.

116
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:36,858
I hope you two have a blast.
You guys even have couple tattoos.

117
00:11:36,883 --> 00:11:39,435
- You two are a match made in heaven!
- Are you kidding me?

118
00:11:40,277 --> 00:11:41,967
Why are you treating me like
I'm a scumbag?

119
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:45,152
Do you know that you're an even
bigger scumbag than Yi-joon?

120
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,938
If you're going to be like this...

121
00:11:54,573 --> 00:11:56,458
then we shouldn't see each other at all.

122
00:11:58,678 --> 00:12:00,511
What the hell are we even doing?

123
00:12:02,301 --> 00:12:03,301
Then...

124
00:12:05,302 --> 00:12:07,167
what was that back at the vacation house?

125
00:12:08,146 --> 00:12:09,146
That was...

126
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:17,101
Nam-ho.

127
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,443
What the heck?
You still didn't tell her?

128
00:12:34,407 --> 00:12:37,153
God, that's why I told
you to hurry up and do it!

129
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,370
I knew it.

130
00:12:47,457 --> 00:12:49,975
I already knew he was that kind of bastard.

131
00:13:00,242 --> 00:13:01,242
But...

132
00:13:02,984 --> 00:13:04,650
why does it hurt so much?

133
00:13:09,824 --> 00:13:12,284
It feels like my heart...
no, my entire body...

134
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,194
was ripped to pieces.

135
00:13:24,302 --> 00:13:25,889
From now on, I'm really...

136
00:13:30,158 --> 00:13:32,028
not going to go near any guy.

137
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,425
Why are you suddenly changing seats?

138
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,211
Aren't you going to sit next to Nam-ho?

139
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:13,111
You two fought, huh?

140
00:14:14,258 --> 00:14:15,814
We broke up.

141
00:14:16,451 --> 00:14:17,451
What?

142
00:14:22,212 --> 00:14:23,212
Why?

143
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,117
Personality difference?
Your parents? Or you're busy?

144
00:14:26,142 --> 00:14:29,278
Or did he cheat on you?

145
00:14:31,642 --> 00:14:33,269
Why did you guys break up?

146
00:14:59,179 --> 00:15:00,972
God, you're in my way.

147
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,650
Didn't we decide not to
see other for a while?

148
00:15:03,675 --> 00:15:05,684
We're in the same class.
What do you want me to do?

149
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:07,106
Get lost! Just piss off!

150
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:08,701
You piss off!

151
00:15:10,057 --> 00:15:13,080
We decided not to see each other.
So let's do just that.

152
00:15:14,935 --> 00:15:16,212
You won't have to wait long.

153
00:15:16,585 --> 00:15:17,863
It'll soon end up that way.

154
00:15:30,316 --> 00:15:31,316
Darn it!

155
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,580
That was so sad,
but I feel like I'm walking on eggshells!

156
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,569
This is why you shouldn't date
someone from the same class!

157
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,119
We all have to experience
the storm then!

158
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,995
But what are they going to do now?

159
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:48,188
Damn it. They should've made it last.

160
00:15:52,061 --> 00:15:55,235
Why did you break up with Nam-ho?

161
00:15:56,676 --> 00:15:58,700
I just think it's too bad.

162
00:15:58,974 --> 00:16:00,941
It was nice to go on double dates.

163
00:16:01,603 --> 00:16:03,833
And I feel sorry, too.

164
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,632
Why?

165
00:16:07,657 --> 00:16:11,180
It just feels like I'm
the only one who's happy.

166
00:16:14,418 --> 00:16:15,552
Let's talk later.

167
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:22,178
- Goodness!
- Ow!

168
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:26,252
How embarrassing! Your thighs are showing!

169
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,572
Quit it! God!

170
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,196
Why are we suddenly eating meat?

171
00:16:32,221 --> 00:16:33,554
We're going camping.

172
00:16:33,803 --> 00:16:36,089
What? Does that mean
Nam-ho is coming, too?

173
00:16:36,473 --> 00:16:38,909
Yes. His mother is the one
who made the reservations.

174
00:16:38,993 --> 00:16:39,993
I'm going home.

175
00:16:40,018 --> 00:16:43,119
We always go there every summer!
You can't miss out!

176
00:16:44,387 --> 00:16:47,672
After Nam-ho moves, we won't be
able to hang out like this anymore.

177
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,706
Nam-ho is moving?

178
00:16:53,705 --> 00:16:58,261
- Goodness, there's a lot of food.
- It looks delicious.

179
00:16:58,645 --> 00:16:59,994
There's pork belly, too.

180
00:17:01,031 --> 00:17:04,205
- Did you guys set the moving date?
- Yes, the third of next month.

181
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,327
That's not far away.
I still can't believe you're moving.

182
00:17:07,352 --> 00:17:08,623
Me neither.

183
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:11,077
Who knew I'd end up in Jeju Island?

184
00:17:11,543 --> 00:17:14,606
But you should be grateful for a
company that transfers you there.

185
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:18,326
What about Nam-ho?
Is he transferring schools?

186
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:20,715
It's the middle of the semester,
so we haven't decided yet.

187
00:17:21,235 --> 00:17:23,830
If he wants to go, I'll transfer
him during the second semester.

188
00:17:23,855 --> 00:17:26,142
Or I'll leave him in Seoul
and drop by once in a while.

189
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:29,882
- Gosh, that sounds difficult.
- I know.

190
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:36,620
- It's so nice.
- Right?

191
00:17:38,197 --> 00:17:41,506
Yu-Ra, go to the store with Nam-ho
and get some drinks and instant rice.

192
00:17:45,657 --> 00:17:48,466
What are you doing?
The store is far away. Go with her.

193
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,160
I don't have to.

194
00:17:50,885 --> 00:17:52,234
- Ouch!
- Go on.

195
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:15,210
Damn it. You have a death wish?

196
00:18:19,677 --> 00:18:21,590
What? Are you gonna report me?

197
00:18:21,615 --> 00:18:23,219
Yeah. To your mom.

198
00:18:23,626 --> 00:18:25,349
You little brat.
Give it to me.

199
00:18:25,374 --> 00:18:26,374
Delete it.

200
00:18:26,437 --> 00:18:27,437
Ow!

201
00:18:28,786 --> 00:18:30,867
Jeez.

202
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,741
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna post this on Instagram.

203
00:18:38,766 --> 00:18:39,989
You jerk! Delete it!

204
00:18:40,014 --> 00:18:41,976
- You delete it first!
- Give it to me!

205
00:18:42,001 --> 00:18:44,222
- You give it to me!
- Darn it!

206
00:18:44,496 --> 00:18:45,496
Ow!

207
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:48,449
Give it!

208
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,227
Take it.

209
00:18:54,826 --> 00:18:56,151
You don't think I can?

210
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,730
- Go on. Take it.
- I'll do it.

211
00:18:57,755 --> 00:18:59,355
- Go on.
- Don't move.

212
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,571
Hey!

213
00:19:06,351 --> 00:19:07,351
You little!

214
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:19,127
I said I was sorry!

215
00:19:21,148 --> 00:19:22,933
I really am...

216
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:57,038
Jeez.

217
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,513
Why are you so brainless?

218
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:14,112
You have to cook it slowly and gently.

219
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,544
I don't need to be a genius
to roast a marshmallow.

220
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:32,797
A long time ago, didn't you burn
your chopsticks trying to roast one?

221
00:20:32,822 --> 00:20:34,983
- When did I do that?
- I think it was in third grade.

222
00:20:35,963 --> 00:20:37,328
When we first came here.

223
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,737
Did something happen to your memory?

224
00:20:39,983 --> 00:20:41,435
That wasn't me.
That was my brother.

225
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,460
It was you.

226
00:20:42,485 --> 00:20:43,796
No, it wasn't!

227
00:20:43,922 --> 00:20:46,614
It was you. You freaking cried
because you burned your hair.

228
00:20:46,974 --> 00:20:48,680
- Oh.
- Why do you keep arguing with me?

229
00:20:54,794 --> 00:20:55,794
But...

230
00:20:57,218 --> 00:20:59,098
what will happen to your
girlfriend if you move?

231
00:20:59,123 --> 00:21:00,256
What's it to you?

232
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:02,974
Then again, you can't even last a
month with your fake girlfriend.

233
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,191
- You can't last a month with her.
- Just shut up.

234
00:21:11,908 --> 00:21:13,796
Why did you do that at the vacation house?

235
00:21:14,161 --> 00:21:16,526
- You have a girlfriend.
- I was drunk.

236
00:21:18,406 --> 00:21:19,914
Then why did you stop?

237
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:28,984
You were drunk anyway.
So why'd you stop?

238
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,624
I don't remember, so shut your trap.

239
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,381
Come to the rooftop later.

240
00:22:20,318 --> 00:22:22,016
I'll give you the autographed ball.

241
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,475
That's right.
He doesn't...

242
00:22:28,168 --> 00:22:29,168
have a phone.

243
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:44,008
(Sports Academy)

244
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:48,199
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hi.

245
00:22:49,356 --> 00:22:50,356
Hey.

246
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:51,994
Yu-Ra.

247
00:22:54,316 --> 00:22:57,260
- Do you know me?
- Yes, you're Nam-ho's friend.

248
00:22:57,456 --> 00:22:59,257
Why are you acting like we're friends?

249
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,201
Do you want a smoothie?
It'll be my treat.

250
00:23:02,627 --> 00:23:04,730
- Mom, you can head home first.
- All right.

251
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,752
She's your mom?

252
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:12,118
I had no idea my PE teacher was married.

253
00:23:12,495 --> 00:23:14,789
Oh, she's not.

254
00:23:15,579 --> 00:23:16,579
Nam-ho knows.

255
00:23:17,142 --> 00:23:19,904
He probably didn't tell you because
it'll spread around the school.

256
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:20,929
I see.

257
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:24,354
What the heck?
What does he take me for?

258
00:23:24,984 --> 00:23:27,024
I got hurt while doing figure
skating, so I quit.

259
00:23:27,629 --> 00:23:30,892
I had a hard time,
and my mom asked Nam-ho to help me.

260
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,738
I heard Nam-ho had a hard time
after he quit soccer, too.

261
00:23:35,217 --> 00:23:36,550
He said you helped him then.

262
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:41,286
Nam-ho told me a lot about you.

263
00:23:42,556 --> 00:23:45,494
- What did he say?
- Gosh, he's so freaking timid!

264
00:23:45,783 --> 00:23:51,594
I told him to confess his feelings for
you, but he kept saying you don't like him!

265
00:23:52,768 --> 00:23:56,331
What? Aren't you his girlfriend?

266
00:23:57,391 --> 00:23:59,636
No. I have a girlfriend.

267
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:03,675
A girlfriend?

268
00:24:05,321 --> 00:24:06,702
Then what about that tattoo?

269
00:24:06,775 --> 00:24:09,108
Oh. I'm a fan of Son Heung-min, too.

270
00:24:09,937 --> 00:24:10,937
Wanna see?

271
00:24:11,373 --> 00:24:13,556
- "Son."
- That says "Son"?

(Garam High School: Kim Nam-ho)

273
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:37,820
Son Heung-min made a goal!

274
00:24:38,507 --> 00:24:39,507
Wow!

275
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,636
Because of that, Son Heung-min...

276
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:45,879
Hey.

277
00:24:48,868 --> 00:24:50,733
- Are you crying?
- Get lost.

278
00:24:53,922 --> 00:24:57,366
God, you're insane!
Why are you crying?

279
00:24:57,449 --> 00:24:59,528
Damn it. I said, get lost.

280
00:24:59,578 --> 00:25:02,036
There are so many things
to do besides soccer.

281
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,667
Besides, you weren't even that good at it!

282
00:25:05,108 --> 00:25:06,375
Are you kidding me?

283
00:25:07,094 --> 00:25:09,161
What are you so sad about? Huh?

284
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,429
Because you can't meet Son Heung-min?

285
00:25:11,454 --> 00:25:13,773
You can meet him even if
you're not a soccer player.

286
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:15,773
You can become a coach or a manager. Right?

287
00:25:16,652 --> 00:25:20,381
I saw a documentary, and there was
a trainer specializing in athletes.

288
00:25:22,675 --> 00:25:23,741
Don't tell me...

289
00:25:24,547 --> 00:25:26,874
you like him in that way.

290
00:25:28,331 --> 00:25:30,069
Do you swing that way?

291
00:25:32,478 --> 00:25:33,478
Are you nuts?

292
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:36,303
Is that why you have
zero interest in girls?

293
00:25:37,253 --> 00:25:40,983
- I have a lot of interest in girls.
- Yeah, right.

294
00:25:41,353 --> 00:25:43,876
Take a look at this.
I'll find it for you.

295
00:25:45,445 --> 00:25:46,712
An athlete trainer.

296
00:25:47,057 --> 00:25:50,367
"When there is an injured player
in a soccer game or anywhere else,

297
00:25:50,392 --> 00:25:53,457
the trainer is like a staff who
enters the scene with a bag..."

298
00:26:24,056 --> 00:26:26,326
You have great manners.
You even walked me home.

299
00:26:28,363 --> 00:26:30,807
If Nam-ho leaves, you'll be bored.
Call me anytime.

300
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:32,133
Okay.

301
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,230
What should I do now?

302
00:26:35,481 --> 00:26:38,123
Just be honest and tell him everything.

303
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:44,836
Tell your mom...

304
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,461
that she's super cool for
raising you by herself.

305
00:26:48,486 --> 00:26:50,137
It's like she's from an American drama.

So...

307

she doesn't have to hide anything.

Hey, Nam-ho. You should've
told me sooner, you punk.

We've built a strong
friendship for a long time.

much, I'll go out with you.

324
00:29:34,242 --> 00:29:36,852
Did you prepare this?

325
00:29:43,838 --> 00:29:45,210
That's so sexy!

326
00:29:56,064 --> 00:29:57,683
Surprise!

327
00:30:04,443 --> 00:30:06,375
(Starting from today, we're dating again.)

328
00:30:09,723 --> 00:30:10,723
No.

329
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,423
- I didn't do this.
- What?

330
00:30:13,448 --> 00:30:15,972
We prepared this with
the hopes that Garam High

331
00:30:15,997 --> 00:30:18,775
School's hottest couple will
get back together again!

332
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,994
To support your endless
long-distance relationship!

333
00:30:24,484 --> 00:30:31,616
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

334
00:30:31,894 --> 00:30:32,894
Kiss...

335
00:30:49,129 --> 00:30:51,764
A high school girl who was publicly
rejected after a public event.

336
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:52,789
How embarrassing.

337
00:30:53,078 --> 00:30:54,117
The guy was firm.

338
00:30:54,142 --> 00:30:55,919
Don't students study these days?

339
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,217
That inflexible bastard! How could
he do that with everyone watching us?

340
00:31:00,242 --> 00:31:02,395
He should've just said that he did it!

341
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,206
I can't believe this!

342
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,288
God, what's wrong with him?

343
00:31:09,364 --> 00:31:11,039
Does he really like me?

344
00:31:11,709 --> 00:31:12,709
That punk!

345
00:31:16,594 --> 00:31:17,594
Hey!

346
00:31:21,566 --> 00:31:24,502
I love you.

347
00:31:46,526 --> 00:31:47,859
- Goodness.
- Ouch!

348
00:31:51,522 --> 00:31:52,522
Argh!

349
00:32:02,973 --> 00:32:05,140
Just as people forget
things at different speeds,

350
00:32:06,307 --> 00:32:09,173
they confirm love at different speeds.

351
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:18,720
I realize now that we were slowly
getting sweeter over an open fire...

352
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,330
and not a burner.

353
00:32:29,301 --> 00:32:32,397
Why did you block your window?
Don't you air out your room?

354
00:32:34,848 --> 00:32:39,685
- I get easily hurt more than you think.
- I know.

355
00:32:39,947 --> 00:32:43,280
- I cry a lot when others don't see me.
- I know.

356
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:47,334
I get angry really easily,
and I say a lot of mean things.

357
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:48,826
I know that damn well.

358
00:32:50,111 --> 00:32:54,111
I want to be cool, but that never
works out, so I just lose my temper.

359
00:32:54,464 --> 00:32:57,583
I don't want to hurt my pride,
so I don't say anything when I'm jealous.

360
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:04,286
I'm scared of getting hurt, so I put up
walls, pretend to be strong, and get angry.

361
00:33:07,645 --> 00:33:08,994
That's the real me.

362
00:33:10,808 --> 00:33:11,808
But do you...

363
00:33:14,907 --> 00:33:16,351
still want to date me?

364
00:33:25,353 --> 00:33:26,353
Yes.

365
00:33:58,603 --> 00:33:59,603
Hold on.

366
00:34:02,338 --> 00:34:08,822
Now that you've confessed, I hope
we can get to know each other first.

367
00:34:08,988 --> 00:34:10,630
But we've known each other for 18 years.

368
00:34:10,655 --> 00:34:11,922
I thought about it,

369
00:34:12,807 --> 00:34:14,942
and I like staying conservative.

370
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:17,692
I grew up that way,
so what can I do about it now?

371
00:34:17,981 --> 00:34:20,172
You said everyone forgets
things at their own speed.

372
00:34:20,627 --> 00:34:23,175
That means everyone opens up
their heart at their own speed.

373
00:34:24,814 --> 00:34:25,814
Then...

374
00:34:26,576 --> 00:34:28,171
how much did your heart open up?

375
00:34:29,836 --> 00:34:32,280
Let's start with holding hands first.

376
00:34:39,028 --> 00:34:40,662
- By the way...
- Yeah?

377
00:34:41,563 --> 00:34:44,348
- Why did you stop kissing me
at the vacation house? - Damn it.

378
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:47,454
- Why are you asking me that again?
- You like me.

379
00:34:47,479 --> 00:34:49,065
So why on earth did you stop?

380
00:34:50,158 --> 00:34:52,475
- I told you. I don't remember.
- You better spit it out.

381
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,758
Because you might be scared.

382
00:34:58,163 --> 00:34:59,849
- Yeah, right.
- Whatever.

383
00:34:59,978 --> 00:35:02,502
Tell me! What's the reason?

384
00:35:02,527 --> 00:35:03,927
It was my first time!

385
00:35:04,156 --> 00:35:06,227
It was my first kiss!
My first everything!

386
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,024
- You happy now?
- Wow!

387
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:11,956
You kept teasing me,
but you were clueless, too!

388
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:14,362
Jeez.

389
00:35:15,685 --> 00:35:19,090
I'm not clueless.
I just stayed in the line.

390
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,325
Whatever.

391
00:35:20,922 --> 00:35:23,722
And you learned terrible
things from Yi-joon!

392
00:35:24,374 --> 00:35:26,620
You kissed me before
we officially went out!

393
00:35:26,645 --> 00:35:31,458
Wow, you're from Joseon, aren't you?
Who are you calling conservative?

394
00:35:31,582 --> 00:35:35,598
- You little brat!
- Ouch. Let go. I'm not gonna hold back.

395
00:35:35,623 --> 00:35:38,530
- Go ahead then.
- I'm really going to do it!

396
00:35:43,853 --> 00:35:45,920
- Go over there!
- Okay, okay.

397
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:48,877
Did you and Nam-ho decide to date?

398
00:35:48,902 --> 00:35:50,624
Yup. We did.

399
00:35:53,423 --> 00:35:55,241
Yu-Ra, I'm really sorry.

400
00:35:55,902 --> 00:35:57,302
I told you. It's okay.

401
00:35:57,327 --> 00:35:58,745
We're really sorry.

402
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,991
We didn't know things would
get out of hand like this.

403
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,210
Let's...

404
00:36:11,872 --> 00:36:13,459
stay apart from each other for a while.

405
00:36:14,023 --> 00:36:15,023
What?

406
00:36:15,287 --> 00:36:17,336
I met a new friend recently.

407
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:21,894
Strangely enough, she told me
everything even though we just met.

408
00:36:22,915 --> 00:36:27,145
We called each other "best friends,"
but I was never honest with you.

409
00:36:27,706 --> 00:36:30,031
I lied because I didn't
want to lose to you,

410
00:36:30,056 --> 00:36:32,031
and I was passive-aggressive with you.

411
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,027
You were like that, too.

412
00:36:34,618 --> 00:36:37,618
You two are nice people.
You make a great couple.

413
00:36:39,473 --> 00:36:43,210
But honestly, I feel a bit
uncomfortable around you guys right now.

414
00:36:43,612 --> 00:36:48,786
I'll stay away from you
until I truly feel comfortable.

415
00:36:52,518 --> 00:36:53,518
I'm sorry.

416
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:55,778
I'm not a cool person.

417
00:37:17,795 --> 00:37:18,795
I'm...

418
00:37:19,557 --> 00:37:20,858
ready now.

419
00:37:24,182 --> 00:37:25,182
Here I go.

420
00:37:35,773 --> 00:37:38,677
No! Tilt your head more!

421
00:37:38,702 --> 00:37:39,829
More than this?

422
00:37:41,184 --> 00:37:42,184
Like this?

423
00:37:42,731 --> 00:37:44,191
Nam-ho is coming tomorrow.

424
00:37:44,216 --> 00:37:46,162
At this rate,
will you be able to sleep with him?

425
00:37:46,187 --> 00:37:48,450
How can I get immersed
in this pillow?

426
00:37:48,501 --> 00:37:51,461
And what I want to know is
what happens after the kiss.

427
00:37:51,486 --> 00:37:54,433
The kiss is the beginning of everything!

428
00:37:54,545 --> 00:37:56,814
Are you just going to
dive right in without it?

429
00:37:57,939 --> 00:38:00,169
Do you know a lot of things?

430
00:38:00,864 --> 00:38:01,864
No.

431
00:38:01,889 --> 00:38:04,744
- Gosh.
- Hey, wanna watch porn?

432
00:38:05,758 --> 00:38:06,813
Oh my god! Hey!

433
00:38:07,091 --> 00:38:09,027
That's a fantastic idea.
Turn it on.

434
00:38:09,459 --> 00:38:10,561
Hang on.

435
00:38:12,447 --> 00:38:13,447
It's Nam-ho!

436
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,506
- What are you two doing?
- Dating.

437
00:38:17,492 --> 00:38:19,270
- Jeez.
- What time will you be here?

438
00:38:19,295 --> 00:38:21,246
- I want to see you soon.
- Open the window.

439
00:38:23,403 --> 00:38:24,403
Is he here?

440
00:38:32,555 --> 00:38:34,364
- God.
- There's a lot of fine dust, huh?

441
00:38:34,389 --> 00:38:35,389
What the hell?

442
00:38:36,473 --> 00:38:38,226
Enough with your dad jokes!

443
00:38:38,251 --> 00:38:41,656
I told you I'm coming tomorrow.
I'm not the type to do special events.

444
00:38:41,899 --> 00:38:43,986
God, I miss you so much.

445
00:38:44,011 --> 00:38:45,494
I miss you, too!

446
00:38:46,276 --> 00:38:48,062
You'd better hurry up. You promised.

447
00:38:48,803 --> 00:38:49,937
See you tomorrow.

448
00:38:50,271 --> 00:38:51,271
I love you.

449
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,007
I love you, too.

450
00:38:53,032 --> 00:38:57,181
- I love you this much.
- I love you this much, too.

451
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:03,334
It's not that cool, but we've changed a
little from what we really are like.

452
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:09,080
- (Adult Trainee)
- Because we're still freaking young.

453
00:39:48,189 --> 00:39:53,504
(I love you.)
