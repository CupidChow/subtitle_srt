1
00:00:17,742 --> 00:00:20,808
(Ban Yu-Ra: Conservative girl,
Kim Nam-ho's female friend)

2
00:00:31,463 --> 00:00:34,697
(Knowing Beast Kim Nam-ho: Huge fan of Son
Heung-min, Ban Yu-ra's male friend)

3
00:00:44,655 --> 00:00:46,607
What the heck!
Don't touch me!

4
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:49,378
Gosh.

5
00:02:04,092 --> 00:02:05,291
Jeez.

6
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,109
- Yu-Ra.
- Damn it.

7
00:02:15,071 --> 00:02:18,134
(Best friend: Kang Da-hyun
Ex-boyfriend: Song Yi-joon)

8
00:02:19,153 --> 00:02:20,780
Come on. What's wrong with you?

9
00:02:20,997 --> 00:02:23,489
We're dating.
That means we can kiss.

10
00:02:28,457 --> 00:02:30,712
Yu-Ra, I don't think I
can date you anymore.

11
00:02:31,984 --> 00:02:33,746
What? Are you dumping me?

12
00:02:35,234 --> 00:02:36,234
Are you two...

13
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:38,957
dating?

14
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:43,598
W-Well...

15
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:45,281
Yeah.

16
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:50,170
I'm sorry!

17
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,462
Why would you apologize?
It's been a month since we split.

18
00:02:59,487 --> 00:03:00,958
I need to change first.

19
00:03:01,183 --> 00:03:02,500
We'll talk about this later.

20
00:03:03,555 --> 00:03:04,722
Congrats.

21
00:03:10,352 --> 00:03:12,685
When did you guys start dating?

22
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:14,505
Um...

23
00:03:16,683 --> 00:03:19,206
- It's been 20 days.
- 20 days?

24
00:03:19,471 --> 00:03:22,432
Are you mad?

25
00:03:23,476 --> 00:03:25,976
What are you talking about?
Why would I be mad?

26
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:27,162
You are mad.

27
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,600
I was going to tell you first,
but Yi-joon said he really likes me.

28
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:42,198
You don't have to feel bad at all.
And I'm sincerely happy for you.

29
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:44,259
You mean it?

30
00:03:44,284 --> 00:03:46,371
Totally.
You two make a cute couple.

31
00:03:46,396 --> 00:03:50,477
Then can we tell everyone
that we're dating?

32
00:03:51,307 --> 00:03:52,307
Of course!

33
00:04:10,968 --> 00:04:13,668
(Adult Trainee)

34
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:31,243
Why the heck is Yi-joon
cheering for our class?

35
00:04:34,591 --> 00:04:37,313
Oh my god! Is the popular Song
Yi-joon dating Kang Da-hyun?

36
00:04:37,772 --> 00:04:40,409
Song Yi-joon and Kang Da-hyun are dating!

37
00:04:40,434 --> 00:04:43,800
Kang Da-hyun from class 3 and Song
Yi-joon from class 4 are dating!

38
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:44,983
The Song-Kang couple?

39
00:04:45,008 --> 00:04:47,120
- They're doing PDA.
- Poor Yu-Ra!

40
00:04:48,665 --> 00:04:51,261
That's too much!
This isn't some American TV show!

41
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,057
We're in Korea!

42
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:56,853
I'm not surprised.
Song Yi-joon's PDA is on another level.

43
00:04:58,326 --> 00:05:00,905
Damn. Yu-Ra must be pissed off.

44
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,964
I don't care about them at all.

45
00:05:03,325 --> 00:05:07,602
Even if my ex is dating my
bestie, I'm going to stay cool.

46
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,580
I'm so freaking cool.

47
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:54,126
I'm going to coolly win.

48
00:05:54,678 --> 00:05:55,918
Because I'm totally fine.

49
00:05:56,755 --> 00:05:57,862
Hurry up!

50
00:05:59,238 --> 00:06:00,627
Hurry!

51
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:16,819
Yu-Ra!

52
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:20,913
Are you okay?

53
00:06:21,049 --> 00:06:25,208
Would it be embarrassing
to get up or stay down?

54
00:06:28,858 --> 00:06:29,858
Is she dead?

55
00:06:29,883 --> 00:06:32,042
- Yu-Ra!
- Yu-Ra!

56
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,422
I think I lost the chance to get up.

57
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,957
Take out your camera!
Take pictures of them!

58
00:06:56,669 --> 00:06:57,890
Ditch the baton.

59
00:07:14,362 --> 00:07:15,362
Gosh!

60
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,661
Yu-Ra!
Yu-Ra!

61
00:07:23,372 --> 00:07:24,570
Yu-Ra!

62
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,466
Oh no!

63
00:07:26,995 --> 00:07:29,400
What if Yu-Ra doesn't wake up?

64
00:07:30,135 --> 00:07:32,301
The nurse said she'd get up soon.

65
00:07:32,772 --> 00:07:37,367
Her forehead landed right on the baton!

66
00:07:38,134 --> 00:07:39,134
Darn it!

67
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:42,079
What if she has a concussion?

68
00:07:43,146 --> 00:07:45,495
You're too scared, baby.

69
00:07:45,705 --> 00:07:46,705
Oh, please.

70
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,130
This is all my fault.

71
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:52,169
She was so mad at me that
she fell flat on her face.

72
00:07:52,474 --> 00:07:53,687
What the f-!

73
00:07:53,881 --> 00:07:56,754
Yu-Ra!

74
00:07:59,171 --> 00:08:00,211
Da-hyun.

75
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:01,933
Yu-Ra!

76
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,750
I want to be alone.

77
00:08:07,182 --> 00:08:10,022
Oh... okay...

78
00:08:13,061 --> 00:08:14,061
And...

79
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:16,751
I'm not mad.

80
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,633
Are you dumping me?

81
00:08:39,914 --> 00:08:42,755
Yeah. I don't want to date a
conservative girl like you.

82
00:08:43,831 --> 00:08:47,894
I want a girlfriend who grants my hand the
freedom to get physically close with her.

83
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,114
I hope you'll be happy with a boy who
is just as conservative as you are.

84
00:08:55,262 --> 00:08:58,112
Of course, it won't be easy to find
someone with a mindset like that.

85
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,307
Ugh!

86
00:09:03,818 --> 00:09:04,818
God.

87
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:09,148
Hey.

88
00:09:18,168 --> 00:09:21,081
- Copying Indian style?
- Yeah. Namaste, you jerk.

89
00:09:21,814 --> 00:09:22,814
Hey.

90
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,588
- Hey!
- What?

91
00:09:27,217 --> 00:09:29,218
- Damn, you've got a temper.
- What do you want?

92
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:30,926
- My mom wants you to take some kimchi.

93
00:09:30,951 --> 00:09:32,018
You little punk.

94
00:09:32,945 --> 00:09:34,295
- You mad about something?
- No!

95
00:09:35,926 --> 00:09:37,822
Is it because of Kang
Da-hyun and Song Yi-joon?

96
00:09:40,144 --> 00:09:41,897
I'm mad because of environmental pollution!

97
00:09:41,922 --> 00:09:44,598
I'm annoyed because of endless
problems in the Middle East!

98
00:09:44,623 --> 00:09:49,211
And I'm freaking pissed off
because innocent people are dying!

99
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:51,368
God! Jeez!

100
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:54,870
When will there be peace in this world?

101
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,802
- Argh!
- What the heck?

102
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:01,163
- Talk about disgraceful.
- Today's legendary video.

103
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,437
If that baton got stuck
in her forehead...

104
00:10:03,724 --> 00:10:04,794
Chupa Chups!

105
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:07,806
They're so rude! How can they
bad-mouth someone who got hurt?

106
00:10:08,252 --> 00:10:10,815
I'm going to report them all.
Report. Report.

107
00:10:10,962 --> 00:10:13,525
- Kim Nam-ho is so cool.
- He's boyfriend material.

108
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,662
- Check out his body!
- His face is a genre itself.

109
00:10:15,687 --> 00:10:17,807
- Are they dating?
- No, they're just good friends.

110
00:10:17,832 --> 00:10:20,246
If they date, it'd make history!

111
00:10:21,742 --> 00:10:23,735
History, my foot!

112
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:25,508
Song Yi-joon dumped her.

113
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:27,081
Kang Da-hyun stabbed her in the back.

114
00:10:27,106 --> 00:10:29,043
Then she fell flat on
the front of her head.

115
00:10:34,185 --> 00:10:36,122
Want to get some tteokbokki
before we go home?

116
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:38,943
I'm not that hungry.

117
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:41,762
- Come on, let's go!
- Maybe next time.

118
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:45,193
Please! Let's go eat! Come on!

119
00:10:45,218 --> 00:10:46,996
Why don't you just
go with Yi-joon?

120
00:10:50,822 --> 00:10:53,822
I mean, why would you ask me
when you can ask your boyfriend?

121
00:10:53,847 --> 00:10:56,959
By any chance, are you not over him yet?

122
00:10:56,984 --> 00:10:58,708
What are you saying?
It's not like that!

123
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:03,729
Yi-joon said he ended things with you,
so I thought you were completely over him.

124
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:08,480
He told me you two weren't anything
special, so I just believed him.

125
00:11:12,075 --> 00:11:15,337
If our relationship bothers you that
much, we'll wait.

126
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,921
- Until you get a boyfriend...
- No, I just...

127
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:19,946
Baby.

128
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,010
Joon!

129
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:28,615
I have a boyfriend!

130
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,640
- What?
- Huh?

131
00:11:29,718 --> 00:11:32,142
- What?
- Really? Who is it?

132
00:11:32,238 --> 00:11:34,659
If they date, it'd make history!

133
00:11:34,956 --> 00:11:36,233
Kim Nam-ho.

134
00:11:36,594 --> 00:11:37,681
Kim Nam-ho?

135
00:11:37,832 --> 00:11:41,101
God, he's definitely going to say no!

136
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:43,231
Jeez!

137
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,141
- (7 years ago)
- Let's play.

138
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,803
- No.
- (4 years ago)

139
00:11:58,828 --> 00:12:00,624
- Let's hang out!
- No!

140
00:12:01,081 --> 00:12:02,323
(2 years ago)

141
00:12:02,348 --> 00:12:04,339
Now that you can't play
soccer, let's hang out!

142
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:05,641
Hey!

143
00:12:14,586 --> 00:12:16,631
(Son Heung-min)

144
00:12:27,353 --> 00:12:28,947
Come to the rooftop right now.

145
00:12:29,585 --> 00:12:30,585
God!

146
00:12:32,103 --> 00:12:35,191
I became a loser who handed
over her ex to her best friend!

147
00:12:35,997 --> 00:12:38,679
On top of that,
people have been teasing me about this.

148
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:40,936
How am I going to fix my reputation?

149
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,280
Are you some kind of celebrity?

150
00:12:42,327 --> 00:12:44,081
No one cares about your reputation.

151
00:12:44,106 --> 00:12:46,592
Out of all the girls at our school,
I have the most followers.

152
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:49,253
I'm all over Instagram right now!

153
00:12:51,513 --> 00:12:52,830
Which brings me to my point...

154
00:12:53,668 --> 00:12:54,668
Do...

155
00:12:55,303 --> 00:12:56,303
you...

156
00:12:57,917 --> 00:12:59,178
want to...

157
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:03,492
pretend to go out with me?

158
00:13:05,616 --> 00:13:07,544
- Ugh.
- Are you out of your mind?

159
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:12,078
Dating is out of the question,
but let's just pretend we are.

160
00:13:12,103 --> 00:13:13,858
- Get lost!
- Hey.

161
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:19,618
Just look at us.
We're like a Hollywood couple.

162
00:13:19,726 --> 00:13:22,003
This totally screams "romance"!

163
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:25,865
You're a lunatic.

164
00:13:26,476 --> 00:13:29,104
That's why we need to pretend to date?
You and me?

165
00:13:29,331 --> 00:13:31,870
At least you're easy on the eyes.

166
00:13:32,914 --> 00:13:35,033
- Do you still have feelings for Yi-joon?
- Hell no!

167
00:13:35,058 --> 00:13:36,185
I dumped him, okay?

168
00:13:36,297 --> 00:13:37,622
So you do have feelings for him.

169
00:13:37,647 --> 00:13:40,093
Quit putting words in my mouth!
I said no!

170
00:13:40,692 --> 00:13:44,064
I'm going to make sure everyone
knows that I got a boyfriend first.

171
00:13:46,205 --> 00:13:47,713
So what if we pretend to date?

172
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:49,000
What's in it for me?

173
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:53,275
Honor?

174
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:54,402
Beat it.

175
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,590
(To Yu-jae: Yu-jae, call me when
you're out of the military - Heung-min)

176
00:14:01,615 --> 00:14:03,611
You know my brother went
to the marines, right?

177
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:10,276
And that he got close to Son
Heung-min during training, right?

178
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:13,635
Heung-min's fingerprints are on this?

179
00:14:14,862 --> 00:14:16,462
Probably his sweat, too.

180
00:14:18,144 --> 00:14:21,287
If you pretend we're dating for 100
days, I'll give you this.

181
00:14:29,356 --> 00:14:31,925
(kkang_da_hyun and 1,369
people liked your post.)

182
00:14:44,277 --> 00:14:45,915
(#Kim Nam-ho
#Ban Yu-Ra)

183
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,358
What's the difference between
dating and pretending to date?

184
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:52,085
No PDA.

185
00:14:53,802 --> 00:14:56,087
- No PDA?
- No PDA.

186
00:14:56,112 --> 00:14:57,158
- Holding hands?
- Nope.

187
00:14:57,177 --> 00:14:58,177
- Arms?
- No.

188
00:14:58,202 --> 00:15:00,867
Hugs, pecks, kisses,
and physical touching are forbidden.

189
00:15:00,892 --> 00:15:02,485
You conservative girl.

190
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,519
'Girl, hey conservative girl!'

191
00:15:04,544 --> 00:15:06,352
'The conservative one!'

192
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,507
What are you saying?
Who are you calling "conservative"?

193
00:15:09,532 --> 00:15:10,713
You wanna die?

194
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:14,185
We're not really dating,
but you're putting up a wall.

195
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:15,822
You're the one who said no PDA.

196
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:18,006
- Don't cross the line.
- Are you kidding me?

197
00:15:18,031 --> 00:15:21,017
I'm not you.
I don't have any rated R thoughts.

198
00:15:22,784 --> 00:15:24,903
You haven't even gotten
past the rated pg-13 stage.

199
00:15:24,928 --> 00:15:28,080
It'd be better for you to go
back to Joseon and date Mencius.

200
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:30,902
Mencius isn't even from Joseon.

201
00:15:31,508 --> 00:15:33,905
And I told you to quit making dad jokes.

202
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:34,930
Yu-Ra!

203
00:15:37,642 --> 00:15:38,824
Make sure you play your part.

204
00:15:38,849 --> 00:15:40,705
Worry about yourself.
Hide your jealousy.

205
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:43,175
Shut up.
I told you I'm not jealous.

206
00:15:44,904 --> 00:15:46,506
Seriously? You two are really dating?

207
00:15:46,531 --> 00:15:48,309
Well, it just happened.

208
00:15:48,334 --> 00:15:50,644
Oh my gosh! You two look so cute together!

209
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,385
When did you guys start dating?

210
00:15:52,631 --> 00:15:53,750
About a month ago?

211
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:55,785
But why didn't you tell me?

212
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:59,790
I just thought it was rude
to start dating someone

213
00:15:59,815 --> 00:16:03,170
new right after you
broke up with your ex.

214
00:16:03,311 --> 00:16:06,431
I didn't. My baby felt really bad though.

215
00:16:06,728 --> 00:16:08,371
You don't have to feel sorry anymore.

216
00:16:08,396 --> 00:16:09,823
I'm super excited!

217
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,207
We should hang out together! How about
we go on a double date after school?

218
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,005
- Sure.
- Let's go!

219
00:16:18,931 --> 00:16:19,931
Darn it.

220
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:22,972
"Sure"?
Are you for real?

221
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:34,222
Let's discuss the stratum,
the layer of sedimentary rock.

222
00:16:34,606 --> 00:16:36,885
Through this, we can understand the

223
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,876
environment and gauge
the overturned strata.

224
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,872
Let's move on.

225
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,335
Cross-bedding structure.

226
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,089
It is the sedimentary structure
in which the upper and lower

227
00:16:45,114 --> 00:16:47,618
stratification surfaces are
not parallel but alternated.

228
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:51,557
It is produced where the direction of
shallow water or wind changes frequently.

229
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,896
The cross-bedding structure,
which has not been reversed,

230
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:57,698
has a concave layered surface
that is pointed downward.

231
00:16:57,844 --> 00:17:00,654
The lower part has a gentle
slope compared to the upper part.

232
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:02,323
Wanna go to a room cafe later?

233
00:17:08,442 --> 00:17:09,577
Sure!

234
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,864
Aren't you buying too much food?

235
00:17:16,889 --> 00:17:18,801
This is all included in the admission fee.

236
00:17:20,718 --> 00:17:21,718
Oh.

237
00:17:22,555 --> 00:17:26,356
- You've never been to a room cafe before?
- Of course I have!

238
00:17:26,971 --> 00:17:29,400
It's my first time here,
but there are more snacks.

239
00:18:34,231 --> 00:18:36,508
- What are you doing? Come on.
- Okay.

240
00:18:39,842 --> 00:18:41,342
Did you have fun?

241
00:18:49,451 --> 00:18:50,612
(Couple Marble)

242
00:18:50,637 --> 00:18:52,256
(Kidult Jenga)

243
00:19:02,311 --> 00:19:04,604
I thought she wanted to go on
a double date. What's this?

244
00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:06,876
You didn't really want to
hang out with them, did you?

245
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:09,641
What? What's wrong with that?
I'm freaking cool.

246
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:10,887
Gosh.

247
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:27,335
Darn it!

248
00:19:52,122 --> 00:19:57,015
- No! They'll hear us!
- It's fine. It's soundproof.

249
00:19:57,552 --> 00:19:59,671
Soundproof, my foot!
More like Dolby Atmos.

250
00:19:59,972 --> 00:20:01,147
It's not soundproof...

251
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:04,571
If you scream now, what will they think?

252
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:06,782
That you're jealous.

253
00:20:07,569 --> 00:20:10,077
- Right?
- I said you can't!

254
00:20:10,236 --> 00:20:12,407
- It's okay.
- Yi-joon!

255
00:20:12,432 --> 00:20:13,432
It's fine. It's fine.

256
00:20:14,694 --> 00:20:18,202
Kim Nam-ho, don't do this!

257
00:20:18,428 --> 00:20:20,532
What the hell is your problem?
Have you gone mad?

258
00:20:21,056 --> 00:20:24,392
We did it yesterday, too!
Let's take a break today!

259
00:20:26,257 --> 00:20:29,431
Hey, it tickles!

260
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:34,699
Hey!

261
00:20:37,997 --> 00:20:40,672
(Time to face reality.)

262
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:41,969
Don't overdo it.

263
00:20:42,843 --> 00:20:43,843
What?

264
00:20:44,863 --> 00:20:46,053
Your terrible acting skills.

265
00:20:46,325 --> 00:20:48,388
It's freaking obvious
you've never done it before.

266
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:51,860
- I know the basics.
- You obviously got it from movies.

267
00:20:52,196 --> 00:20:54,993
"Nam-ho, don't do this!"

268
00:20:55,018 --> 00:20:56,691
- Were we hiking?
- Knock it off.

269
00:20:56,716 --> 00:20:59,416
"It tickles!"
Did you get bitten by a mosquito?

270
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:00,797
I said, cut it out!

271
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,917
Tomorrow at 8. You know, right?

272
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:17,843
Yeah.

273
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,038
You're dead if you're late.

274
00:21:32,176 --> 00:21:33,302
Oh my god.

275
00:21:40,016 --> 00:21:41,421
I must be out of my mind.

276
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,480
Whatcha' lookin at?

277
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,822
Are you a pervert?

278
00:22:00,618 --> 00:22:01,618
That little...

279
00:22:02,825 --> 00:22:03,976
You're crazy.

280
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,883
Stalker.

281
00:22:07,323 --> 00:22:08,387
Cut the crap.

282
00:22:09,008 --> 00:22:10,690
- You.
- What?

283
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,661
- Don't look at me!
- She's at it again.

284
00:22:13,686 --> 00:22:16,235
- Quit looking at me.
- What do you want?

285
00:22:16,683 --> 00:22:18,092
- Piss off.
- Are you insane?

286
00:22:18,606 --> 00:22:20,737
I'm not gonna give you the
autographed ball!

287
00:22:20,936 --> 00:22:22,190
Get lost.

288
00:22:25,443 --> 00:22:28,474
We're not even really dating, so do
we have to celebrate our anniversary?

289
00:22:28,878 --> 00:22:31,678
They're at 30 days and we're at 40.
It's a group event.

290
00:22:32,395 --> 00:22:34,704
Why do you guys always want
to do everything together?

291
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:36,215
Because we're besties.

292
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:37,533
You two are friends?

293
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,782
She's dating your ex,
and you're not even talking to her.

294
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:43,506
And now you're pretending to date
me because your ego is bruised.

295
00:22:45,209 --> 00:22:47,335
Girls have complicated friendships.

296
00:22:54,911 --> 00:22:57,156
My mind is getting freaking complicated.

297
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:05,697
Oh my god. How can they do
that in front of everyone?

298
00:23:06,182 --> 00:23:08,714
I want to take a picture there, too!

299
00:23:09,498 --> 00:23:11,100
Let's just go ride a rollercoaster.

300
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:12,213
Let's take a picture!

301
00:23:12,238 --> 00:23:15,436
Taking a memorable photo in front
of the carousel is all the rage!

302
00:23:15,939 --> 00:23:17,470
Let's go! Let's go!

303
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,714
- Wow!
- Oh my gosh.

304
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,922
- Everyone is taking pictures like that.
- God, I hate things like this!

305
00:23:33,634 --> 00:23:34,808
You think I don't?

306
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,983
- We'll just take a picture for them.
- Sounds good.

307
00:23:49,118 --> 00:23:52,975
- Awww!
- I'm jealous!

308
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,310
- They're so cute!
- They're picture perfect!

309
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,202
- So cool!
- You guys look great!

310
00:24:07,565 --> 00:24:09,145
- What about you guys?
- We're good.

311
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,004
Why? We came all the way here! Go!

312
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:14,953
Go on!

313
00:24:23,845 --> 00:24:25,702
What's going on?
Are you two social distancing?

314
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:28,174
Get closer to each other!

315
00:24:33,283 --> 00:24:35,569
What's up with you guys?
Are you even dating?

316
00:24:35,906 --> 00:24:38,088
Come on! Just go if you're
not going to take a picture!

317
00:24:38,113 --> 00:24:39,421
Yeah, get moving.

318
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:42,155
- Can't you see we're waiting?
- I know.

319
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:43,428
This is boring.

320
00:24:43,453 --> 00:24:45,652
Make it quick. Got it?

321
00:25:07,136 --> 00:25:09,588
I'm not going to give you the
ball that Son Heung-min signed.

322
00:25:17,615 --> 00:25:19,647
What? It looks like
they're really gonna do it.

323
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,018
- You're really gonna kiss me?
- Don't move.

324
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,981
- Ugh, come on.
- That's no fun.

325
00:25:38,471 --> 00:25:41,408
Of course, it won't be easy to find
someone with a mindset like that.

326
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,192
I'm really sorry. Okay?

327
00:26:30,751 --> 00:26:32,179
I got too absorbed in my role.

328
00:26:32,204 --> 00:26:33,204
Forget it.

329
00:26:33,664 --> 00:26:35,251
I don't want to do this anymore.

330
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,565
You always say you want to quit.

331
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,629
For an athlete, you have no endurance.

332
00:26:39,654 --> 00:26:42,132
Why are you getting mad?
I'm the one who suffered here.

333
00:26:42,238 --> 00:26:44,713
What do you mean "suffer"?
You freaking enjoyed it!

334
00:26:44,738 --> 00:26:47,383
You're the one who gave it
your all with your tongue.

335
00:26:48,102 --> 00:26:50,371
I did not! That was you!

336
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:54,177
- Shut up! I just used my
tongue to defend myself. - Wow.

337
00:26:54,202 --> 00:26:57,282
- You freaking attacked me with it.
- Whatever.

338
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,094
I'm done here.

339
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:01,319
We just kissed!
How can you quit now?

340
00:27:01,344 --> 00:27:02,780
You didn't kiss me!
You inhaled me!

341
00:27:02,805 --> 00:27:05,034
- Anyway, they saw us do it.
- Just say we broke up.

342
00:27:07,517 --> 00:27:08,517
Hey!

343
00:27:09,021 --> 00:27:10,021
Gosh.

344
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:11,291
Ouch!

345
00:27:22,868 --> 00:27:23,868
Ow!

346
00:27:24,114 --> 00:27:25,590
What are you doing?

347
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:28,252
Don't move.
It has to be iced.

348
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:46,361
It's cold.

349
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,848
I'm helping you.
Why are you getting annoyed?

350
00:27:49,873 --> 00:27:51,929
Don't you remember?
When you got hurt, I waited on

351
00:27:51,954 --> 00:27:53,889
you hand and foot because
your mom was too busy.

352
00:27:53,914 --> 00:27:56,241
You were always annoyed and
acted really mean to me.

353
00:27:56,562 --> 00:27:59,316
I let you whine about
not being able to play soccer.

354
00:27:59,341 --> 00:28:00,753
Compared to
that, this is nothing.

355
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:02,899
If you're grateful, just say thank you.

356
00:28:03,671 --> 00:28:05,155
Quit trying to act cool.

357
00:28:08,933 --> 00:28:10,655
Do they bother you that much?

358
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,647
Shut up! It's not like that.

359
00:28:14,105 --> 00:28:16,248
Why would you be hung
over on a jerk like that?

360
00:28:17,124 --> 00:28:18,298
You wanna die?

361
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:20,608
I told you I'm over him.

362
00:28:21,098 --> 00:28:23,126
Rather than being into
me, Yi-joon seemed to

363
00:28:23,151 --> 00:28:25,097
be more interested in the
fact that I was a girl.

364
00:28:25,434 --> 00:28:27,774
That's why there are more
bad memories than good ones.

365
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,080
But...

366
00:28:34,174 --> 00:28:35,441
he's my first love.

367
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:40,600
He was my first boyfriend.

368
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:45,317
I'm irritated that he can
forget about me so easily.

369
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:49,377
When I see them being all
lovey-dovey in front of me,

370
00:28:50,883 --> 00:28:51,883
I feel...

371
00:28:54,811 --> 00:28:57,782
smaller than the dust bunnies in my room.

372
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,559
People have different speeds in life.

373
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:13,452
It's just faster for Yi-joon.

374
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:17,409
And it's just slower for you.

375
00:29:18,547 --> 00:29:20,872
That's what upsets me.

376
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:41,991
Let's go. Ouch!

377
00:29:43,985 --> 00:29:45,207
Jeez.

378
00:29:46,543 --> 00:29:47,543
Get on my back.

379
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,560
No, thanks.

380
00:29:50,906 --> 00:29:52,413
Are you gonna fly home then?

381
00:29:54,011 --> 00:29:55,170
Just get on.
Hurry up.

382
00:30:02,054 --> 00:30:05,419
Was this punk's back always so wide?

383
00:30:06,692 --> 00:30:08,034
Ever since field day,

384
00:30:08,565 --> 00:30:11,153
you've been using me as transportation.

385
00:30:11,507 --> 00:30:13,220
That wasn't my intention.

386
00:30:14,837 --> 00:30:18,019
You know you're totally breaking
the "no touching" rule, right?

387
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:20,483
I'm even carrying you on my back now.

388
00:30:20,827 --> 00:30:23,169
Don't you think we need to
settle things once and for all?

389
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,439
- But Nam-ho...
- Yeah?

390
00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:27,467
I'm sorry.

391
00:30:28,287 --> 00:30:29,630
So you admit you're wrong, right?

392
00:30:30,408 --> 00:30:33,249
It's not that.
I really have to go.

393
00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:37,490
- Go where?
- I really have to go to the toilet!

394
00:30:37,515 --> 00:30:38,691
Damn it!

395
00:30:49,396 --> 00:30:51,419
I knew you were eating too much ice!

396
00:31:06,356 --> 00:31:07,623
What do you think you're doing?

397
00:31:10,688 --> 00:31:12,991
Wait here.
I'll call your mom.

398
00:31:13,016 --> 00:31:15,380
My parents went to a funeral.

399
00:31:18,157 --> 00:31:20,220
Are you trying to kill me today?

400
00:31:20,898 --> 00:31:22,866
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

401
00:31:29,603 --> 00:31:30,936
Nam-ho.

402
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,740
Yeah?

403
00:31:33,407 --> 00:31:34,922
You're still there, right?

404
00:31:35,172 --> 00:31:36,306
What do you want?

405
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,227
Don't go.

406
00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:40,109
Why not?

407
00:31:41,925 --> 00:31:44,020
Don't tell me you're
scared to be home alone.

408
00:31:44,992 --> 00:31:46,460
You're not a little kid!

409
00:31:46,857 --> 00:31:48,110
It's not that...

410
00:31:50,085 --> 00:31:53,259
- You have to help me out of here.
- Crap!

411
00:32:29,936 --> 00:32:30,936
What?

412
00:32:31,009 --> 00:32:33,675
- What are you looking at?
- I wasn't looking at anything!

413
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:38,027
You must think you're R-rated material,
but to me, you're nothing but G-rated!

414
00:32:38,342 --> 00:32:41,833
You're a freaking Disney movie!

415
00:32:41,858 --> 00:32:45,504
You sure about that? If I put my mind
to it, you'll be begging me for more.

416
00:32:45,529 --> 00:32:46,529
Jeez.

417
00:32:47,318 --> 00:32:50,217
You think I'm on the same level
as those girls you hook up with?

418
00:33:18,401 --> 00:33:19,583
What are you doing?

419
00:33:19,742 --> 00:33:20,901
Get off.

420
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,063
What are you gonna do?

421
00:33:30,302 --> 00:33:31,397
What?

422
00:33:33,392 --> 00:33:34,679
What do you want?

423
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,592
Why are you closing your eyes?

424
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:57,010
Gosh.

425
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,193
Use this for now.

426
00:34:26,218 --> 00:34:28,734
I have an ice pack at home,
so I'll bring it to you tomorrow.

427
00:34:31,885 --> 00:34:35,178
Don't move the ice just because it gets
in the way. Keep it on all night long.

428
00:34:35,203 --> 00:34:37,466
Or else, you won't be able
to walk tomorrow either.

429
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:39,463
Hey, Nam-ho.

430
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:42,125
Thanks...

431
00:34:43,228 --> 00:34:44,354
for today.

432
00:35:47,884 --> 00:35:49,084
Conservative girl.

433
00:35:57,117 --> 00:35:58,362
What was that?

434
00:36:18,047 --> 00:36:19,047
Hey!

435
00:36:46,551 --> 00:36:47,606
Why'd you leave first?

436
00:36:47,631 --> 00:36:49,892
Because I woke up early.

437
00:36:50,897 --> 00:36:52,830
- Do you feel better?
- Yup.

438
00:36:56,377 --> 00:36:58,012
You should keep icing it though.

439
00:37:11,617 --> 00:37:12,617
What?

440
00:37:14,238 --> 00:37:15,904
What are you looking at?

441
00:37:27,648 --> 00:37:28,648
It's strange.

442
00:37:31,352 --> 00:37:33,868
The guy friend I treated as a wild beast...

443
00:37:34,814 --> 00:37:36,973
is starting to look like a beastly man.

444
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:05,911
What do I do?

445
00:38:07,364 --> 00:38:10,564
It feels like someone put
a filter over my eyes.

446
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,974
