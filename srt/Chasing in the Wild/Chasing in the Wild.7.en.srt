1
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:13,116
@sevirous: I’m okay.
My body’s just a bit sore.

2
00:00:13,117 --> 00:00:14,952
@sevirous:
Because I fell for you.

3
00:00:16,162 --> 00:00:17,495
Sevi’s amazing, huh?

4
00:00:17,496 --> 00:00:18,830
You want to know why?

5
00:00:18,831 --> 00:00:20,331
It’s because he’s inspired…

6
00:00:20,332 --> 00:00:21,167
Because of you.

7
00:00:21,168 --> 00:00:22,584
- Really?
- Really!

8
00:00:22,585 --> 00:00:24,295
I think he really likes you.

9
00:00:24,435 --> 00:00:25,603
I’m really nervous.

10
00:00:25,909 --> 00:00:27,369
Believe in yourself.

11
00:00:27,673 --> 00:00:29,153
That’s why you’re
the only one for me.

12
00:00:29,467 --> 00:00:31,092
Just one word from you

13
00:00:31,093 --> 00:00:32,343
and I feel more confident.

14
00:00:32,344 --> 00:00:33,804
Wear this for Game 2, okay?

15
00:00:34,346 --> 00:00:36,014
I don’t think I can, Sev.

16
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:37,016
I’m sorry.

17
00:00:37,725 --> 00:00:39,017
Is this okay?

18
00:00:39,018 --> 00:00:41,312
You know I can’t
ruin the surprise.

19
00:00:41,604 --> 00:00:42,937
Don’t worry about it.

20
00:00:42,938 --> 00:00:45,191
It will all be worth it once
he sees your banner.

21
00:00:45,441 --> 00:00:46,275
Elyse?

22
00:00:46,276 --> 00:00:47,859
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

23
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,820
We’re just—
Working on a new project.

24
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:52,072
Can I take a look at it?

25
00:00:52,073 --> 00:00:53,908
Don’t be shy.
I just want to see it.

26
00:00:56,077 --> 00:00:58,328
Alfred?
You’re here.

27
00:00:58,329 --> 00:00:59,663
Come, I’ll prepare your food.

28
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:04,835
I’ll win this for you.

29
00:01:08,339 --> 00:01:09,840
I like you, Sevi.

30
00:02:21,912 --> 00:02:23,246
It looks good, right?

31
00:02:23,247 --> 00:02:24,247
Yes.

32
00:02:24,665 --> 00:02:26,250
- Can you taste it?
- Sure.

33
00:02:29,712 --> 00:02:31,005
That’s a mouthful!

34
00:02:37,887 --> 00:02:40,006
Why the hell is this so salty?

35
00:02:40,031 --> 00:02:41,031
Huh?

36
00:02:41,056 --> 00:02:42,682
It tastes like seawater.

37
00:02:42,683 --> 00:02:44,018
Seawater?

38
00:02:44,268 --> 00:02:45,436
Yes!

39
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:48,855
I guess I put a lot of salt…

40
00:02:48,856 --> 00:02:50,107
You think?

41
00:02:50,524 --> 00:02:52,442
Is this what you're
going to feed Sevi?

42
00:02:52,443 --> 00:02:53,902
He might just go home instead.

43
00:02:53,903 --> 00:02:55,445
What are we going to do?

44
00:02:55,565 --> 00:02:56,941
Should we just order out?

45
00:02:57,281 --> 00:02:59,657
But I do want to make an effort

46
00:02:59,658 --> 00:03:01,702
and I’m sure Sevi
would appreciate it.

47
00:03:03,913 --> 00:03:05,663
Let’s add cream.

48
00:03:05,664 --> 00:03:07,123
Let’s add more cream

49
00:03:07,124 --> 00:03:08,709
to lessen the saltiness.

50
00:03:09,293 --> 00:03:10,669
Think you can fix it?

51
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:14,923
Oh, shoot.

52
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,092
Oh my god, he’s here.

53
00:03:18,093 --> 00:03:19,177
- What are we going to do?
- Cream?

54
00:03:19,178 --> 00:03:20,637
- Good evening, sir.
- Cream?

55
00:03:20,638 --> 00:03:22,238
I don’t know.

56
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:25,976
He’s coming. He’s right there.

57
00:03:31,982 --> 00:03:33,901
Ma’am Elyse, Sir Sevi is here.

58
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,112
Hi, Sevi.

59
00:03:37,488 --> 00:03:39,406
- Hi, Ely.
- Hi, Sev.

60
00:03:42,034 --> 00:03:43,035
Thank you.

61
00:03:48,082 --> 00:03:49,208
Are your parents home?

62
00:03:49,928 --> 00:03:51,334
Mommy’s still at work

63
00:03:51,335 --> 00:03:52,920
and Daddy’s out of the country.

64
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:54,380
And…

65
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,518
we cooked…

66
00:03:57,091 --> 00:03:58,300
something.

67
00:04:01,345 --> 00:04:02,346
Really?

68
00:04:02,721 --> 00:04:04,223
You know how to cook now?

69
00:04:04,932 --> 00:04:06,784
Awesome! I’m starving.

70
00:04:07,518 --> 00:04:09,520
Come on, let’s eat.

71
00:04:12,064 --> 00:04:13,356
This smells good.

72
00:04:13,357 --> 00:04:14,566
You really cooked this?

73
00:04:23,117 --> 00:04:25,076
I think I’m craving
Chinese food.

74
00:04:25,077 --> 00:04:27,871
- Yes. That’s a good idea.
- Right? Let’s just order.

75
00:04:28,205 --> 00:04:29,707
Let’s order instead.

76
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:33,001
Huh?

77
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:33,836
Why?

78
00:04:33,837 --> 00:04:35,962
It actually looks good
and there's a lot of it.

79
00:04:35,963 --> 00:04:39,591
Plus, I'm sure it's tasty
because you made it.

80
00:04:40,551 --> 00:04:41,719
Are you sure?

81
00:04:42,094 --> 00:04:43,094
Yes.

82
00:04:43,595 --> 00:04:44,595
Why not?

83
00:04:47,308 --> 00:04:49,018
I’m sure this is delicious.

84
00:04:49,268 --> 00:04:50,686
Come on, let’s eat.

85
00:05:07,738 --> 00:05:08,828
Oh my!

86
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:10,913
Why isn't he saying anything?

87
00:05:10,914 --> 00:05:13,625
Nothing? Really?
He’ll just cough about it?

88
00:05:19,798 --> 00:05:20,798
How...

89
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:22,092
How is it?

90
00:05:25,453 --> 00:05:27,222
It... It’s fine.

91
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:30,684
It’s okay.
Give it a try.

92
00:05:33,864 --> 00:05:35,272
You try it, Ely.

93
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:37,067
I already tried it a while ago.

94
00:05:39,276 --> 00:05:40,277
Thank you.

95
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:59,447
Why does it taste like this?
This is so embarrassing!

96
00:06:00,798 --> 00:06:03,425
What did you put in this?

97
00:06:05,761 --> 00:06:09,180
Oops, my ride's here.
I have to go.

98
00:06:09,181 --> 00:06:11,517
Enjoy your meal, guys.

99
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:14,103
What?
But I have to go, Ely.

100
00:06:16,146 --> 00:06:19,191
Bye now. Don’t poison
yourselves, okay?

101
00:06:19,983 --> 00:06:21,735
Sevi, enjoy the food.

102
00:06:31,328 --> 00:06:32,663
Let’s just order instead?

103
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,581
Huh? No.

104
00:06:35,374 --> 00:06:38,876
I don’t want to waste
the food you cooked.

105
00:06:38,877 --> 00:06:41,130
I’ll eat this. I’ll even
finish the whole bowl.

106
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,798
Don’t. Don’t.

107
00:06:53,684 --> 00:06:54,684
So good!

108
00:06:55,352 --> 00:06:57,020
Can I take some
home for my family?

109
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,651
I think I can’t finish it all.

110
00:07:16,582 --> 00:07:17,832
Have you guys kissed yet?

111
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,001
Oh boy, you have
to be prepared, girl.

112
00:07:20,002 --> 00:07:24,130
I heard that the Panthers
are good kissers.

113
00:07:24,131 --> 00:07:26,215
Yes! Based on my experience,

114
00:07:26,216 --> 00:07:27,176
it’s true.

115
00:07:27,177 --> 00:07:28,510
You’ll have to hold your own.

116
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:33,348
Are Panthers really
good kissers?

117
00:07:44,276 --> 00:07:46,236
Kissable lips.

118
00:07:56,163 --> 00:07:57,330
Am I really that handsome

119
00:07:57,331 --> 00:07:58,999
that you can’t help
but stare at me?

120
00:08:07,674 --> 00:08:10,177
Do you want to go...

121
00:08:12,846 --> 00:08:13,847
What?

122
00:08:16,141 --> 00:08:17,141
Nevermind.

123
00:08:18,352 --> 00:08:20,479
Come on, tell me.

124
00:08:27,461 --> 00:08:29,087
Do you want to go to my room?

125
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:34,367
Why?

126
00:08:34,743 --> 00:08:36,078
I don’t want to.

127
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,372
- Huh?
- What are we going to do there?

128
00:08:39,748 --> 00:08:41,500
You don’t want to see my room?

129
00:08:43,085 --> 00:08:44,711
This is your only chance.

130
00:08:46,088 --> 00:08:47,338
Only chance?

131
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:48,339
Why?

132
00:08:48,757 --> 00:08:50,801
Well, my dad comes
back next week.

133
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:53,345
So you can't come here anymore.

134
00:08:54,638 --> 00:08:57,391
What do you have in your room?

135
00:08:58,678 --> 00:08:59,685
Nothing.

136
00:08:59,686 --> 00:09:01,353
I just want to show you.

137
00:09:07,401 --> 00:09:09,987
Can't you just
show me a picture?

138
00:09:11,488 --> 00:09:14,821
I mean, I think it’s better
to see it in person.

139
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:19,476
I want to show you
my safe space.

140
00:09:24,387 --> 00:09:25,419
Well?

141
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:27,546
Let’s go?

142
00:09:27,955 --> 00:09:30,465
Sure, but just for a bit, okay?

143
00:09:31,258 --> 00:09:32,258
Okay.

144
00:09:34,136 --> 00:09:35,136
Come on.

145
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:37,129
This way.

146
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:51,320
Come on.

147
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:55,782
Come on…

148
00:09:57,075 --> 00:09:59,910
I’m all good.
I can see it from here.

149
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:00,953
Come on, please.

150
00:10:00,954 --> 00:10:03,415
You look so awkward
just standing there.

151
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:06,043
You don’t want to see my place?

152
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,547
It'd be more awkward
if I went in there.

153
00:10:11,548 --> 00:10:13,008
Why don’t you want to come in?

154
00:10:13,258 --> 00:10:16,094
What, you probably think
we’re doing something else, huh?

155
00:10:17,304 --> 00:10:18,304
Huh?

156
00:10:20,807 --> 00:10:22,017
No.

157
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:24,436
Okay then, so come on.

158
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:36,031
You can sit there.

159
00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:39,284
Come on.

160
00:11:04,184 --> 00:11:06,102
Okay, let’s go.

161
00:11:06,103 --> 00:11:06,937
Huh?

162
00:11:06,937 --> 00:11:07,896
Wait...

163
00:11:07,897 --> 00:11:10,065
Wait, but we just got here.

164
00:11:10,357 --> 00:11:11,357
Please?

165
00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:26,540
Are you okay?

166
00:11:27,165 --> 00:11:28,417
Do you need anything?

167
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:29,668
I’m good.

168
00:11:33,046 --> 00:11:36,424
Are you sure?
Because you seem tense.

169
00:11:36,425 --> 00:11:37,425
Huh?

170
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,761
No, I’m not.

171
00:11:42,764 --> 00:11:44,015
Okay…

172
00:11:47,227 --> 00:11:49,855
I wanted to ask, are you
still sad about the game?

173
00:11:54,568 --> 00:11:55,777
Sevi…

174
00:11:56,737 --> 00:11:59,072
Can you answer me, please?

175
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:02,033
Are you still sad
about the game?

176
00:12:03,535 --> 00:12:04,828
What game?

177
00:12:05,203 --> 00:12:06,538
Your game.

178
00:12:07,289 --> 00:12:09,583
Gosh, Sevi, are you okay?

179
00:12:12,252 --> 00:12:13,419
I just— Sorry.

180
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,297
I haven’t thought
about it actually.

181
00:12:16,564 --> 00:12:18,383
But yes, I’m still sad about it.

182
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:19,759
But...

183
00:12:20,177 --> 00:12:22,345
It’s just how it is.
I can’t do anything about it.

184
00:12:24,514 --> 00:12:27,099
It must be hard to leave...

185
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,893
Leave? Sure, let’s go.

186
00:12:28,894 --> 00:12:30,687
Wait! No.

187
00:12:31,646 --> 00:12:36,151
No. I meant,
leave the team.

188
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,028
I know this was your last year

189
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:42,573
and I still hope
that you know that

190
00:12:42,574 --> 00:12:45,035
you were a great captain.

191
00:12:47,871 --> 00:12:48,872
Thanks.

192
00:12:55,337 --> 00:12:57,596
Can you look at me, please?

193
00:13:10,393 --> 00:13:11,394
Come on,

194
00:13:12,103 --> 00:13:13,354
let’s go back downstairs.

195
00:13:13,355 --> 00:13:14,272
Huh?

196
00:13:14,273 --> 00:13:17,442
I need to go home soon.

197
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,904
Wait, but it’s still so early.

198
00:13:21,988 --> 00:13:23,948
At least just

199
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:26,618
a couple more minutes.

200
00:13:28,036 --> 00:13:29,037
Please?

201
00:13:41,216 --> 00:13:42,217
Sevi…

202
00:13:45,804 --> 00:13:47,848
Have you ever tried kissing?

203
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:05,824
Yes.

204
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:08,702
What the hell?

205
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:11,580
Really?

206
00:14:11,955 --> 00:14:13,331
With who?

207
00:14:15,386 --> 00:14:18,086
Just some random people...

208
00:14:19,671 --> 00:14:21,771
but I’ve forgotten about it,

209
00:14:22,048 --> 00:14:23,341
so there’s no need to ask.

210
00:14:26,227 --> 00:14:27,762
But I’m curious.

211
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:33,080
I haven’t had my first kiss yet.

212
00:14:41,318 --> 00:14:44,570
Your curtains are really nice.

213
00:14:44,571 --> 00:14:45,821
A nice pink color.

214
00:14:45,822 --> 00:14:49,117
It matches the pillowcases
and the bed sheets.

215
00:14:49,606 --> 00:14:53,079
Even that flower over there.

216
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:56,750
You can’t even look at me, huh?

217
00:14:58,168 --> 00:14:59,169
Hey…

218
00:15:00,378 --> 00:15:01,588
Are you mad?

219
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:06,092
Well, this...

220
00:15:07,218 --> 00:15:09,304
You’re not taking me seriously.

221
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:12,015
This is an important
matter to me.

222
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:16,882
I’m sorry.

223
00:15:19,064 --> 00:15:20,982
Okay, I’ll be serious now.

224
00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:27,571
So...

225
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:29,645
When are we allowed to kiss?

226
00:15:34,371 --> 00:15:36,414
Why do you want to kiss?

227
00:15:36,831 --> 00:15:38,792
Why?
You don’t want to?

228
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:41,543
Should I just find another guy

229
00:15:41,544 --> 00:15:43,627
to satisfy my curiosities?

230
00:15:45,882 --> 00:15:46,883
Okay.

231
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:50,053
All right then.
If that’s what you want.

232
00:15:51,304 --> 00:15:52,722
I’m just kidding!

233
00:15:53,723 --> 00:15:55,100
I’m just kidding.

234
00:15:59,521 --> 00:16:00,521
So?

235
00:16:00,814 --> 00:16:02,357
Can I kiss you?

236
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,236
But I don’t know
how to do it, though.

237
00:16:23,712 --> 00:16:26,089
Oh my god! Here it goes.

238
00:16:40,645 --> 00:16:43,273
I’m sorry,
I’m not so good at this.

239
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:44,805
I’m sorry.

240
00:17:48,838 --> 00:17:49,922
It’s getting...

241
00:17:49,923 --> 00:17:51,591
I don’t have a watch, it’s...

242
00:17:52,217 --> 00:17:53,510
It’s getting late.

243
00:17:54,302 --> 00:17:55,386
You’re right.

244
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,060
Should I have Roel
take you home?

245
00:18:06,147 --> 00:18:07,357
Now?

246
00:18:09,818 --> 00:18:10,568
Okay.

247
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:11,569
Let’s go.

@sevirous:
Hey. Still up?

250
00:18:40,723 --> 00:18:47,104
@elydezma:
Yup. I can’t sleep.

251
00:18:47,105 --> 00:18:53,986
@sevirous: Why can’t you sleep?
Am I on your mind?

252
00:18:53,987 --> 00:18:57,866
@elydezma:
As if.

253
00:19:00,201 --> 00:19:03,204
@elydezma:
I’m going to sleep in a while.

254
00:19:04,747 --> 00:19:06,874
@sevirous:
Lucky you for feeling sleepy.

255
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:12,505
I’ll sleep later, I still want
to think about you.

256
00:19:14,215 --> 00:19:16,717
@elydezma:
Okay, Mr. Corny and dramatic.

257
00:19:16,718 --> 00:19:18,760
I’m also thinking of you.

258
00:19:18,761 --> 00:19:22,432
But you should sleep now.
You have a quiz tomorrow, right?

259
00:19:27,562 --> 00:19:29,438
@sevirous:
You should sleep now, too.

260
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:30,981
Don’t think about me too much,

261
00:19:30,982 --> 00:19:33,317
you might dream about me.

262
00:19:33,318 --> 00:19:35,110
Good night, babe.

263
00:19:35,111 --> 00:19:37,030
@elydezma:
Good night, babe.

264
00:19:43,995 --> 00:19:45,788
Are you going out?

265
00:19:46,247 --> 00:19:50,250
Yes, Mommy.
I’m going to meet Sevi.

266
00:19:50,251 --> 00:19:52,169
Okay. Enjoy, sweetheart.

267
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,922
- Take care.
- Thank you, Mommy. Bye.

268
00:19:55,632 --> 00:19:58,051
@sevirous: I’m on my way
to the cafe. See you!

269
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:00,897
@elydezma: I’m about to
leave the house too!

270
00:20:01,137 --> 00:20:02,639
See you and take care.

271
00:20:08,895 --> 00:20:10,479
- Elyse…
- Daddy!

272
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,357
- Hello!
- Hi!

273
00:20:12,815 --> 00:20:14,067
You’re home early.

274
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:16,527
I thought you were
coming home next week.

275
00:20:17,153 --> 00:20:18,738
How was your trip?

276
00:20:19,489 --> 00:20:21,783
Well, unfortunately,

277
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,078
the deal didn’t push through.
They just wasted my time.

278
00:20:26,037 --> 00:20:28,081
You? Why are you
so dressed up?

279
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:31,668
You seem to be
going out a lot lately.

280
00:20:32,794 --> 00:20:35,296
I’m not going anywhere, Dad.

281
00:20:36,256 --> 00:20:37,548
I’m just

282
00:20:38,007 --> 00:20:40,134
trying on a dress
that Ida bought me.

283
00:20:40,718 --> 00:20:42,887
Did I miss anything
while I was gone?

284
00:20:44,472 --> 00:20:44,973
No.

285
00:20:44,974 --> 00:20:46,607
Everything’s good, Dad.

286
00:20:46,808 --> 00:20:48,600
I’ve just been focused
on my finals

287
00:20:48,601 --> 00:20:51,145
‘cause cheer training
is finished.

288
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,564
That’s good to hear.

289
00:20:54,274 --> 00:20:56,566
Just make sure nothing
is distracting you

290
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:57,860
from your studies, okay?

291
00:20:59,445 --> 00:21:00,905
Okay. Yes, Dad.

292
00:21:02,407 --> 00:21:04,058
I’ll just go up. I’m...

293
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:05,285
I’m tired.

294
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,619
- Okay?
- Okay.

295
00:21:10,748 --> 00:21:13,001
Ely, I just got here.

296
00:21:13,459 --> 00:21:14,836
Want me to order for you?

297
00:21:15,545 --> 00:21:17,672
I’m sure you’d like
a matcha drink.

298
00:21:18,965 --> 00:21:20,966
Oh, you’re still at home?

299
00:21:20,967 --> 00:21:23,593
Yes. Sev...

300
00:21:23,594 --> 00:21:25,887
I can’t make it anymore,
I’m sorry.

301
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,597
Why, what happened?

302
00:21:27,598 --> 00:21:29,808
My dad came home
earlier than expected

303
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:33,021
and he was in a really bad mood.

304
00:21:34,564 --> 00:21:35,690
Honestly,

305
00:21:35,767 --> 00:21:38,735
I was so scared to
ask permission to go out.

306
00:21:39,068 --> 00:21:41,988
He might get suspicious of us.

307
00:21:42,398 --> 00:21:45,026
I’m really sorry, Sev.

308
00:21:45,575 --> 00:21:47,493
You’re already there.

309
00:21:47,952 --> 00:21:49,911
I’m really sorry
for making you wait.

310
00:21:49,912 --> 00:21:51,590
Please don’t be mad at me.

311
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,654
Relax, Ely. It’s okay.

312
00:21:54,876 --> 00:21:56,377
I understand.

313
00:21:57,295 --> 00:21:58,295
And...

314
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,340
It’s a good thing
you didn’t leave.

315
00:22:01,341 --> 00:22:02,341
Really?

316
00:22:03,176 --> 00:22:04,761
You’re not mad?

317
00:22:05,136 --> 00:22:06,846
You don’t want
to break up with me?

318
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,265
Why would I break up with you?

319
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,975
It’s nothing serious.

320
00:22:11,517 --> 00:22:12,685
Besides,

321
00:22:13,603 --> 00:22:16,314
we can meet up next time.

322
00:22:17,815 --> 00:22:19,317
Thank you, Sev.

323
00:22:20,818 --> 00:22:22,819
I’m really lucky to have you.

324
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,447
You really are.

325
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,117
You’re so full
of yourself again!

326
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:30,036
Stop!

327
00:22:30,037 --> 00:22:33,039
Don’t worry,
things we’ll get better.

328
00:22:33,998 --> 00:22:36,959
He’s right.
I’m the lucky one.

329
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:43,507
Enjoy golfing with your buddies.

330
00:22:43,508 --> 00:22:45,073
Make sure you score big, Dad.

331
00:22:46,177 --> 00:22:47,261
I will.

332
00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:49,764
So what time do you plan
to come home?

333
00:22:50,214 --> 00:22:52,307
Most likely late at night.

334
00:22:52,308 --> 00:22:53,517
I’ll have dinner in the club

335
00:22:53,518 --> 00:22:55,937
and then have drinks after.

336
00:22:56,312 --> 00:22:57,313
You know how it goes.

337
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,022
- Okay.
- I shall go ahead.

338
00:22:59,023 --> 00:23:00,023
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

339
00:23:00,024 --> 00:23:00,942
- Bye.
- Bye, Daddy.

340
00:23:00,943 --> 00:23:01,943
Love you.

341
00:23:01,943 --> 00:23:02,735
- Bye.
- Okay.

342
00:23:02,735 --> 00:23:03,735
- Bye!
- Love you.

343
00:23:04,737 --> 00:23:06,239
- Love you, Dad.
- Love you.

344
00:23:07,657 --> 00:23:09,367
- Let’s go.
- Mommy...

345
00:23:10,118 --> 00:23:11,869
Can I meet someone today?

346
00:23:12,662 --> 00:23:14,038
Someone?

347
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,874
Okay, just as long
as you bring Roel

348
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:20,210
and you have to text me
when you get there, okay?

349
00:23:20,211 --> 00:23:21,837
- Okay.
- Don’t forget to update me.

350
00:23:21,838 --> 00:23:23,171
- Okay.
- I’ll just go up.

351
00:23:23,172 --> 00:23:24,172
Thank you, Mommy.

352
00:23:38,692 --> 00:23:46,552

today! Let’s meet?

Hi, Daddy.

357
00:24:06,591 --> 00:24:09,843
I’m planning on going
Christmas shopping today.

358
00:24:09,844 --> 00:24:11,721
Is that okay?

359
00:24:15,016 --> 00:24:16,308
It’s all right.

360
00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:17,402
Really?

361
00:24:17,602 --> 00:24:19,770
Just go easy
on the spending, okay?

00:24:20,146 --> 00:24:21,183

- Babe!

- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

00:24:43,878 --> 00:24:46,630
I can stay before dinner today.

369
00:24:46,631 --> 00:24:48,132
Won’t your dad look for you?

370
00:24:48,841 --> 00:24:50,717
No, I told him
I’ll go Christmas shopping

371
00:24:50,718 --> 00:24:52,637
and he knows how long
that’s gonna take.

372
00:24:53,804 --> 00:24:55,973
And I want to buy Sofia a gift.

373
00:24:56,307 --> 00:24:58,601
You don’t have to, babe.

374
00:24:58,976 --> 00:25:01,479
No, I want to. I insist.

375
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,067
Let’s go?

376
00:25:37,807 --> 00:25:39,225
I want to show you this.

377
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,311
What do you think?

378
00:25:43,312 --> 00:25:44,981
You think Sofia will like it?

379
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,274
Of course.

380
00:25:47,275 --> 00:25:50,221
She’s like a little Elyse.
She's also into clothes.

381
00:25:52,205 --> 00:25:54,364
Well, I am very proud of her

382
00:25:54,365 --> 00:25:55,825
because at such a young age,

383
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,774
she already has
a sense of fashion.

384
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:05,585
What do you think about this?

385
00:26:08,379 --> 00:26:11,007
I don’t think
that’s going to fit her.

386
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,093
This isn’t for Sofia.

387
00:26:14,468 --> 00:26:16,887
This is for my friend’s
soon-to-be baby.

388
00:26:18,973 --> 00:26:20,308
I see.

389
00:26:23,894 --> 00:26:27,773
Sevi has a pregnant friend?
Who could it be?

390
00:26:53,424 --> 00:26:56,135
Sevi and I look like
a married couple here.

391
00:26:58,888 --> 00:26:59,889
Hey!

392
00:27:00,264 --> 00:27:02,058
Why are you laughing, babe?

393
00:27:04,435 --> 00:27:06,145
It’s nothing.

394
00:27:07,438 --> 00:27:08,439
Here.

395
00:27:09,148 --> 00:27:10,524
Taste this.

396
00:27:16,572 --> 00:27:17,448
Good, right?

397
00:27:17,449 --> 00:27:18,699
That’s my favorite.

398
00:27:19,825 --> 00:27:20,826
Tasty, right?

399
00:27:24,372 --> 00:27:26,873
You can’t do anything right,
you son of a bitch!

400
00:27:26,874 --> 00:27:28,125
I’m your father!

401
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:30,835
Have you forgotten
everything I’ve done for you?

402
00:27:30,836 --> 00:27:32,452
Even your fucking law school.

403
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,005
That’s why you
don’t have the right

404
00:27:34,006 --> 00:27:35,697
to fucking raise
your voice at me.

405
00:27:35,722 --> 00:27:37,676
That’s your
obligation as a parent.

406
00:27:37,677 --> 00:27:39,515
Don’t throw that shit
against me.

407
00:27:39,553 --> 00:27:40,679
You son of a bitch,
you still have the nerve

408
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,639
to talk back?

409
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,557
- Daddy!
- Alfred!

410
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:45,809
Alfred!

411
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,143
- What!
- Stop it!

412
00:27:47,144 --> 00:27:48,144
- Stop!
- Answer me!

413
00:27:48,354 --> 00:27:49,605
Don’t hurt him!

414
00:27:50,189 --> 00:27:51,190
Shan.

415
00:27:52,233 --> 00:27:53,234
Alfred!

416
00:27:57,238 --> 00:27:58,322
Come on…

417
00:27:59,657 --> 00:28:01,057
Don’t you dare
show your face to me!

418
00:28:01,492 --> 00:28:02,743
Enough!

419
00:28:03,994 --> 00:28:04,995
That’s enough.

420
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,591
Shan…

421
00:28:21,178 --> 00:28:22,470
I’m fine, Ely.
Don’t worry about me.

422
00:28:22,471 --> 00:28:23,472
I’m fine.

423
00:28:24,992 --> 00:28:27,392
No, you’re not fine!

424
00:28:27,393 --> 00:28:29,477
Why do you guys
always have to fight?

425
00:28:29,478 --> 00:28:31,480
Can’t you just stop?

426
00:28:32,231 --> 00:28:34,400
He’s not the person
you think he is, Elyse.

427
00:28:36,527 --> 00:28:37,862
What?

428
00:28:41,532 --> 00:28:44,076
I feel so conflicted, Shan.

429
00:28:46,495 --> 00:28:49,998
I know Dad is strict but he’s
been a good father to me.

430
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:53,627
But then, I’ve seen him
repeatedly hit you.

431
00:28:56,128 --> 00:28:58,215
I don’t know what to feel.

432
00:29:01,218 --> 00:29:02,261
Listen, Ely…

433
00:29:03,795 --> 00:29:05,816
As long as
he’s treating you right,

434
00:29:06,015 --> 00:29:07,600
you don’t have to worry.

435
00:29:08,893 --> 00:29:11,645
But the moment
he lays his hand on you

436
00:29:12,813 --> 00:29:14,356
or Auntie Erin...

437
00:29:15,682 --> 00:29:18,444
I’m gonna get you out
of this fucking house.

438
00:29:19,779 --> 00:29:20,780
What…

439
00:29:25,826 --> 00:29:27,369
What are you saying?

440
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,039
- He’s our dad—
- He’s your dad!

441
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,166
What?

442
00:29:32,917 --> 00:29:35,169
I don’t consider him
as my family anymore.

443
00:29:37,546 --> 00:29:39,632
Why...

444
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,115
Hi Sevi.

445
00:30:06,116 --> 00:30:07,618
Have you tried
braised beef stew?

446
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:12,863
I know a good place in España
where we can get it.

447
00:30:13,207 --> 00:30:14,700
I promise you’ll like it.

448
00:30:16,669 --> 00:30:20,589
I don’t know what that is
but I look forward to it.

449
00:30:22,716 --> 00:30:23,968
Are you okay?

450
00:30:24,602 --> 00:30:26,970
You seem a bit sad.

451
00:30:26,971 --> 00:30:28,057
Did something happen?

452
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,665
Should I tell him what happened?

453
00:30:33,644 --> 00:30:35,895
No. I don’t want
to burden him

454
00:30:35,896 --> 00:30:37,731
with my family problems.

455
00:30:42,278 --> 00:30:43,737
I’m just tired.

456
00:30:44,711 --> 00:30:46,948
I was reviewing earlier

457
00:30:46,949 --> 00:30:48,993
because I have finals coming up.

458
00:30:50,786 --> 00:30:51,787
Okay then.

459
00:30:52,621 --> 00:30:55,082
Well, don’t forget
to rest, okay?

460
00:30:57,001 --> 00:30:59,795
That’s why I’m really glad
we went on our date earlier.

461
00:31:00,546 --> 00:31:02,881
It really helped me to destress.

462
00:31:02,882 --> 00:31:04,799
If you need to destress again,

463
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,385
just give me a call,
and I’ll be there.

464
00:31:07,386 --> 00:31:08,429
In a jiffy.

465
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:12,098
By the way,

466
00:31:12,099 --> 00:31:15,059
our first monthsary
is coming up.

467
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:18,272
Is it okay if
we celebrate at my place?

468
00:31:19,356 --> 00:31:22,692
You know… I want to
introduce you to my family...

469
00:31:22,693 --> 00:31:24,069
officially.

470
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,073
My— Sevi...

471
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,493
I would love to.

472
00:31:31,994 --> 00:31:32,995
Really?

473
00:31:33,787 --> 00:31:35,538
Okay, I’ll tell Mama then.

474
00:31:35,539 --> 00:31:37,665
I really hope that she likes me.

475
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:40,209
Please, Mama already knows you.

476
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,211
And she’s okay with you.

477
00:31:42,212 --> 00:31:43,797
I’m sure she’ll like you.

478
00:31:50,137 --> 00:31:53,557
Ely, are you sure
you want to ride a jeepney?

479
00:31:54,224 --> 00:31:57,685
Because we can book
a ride or take a taxi.

480
00:31:57,686 --> 00:31:59,228
Or you can call Roel,

481
00:31:59,229 --> 00:32:01,607
and we can ask him
to give us a ride.

482
00:32:02,066 --> 00:32:04,068
Sevi, chill. It’s okay.

483
00:32:05,444 --> 00:32:07,612
It’s not comfortable
in a jeepney.

484
00:32:07,613 --> 00:32:09,989
It’s usually cramped,

485
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,574
and there’s no air conditioning.

486
00:32:11,575 --> 00:32:13,418
Isn’t it your
first time riding one?

487
00:32:14,078 --> 00:32:15,495
Yes, but

488
00:32:15,496 --> 00:32:17,830
that’s why
I want to experience it.

489
00:32:17,831 --> 00:32:21,857
Besides, Roel dropped off
Mommy and Daddy at the airport.

490
00:32:21,882 --> 00:32:24,545
They have a business trip, so...

491
00:32:24,546 --> 00:32:26,757
I can hang out longer
at your place.

492
00:32:28,842 --> 00:32:30,760
Come on, let’s go.

493
00:32:30,761 --> 00:32:31,887
How much do I need?

494
00:32:34,932 --> 00:32:36,183
Is this enough?

495
00:32:38,233 --> 00:32:40,478
This is too much.

496
00:32:40,479 --> 00:32:43,022
And the driver might get mad

497
00:32:43,023 --> 00:32:44,691
because he won’t have
any change for that.

498
00:32:44,692 --> 00:32:46,151
Don’t worry, I have change.

499
00:32:46,902 --> 00:32:47,903
Okay.

500
00:32:50,114 --> 00:32:51,615
Hold on,
let’s wait for a jeepney.

501
00:32:53,742 --> 00:32:54,743
Boss!

502
00:32:56,036 --> 00:32:57,413
We’ll ride, boss.

503
00:33:00,958 --> 00:33:01,959
Well?

504
00:33:02,334 --> 00:33:03,970
Aren’t we going to ride?

505
00:33:03,994 --> 00:33:06,663
Come on, let’s go.

506
00:33:21,437 --> 00:33:22,438
Elyse…

507
00:33:24,273 --> 00:33:25,274
Come in.

508
00:33:30,988 --> 00:33:32,573
Wear my slippers first.

509
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:33,710
Okay.

510
00:33:37,745 --> 00:33:38,746
I’m sorry.

511
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:41,498
Our house is small.

512
00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:56,847
Your home looks
so cozy and warm.

513
00:33:57,931 --> 00:33:59,222
Do you feel hot?

514
00:33:59,349 --> 00:34:03,812
No! I mean that
it looks very homey.

515
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,859
Where have you been?

516
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,360
Hanging out somewhere again?

517
00:34:11,361 --> 00:34:13,030
I just bought something outside.

518
00:34:15,157 --> 00:34:17,804
Steven, my girlfriend, Elyse.

519
00:34:18,452 --> 00:34:19,702
This is Steven, Elyse.

520
00:34:19,703 --> 00:34:21,292
- My brother.
- Nice to meet you.

521
00:34:21,778 --> 00:34:23,028
Nice to meet you, too.

522
00:34:23,053 --> 00:34:25,208
Hey!
What are you doing?

523
00:34:25,209 --> 00:34:26,375
Is she your godmother?

524
00:34:26,376 --> 00:34:27,405
Just give a handshake.

525
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,390
You don’t have to be mad.

526
00:34:28,437 --> 00:34:31,314
You keep hitting me,
if I get back at you…

527
00:34:31,548 --> 00:34:32,548
Come on.

528
00:34:34,676 --> 00:34:35,927
Hi, Elyse!

529
00:34:35,928 --> 00:34:37,512
Welcome to our home.

530
00:34:37,513 --> 00:34:40,056
Sorry, I’m not done cooking yet.

531
00:34:40,057 --> 00:34:42,100
Hello, Princess.

532
00:34:42,101 --> 00:34:45,061
Hi, little princess.
It’s nice to see you again.

533
00:34:45,062 --> 00:34:47,439
And it’s okay, Auntie.

534
00:34:48,232 --> 00:34:51,235
I’m still not used
to you calling me Auntie.

535
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,320
But you know, Elyse,

536
00:34:53,987 --> 00:34:56,365
I’m really happy
you visited us here.

537
00:34:56,698 --> 00:34:57,699
Thank you.

538
00:34:58,546 --> 00:35:01,119
All right. I’ll finish cooking

539
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,913
so we can all eat already.
Sevi, take care of Elyse.

540
00:35:03,914 --> 00:35:04,832
Feel at home, okay?

541
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:06,499
- Steven, watch over your sister
- Sure.

542
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,544
- All right.
- What do you want to eat?

543
00:35:10,379 --> 00:35:11,630
Are you okay?

544
00:35:13,006 --> 00:35:14,133
I’m okay.

545
00:35:17,803 --> 00:35:20,805
Wow, you bought so much, Elyse.
Thank you!

546
00:35:20,806 --> 00:35:23,015
You didn’t have to go
through all the trouble,

547
00:35:23,016 --> 00:35:24,767
but thanks a lot! Thank you!

548
00:35:24,768 --> 00:35:25,768
Of course.

549
00:35:26,145 --> 00:35:29,981
Sofia, you have a new dress.
It’s from Elyse.

550
00:35:29,982 --> 00:35:31,274
Look, it suits you perfectly.

551
00:35:31,275 --> 00:35:32,316
Go on, show it to them.

552
00:35:32,317 --> 00:35:33,985
- Wow!
- Wow!

553
00:35:33,986 --> 00:35:35,862
- Looks great.
- Wow, I’ve got a new outfit!

554
00:35:35,863 --> 00:35:38,281
- Yes.
- Thank you, Princess.

555
00:35:38,282 --> 00:35:40,491
- It suits you.
- It suits you perfectly, see?

556
00:35:40,492 --> 00:35:42,118
- You look so pretty.
- Thank you.

557
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:44,412
Of course, there’s something
for you too, Steven.

558
00:35:44,413 --> 00:35:46,831
Wow!

559
00:35:46,832 --> 00:35:49,000
Thank you, Elyse.
Thanks for the gift.

560
00:35:49,001 --> 00:35:51,253
You’re better at
choosing gifts than Sevi.

561
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,531
Watch your mouth.

562
00:35:53,881 --> 00:35:57,426
You two, enough now.
Just keep eating.

563
00:35:57,705 --> 00:35:59,135
Glad you guys liked the gifts.

564
00:35:59,136 --> 00:36:00,512
Thank you.

565
00:36:02,055 --> 00:36:04,183
Sevi, can you pass me the water?

566
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:08,045
Where’s your papa, by the way?

567
00:36:14,735 --> 00:36:17,237
Oh no, what did I even ask?

568
00:36:25,245 --> 00:36:27,080
He and Mama are separated.

569
00:36:27,998 --> 00:36:30,372
Now, I don’t know where he went.

570
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:37,049
I’m sorry. I didn’t know.

571
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:40,151
Papa’s also an engineer,

572
00:36:40,176 --> 00:36:42,247
that’s why Sevi
took engineering too.

573
00:36:42,272 --> 00:36:45,775
Hey! Nobody asked you.
Just keep eating.

574
00:36:48,518 --> 00:36:50,478
Okay, let’s just eat.

575
00:36:50,479 --> 00:36:52,396
Elyse, don’t be shy. Eat more.

576
00:36:52,397 --> 00:36:54,441
I cooked a lot.

577
00:36:54,942 --> 00:36:57,027
Here, try the chicken.

578
00:36:57,694 --> 00:36:59,570
- Ma—
- Go ahead. Don’t be shy.

579
00:36:59,571 --> 00:37:01,611
. - Ma, give me some chicken.
- Eat your vegetables.

580
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,075
Give Sofia some vegetables, too.

581
00:37:04,076 --> 00:37:05,368
Eat your veggies, okay?

582
00:37:05,369 --> 00:37:08,162
Sofia, eat veggies.

583
00:37:08,163 --> 00:37:09,163
Yum!

584
00:37:10,758 --> 00:37:12,376
Feed her properly...

585
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,378
I did…

586
00:37:14,836 --> 00:37:16,338
Very good.

587
00:37:20,926 --> 00:37:23,178
Welcome to my world.

588
00:37:34,982 --> 00:37:35,983
What do you think?

589
00:37:37,818 --> 00:37:38,860
It’s clean.

590
00:37:39,695 --> 00:37:43,781
I thought it would be some
chaotic college room vibe.

591
00:37:43,782 --> 00:37:44,782
Huh?

592
00:37:45,909 --> 00:37:47,703
I'm actually tidy with my stuff.

593
00:37:47,953 --> 00:37:49,912
I sweep almost every day.

594
00:37:49,913 --> 00:37:51,581
Oh, really?

595
00:38:06,972 --> 00:38:08,598
I was wondering,

596
00:38:09,224 --> 00:38:12,227
did you choose engineering
because of your dad?

597
00:38:26,616 --> 00:38:29,578
We don’t have to talk about it
if you’re not comfortable.

598
00:38:30,454 --> 00:38:31,621
I understand.

599
00:38:41,506 --> 00:38:42,506
Yes.

600
00:38:45,302 --> 00:38:46,094
When I was a kid,

601
00:38:46,095 --> 00:38:47,815
he used to take me
to the site all the time.

602
00:38:48,889 --> 00:38:51,641
That’s when I started
liking engineering.

603
00:38:52,642 --> 00:38:55,729
He became my role model too.

604
00:38:56,772 --> 00:38:59,273
But, well...

605
00:38:59,274 --> 00:39:00,942
He and Mama split up.

606
00:39:04,488 --> 00:39:06,073
If you don’t mind...

607
00:39:07,157 --> 00:39:08,403
what happened?

608
00:39:10,077 --> 00:39:11,828
They said they
weren't compatible.

609
00:39:12,537 --> 00:39:13,955
Funny, right?

610
00:39:14,581 --> 00:39:17,583
They were together for years,

611
00:39:17,584 --> 00:39:19,002
had three kids,

612
00:39:19,336 --> 00:39:22,005
and then they realized
they weren't compatible?

613
00:39:22,923 --> 00:39:24,383
Ridiculous, don’t you think?

614
00:39:25,967 --> 00:39:29,596
Did they end on
good terms at least?

615
00:39:33,308 --> 00:39:34,351
Seems so.

616
00:39:35,394 --> 00:39:37,687
Mama helped him pack.

617
00:39:52,202 --> 00:39:54,538
How do you feel about your dad?

618
00:40:05,882 --> 00:40:07,175
Of course, I’m pissed.

619
00:40:09,242 --> 00:40:10,493
He’s really something.

620
00:40:11,096 --> 00:40:13,473
He was able to leave
his children that easily.

621
00:40:16,226 --> 00:40:18,228
He hasn’t even visited us.

622
00:40:19,187 --> 00:40:21,106
He can’t even show up,

623
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:24,192
not even to help
with school expenses.

624
00:40:24,985 --> 00:40:26,027
Nothing at all.

625
00:40:27,112 --> 00:40:28,822
He left everything to Mama.

626
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,783
But,

627
00:40:32,451 --> 00:40:34,119
at least I’m about to graduate.

628
00:40:34,661 --> 00:40:36,371
I’ll finally be able
to help Mama.

629
00:40:41,793 --> 00:40:45,255
I’m really sorry
that happened, Sev.

630
00:40:47,048 --> 00:40:49,217
That’s why,
If we have a problem,

631
00:40:49,968 --> 00:40:51,595
let’s sort it out
right away, okay?

632
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:56,391
No walking out
without saying anything.

633
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:01,354
I won’t do that to you.

634
00:41:02,272 --> 00:41:03,732
I promise.

635
00:41:32,677 --> 00:41:33,760
You know...

636
00:41:35,362 --> 00:41:36,901
I just realized…

637
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,727
We haven’t said
the three words yet.

638
00:41:41,728 --> 00:41:42,771
Three words?

639
00:41:43,522 --> 00:41:44,772
What three words?

640
00:41:44,896 --> 00:41:46,084
Three little ducks?

641
00:41:46,691 --> 00:41:48,193
Whatever.

642
00:41:49,486 --> 00:41:51,920
What three words?
Go to hell?

643
00:41:53,782 --> 00:41:56,535
Sebastian, you’re so annoying.

644
00:42:03,542 --> 00:42:04,563
Ely.

645
00:42:05,168 --> 00:42:06,169
What?

646
00:42:16,971 --> 00:42:18,004
I love you.

647
00:42:25,063 --> 00:42:26,503
I love you, too.

648
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,921
Happy monthsary!

649
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,007
This one’s for Sofia.

650
00:43:07,032 --> 00:43:09,189
Merry Christmas, Ely!

651
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,781
Is it cold there in Japan?

652
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,612
Merry Christmas, babe.
And yes, it’s so cold.

653
00:43:14,613 --> 00:43:16,113
It’s snowing here.

654
00:43:16,114 --> 00:43:18,907
I’m excited to show you
my Christmas gift for you.

655
00:43:18,908 --> 00:43:21,452
I got you an omamori
and it’s for

656
00:43:21,453 --> 00:43:22,911
good success in life

657
00:43:22,912 --> 00:43:25,331
because I wish you
good success in life.

658
00:43:25,332 --> 00:43:27,149
And I also got myself one, too.

659
00:43:27,375 --> 00:43:29,043
You don’t need that.

660
00:43:29,044 --> 00:43:31,546
I’m the one bringing
you luck in life.

661
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:34,215
You’re so full of yourself.

662
00:43:34,924 --> 00:43:35,924
I love you.

663
00:43:35,925 --> 00:43:37,968
- Take care over there.
- I love you, too.

664
00:43:37,969 --> 00:43:39,888
Don’t forget to say thank you.

665
00:43:41,056 --> 00:43:42,098
Wow!

666
00:43:54,778 --> 00:43:56,028
Come and greet Elyse.

667
00:43:56,029 --> 00:43:58,239
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

668
00:43:58,698 --> 00:44:00,741
Hi! Hi, everyone!

669
00:44:00,742 --> 00:44:04,578
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year, Princess!

670
00:44:04,579 --> 00:44:06,373
Happy New Year, Pretty Elyse!

671
00:44:07,457 --> 00:44:09,042
Happy New Year!

672
00:44:09,668 --> 00:44:11,044
What do you mean, pretty?

673
00:44:11,252 --> 00:44:12,836
Why? It’s true.

674
00:44:12,837 --> 00:44:14,713
Here’s our good luck charm.

675
00:44:14,714 --> 00:44:16,048
Wow!

676
00:44:16,049 --> 00:44:18,217
- Here are the fruits.
- Mama…

677
00:44:18,218 --> 00:44:21,178
Hello, Elyse. Happy New Year!

678
00:44:21,179 --> 00:44:24,348
Hi, Auntie. Happy New Year!

679
00:44:24,349 --> 00:44:26,433
Be careful over there,
and when you get here,

680
00:44:26,434 --> 00:44:29,612
come visit us right away, okay?
Happy New Year!

681
00:44:31,356 --> 00:44:33,857
Happy New Year, babe.
I miss you.

682
00:44:33,858 --> 00:44:36,568
Happy New Year! We should
make a new year’s wish.

683
00:44:36,569 --> 00:44:37,569
Yup?

684
00:44:39,499 --> 00:44:41,329
I’m manifesting

685
00:44:41,354 --> 00:44:45,399
that you graduate and
pass your board exams.

686
00:44:45,954 --> 00:44:46,955
Okay,

687
00:44:47,497 --> 00:44:48,832
my wish is

688
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:51,835
that you’ll always be happy,

689
00:44:52,252 --> 00:44:54,170
and that you
won’t break up with me.

690
00:44:55,797 --> 00:44:58,257
That’s not going to happen.

691
00:44:58,258 --> 00:45:00,510
- I love you.
- I love you, babe.

692
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:03,763
See you soon. Take care.

693
00:45:08,143 --> 00:45:12,188
Let’s all eat!
Hurry, sit down and eat.

694
00:45:16,502 --> 00:45:19,111
@elydezma: I’m in the hospital
for Mom’s regular check-up.

695
00:45:19,112 --> 00:45:21,697
We just finished.
I’m free after.

696
00:45:21,698 --> 00:45:23,283
Let’s meet up?

697
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:32,367
Why isn’t he replying?
Is he busy or something?

698
00:45:43,013 --> 00:45:45,140
Hello? Steven.

699
00:45:46,055 --> 00:45:47,598
Is your brother home?

700
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,685
Sevi left to meet some girl.

701
00:45:52,645 --> 00:45:54,272
A girl?

702
00:45:56,524 --> 00:45:59,027
Okay. I got to go. Bye.

703
00:46:10,638 --> 00:46:11,930
Yes, babe?

704
00:46:11,955 --> 00:46:15,791
Come on, babe, let’s go back…

705
00:46:15,816 --> 00:46:17,276
Babe!

706
00:46:19,154 --> 00:46:22,342
What the actual fuck?
Is he cheating on me?

707
00:46:22,717 --> 00:46:24,177
What the hell?

708
00:46:26,679 --> 00:46:28,097
Babe…

709
00:46:28,598 --> 00:46:30,391
Is that Sevi?

710
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:37,148
Why is he here?

711
00:46:55,708 --> 00:46:56,417
Jeez!

712
00:46:56,418 --> 00:46:57,626
Sebastian!

713
00:46:57,627 --> 00:46:59,212
Who the hell is that woman...

714
00:47:03,716 --> 00:47:04,716
Hello!

715
00:47:06,095 --> 00:47:09,389
What the fuck?
That’s Yanna! Hiro’s ex!

716
00:47:13,935 --> 00:47:17,980
Elyse, this is Yanna.
Yanna, this is Elyse.

717
00:47:17,981 --> 00:47:21,086
Your girlfriend sure
rushed over here quickly...

718
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,172
Babe.

719
00:47:22,485 --> 00:47:24,820
Fuck, Yanna,
stop with the teasing already.

720
00:47:24,821 --> 00:47:26,698
Did you get her pregnant?

721
00:47:28,324 --> 00:47:30,493
Hey!
Of course not.

722
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,621
Yes.
Sevi is the father.

723
00:47:34,122 --> 00:47:35,122
Huh?

724
00:47:39,168 --> 00:47:40,377
I’m kidding!

725
00:47:40,378 --> 00:47:42,004
Chill guys, look at your faces.

726
00:47:42,005 --> 00:47:42,797
You’re both so angry.

727
00:47:42,798 --> 00:47:44,758
You’re going to make me
give birth any minute now!

728
00:47:45,258 --> 00:47:48,219
This girl always annoys
the hell out of me!

729
00:47:49,345 --> 00:47:50,680
Here’s the thing, Elyse...

730
00:47:50,889 --> 00:47:53,507
Kierra called
the other day because

731
00:47:53,532 --> 00:47:55,385
Yanna’s stomach was hurting.

732
00:47:55,643 --> 00:47:57,102
Then they rushed her
to the hospital

733
00:47:57,103 --> 00:47:58,687
because her due date
is getting close.

734
00:47:58,688 --> 00:48:01,060
So, I’m the one watching
over her now.

735
00:48:01,274 --> 00:48:03,860
And later, Sam and the
others will be coming.

736
00:48:05,153 --> 00:48:06,610
This isn’t for Sofia.

737
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:09,012
This is for my friend’s
soon-to-be baby.

738
00:48:09,282 --> 00:48:12,702
Is she the one you mentioned
who's about to give birth soon?

739
00:48:16,497 --> 00:48:17,498
Wait…

740
00:48:19,292 --> 00:48:21,336
Does Hiro know about this?

741
00:48:24,297 --> 00:48:26,257
If you're planning to tell him,
don't even bother.

742
00:48:27,342 --> 00:48:29,051
He already knows
he’s not the one

743
00:48:29,052 --> 00:48:30,553
who got me pregnant,
that’s why…

744
00:48:30,929 --> 00:48:32,388
That’s why we’re not
talking anymore.

745
00:48:32,889 --> 00:48:34,432
So you cheated on him?

746
00:48:36,059 --> 00:48:38,436
If that’s what you
want to think, go ahead.

747
00:48:39,103 --> 00:48:40,630
Just let me be, okay?

748
00:48:41,022 --> 00:48:43,149
Only my close friends
know about this.

749
00:48:43,483 --> 00:48:44,817
Stay out of it, all right?

750
00:48:45,735 --> 00:48:47,425
I wasn’t even planning to.

751
00:48:47,654 --> 00:48:50,548
And don’t be mad at Sevi.

752
00:48:50,657 --> 00:48:53,659
I blackmailed him
into not telling anyone.

753
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,865
Not even you.
That I’m pregnant.

754
00:48:56,955 --> 00:48:58,206
But...

755
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:00,792
Your boyfriend is really sweet.

756
00:49:01,042 --> 00:49:02,418
He’s really caring.

757
00:49:04,295 --> 00:49:05,653
Can I borrow him for now?

758
00:49:07,521 --> 00:49:09,007
You fucking bitch...

759
00:49:09,008 --> 00:49:11,343
Damn it, Yanna, stop it already.

760
00:49:11,344 --> 00:49:13,178
- Hey, I’m pregnant…
- Yanna!

761
00:49:13,179 --> 00:49:14,638
- We’re here!
- Hey!

762
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:15,723
Finally.

763
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,976
Elyse? You’re here.

764
00:49:18,351 --> 00:49:19,644
Hi!

765
00:49:21,132 --> 00:49:23,106
I heard about you and Sevi.

766
00:49:24,983 --> 00:49:25,984
Guys,

767
00:49:27,162 --> 00:49:29,206
this is Elyse. My girlfriend.

768
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:33,865
Hi, Elyse. Hi!

769
00:49:33,866 --> 00:49:37,245
Kierra is coming too,
she’s just finishing something.

770
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:41,289
You know, Sevi can’t stop
talking about you.

771
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:43,760
Yes, Luna told me.

772
00:49:45,211 --> 00:49:46,838
What have you been
telling her, Luna?

773
00:49:47,255 --> 00:49:49,756
And now, my friends aren’t
paying attention to me anymore.

774
00:49:49,757 --> 00:49:51,842
- Hey…
- Come on…

775
00:49:51,843 --> 00:49:54,511
Baby girl, come out
to the outside world.

776
00:49:54,512 --> 00:49:55,929
We want to meet you already.

777
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:56,930
Hey!

778
00:49:56,931 --> 00:50:00,017
Yes, we’ve been
waiting for so long.

779
00:50:00,018 --> 00:50:02,729
Hey, don’t pressure me.
It’s getting painful...

780
00:50:03,187 --> 00:50:04,187
Oh no...

781
00:50:06,774 --> 00:50:07,775
Help me.

782
00:50:09,235 --> 00:50:10,445
Take it easy. Slowly…

783
00:50:11,696 --> 00:50:13,114
Thank you.

784
00:50:21,622 --> 00:50:23,290
Sevi’s always like that.

785
00:50:23,291 --> 00:50:25,167
He takes care of everyone.

786
00:50:25,168 --> 00:50:28,837
For sure, when you're
in labor in the future,

787
00:50:28,838 --> 00:50:31,049
he’ll take care of you
ten times more.

788
00:50:31,424 --> 00:50:34,259
Hey, Elyse needs
to graduate first

789
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:38,096
before that, and I need
to work to be successful

790
00:50:38,097 --> 00:50:39,599
so I can marry her.

791
00:50:39,974 --> 00:50:43,185
Then we can have five kids.

792
00:50:43,186 --> 00:50:44,853
Oh…
Huh?

793
00:50:44,854 --> 00:50:46,397
Five? Really?

794
00:50:46,939 --> 00:50:48,774
Six is fine too,
so someone can sub.

795
00:50:48,775 --> 00:50:49,650
What...

796
00:50:49,651 --> 00:50:51,526
Are you sure?
Want to switch places?

797
00:50:51,527 --> 00:50:52,527
You think this is easy?

798
00:50:52,528 --> 00:50:53,528
Ask her, come on.

799
00:50:53,529 --> 00:50:55,406
Just one is already so hard.

800
00:50:55,907 --> 00:50:57,450
I’ll let her decide then.

801
00:50:59,884 --> 00:51:03,000
I’m included in
Sevi’s future plans.

802
00:51:03,498 --> 00:51:04,900
That makes me happy.

803
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:07,293
Baby! Come out now.

804
00:51:14,008 --> 00:51:15,009
You know,

805
00:51:15,259 --> 00:51:18,303
I’m still upset or annoyed

806
00:51:18,304 --> 00:51:21,099
that you didn’t reply
to my messages earlier.

807
00:51:22,934 --> 00:51:23,934
Like...

808
00:51:26,187 --> 00:51:31,025
I understand that you
can’t tell me about Yanna.

809
00:51:32,068 --> 00:51:34,278
But at least tell me
where you are.

810
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:38,825
I’m sorry.

811
00:51:39,617 --> 00:51:40,618
It’s my fault.

812
00:51:42,787 --> 00:51:44,622
I promise it won’t happen again.

813
00:51:50,294 --> 00:51:51,294
Okay.

814
00:51:52,338 --> 00:51:53,631
You’re forgiven.

815
00:51:54,006 --> 00:51:55,508
Are you sure
you’re not mad anymore?

816
00:51:56,425 --> 00:51:57,425
Will you hug me?

817
00:52:08,271 --> 00:52:09,271
Okay.

818
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:26,705
Here’s my
Valentine’s gift for you.

819
00:52:26,706 --> 00:52:29,041
Brownies!
I baked that.

820
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:31,919
Thanks! I’m sure it’s delicious.

821
00:52:36,257 --> 00:52:37,758
And here’s my gift for you.

822
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:40,261
Wow!

823
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,096
Oh my god!

824
00:52:42,555 --> 00:52:44,472
It’s so pretty.

825
00:52:44,473 --> 00:52:45,850
Just like you.

826
00:52:53,441 --> 00:52:54,441
A letter?

827
00:52:55,026 --> 00:52:56,194
What’s this?

828
00:52:58,446 --> 00:53:01,031
Roses are red, violets are blue.

829
00:53:01,032 --> 00:53:03,868
Something’s not dead,
it’s my love for you!

830
00:53:04,785 --> 00:53:07,788
Happy Valentine’s Day, Elyse.
I love you!

831
00:53:08,247 --> 00:53:11,124
Engineer Camero.
Only if I get lucky.

832
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:14,837
If not, I’ll just become
your non-showbiz boyfriend.

833
00:53:18,466 --> 00:53:19,538
Thank you.

834
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,756
Thanks for everything, amore.

835
00:53:25,681 --> 00:53:26,682
Te amo.

836
00:53:29,893 --> 00:53:31,145
Why are you swearing?

837
00:53:31,562 --> 00:53:32,562
Huh?

838
00:53:33,481 --> 00:53:35,315
No, stupid!

839
00:53:35,316 --> 00:53:38,110
That means
I love you in Spanish.

840
00:53:39,946 --> 00:53:41,488
I thought I heard you say,
eff ‘em all.

841
00:53:41,489 --> 00:53:42,990
Eff ‘em all?

842
00:53:44,408 --> 00:53:46,160
Te amo, too.

843
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:49,247
Stop! Don’t say it like that.

844
00:53:52,667 --> 00:53:55,127
You know, it would be nice
if we could live together.

845
00:53:55,711 --> 00:53:58,047
Then we could laugh
like this all the time.

846
00:54:00,633 --> 00:54:04,387
And when we do move in together,

847
00:54:05,721 --> 00:54:09,016
I want a painting just like that
in our living room.

848
00:54:09,475 --> 00:54:10,476
Sure.

849
00:54:11,194 --> 00:54:12,394
You know what..

850
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,146
You can also be displayed here.

851
00:54:15,147 --> 00:54:16,399
Because...

852
00:54:16,732 --> 00:54:18,401
you’re a masterpiece, too.

853
00:54:19,277 --> 00:54:22,028
Wow! You really are
something, Camero.

854
00:54:22,029 --> 00:54:23,322
Such a sweet-talker.

855
00:54:26,701 --> 00:54:28,494
Once I have a job,

856
00:54:28,995 --> 00:54:30,787
I can move out
of my parents’ house

857
00:54:30,788 --> 00:54:32,164
and live with you.

858
00:54:32,748 --> 00:54:34,250
We can do that, right?

859
00:54:36,752 --> 00:54:37,752
Of course.

860
00:54:38,462 --> 00:54:40,130
And I'll save up for all of that

861
00:54:40,131 --> 00:54:42,008
since I'm the first one
to get a job.

862
00:54:42,508 --> 00:54:44,552
Then, I'll get a condo,

863
00:54:45,052 --> 00:54:47,430
one that's close to the office
so I won't have to commute.

864
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,226
I’m so excited
for our future, babe.

865
00:54:52,935 --> 00:54:55,021
So am I.

866
00:55:33,893 --> 00:55:34,893
Ma...

867
00:55:35,102 --> 00:55:36,228
It’s okay.

868
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,064
Don’t cry anymore.

869
00:55:38,738 --> 00:55:41,316
Oh come on, I’m just
really happy for you.

870
00:55:41,317 --> 00:55:43,684
You’ve finally graduated.

871
00:55:52,495 --> 00:55:54,120
I should take a picture
of you guys.

872
00:55:54,121 --> 00:55:55,164
Okay.

873
00:55:55,693 --> 00:55:57,360
- Yes.
- I’ll hold this.

874
00:55:57,541 --> 00:55:58,542
One wacky shot.

875
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:01,323
Nice!

876
00:56:02,588 --> 00:56:03,588
Okay…

877
00:56:04,469 --> 00:56:06,926
One, two, three…

878
00:56:07,468 --> 00:56:08,803
So sweet…

879
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:12,723
Let’s take a selfie!

880
00:56:15,142 --> 00:56:17,228
I’m so proud of you,
you know that?

881
00:56:17,645 --> 00:56:19,605
You graduated on time.

882
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,860
You’re even the captain
of the Panthers.

883
00:56:23,563 --> 00:56:26,403
My god, why is my boyfriend
so perfect?

884
00:56:26,404 --> 00:56:27,904
Okay, enough with
the compliments;

885
00:56:27,905 --> 00:56:29,323
you're making me blush.

886
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:32,450
But...

887
00:56:33,953 --> 00:56:35,871
Wait for me, okay?

888
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:40,209
I promise that after I graduate,

889
00:56:40,543 --> 00:56:42,461
I’ll introduce you to my dad.

890
00:56:42,878 --> 00:56:44,170
Just two more years.

891
00:56:44,171 --> 00:56:45,381
Of course.

892
00:56:45,798 --> 00:56:47,967
And in those two years,

893
00:56:48,759 --> 00:56:50,593
I'll work really hard

894
00:56:50,594 --> 00:56:52,095
so I have a good face
to show your dad

895
00:56:52,096 --> 00:56:53,722
when you introduce me.

896
00:56:55,474 --> 00:56:58,644
I know that you’ll do great
in the real world.

897
00:56:59,311 --> 00:57:00,521
Thank you.

898
00:57:01,313 --> 00:57:02,606
But…

899
00:57:03,399 --> 00:57:05,526
I’m already feeling nervous
about the board exams.

900
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:07,652
I need to pass it right away

901
00:57:07,653 --> 00:57:10,072
so I can start earning
a decent salary.

902
00:57:10,698 --> 00:57:13,075
I'm sure that you'll pass,
it's you we're talking about!

903
00:57:13,742 --> 00:57:15,243
And then after that,

904
00:57:15,244 --> 00:57:16,995
you’ll be the one who designs

905
00:57:16,996 --> 00:57:21,417
the most iconic skyscraper
in the Manila skyline.

906
00:57:23,419 --> 00:57:24,712
I hope so...

907
00:57:25,713 --> 00:57:27,089
I really hope so.

908
00:57:31,594 --> 00:57:34,638
But, don’t leave, okay?

909
00:57:36,891 --> 00:57:37,892
Just stay here.

910
00:57:40,728 --> 00:57:42,229
Don't worry,

911
00:57:43,355 --> 00:57:45,399
I’ll always be here for you.

912
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:50,154
And I’ll celebrate
every milestone with you.

913
00:57:51,906 --> 00:57:52,906
Okay?

914
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:54,366
I promise.

915
00:57:55,576 --> 00:57:56,576
Okay.

916
00:59:22,955 --> 00:59:23,955
So?

917
00:59:24,331 --> 00:59:25,624
Can I kiss you?

918
00:59:26,959 --> 00:59:28,627
But I don’t know
how to do it, though.

919
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:38,845
Shit!
She’s getting closer.

920
00:59:38,846 --> 00:59:40,526
What should I do?
Is this really happening?

921
00:59:43,058 --> 00:59:44,268
Okay, calm down, Sevi.

922
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,689
A smack? So cute.

923
00:59:50,649 --> 00:59:53,319
I’m sorry,
I’m not so good at this.

924
00:59:53,724 --> 00:59:54,684
I’m sorry.

925
00:59:54,709 --> 00:59:56,918
Shit…
Fine, let’s do this.

926
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:09,144
Sir, are you okay?

927
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:11,855
I’m more than okay.

928
01:01:13,398 --> 01:01:16,360
I had no idea that it was
possible to be this happy.

929
01:01:19,363 --> 01:01:20,822
Okay, sir, get up now

930
01:01:20,823 --> 01:01:23,200
so you can go home.
Roel’s waiting for you.

931
01:01:28,706 --> 01:01:29,998
I’m sorry.

932
01:02:05,701 --> 01:02:08,745
What if I have
a boyfriend right now?

933
01:02:08,746 --> 01:02:10,497
I have something for you.

934
01:02:11,248 --> 01:02:12,248
What’s this?

935
01:02:12,583 --> 01:02:15,460
I call this
the Ely-mergency kit.

936
01:02:15,461 --> 01:02:18,088
We can do anything we want.

937
01:02:19,173 --> 01:02:20,340
Anything?

938
01:02:20,883 --> 01:02:21,883
Yes.

939
01:02:22,718 --> 01:02:23,886
Anything.

940
01:02:26,513 --> 01:02:28,098
Do you have a boyfriend?

941
01:02:29,308 --> 01:02:31,684
Never introduce
someone to your family

942
01:02:31,685 --> 01:02:35,481
unless you're 100% sure
about the person.
