1
00:00:10,504 --> 00:00:12,047
Ely, I don't understand...

2
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,474
Are you breaking up with me?

3
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:23,273
It’s only been a few days
since we last talked,

4
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:27,151
but I can really feel the
emptiness when she’s not around.

5
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,820
You really love her, don’t you?

6
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,614
If you love someone,

7
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:34,158
never ever let them go.

8
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,452
I miss her so much.

9
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,037
Elyse.

10
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,707
Thank you for
letting me take a break.

11
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,375
Let’s go home?

12
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:43,918
Come home to me?

13
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,550
I miss this.

14
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,718
Can you really live
without me, Elyse?

15
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,303
Why are you talking like that?

16
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,973
The doctor said that
you’re feeling better now.

17
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:00,893
You’re still a big baby, Elyse.

18
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:01,894
What?

19
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,855
Okay, I’m on my way there.

20
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,356
Ask for help, okay?

21
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,149
Don’t leave Sofia.

22
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,109
Babe, something
happened at home.

23
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,444
I need to go see Mama.

24
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,307
Come on, Sevi…

25
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,815
Where are you, Sevi?

26
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,401
Please, pick up.

27
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,131
Hello?

28
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:55,090
Sevi, are you okay?

29
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,259
Where are you?

30
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,721
Ma’am Elyse,
this is one of your staff.

31
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:02,973
Sorry...

32
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:03,974
Yes?

33
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:05,851
Just wanted to remind you

34
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:09,229
that you are needed at
the grand opening before 9AM.

35
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,273
Yes, right.
Okay, thank you.

36
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,649
I will be there.

37
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,027
Thank you.

38
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:25,120
Sev, if you need me,
just let me know.

39
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,957
I can leave the event.

40
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,438
Thank you!

41
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:55,943
On behalf of the Ledezma Group
of Hotels and Resorts,

42
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,988
I’d like to welcome everyone
to the Metropolitan Hotel.

43
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,324
There you go.

44
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:02,992
Thank you.

45
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,076
- Okay.
- Ready?

46
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,077
Let’s go.

47
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,621
Okay…

48
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,461
Thank you!

49
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:17,693
Congratulations!

50
00:04:17,718 --> 00:04:19,593
Sev, where are you?

51
00:04:19,618 --> 00:04:20,717
- Picture?
- Yes!

52
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:21,878
- Photo!
- Let’s take a photo.

53
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,646
Thanks for being here.

54
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:33,648
- Photo?
- Take a picture.

55
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,068
Babe, how are you?

56
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,779
It’s okay if you can’t
come here anymore.

57
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,705
Just let me know
where you are. Please.

58
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,431
Alfred!

59
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,188
You bastard!

60
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,691
What did you do to my mom?

61
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,026
Sev?

62
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,990
What are you talking about?

63
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,034
Sevi.

64
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:27,159
Sevi, not here.

65
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,785
Not here, Sevi.

66
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,203
Fuck you! What did you
do to my mom?

67
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,039
Sevi!

68
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:31,831
Stop!

69
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:32,831
Sevi!

70
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:33,958
Huh?

71
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:34,959
What is your problem?

72
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,839
The child… It’s gone.

73
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,592
The child is gone?

74
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,565
Sevi! Stop it!

75
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,817
What the hell
are you talking about?

76
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:01,527
Hold him down!

77
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,363
You assaulted my mom!

78
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,613
What?

79
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:06,949
Are you even human?

80
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:12,038
My mom lost her child,
and you’re just here smiling?

81
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,165
What the hell is happening?

82
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,749
Alfred, what did you do?

83
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,169
I don’t know what this
liar is talking about!

84
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,005
Take responsibility for
what you did to my mom.

85
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,175
What you did is
the same as killing her.

86
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:27,011
You practically killed us all.

87
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,014
I don’t know what
you’re talking about.

88
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,682
Sev, just stop it.

89
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,894
I had so much respect for you.

90
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:39,190
But then you were screwing
my mom behind my back!

91
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,236
Fuck you!
How could you do that?

92
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,280
I don’t know what he’s saying.

93
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,282
He’s a liar.

94
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,547
Elyse, your Mom!

95
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:03,965
Mommy?

96
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:05,382
- Help her!
- Help her!

97
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,968
Call an ambulance, hurry!

98
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,345
How dare you
do this to my family?

99
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:10,847
Hey!

100
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,055
Elyse!

101
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,392
- Mommy…
- Erin!

102
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,351
Call an ambulance, hurry!

103
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,228
Mommy! Mommy!

104
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,521
Call an ambulance!

105
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,774
Call an ambulance! Hurry up!

106
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,776
- Erin!
- Call an ambulance!

107
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,195
Someone call an ambulance!

108
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,405
Get him out of here!

109
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,824
Please.
Please, Mommy!

110
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,702
Mommy! Mommy!

111
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,580
Please, Mommy!

112
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,372
Someone!

113
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,124
Help please!

114
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,627
Please someone help!

115
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:42,670
Help!

116
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:43,920
Get him out!

117
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:44,922
Fuck you!

118
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,944
Please don't leave me, Mommy.

119
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,455
I’m sorry, Miss Ledezma.

120
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:47,901
No…

121
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:48,903
No.

122
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:55,909
No!

123
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,328
She can’t be!

124
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,374
No!

125
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:10,298
No! She can't be.
She's not dead!

126
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:14,095
She's not dead!
She's not.

127
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,641
No, she can't be.

128
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:26,607
No!

129
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,485
No!

130
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:54,051
I’m about to head out.
Do you need anything?

131
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,394
Please excuse me.

132
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,694
Elyse?

133
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,364
You have to eat.

134
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,494
Elyse, please.

135
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,873
At least drink some water.

136
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,251
You might get dehydrated.

137
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,637
At least get some rest.

138
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,015
I’ll ask Roel to
bring you home, okay?

139
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,269
You haven’t slept for days.

140
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,453
Elyse, dear...

141
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,501
Don’t touch me.

142
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,171
Don’t...

143
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,589
Just don’t fucking touch me.

144
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,094
God, you disgust me so much,
you know that?

145
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,055
You disgust me so fucking much,

146
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,642
I want to just kill myself.

147
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,814
Elyse, let’s not do this here.

148
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,691
We’re at your mom’s wake.

149
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:35,944
Her wake…

150
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,408
Her wake?

151
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:51,042
God! You know,
this wouldn’t even be happening

152
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,336
if you just tried to
become a decent

153
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:56,173
fucking human being
for fuck’s sake!

154
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:57,966
Elyse, this wouldn’t
have happened

155
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,052
if it weren’t for
your lying boyfriend.

156
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,181
Fuck you both!

157
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:11,480
You know, I am so
sick of your excuses!

158
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,692
God!

159
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,486
You know what, fuck you, Dad!

160
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:19,822
Fuck you!

161
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,911
Elyse, let’s just leave.

162
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,289
You need some rest.

163
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,586
Don’t disrespect me like that.

164
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,630
Let’s just finish
your mom’s funeral,

165
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,758
and then we’ll talk.

166
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,302
Elyse, let’s go now.

167
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,130
Oh my god.

168
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,059
Elyse, don’t...

169
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,030
Ely…

170
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,243
Why are you here?

171
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,995
I just wanted to know if...

172
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,592
My mom is gone!

173
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,930
How am I okay?

174
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,474
Ely, I’m sorry…

175
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,935
Sorry?

176
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,693
That’s all you have to say
after everything that you did?

177
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:28,241
After screaming and punching
my dad in front of my mom,

178
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:31,870
you have the audacity to
show up here at our house

179
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,747
and ask me if I’m okay?

180
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,083
Ely...

181
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,002
You know, Sevi!

182
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,673
You know! You fucking know!

183
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,428
You know she was sick!

184
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:58,939
Her heart was weak, Sevi.

185
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,942
It was weak.

186
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,737
She was sick!

187
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:11,869
And she died a painful death
because of what you did!

188
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,457
And now she’s...

189
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,960
And now she’s gone,
Sevi! She’s gone.

190
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,630
She’s gone…

191
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,177
I understand how painful
all of this is, Elyse.

192
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:34,141
But my mom's life
was also put in danger.

193
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,772
Why are you
blaming it all on me?

194
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,109
Your dad destroyed my family.

195
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,781
And you guys have the
nerve to be angry with me?

196
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,577
I didn’t mean to do what I did.

197
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,288
I regret it.

198
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:01,752
But your dad meant everything
he did to my mom.

199
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,004
Did you even get mad at him?

200
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,925
Don’t you understand, Ely?

201
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,802
Your dad destroyed my family.

202
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:11,803
No…

203
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,390
He assaulted my mom!

204
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,895
He deceived your mom.

205
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,065
Fuck, Ely, and...

206
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,233
you’re blaming it all on me?

207
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,236
Stop it, Sevi.

208
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,281
Just stop!

209
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,617
Okay, so what do you want to do?

210
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,493
Slap me then! Just slap me!

211
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,579
No, just stop!

212
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,581
Slap me!

213
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,624
- Hit me.
- No...

214
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,334
Fine, if that’s what will
get rid of your anger,

215
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,294
go ahead and do it!

216
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,755
I said, no! No!

217
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:53,721
I’ve been numb since I saw
my mom covered in blood.

218
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,058
That’s enough, Sevi, please.

219
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,684
Please!

220
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,812
Why don’t you
want to hear it, Elyse?

221
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,857
Fuck your dad!

222
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,861
He defiled my mom!

223
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,196
And he deceived your mom!

224
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,950
Why are you putting all
of the blame on my dad?

225
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,201
It’s an affair, Sevi!

226
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:21,415
Can’t you see that your mom
is equally to blame for this!

227
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,043
Do you hear yourself, Elyse?

228
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,253
My mom didn’t want that!

229
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,547
She had to do it
to keep her job.

230
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,508
Your dad blackmailed her!

231
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,719
Sevi, there are two
sides to the story.

232
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,972
How can you be sure
that that’s true?

233
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,855
Fuck, Elyse…

234
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,108
Are you serious?

235
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,490
I don’t know!

236
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,243
I don’t know!
I don’t know anymore.

237
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,996
I just don’t know!

238
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,793
It’s too painful.

239
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,590
It’s too painful!

240
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:14,927
I wish you...

241
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:18,180
I wish you just killed me
instead of her!

242
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,309
I wish it had been me instead.

243
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,687
That’s enough.

244
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,649
Ely… That’s enough, Ely.

245
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,570
Sevi, please…

246
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,198
She’s still in shock.

247
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,201
Both of you should stop.

248
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,162
Please.

249
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,468
Roel…

250
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,397
Ely, let’s go.

251
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,674
I can’t…

252
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,346
Baby…

253
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,398
Sweetheart, look at what I have!

254
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,442
Look!

255
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,403
Isn’t she cute?

256
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,031
What is that?

257
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,324
Sweetheart, it’s a dog.

258
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,992
Okay? And be kind.

259
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,244
She’s a stray puppy I rescued.

260
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,704
I felt bad for her.

261
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,456
But she looks scary.

262
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,999
What are you talking about?

263
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,001
Come on.

264
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,960
There you go.

265
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,219
She likes you, sweetheart.

266
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,927
- She does?
- Yes!

267
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,387
See?

268
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,013
She really does like you.

269
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,515
What are we going to name her?

270
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,268
Maybe we should name her Jewel.

271
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,063
Jewel, that’s such a cute name.

272
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,648
That’s a nice name.
Hi Jewel!

273
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,484
Are you a Jewel?

274
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,569
So Jewel,

275
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,905
you are going to be
Elyse’s protector, okay?

276
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,783
And you’ll always be with Elyse

277
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,161
when Mommy and Daddy
aren’t around, okay?

278
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,539
There. You better
take care of her, okay?

279
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,540
Okay.

280
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,547
Thank you for everything.

281
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,781
What happened?

282
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,365
Oh no.

283
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,785
You have to press hard, okay?

284
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,120
So the bleeding would stop.

285
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,121
Okay.

286
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,039
- Okay, it’s okay…
- Ouch!

287
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,292
- Mommy!
- It’s okay.

288
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,087
It's okay.
I’m here. I’m here.

289
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:38,922
There you go.

290
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,841
I told you

291
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,176
I was going to cut it myself.

292
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,471
Well, I wanted to show you
that I can cut fruits.

293
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,682
But I cut my finger instead.

294
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,225
That’s okay, but anyway...

295
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,770
Here! I’ll teach you
how to hold the knife

296
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,814
and keep your
fingers to yourself.

297
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,941
The claw! Like that.

298
00:21:58,942 --> 00:21:59,860
- Okay.
- Okay so you hold the knife

299
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:01,570
here so you have control.

300
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,155
And then your fingers…

301
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,492
Okay. Got it?

302
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,287
You make it look so easy.

303
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,165
It is, you just need
to practice. Okay, try it.

304
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,207
Come on.

305
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,375
Okay.

306
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,628
With four fingers.

307
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,880
- Like this?
- It’s the claw!

308
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,049
The claw...

309
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,302
- And then…
- A bit closer…

310
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,762
There you go.

311
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:30,140
Okay, then move…
There you go!

312
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,225
Am I doing it?

313
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,519
Okay.

314
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,897
You did it right.

315
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,398
Thank you, Mommy.

316
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,401
What would I ever do
without you?

317
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,111
Not cut fruits.

318
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,075
Let’s eat.

319
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,085
What will I do now
without you, Mommy?

320
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:33,870
Part of professionalism is
always looking presentable.

321
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,665
I always look
presentable, Mommy.

322
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,207
That’s true.

323
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,459
But I still don’t know where

324
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,296
I’m going to get
my self-confidence.

325
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,800
Mommy, I’m scared.

326
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,636
What if I mess up or something?

327
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,931
What if I do bad
on my first day?

328
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,809
I don’t want to
fail you and Daddy.

329
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:59,521
Love, it’s okay to be scared.

330
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,983
Just don’t let that
fear hold you back.

331
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:07,028
Be brave and face
every challenge head-on.

332
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,781
You can do it. You’re smart
and you’re hardworking.

333
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,492
You’ll figure it out.

334
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:16,371
And I know you want to
make me and Daddy proud but,

335
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:19,166
please— do it for yourself.

336
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,961
Okay.
Yes, Mommy.

337
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,211
Thank you.

338
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,013
I’m scared, Mommy.

339
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,978
I don’t think I can face
the world without you.

340
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,577
Mommy…

341
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,915
Oh, god…

342
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,833
I love you.

343
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,089
I love you so much.

344
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:15,699
Mommy?

345
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,665
Mommy?

346
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,235
Mommy...

347
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,392
Sev?

348
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,855
It’s late. What are you
still doing here?

349
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,524
I just need to finish this.

350
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,361
What about you,
why are you still here?

351
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,157
I was just gonna
grab some takeout.

352
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:41,785
Jeez, Sev.

353
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:45,371
My parents might end up
giving the firm to you.

354
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,165
There’d be nothing left for me.

355
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:54,964
Sev?

356
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,760
You don’t look okay.
Why don’t you take a break?

357
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:00,886
I need to finish this.

358
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:04,557
There might be another
construction mistake again.

359
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:10,730
Sev...

360
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,942
You don’t look okay.
That’s enough.

361
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:29,499
Sevi!

362
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,500
Fuck!

363
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,210
Everything’s a mess!

364
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,296
Sevi, please, sit down.

365
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,507
- Fuck!
- Sev...

366
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,093
Sev…

367
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:50,019
Luna, why is this
happening to me?

368
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,693
Am I a bad person?

369
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,158
I’m so exhausted.

370
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,582
- Sev…
- I am so exhausted.

371
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:12,876
Sev…

372
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,549
I didn’t know it was possible
to feel this kind of pain.

373
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,094
Elyse…

374
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,431
What are you doing?

375
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,726
I’m baking.

376
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,480
It’s Mom’s favorite
bonding time with me.

377
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,401
And it’s funny because...

378
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:26,448
I thought I’m already an expert
at this but without Mom

379
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:29,160
guiding me, I feel so lost.

380
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,916
I don’t know if
what I’m doing is right.

381
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,253
Ely…

382
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:46,636
It’s Auntie Erin’s
funeral today.

383
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:51,390
Why are you baking instead of

384
00:30:51,415 --> 00:30:53,460
being there to send her off?

385
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,981
I don’t want to see
Dad’s fake crying.

386
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,526
It will just make me more mad.

387
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:06,364
But Ely, your brother would
be there all by himself.

388
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,408
Shan’s not going.

389
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,411
We’re just going to go
there after the funeral

390
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,789
when my father is not there.

391
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:20,003
I don’t want to see our
relatives’ fake condolences.

392
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:25,216
Since they’re talking about us
behind our backs.

393
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,303
Ely…

394
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:36,895
And most importantly, Ida...

395
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:46,028
I don’t think I’m ready
to send her off yet.

396
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,780
I don’t think I can do it.

397
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,910
I don’t think I can do it.

398
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:55,830
Ely…

399
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,586
I’m not ready.

400
00:32:03,325 --> 00:32:06,966
I don’t know how I’m
going to move on from this.

401
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,596
I don’t think
I can move on from this.

402
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:17,435
It’s too painful.

403
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,689
I don’t think I can.

404
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,717
Why didn’t you go
to your mom’s funeral?

405
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,846
The guests were asking me, and
I didn’t know what to tell them.

406
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,100
Elyse?

407
00:32:58,652 --> 00:33:00,520
Aren’t you going
to say anything?

408
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,949
Why did you do that?

409
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,412
Elyse, what are you
talking about?

410
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,124
Why did you cheat on Mom?

411
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:23,918
Elyse…

412
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,545
Elyse, I would...

413
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,463
I will never cheat on your mom.

414
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,923
I loved your mom.

415
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:32,301
I loved Mom with my life.

416
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,637
But I know that you and
her started as an affair.

417
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:38,265
You cheated on Shan’s
mom with my mom,

418
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,268
so of course, you can do that.

419
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:41,894
You know what,

420
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,774
your boyfriend
is a bad influence.

421
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,694
You should break up with him.

422
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,113
You know up to now,

423
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,073
I still can’t believe
what he did to us.

424
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,827
That he’s capable of lying
to destroy our family.

425
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,203
I’m sure he’s just
covering for his mom.

426
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,707
Selene seduced me
out of desperation.

427
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,042
She probably needed my money

428
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,460
because she was
struggling financially

429
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,212
when her husband left her.

430
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:22,518
How could you do that?
How can you lie like that?

431
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,772
Elyse…

432
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,231
Elyse…

433
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,317
Listen to me.

434
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,486
You don’t believe
your own father?

435
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,863
I raised you like a princess.

436
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,573
I would never hurt you
or your mom.

437
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,951
Erin died because
of that lying bitch.

438
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:42,914
You should be blaming your
boyfriend’s family, not me.

439
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,458
Please! Just please...

440
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,085
Just please, stop lying to me.

441
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,045
I just want to know the truth.

442
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,172
- Elyse—
- I just want to know the truth!

443
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,466
I just want to know
your side of things!

444
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,259
Elyse, I will never lie to you.

445
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,888
I’m your father,
I will never lie to you.

446
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,101
Don’t you understand, Ely?

447
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:06,020
Your dad destroyed my family.

448
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,564
He assaulted my mom!

449
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:12,735
The baby in my mom's womb
died because of your dad.

450
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,363
He deceived your mom.

451
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,622
You harassed her, didn’t you?

452
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,499
- Didn’t you?
- I did not!

453
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,918
She seduced me!

454
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:31,045
You’re an abuser!

455
00:35:31,237 --> 00:35:33,072
You abused your power!

456
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,758
God, you cheated on Mom!

457
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,094
Oh my god, I can’t...

458
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:42,807
I can’t even look at you,
you manipulative bastard!

459
00:35:44,623 --> 00:35:46,457
What did you fucking say?

460
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,271
You’re fucking disgusting...

461
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,314
What?

462
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,151
What did you say?

463
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,819
You fucking bitch!

464
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:56,444
Fuck you!

465
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:56,946
Damn you!

466
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:57,946
Fuck you!

467
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,574
What did you say? Huh?

468
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,951
You fucking asshole!

469
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,452
No!

470
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:04,786
Don’t fucking touch her!

471
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,204
- Shan, wait—
- Don’t you dare touch her!

472
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,582
- Wait, Shan!
- You son of a bitch!

473
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,417
Don’t fucking touch her.

474
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,835
I will fucking destroy you.

475
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,087
Remember that!

476
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,463
Remember that!

477
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,698
Ely…

478
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,325
Just stay at my condo for now.

479
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,160
I can’t leave you with Alfred.

480
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,205
I’m worried about your safety.

481
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:51,249
I can’t believe my own father
could do this to me.

482
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,754
Sevi was right all along
and I told him those things.

483
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,798
Where are your things?

484
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:00,843
Ely?

485
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,762
Where are your things?

486
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,060
At the condo, Shan.

487
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:11,812
Okay, then.

488
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,523
Let’s just go there
for now, okay?

489
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,911
I hope Sevi’s not there.

490
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,788
I’m still not ready to see him.

491
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,375
After all the things
I’ve said to him…

492
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,801
This place has lost its light.

493
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:28,180
Everything feels so empty now.

494
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,412
Elyse…

495
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,548
Elyse, please…

496
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,051
Let me go.

497
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:08,261
Elyse, please don’t do this.

498
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,473
Let me go, Sevi!

499
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:18,314
- Elyse…
- Sevi, please.

500
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:19,940
Please.

501
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:26,113
Babe, please don’t leave.

502
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,784
Let’s talk about this.

503
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:33,954
We usually talk about
our problems, right?

504
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,832
Let’s talk about this, please.

505
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,670
Damn it, Sevi! Fuck!

506
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,277
Why can’t you just leave me?

507
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:52,347
I am so fucking tired.

508
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,683
Well, I fucking love you.

509
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,812
I’m tired too, you know!

510
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,898
I’m really, really tired.

511
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,276
But you’re my safe haven.

512
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,904
And you still want to leave me?

513
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,992
I’m sorry, okay? I’m sorry.

514
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,036
I’ll do better.

515
00:40:15,571 --> 00:40:18,408
I’ll work hard to earn a lot.

516
00:40:19,264 --> 00:40:20,476
I'll pay for everything,

517
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,252
I'll even wash
the dishes, I'll cook,

518
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,337
I’ll do it all. I’ll also
do all the cleaning.

519
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,508
Please, just don't
leave me, Elyse. Please.

520
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:31,762
Please…

521
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:35,808
I’m sorry for everything
I did. I’m sorry.

522
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,143
I’m sorry…

523
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:40,062
I’m sorry for everything
I said. I’m sorry, Elyse.

524
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,732
Please, Elyse. Please.

525
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,320
I just want to get out of here.

526
00:40:50,085 --> 00:40:54,452
I just want to get out of here,
can’t you understand that?

527
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:59,457
I can’t work at
our company anymore.

528
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:07,131
I will leave.
I will start a new life.

529
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,180
Without me?

530
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,767
I'm not part
of your plans anymore?

531
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:29,028
You’re all so fucking exhausting.

532
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,536
I need rest. I want rest!
I need rest!

533
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:41,832
Can’t you just
give it to me, please?

534
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,930
You’re tired of me?

535
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,271
Fuck, Elyse…

536
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,733
I look like a fool here.

537
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,736
I’ve been saying
sorry over and over.

538
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:14,406
But you haven’t given me
a single apology.

539
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,166
Do you even love me?

540
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:26,710
Yes.

541
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,922
But you’ve doubted
everything I said to you?

542
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:33,008
Do you believe your dad more?

543
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,351
Fuck.

544
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,647
I just remembered.

545
00:42:49,428 --> 00:42:50,638
Of course.

546
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,780
Family is more important.

547
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,412
I love my family more, too.

548
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,251
I understand.

549
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,713
You should just hate me!

550
00:43:12,098 --> 00:43:14,850
I called your mom a liar.

551
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,434
Is that what you want?

552
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:38,824
Leave.

553
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,669
I’m sorry.

554
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,464
Just go. Please.

555
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,388
Ely…

556
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,371
Ely?

557
00:45:08,513 --> 00:45:09,514
Ely...

558
00:45:13,486 --> 00:45:14,654
Look who’s here!

559
00:45:17,985 --> 00:45:18,986
Jewel?

560
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,511
Jewel!

561
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:27,063
Hi, baby.

562
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,565
I’m sorry for leaving you.

563
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,610
How did you get her, Shan?

564
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:41,613
Roel dropped her off
without Alfred’s knowledge.

565
00:45:42,141 --> 00:45:44,685
Also, he got you food.

566
00:45:45,633 --> 00:45:47,468
He’s so worried about you.

567
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,664
He did?

568
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:58,129
Roel has been
more of a father to me

569
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,506
than my dad could ever be.

570
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:03,260
Please message Roel for me.

571
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,889
Tell him I say thank you.

572
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,893
And tell him I’m doing okay.

573
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,604
Doing good.

574
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,856
I’m happy to see you smile, Ely.

575
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,985
So, have you thought
about what your plan is?

576
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,908
I’m actually thinking of

577
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,827
moving to the U.S. for a while.

578
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:33,832
Ida works there too,
so I won’t be alone.

579
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:39,213
I think a new environment
would be good for me.

580
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,464
Yes, I think it’s
a good idea for you

581
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,133
to leave the
country for a while.

582
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,467
Look, Ely…

583
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,929
As long as you’re okay

584
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,389
I’ll support you
no matter what, alright?

585
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,684
Thank you, Shan.

586
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,436
Also, Hiro’s inviting you
for his birthday.

587
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:56,605
He said he wants to see you.

588
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,524
I think you should go.

589
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:01,151
So you can meet other people.

590
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:14,540
Here. Hi, baby.
I missed you.

591
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,469
We had so many dreams back then.

592
00:47:36,124 --> 00:47:39,670
So many plans we
wanted to achieve together.

593
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:45,612
We really thought
we could make it.

594
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:18,270
Hello?

595
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:20,313
Ely, congratulations!

596
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:23,190
Our company has
sent you a job offer.

597
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:26,903
It’s official. You are
really flying to the U.S.

598
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,615
Finally! We will be
working together.

599
00:48:31,009 --> 00:48:33,845
It’s real. It’s happening.

600
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,455
I’m leaving.

601
00:48:38,523 --> 00:48:39,524
Hello?

602
00:48:39,817 --> 00:48:42,195
Ely, are you still there?

603
00:48:48,523 --> 00:48:49,690
Ida...

604
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:54,689
I miss him.

605
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,520
I miss him so much.

606
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:15,535
I really wish that none
of that had happened.

607
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,835
I want to see him so badly.

608
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:27,088
I want to see him so badly.

609
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:30,008
But I know that he
doesn’t want to see me.

610
00:49:34,698 --> 00:49:38,350
I think it’s a good idea to
see Sevi before you leave.

611
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,978
You need to be strong, Ely.

612
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:43,229
You guys need closure.

613
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,773
Sevi deserves closure.

614
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:49,152
It’s too cruel to leave
without him knowing.

615
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:52,571
You have been
together for so long.

616
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:57,369
You might regret not
talking to him one last time.

617
00:50:48,725 --> 00:50:49,752
Hi, Mommy.

618
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:56,011
I came here to say goodbye.

619
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:00,224
I’m leaving.

620
00:51:01,581 --> 00:51:03,500
I decided to leave.

621
00:51:06,632 --> 00:51:09,073
I feel so ashamed.

622
00:51:13,944 --> 00:51:16,321
I just want to start a new life.

623
00:51:16,909 --> 00:51:20,245
And I really want to
save my mental health.

624
00:51:23,855 --> 00:51:26,650
I don't think I can be
here anymore.

625
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:35,697
Being here is just
too painful for me.

626
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:40,747
I promise, Mommy,
I’ll come back.

627
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:46,603
I love you so much.

628
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:52,776
So much, Mommy.

629
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:01,326
I’ll be back.

630
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:30,397
Sevi.

631
00:52:35,207 --> 00:52:36,375
Oh, you’re already here, bro.

632
00:52:38,441 --> 00:52:40,318
Is it okay for you...

633
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,951
to go to a place like this?

634
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:44,870
Aren’t you gonna get mobbed?

635
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:49,457
It’s fine. There aren’t
too many people here.

636
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,133
What’s up?
How have you been?

637
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:03,120
As you can see.

638
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:06,975
A lot of work, but...

639
00:53:07,432 --> 00:53:08,473
I’m doing okay.

640
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,812
Sevi, you know that's not
what I was asking about.

641
00:53:19,382 --> 00:53:21,342
By the way, I sent something
to your bank account.

642
00:53:24,133 --> 00:53:25,802
Shit! Why, bro?

643
00:53:26,458 --> 00:53:27,958
It’s fine, I’m good.

644
00:53:28,158 --> 00:53:30,618
What do you mean, it’s fine?
That’s not for you.

645
00:53:30,754 --> 00:53:32,129
That’s for Auntie Selene.

646
00:53:32,154 --> 00:53:33,364
Just accept it.

647
00:53:33,928 --> 00:53:36,003
You know how much
I’ve hung out at your place,

648
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:38,131
and Auntie has fed me
countless times too.

649
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:42,437
Plus, you think I wouldn’t help?

650
00:53:46,252 --> 00:53:47,461
Thanks, bro.

651
00:53:48,508 --> 00:53:49,717
I’m ashamed.

652
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:51,685
Dumbass.

653
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,188
Ashamed, dude?

654
00:53:53,846 --> 00:53:56,057
There's no shame
between us. You know that.

655
00:54:02,526 --> 00:54:04,194
Do you want to talk
about what happened?

656
00:54:08,323 --> 00:54:12,786
I just want to
drink and breathe.

657
00:54:14,788 --> 00:54:15,789
Sounds good.

658
00:54:17,426 --> 00:54:18,844
Let’s drink and breathe.

659
00:54:30,887 --> 00:54:33,264
Okay! I’ll fetch you
at the airport.

660
00:54:33,265 --> 00:54:35,891
Have a safe flight
and see you soon!

661
00:54:35,892 --> 00:54:38,519
Okay.
See you soon, Ida.

662
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,520
Thank you.

663
00:54:46,403 --> 00:54:48,822
I’m going to miss you,
you know that?

664
00:54:49,239 --> 00:54:51,992
I’m sorry that I can’t
bring you with me.

665
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:57,456
But, Shan’s going to take
really good care of you.

666
00:54:58,206 --> 00:55:00,292
So you take care
of him too, okay?

667
00:55:02,544 --> 00:55:03,544
Ely?

668
00:55:08,467 --> 00:55:11,094
If you still have something
to do, finish it soon, okay?

669
00:55:28,403 --> 00:55:29,403
Shan?

670
00:55:30,781 --> 00:55:34,618
Can we drop by unit 1432
before we leave?

671
00:55:38,872 --> 00:55:39,872
Of course.

672
00:57:00,162 --> 00:57:01,705
I still can’t believe it.

673
00:57:02,622 --> 00:57:04,457
We’re homeowners now.

674
00:57:08,086 --> 00:57:11,297
This is one of the most
important milestones

675
00:57:11,298 --> 00:57:12,716
of our lives.

676
00:57:27,856 --> 00:57:31,984
I promise I’ll do
everything to be successful

677
00:57:31,985 --> 00:57:34,237
because I want to
marry you, Elyse.

678
00:57:36,656 --> 00:57:40,160
And I also don’t want us
to break up again.

679
00:57:40,577 --> 00:57:41,912
I love you, Elyse.

680
00:57:42,245 --> 00:57:44,789
I love you at all times.

681
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:50,212
I chose you because I love you.

682
00:57:51,296 --> 00:57:54,132
And I love you for who you are.

683
00:57:54,633 --> 00:57:56,092
And loving you

684
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:59,221
has made my life so beautiful.

685
00:58:19,532 --> 00:58:20,825
What are you doing here?

686
00:58:36,477 --> 00:58:39,855
I’m sorry. I thought you
were not around.

687
00:58:47,352 --> 00:58:49,813
- I want to apologize...
- I don’t need it.

688
00:58:52,274 --> 00:58:54,609
- Sevi, I’m so—
- I said I don’t need it.

689
00:58:57,153 --> 00:58:58,154
Okay.

690
00:58:59,656 --> 00:59:02,741
Of course…
Of course he’s mad.

691
00:59:02,742 --> 00:59:05,953
I said a lot
of bad things to him.

692
00:59:05,954 --> 00:59:07,789
I even slapped him. Twice.

693
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:16,840
Why are you crying?

694
00:59:17,632 --> 00:59:18,632
Huh?

695
00:59:21,511 --> 00:59:23,013
It’s nothing.

696
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,932
I was just thinking
of something.

697
00:59:28,768 --> 00:59:29,978
What’s that for?

698
00:59:36,026 --> 00:59:38,737
- It’s just—
- Fifth anniversary.

699
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:45,160
I’m sorry.

700
00:59:51,958 --> 00:59:53,418
You’re crying again.

701
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,223
Let it out.

702
01:00:10,477 --> 01:00:14,064
Let your emotions out.
I know you’re mad at me.

703
01:00:17,942 --> 01:00:21,237
Scream at me,
curse at me, hurt me…

704
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:23,323
I can’t do it.

705
01:00:24,199 --> 01:00:26,951
I can’t even let
a mosquito near you,

706
01:00:27,544 --> 01:00:28,879
let alone hurt you.

707
01:00:30,038 --> 01:00:32,040
But you’re mad, right?

708
01:00:32,957 --> 01:00:34,583
You’re mad at me.

709
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:36,275
Yes, I’m mad at you!

710
01:00:37,253 --> 01:00:38,933
I’m mad at your dad!

711
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:41,669
I’m mad at myself!
I’m mad at the world!

712
01:00:43,885 --> 01:00:44,886
Fuck.

713
01:00:45,845 --> 01:00:47,722
Why did this have to happen?

714
01:00:48,932 --> 01:00:50,725
We were so happy.

715
01:00:51,810 --> 01:00:53,395
Everything was fine.

716
01:00:55,355 --> 01:00:57,357
Yes, we fight, but

717
01:00:57,982 --> 01:01:00,068
it never got to this point.

718
01:01:02,112 --> 01:01:03,571
Damn it, Elyse, why?

719
01:01:04,447 --> 01:01:06,157
I’m sorry.

720
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:15,959
Why are you here again?

721
01:01:18,447 --> 01:01:19,824
Why did you show up again?

722
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:22,506
Didn’t you beg me to let you go,

723
01:01:22,507 --> 01:01:24,467
and now you’re
in front of me again?

724
01:01:26,928 --> 01:01:28,680
Please, Elyse.

725
01:01:30,098 --> 01:01:31,808
Don’t play with me.

726
01:01:33,643 --> 01:01:36,855
I want to properly say goodbye.

727
01:01:37,439 --> 01:01:38,440
Fuck this.

728
01:01:39,899 --> 01:01:40,900
Goodbye?

729
01:01:42,944 --> 01:01:44,529
Didn’t you already say goodbye?

730
01:01:47,582 --> 01:01:48,833
What do you really want?

731
01:01:49,033 --> 01:01:50,785
You’re just making
this harder for me.

732
01:01:51,703 --> 01:01:54,247
You won’t see me after this.

733
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,711
I’m leaving tonight.

734
01:02:00,378 --> 01:02:01,921
Didn’t you already leave?

735
01:02:03,381 --> 01:02:06,968
So, you showed up just to tell
me you’re leaving again.

736
01:02:08,136 --> 01:02:09,929
Are you messing with me?

737
01:02:16,561 --> 01:02:19,939
We need to properly
end things, Sevi.

738
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:25,128
Please,

739
01:02:25,153 --> 01:02:28,614
I need you to tell me that
you’re breaking up with me.

740
01:02:29,157 --> 01:02:30,158
I don’t want to.

741
01:02:32,162 --> 01:02:33,955
Sevi, please.

742
01:02:35,059 --> 01:02:37,728
Please… Please tell me.

743
01:02:39,469 --> 01:02:41,471
If you want to break up,

744
01:02:42,477 --> 01:02:44,646
you do it.

745
01:02:46,466 --> 01:02:50,053
Don’t force me to do
something I can’t.

746
01:03:07,195 --> 01:03:10,031
Sebastian Vincent Camero…

747
01:03:13,326 --> 01:03:14,327
I...

748
01:03:17,872 --> 01:03:18,873
I am...

749
01:03:19,185 --> 01:03:21,376
I am breaking up with you.

750
01:03:24,712 --> 01:03:27,173
You can hate me all you want.

751
01:03:27,799 --> 01:03:30,969
Do what you can to
cope with your pain.

752
01:03:33,054 --> 01:03:35,427
I am a horrible person

753
01:03:35,452 --> 01:03:38,414
who doubted you and your mom.

754
01:03:38,893 --> 01:03:41,563
I sided with my dad.

755
01:03:43,602 --> 01:03:45,479
I slapped you twice.

756
01:03:45,817 --> 01:03:49,904
I left you once and
I’m leaving you again.

757
01:03:52,561 --> 01:03:56,244
I’ve done too much damage, Sevi.

758
01:03:59,581 --> 01:04:02,125
You will find a better woman.

759
01:04:06,197 --> 01:04:07,949
Elyse, if you're leaving,

760
01:04:08,397 --> 01:04:10,382
just go already, please.

761
01:04:10,383 --> 01:04:11,843
I’m begging you.

762
01:04:14,137 --> 01:04:17,599
Stop making me believe
that you still love me.

763
01:04:21,644 --> 01:04:24,856
I love you. I do love you.

764
01:04:25,648 --> 01:04:28,818
But we just can’t be together.

765
01:04:39,495 --> 01:04:41,289
Before I go...

766
01:04:42,999 --> 01:04:45,293
can we at least
greet each other,

767
01:04:45,918 --> 01:04:47,587
one last time?

768
01:05:31,172 --> 01:05:34,634
Happy fifth anniversary, Sevi.

769
01:05:38,221 --> 01:05:39,222
Happy…

770
01:05:40,348 --> 01:05:42,684
Happy fifth anniversary,
my love.

771
01:05:52,443 --> 01:05:54,362
Can we make a wish?

772
01:06:46,873 --> 01:06:48,458
Leave, Elyse.

773
01:07:06,017 --> 01:07:08,269
You won’t ask where I’m going?

774
01:07:10,897 --> 01:07:12,022
No.

775
01:07:12,023 --> 01:07:13,858
I might look for you.

776
01:07:16,778 --> 01:07:18,696
I don’t want to look
for you anymore, Elyse.

777
01:07:20,072 --> 01:07:21,783
I don’t want to see you anymore.

778
01:07:31,667 --> 01:07:32,668
Okay.

779
01:07:39,383 --> 01:07:40,885
Goodbye, Sevi.

780
01:07:47,767 --> 01:07:50,185
This isn’t over yet.
I promise, Sevi.

781
01:07:50,186 --> 01:07:53,648
I will ruin him for you.

782
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:02,234
I'm sorry, Auntie.

783
01:10:03,945 --> 01:10:05,988
If only I can turn back time.

784
01:10:11,452 --> 01:10:12,787
It’s my fault.

785
01:10:13,704 --> 01:10:16,248
I couldn’t keep my promise.

786
01:10:18,042 --> 01:10:21,629
Elyse left me,
and I let it happen.

787
01:10:25,257 --> 01:10:27,093
Please forgive me, Auntie.

788
01:10:30,096 --> 01:10:31,347
I’m sorry.

789
01:11:20,646 --> 01:11:21,647
Roel,

790
01:11:22,314 --> 01:11:24,400
thank you for keeping
the room clean.

791
01:11:28,154 --> 01:11:30,989
Apparently, Sevi’s the
Head Engineer of Project Aruga.

792
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:32,490
How was the meeting earlier?

793
01:11:32,491 --> 01:11:33,651
It was fine.

794
01:11:34,493 --> 01:11:39,206
The CEO had the casino scrapped.

795
01:11:40,041 --> 01:11:42,293
CEO… you mean

796
01:11:42,752 --> 01:11:43,753
Elyse?

797
01:11:44,336 --> 01:11:45,337
Yes,

798
01:11:45,546 --> 01:11:47,923
Miss Ledezma.
