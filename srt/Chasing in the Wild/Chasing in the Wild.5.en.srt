1
00:00:10,156 --> 00:00:12,157
Shan! I'm glad you guys came.

2
00:00:12,158 --> 00:00:13,700
Well, I just came here
to see you.

3
00:00:13,701 --> 00:00:16,077
Shan,
you haven't greeted me yet.

4
00:00:16,078 --> 00:00:17,203
Happy birthday.

5
00:00:17,204 --> 00:00:18,872
But I hope
it won't be your last.

6
00:00:18,873 --> 00:00:19,873
Daddy!

7
00:00:20,499 --> 00:00:21,584
- I'm—
- I'm not...

8
00:00:22,209 --> 00:00:24,169
I'm not used to us
being like this.

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,046
Awkward.

10
00:00:25,047 --> 00:00:27,589
My dad is really strict.

11
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,924
He doesn't want me dating
before I graduate.

12
00:00:29,925 --> 00:00:31,009
Thanks.

13
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,678
It's not a big deal.

14
00:00:33,844 --> 00:00:35,930
What am I going to do with this?

15
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:38,267
So that I've got a reason
to see you again.

16
00:00:40,853 --> 00:00:42,229
Aren't you going
to wish me luck?

17
00:00:43,689 --> 00:00:44,690
Good luck.

18
00:00:55,034 --> 00:00:56,202
What are you doing?

19
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,455
It's cold.

20
00:01:01,082 --> 00:01:02,916
Why are you giving this to me?

21
00:01:02,917 --> 00:01:04,542
So that it has
a special meaning.

22
00:01:04,543 --> 00:01:06,045
Do you like me?

23
00:01:06,295 --> 00:01:07,421
I like you.

24
00:02:15,197 --> 00:02:16,949
Why are you giving this to me?

25
00:02:20,661 --> 00:02:22,371
So that it has
a special meaning.

26
00:02:23,205 --> 00:02:25,124
Am I special to you?

27
00:02:29,378 --> 00:02:30,713
Do you like me?

28
00:02:32,339 --> 00:02:33,799
Isn't it obvious?

29
00:02:35,968 --> 00:02:36,968
Sevi,

30
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:40,413
I don't want any mixed signals

31
00:02:40,438 --> 00:02:42,158
or confusing feelings, okay?

32
00:02:42,474 --> 00:02:43,976
So, yes or no?

33
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:47,646
Do you like me?

34
00:02:51,317 --> 00:02:52,568
I like you.

35
00:03:11,503 --> 00:03:12,503
Wait a second.

36
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:18,052
Roel texted me.

37
00:03:19,762 --> 00:03:21,013
I have to go.

38
00:03:21,597 --> 00:03:22,848
Thank you.

39
00:03:24,225 --> 00:03:25,392
All right then.

40
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:30,681
Will I see you for
Game 1 of the finals?

41
00:03:30,898 --> 00:03:32,441
Will you be there?

42
00:03:36,247 --> 00:03:38,029
I'd really love to go,

43
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,814
but I have training tomorrow.

44
00:03:40,366 --> 00:03:41,616
And you know
the cheer dance competition

45
00:03:41,617 --> 00:03:43,117
is only a few days away.

46
00:03:43,263 --> 00:03:44,332
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:46,538 --> 00:03:47,706
Too bad.

48
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,876
You're actually my lucky charm.

49
00:03:51,377 --> 00:03:54,713
We won in all the games
you went to.

50
00:03:55,923 --> 00:03:58,466
Wow, so that's why we lost
the game last time,

51
00:03:58,467 --> 00:04:00,052
‘cause I was there.

52
00:04:03,055 --> 00:04:04,139
But seriously,

53
00:04:04,723 --> 00:04:06,600
you don't need a lucky charm.

54
00:04:07,393 --> 00:04:08,560
You're a great player.

55
00:04:10,604 --> 00:04:11,897
Good luck tomorrow.

56
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,443
Because you wished me luck,

57
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:18,946
I'll be more motivated to play.

58
00:04:20,072 --> 00:04:22,324
- Wow.
- Thanks, Ely.

59
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,077
Good luck with your practice.

60
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:29,248
Wait, what did you just call me?

61
00:04:29,665 --> 00:04:30,665
Ely.

62
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,418
That's your nickname, right?

63
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,421
Okay,

64
00:04:36,463 --> 00:04:37,840
you can call me that...

65
00:04:38,924 --> 00:04:39,925
Sev.

66
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:48,434
Okay.

67
00:04:50,185 --> 00:04:51,186
Good night.

68
00:04:52,354 --> 00:04:53,689
Take care on your way home.

69
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:57,026
You too.

70
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,238
Take care

71
00:04:59,445 --> 00:05:00,612
and good night.

72
00:05:07,453 --> 00:05:08,454
I'll go.

73
00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:10,289
Take care.

74
00:05:31,143 --> 00:05:32,977
Man, I miss him.

75
00:05:32,978 --> 00:05:35,981
How I wish I could
watch the game today.

76
00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:41,153
Why are you smiling like that?

77
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:43,822
What's making you all giddy?

78
00:05:45,032 --> 00:05:46,575
It's nothing.

79
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:50,829
You're in love, aren't you?

80
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:56,335
I swear to god,
this girl is a mind reader!

81
00:05:56,674 --> 00:05:58,029
No, I'm not!

82
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,840
But I do have a problem.

83
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:05,343
Well, not really my problem.

84
00:06:05,344 --> 00:06:07,763
More like my friend's problem.

85
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:10,015
Okay.

86
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,352
Okay, well...

87
00:06:14,561 --> 00:06:17,772
A guy confessed to my friend.

88
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:19,400
He said that he liked her.

89
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,696
But she doesn't know
what to say back.

90
00:06:26,198 --> 00:06:30,035
Does this friend of yours
like this guy?

91
00:06:32,704 --> 00:06:33,872
She's not sure.

92
00:06:37,418 --> 00:06:38,418
But

93
00:06:38,752 --> 00:06:40,129
they did hold hands

94
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,714
and she really liked it.

95
00:06:43,632 --> 00:06:44,715
Well,

96
00:06:44,716 --> 00:06:48,636
your friend
needs to think about it.

97
00:06:48,637 --> 00:06:50,721
Because the next step is

98
00:06:50,722 --> 00:06:52,474
for the guy to woo her,

99
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,309
and then,

100
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,936
if they both like each other,

101
00:06:56,937 --> 00:06:59,398
they can start dating.

102
00:06:59,898 --> 00:07:00,983
Dating?

103
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:02,817
- Yes.
- But my friend's parents

104
00:07:02,818 --> 00:07:04,152
are strict.

105
00:07:04,153 --> 00:07:06,070
Well, come on, Ely.

106
00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:07,572
The more you avoid someone,

107
00:07:07,573 --> 00:07:09,824
the more your feelings go deep.

108
00:07:09,825 --> 00:07:11,577
Just be honest with him.

109
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:12,911
Besides,

110
00:07:13,412 --> 00:07:15,122
you've already held hands.

111
00:07:15,456 --> 00:07:18,667
So lowkey, you've kinda
led Sevi on.

112
00:07:19,418 --> 00:07:21,253
You can deal
with your dad later.

113
00:07:21,753 --> 00:07:23,839
That's not me. It's my friend.

114
00:07:24,256 --> 00:07:27,425
I'm the only one you really
consider as your friend.

115
00:07:27,426 --> 00:07:29,261
Shut up.

116
00:07:29,761 --> 00:07:33,139
But OMG, Sevi confessed!

117
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,091
And you like him too, right?

118
00:08:33,408 --> 00:08:35,326
Fine! I like him!

119
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,577
- OMG!
- I like him.

120
00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:38,830
Ely, I'm so proud of you.

121
00:08:39,414 --> 00:08:42,334
You're no longer in denial
about your feelings.

122
00:08:43,252 --> 00:08:46,170
You know,
just enjoy this moment.

123
00:08:46,171 --> 00:08:48,006
Get to know each other.

124
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:50,342
Actually, I'm sad.

125
00:08:50,717 --> 00:08:53,178
I really wanted to watch
his game today.

126
00:08:53,595 --> 00:08:54,846
Let's watch it.

127
00:08:59,351 --> 00:09:00,519
Sevi!

128
00:09:00,894 --> 00:09:03,104
Break a leg!
But not literally, okay?

129
00:09:03,105 --> 00:09:04,105
Don't jinx me!

130
00:09:04,106 --> 00:09:05,106
You guys had better win this

131
00:09:05,107 --> 00:09:06,732
because it would be
a waste of money

132
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:08,025
for us if you lost.

133
00:09:08,026 --> 00:09:09,277
You're nervous, huh?

134
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:10,361
Yes, fuck!

135
00:09:10,362 --> 00:09:13,072
I'm really nervous.
I'm sweating bullets.

136
00:09:13,073 --> 00:09:15,074
Jeez!
You know,

137
00:09:15,075 --> 00:09:16,284
it's okay to be nervous

138
00:09:16,285 --> 00:09:17,702
and even if you lose,
it's all good.

139
00:09:17,703 --> 00:09:19,537
Because you're still
treating us, right?

140
00:09:19,538 --> 00:09:20,788
- Milk tea!
- Yes!

141
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:22,206
Or your favorite...

142
00:09:22,207 --> 00:09:23,958
- matcha!
- Matcha!

143
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:25,710
Come on, I'm serious.

144
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:27,211
Our opponents are really strong

145
00:09:27,212 --> 00:09:28,629
and you're all
still joking around.

146
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,964
We're in the finals now.

147
00:09:29,965 --> 00:09:31,882
Hey, Sam wishes you luck.

148
00:09:31,883 --> 00:09:34,052
But she said, don't be too hard
on her school.

149
00:09:34,386 --> 00:09:35,470
I can't make any promises.

150
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:38,390
Sevirous, someone wants
to talk to you.

151
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:42,059
Hey, Sevi! You'd better do
a great job!

152
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,894
We don't want to see you
embarrassing yourself on TV.

153
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:45,939
Please! We've even
beaten you guys.

154
00:09:46,315 --> 00:09:48,774
But, seriously.

155
00:09:48,775 --> 00:09:50,109
Cheer for me because

156
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,903
we need to win Game 1
for us to be in the lead.

157
00:09:52,904 --> 00:09:54,905
You wanna know why he's nervous?

158
00:09:54,906 --> 00:09:56,782
‘Cause his cheerleader
isn't here.

159
00:09:56,783 --> 00:09:57,451
Oh no!

160
00:09:57,476 --> 00:09:59,577
Don't be too nervous!
You've got this.

161
00:09:59,578 --> 00:10:02,455
We're sorry that it's just us
cheering for you.

162
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:03,831
You guys really like
to tease, huh?

163
00:10:03,832 --> 00:10:05,416
I'm trying to be serious here.
I'll go now.

164
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:06,626
- Give it here.
- Bye!

165
00:10:06,627 --> 00:10:08,336
- Bye!
- Let's stop bothering him now.

166
00:10:08,337 --> 00:10:10,964
He might call his cheerleader.

167
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:15,802
Blue Hawks!

168
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:18,679
Boo!

169
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,350
Yellow Panthers!

170
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:23,518
Go, Camero!

171
00:10:26,396 --> 00:10:29,691
Why the hell
does he look so handsome?

172
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:34,446
It's Ely.

173
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,780
Oh!

174
00:10:39,534 --> 00:10:40,701
Hey, Ely!

175
00:10:40,702 --> 00:10:41,952
You're really into
the basketball finals

176
00:10:41,953 --> 00:10:43,372
this season, huh?

177
00:10:44,206 --> 00:10:45,499
Admit it!

178
00:10:45,957 --> 00:10:49,542
Are you finally
the King Panther's queen?

179
00:10:51,632 --> 00:10:53,839
Have you guys kissed yet?

180
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,217
Girls!

181
00:10:56,218 --> 00:10:58,136
- Can't I ask?
- What?

182
00:10:58,137 --> 00:10:59,137
Kiss?

183
00:11:01,473 --> 00:11:03,016
Seriously, come on.

184
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,227
Oh boy, you have
to be prepared, girl.

185
00:11:06,228 --> 00:11:07,478
I heard

186
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:10,231
that the Panthers
are good kissers.

187
00:11:10,232 --> 00:11:13,317
Yes! Based on my experience,
it's true.

188
00:11:13,318 --> 00:11:14,860
You'll have to put up a fight.

189
00:11:14,861 --> 00:11:18,322
Kissing?!
I haven't even thought of that.

190
00:11:18,323 --> 00:11:20,575
I haven't even had
my first kiss yet.

191
00:11:21,201 --> 00:11:23,787
No! I'll embarrass myself
in front of Sevi!

192
00:11:25,664 --> 00:11:27,415
Stop overthinking!

193
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,041
We're not even dating yet!

194
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:31,378
Guys, let's start our training.

195
00:11:31,878 --> 00:11:33,546
We're training until midnight,

196
00:11:33,547 --> 00:11:35,424
so let's save our energy.

197
00:11:35,841 --> 00:11:36,841
Come on!

198
00:11:37,092 --> 00:11:38,885
- Let's go!
- Good luck, girls!

199
00:11:39,177 --> 00:11:41,097
- I'll see you later up there.
- Good luck, babe.

200
00:11:41,722 --> 00:11:43,849
Let's go, Panthers! Let's go!

201
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,075
- Defense!
- Defense!

202
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:14,879
Five, six, seven,
and look then one, two, three...

203
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,548
Five, six, seven, and...

204
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:19,259
Go, Sevi!

205
00:12:25,807 --> 00:12:27,225
- Defense!
- Defense!

206
00:12:46,161 --> 00:12:52,917
Five, six, seven, and one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven...

207
00:12:52,918 --> 00:12:55,086
And one, two, three, four...

208
00:12:59,758 --> 00:13:05,806
- Defense!
- Defense!

209
00:13:21,988 --> 00:13:25,450
Five, six, seven,
and look then one, two, three...

210
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:30,622
- Defense!
- Defense!

211
00:13:44,594 --> 00:13:46,679
Oh shit!

212
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:52,561
- Defense!
- Defense!

213
00:13:56,648 --> 00:13:58,650
Ely, are you okay?

214
00:14:02,696 --> 00:14:04,822
There's still plenty of time,
we can definitely do this.

215
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:05,824
We've got this!

216
00:14:07,158 --> 00:14:08,833
Okay guys, stop arguing.

217
00:14:10,495 --> 00:14:11,829
There's still plenty of time.

218
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,039
We're going to win.

219
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,665
Just stay focused.

220
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:15,749
Keep your heads up.

221
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,418
Just forget about
the scoreboard for now.

222
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:18,419
Okay?

223
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,147
[indistinct chattering]

224
00:14:20,171 --> 00:14:21,006
Let's do this!

225
00:14:21,006 --> 00:14:21,923
Stay focused!

226
00:14:21,924 --> 00:14:23,340
Panthers on three.

227
00:14:23,341 --> 00:14:24,790
One, two, three...

228
00:14:24,815 --> 00:14:26,025
- Panthers!
- Panthers!

229
00:14:29,264 --> 00:14:30,557
Go, Sevi!

230
00:14:31,057 --> 00:14:34,019
- Defense!
- Defense!

231
00:14:35,478 --> 00:14:37,105
Let’s go, Panthers!

232
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:41,985
- Defense!
- Defense!

233
00:14:44,487 --> 00:14:46,114
Let’s go, Panthers!

234
00:14:54,998 --> 00:14:59,586
- Defense!
- Defense!

235
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:46,007
- Go, Sevi!
- You can do it!

236
00:16:15,453 --> 00:16:17,122
Oh no!

237
00:16:33,138 --> 00:16:34,305
Looks like...

238
00:16:34,723 --> 00:16:37,851
we’ll be drinking later.

239
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,166
@sevirous:
Can I come see you later?

240
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:03,877
I’ll wait for you
after your training.

241
00:17:04,002 --> 00:17:06,379
@elydezma:
We finish at 12M.N. today.

242
00:17:06,921 --> 00:17:08,923
It might be too late for you?

243
00:17:09,966 --> 00:17:10,966
Sevi!

244
00:17:11,428 --> 00:17:12,429
You came!

245
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,765
I heard about the game.

246
00:17:17,432 --> 00:17:20,517
Sorry to hear what happened
but you did really great.

247
00:17:20,518 --> 00:17:23,313
And I’m sure you’ll do
really great in Game 2.

248
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:25,732
Thanks.

249
00:17:26,524 --> 00:17:28,068
I told you

250
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:29,736
I just wanted to see you.

251
00:17:31,404 --> 00:17:32,614
Let’s eat?

252
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:46,043
I really hope
that you’ll feel better soon.

253
00:17:46,044 --> 00:17:48,588
You can still bounce back
in the next game.

254
00:17:51,216 --> 00:17:52,592
It’s my last year.

255
00:17:53,676 --> 00:17:55,345
And as captain,

256
00:17:56,596 --> 00:17:58,806
I really want
to win a championship

257
00:17:58,807 --> 00:18:00,850
for the team and the school.

258
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:12,612
It’s okay to feel bad.

259
00:18:13,446 --> 00:18:14,988
You did your best and

260
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:17,534
you didn’t get
the outcome that you wanted.

261
00:18:18,201 --> 00:18:20,410
But I know how hard you trained,

262
00:18:20,411 --> 00:18:23,205
so for sure you guys
will bounce back next time.

263
00:18:23,206 --> 00:18:24,666
Stronger.

264
00:18:27,961 --> 00:18:29,879
Stop it, you’re making me blush.

265
00:18:39,264 --> 00:18:40,264
Wow,

266
00:18:40,557 --> 00:18:43,017
you really like me that much?

267
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,395
Is it too obvious?

268
00:18:51,943 --> 00:18:52,944
What about you?

269
00:18:53,695 --> 00:18:55,822
How’s practice?

270
00:18:56,197 --> 00:18:58,199
Are you ready for
the cheer dance competition?

271
00:19:02,078 --> 00:19:03,621
To be honest,

272
00:19:05,248 --> 00:19:07,125
I’m really nervous about that.

273
00:19:10,295 --> 00:19:11,671
Relax, Elyse.

274
00:19:12,297 --> 00:19:14,674
If you fall, just stand back up.

275
00:19:15,925 --> 00:19:18,552
And don’t put too much
pressure on yourself

276
00:19:18,553 --> 00:19:20,846
since you’re still a sophomore.

277
00:19:20,847 --> 00:19:22,599
You can bounce back next year.

278
00:19:23,433 --> 00:19:24,851
Just enjoy it.

279
00:19:26,561 --> 00:19:27,562
Thanks.

280
00:19:29,564 --> 00:19:31,649
But, the truth is,

281
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,153
my dad doesn’t like me
doing this.

282
00:19:35,737 --> 00:19:37,030
The cheer dancing.

283
00:19:38,198 --> 00:19:41,093
He thinks
it’s just a distraction

284
00:19:41,242 --> 00:19:43,827
from becoming a future CEO.

285
00:19:43,961 --> 00:19:46,589
So, I don’t think
there’s going to be a next time.

286
00:19:46,873 --> 00:19:50,043
That’s why I really want to do
my best and give it my all.

287
00:19:50,793 --> 00:19:52,628
I believe

288
00:19:52,629 --> 00:19:55,590
you’ll definitely
ace your performance.

289
00:19:56,716 --> 00:19:58,801
Besides, I’ll be watching.

290
00:19:59,093 --> 00:20:00,762
I’ll be your cheerleader.

291
00:20:01,346 --> 00:20:03,264
I’ll even memorize
your school’s chants.

292
00:20:03,681 --> 00:20:04,681
Really?

293
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:06,768
I would love to see that.

294
00:20:07,101 --> 00:20:08,436
Make sure you wear green, okay?

295
00:20:08,811 --> 00:20:09,937
Is that all?

296
00:20:09,938 --> 00:20:11,189
Don’t worry about it.

297
00:20:56,734 --> 00:20:57,735
Sir…

298
00:21:04,534 --> 00:21:05,785
What happened to you,

299
00:21:06,494 --> 00:21:08,079
and why are you
coming home so late?

300
00:21:09,163 --> 00:21:11,124
The training finished late.

301
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,626
We’ve been working really hard

302
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,585
because, you know,

303
00:21:15,586 --> 00:21:17,186
the cheer dance competition
is coming up.

304
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,258
Do you have time
to do your homework?

305
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:23,051
Or even review for your classes?

306
00:21:23,052 --> 00:21:25,054
Of course, Dad.

307
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,933
My studies are still
my number one priority.

308
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,518
Elyse, how can you even study

309
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:33,730
if you're coming home at 1AM?

310
00:21:34,147 --> 00:21:35,189
Elyse,

311
00:21:35,565 --> 00:21:36,399
what do you even gain

312
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,318
from this frivolous
hobby of yours?

313
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,194
You need to focus on your grades

314
00:21:41,195 --> 00:21:42,696
and stay on the dean’s list.

315
00:21:42,697 --> 00:21:44,573
No business school
will accept you

316
00:21:44,574 --> 00:21:46,367
if you’re a mediocre student.

317
00:21:47,076 --> 00:21:49,120
You don’t have
to worry about that, Dad.

318
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,246
I’m still making sure that

319
00:21:51,247 --> 00:21:53,124
my grades aren’t suffering.

320
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,376
And, plus...

321
00:21:55,835 --> 00:21:57,586
We have a really good chance

322
00:21:57,587 --> 00:21:59,797
of placing in the top three
this year.

323
00:22:00,631 --> 00:22:02,591
That would boost my credentials.

324
00:22:02,592 --> 00:22:03,592
Elyse,

325
00:22:03,926 --> 00:22:05,886
no one in the
business world cares

326
00:22:05,887 --> 00:22:08,473
if you win in
a college dance competition.

327
00:22:09,432 --> 00:22:11,016
You have to give me

328
00:22:11,017 --> 00:22:12,560
a good enough reason

329
00:22:13,186 --> 00:22:15,271
why I should
let you continue with

330
00:22:15,813 --> 00:22:17,523
cheer dancing next school year.

331
00:22:19,275 --> 00:22:22,195
It’s a waste of time
and energy in my opinion.

332
00:22:23,988 --> 00:22:25,947
I will show you, Dad,

333
00:22:25,948 --> 00:22:28,076
that this isn’t a waste of time.

334
00:22:30,203 --> 00:22:32,789
I will make you guys
proud of our performance.

335
00:22:42,548 --> 00:22:43,548
My god.

336
00:22:48,388 --> 00:22:50,431
I can’t disappoint Mom and Dad.

337
00:22:50,848 --> 00:22:52,392
I have to do great.

338
00:22:56,062 --> 00:23:01,316
Ladies and gentlemen, get ready for an
electrifying display of talent and spirit.

339
00:23:01,317 --> 00:23:03,610
Welcome to our Cheerdance Competition

340
00:23:03,611 --> 00:23:05,237
where energy meets precision

341
00:23:05,238 --> 00:23:07,407
and enthusiasm reigns supreme!

342
00:23:08,491 --> 00:23:10,993
The Buffalos Pep Squad!

343
00:23:52,452 --> 00:23:54,537
Red Fighters Pep Squad!

344
00:24:19,312 --> 00:24:21,397
Blue Hawks Pep Squad!

345
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,414
Yellow Panthers Pep Squad!

346
00:24:51,636 --> 00:24:53,220
The Arrows are much better.

347
00:24:53,221 --> 00:24:54,221
Of course!

348
00:24:54,597 --> 00:24:55,597
But...

349
00:24:55,598 --> 00:24:57,141
they’re not bad.

350
00:25:09,237 --> 00:25:11,531
The Pitbulls Pep Squad!

351
00:25:35,096 --> 00:25:36,097
We can do this!

352
00:25:37,682 --> 00:25:39,475
Let’s go!

353
00:25:40,518 --> 00:25:41,519
Thank you.

354
00:25:42,687 --> 00:25:43,271
Guys!

355
00:25:43,271 --> 00:25:44,271
Guys, come here.

356
00:25:47,608 --> 00:25:49,109
Okay guys, listen.

357
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,444
We’re up next.

358
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,154
I know you all worked hard
to get here.

359
00:25:53,155 --> 00:25:57,158
Let’s give our 100%,
let’s give our 101%.

360
00:25:57,159 --> 00:25:58,493
Yes, Coach!

361
00:25:58,494 --> 00:26:00,870
Let’s aim for
a perfect routine, okay?

362
00:26:00,871 --> 00:26:02,372
But most importantly,

363
00:26:02,373 --> 00:26:05,167
enjoy every moment
of our routine.

364
00:26:05,626 --> 00:26:07,920
Enjoy every moment of it.

365
00:26:08,713 --> 00:26:10,590
I’m so proud of all of you.

366
00:26:12,091 --> 00:26:13,593
Okay? Let’s do this!

367
00:26:13,884 --> 00:26:15,303
Fly high on three?

368
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,554
One, two...

369
00:26:17,555 --> 00:26:18,847
- Fly high!
- Fly high!

370
00:26:18,848 --> 00:26:21,809
Let’s go!

371
00:26:23,227 --> 00:26:24,604
Let's go!

372
00:26:46,876 --> 00:26:50,171
Green Arrows Pep Squad!

373
00:27:02,433 --> 00:27:04,143
Go, Ely!

374
00:27:11,108 --> 00:27:14,027
I can do this... I can do this...

375
00:27:14,028 --> 00:27:16,113
- I can do this.
- Good luck!

376
00:27:32,922 --> 00:27:35,215
Green Arrows, fight and play.

377
00:27:35,216 --> 00:27:37,718
In our green, we rule today!

378
00:27:38,177 --> 00:27:40,888
On the court, we stand as one.

379
00:27:41,097 --> 00:27:43,683
Green Arrows, get it done!

380
00:27:49,355 --> 00:27:50,355
You memorized it?

381
00:27:50,606 --> 00:27:51,607
Of course!

382
00:28:23,931 --> 00:28:24,932
That was awesome!

383
00:28:46,579 --> 00:28:49,540
Shit! Ouch!

384
00:29:04,221 --> 00:29:06,474
Oh no! Is she okay?

385
00:29:14,565 --> 00:29:17,943
Fuck.
We already have deductions.

386
00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:33,459
Guys, good job!

387
00:29:37,922 --> 00:29:39,547
I’m really proud of you.

388
00:29:39,548 --> 00:29:41,966
Please don’t forget
to drink your water, okay?

389
00:29:41,967 --> 00:29:43,277
Yes, Coach!

390
00:29:53,771 --> 00:29:54,772
Elyse?

391
00:29:55,731 --> 00:29:56,665
Hey.

392
00:29:56,736 --> 00:29:57,988
Are you okay?

393
00:29:58,734 --> 00:29:59,902
How’s your leg?

394
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,612
It’s okay, Ely.

395
00:30:02,706 --> 00:30:04,416
Don’t feel bad about it.

396
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:06,866
Yes, Ely.

397
00:30:06,867 --> 00:30:08,076
You did great.

398
00:30:08,077 --> 00:30:09,578
You have nothing to worry about.

399
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:13,499
Hey, cheer up.

400
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:15,584
You did great.

401
00:30:19,755 --> 00:30:20,755
Okay?

402
00:30:22,424 --> 00:30:24,384
Let’s give a round of applause

403
00:30:24,385 --> 00:30:26,554
to our third placer...

404
00:30:27,972 --> 00:30:30,266
the Buffalos!

405
00:30:48,325 --> 00:30:50,785
Let’s welcome to the podium

406
00:30:50,786 --> 00:30:52,538
our second placer...

407
00:30:53,205 --> 00:30:55,165
the Panthers!

408
00:31:15,352 --> 00:31:16,437
And finally,

409
00:31:16,687 --> 00:31:19,398
our Cheer Dance Competition
champions...

410
00:31:20,024 --> 00:31:22,108
goes to...

411
00:31:22,109 --> 00:31:23,652
Do you think they’ll win?

412
00:31:27,364 --> 00:31:29,090
The Pitbulls!

413
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,014
Group hug, guys!

414
00:31:52,015 --> 00:31:53,974
Group hug! Come on!

415
00:31:54,892 --> 00:31:57,685
It’s okay.
Don’t be too sad.

416
00:31:57,686 --> 00:32:00,397
We still did a great job, right?

417
00:32:01,774 --> 00:32:03,567
This is your last year.

418
00:32:04,735 --> 00:32:05,819
You,

419
00:32:06,654 --> 00:32:08,029
Mae,

420
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,406
and Raya.

421
00:32:10,115 --> 00:32:11,366
That’s okay, baby girl.

422
00:32:11,367 --> 00:32:12,909
Make up for it next year.

423
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,244
Make us proud.

424
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:18,170
I’m sorry.

425
00:32:18,848 --> 00:32:20,291
It’s all my fault.

426
00:32:20,292 --> 00:32:21,377
Ely,

427
00:32:21,752 --> 00:32:23,169
it’s not your fault.

428
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,797
Stop punishing yourself.

429
00:32:25,047 --> 00:32:27,715
Yes, Ely.
You did so well.

430
00:32:27,716 --> 00:32:29,133
Our routine was very good

431
00:32:29,134 --> 00:32:30,551
and we trained really hard.

432
00:32:30,552 --> 00:32:33,596
It’s just that our
competitors were better than us.

433
00:32:33,597 --> 00:32:35,599
That’s just how
competitions are.

434
00:32:35,933 --> 00:32:38,519
Just don’t worry
about it too much, okay?

435
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,689
Come on, smile already.

436
00:32:41,897 --> 00:32:43,607
We’re graceful losers.

437
00:32:44,608 --> 00:32:46,025
Let’s just be happy for them.

438
00:32:46,026 --> 00:32:47,403
I mean, look at them, right?

439
00:32:51,115 --> 00:32:52,116
Let’s clap ourselves.

440
00:32:52,825 --> 00:32:53,826
Come on, Elyse.

441
00:32:55,369 --> 00:32:56,370
Come on, Elyse.

442
00:32:57,037 --> 00:32:57,705
We did it, Elyse!

443
00:32:57,705 --> 00:32:58,705
Come on!

444
00:32:59,915 --> 00:33:01,583
We have each other, we won!

445
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:03,001
Yes!

446
00:33:03,836 --> 00:33:11,836
Arrows! Arrows!

447
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,307
Hi!

448
00:33:17,308 --> 00:33:19,017
- Congratulations!
- Thank you!

449
00:33:19,018 --> 00:33:20,519
You guys were great, too.

450
00:33:23,856 --> 00:33:25,566
Elyse, I saw you fell earlier.

451
00:33:25,899 --> 00:33:26,900
Are you okay?

452
00:33:28,736 --> 00:33:29,737
Yes, I’m okay.

453
00:33:31,071 --> 00:33:32,781
Sorry, I have to go somewhere.

454
00:33:41,498 --> 00:33:42,498
Ely!

455
00:33:44,043 --> 00:33:45,335
How’s your foot?

456
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,488
I hate myself!

457
00:33:56,805 --> 00:33:59,600
I feel like it’s all my fault.

458
00:34:00,517 --> 00:34:01,518
Ely…

459
00:34:04,897 --> 00:34:07,815
Elyse, don’t worry
about your loss.

460
00:34:07,816 --> 00:34:09,193
What’s important is

461
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:12,446
that you did your best
and that you’re safe.

462
00:34:19,495 --> 00:34:20,495
Cheer up.

463
00:34:22,414 --> 00:34:24,458
There’s no such thing
as a perfect routine.

464
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:26,168
Besides,

465
00:34:27,044 --> 00:34:28,962
your routine was amazing.

466
00:34:29,463 --> 00:34:31,090
Just do your best
again next year.

467
00:34:36,678 --> 00:34:40,057
Are you still going
to cheer for me next year?

468
00:34:41,183 --> 00:34:42,976
I'll cheer for you forever.

469
00:34:43,352 --> 00:34:45,646
Go Green Arrows!

470
00:34:49,233 --> 00:34:50,275
Cheer up.

471
00:34:51,235 --> 00:34:52,486
You did good.

472
00:34:53,362 --> 00:34:54,362
Okay?

473
00:34:57,783 --> 00:34:58,783
Sevi!

474
00:34:59,535 --> 00:35:00,119
Hey!

475
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,120
Wait up, okay?

476
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,620
Hi!

477
00:35:01,912 --> 00:35:03,121
Hello!

478
00:35:03,122 --> 00:35:05,061
I’ve been looking for you.

479
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,250
Look!

480
00:35:06,251 --> 00:35:07,291
We won!

481
00:35:07,292 --> 00:35:08,417
Aren’t you going
to congratulate me?

482
00:35:08,418 --> 00:35:10,129
- Congratulations! Good job!
- Thanks!

483
00:35:10,629 --> 00:35:11,963
Are they close?

484
00:35:11,964 --> 00:35:14,507
- I thought I was his only cheerleader.
- Thank you.

485
00:35:14,508 --> 00:35:15,550
Let’s take a photo?

486
00:35:15,551 --> 00:35:16,551
Sure.

487
00:35:17,761 --> 00:35:19,429
One, two…

488
00:35:21,557 --> 00:35:23,933
Well? Did you watch
our performance?

489
00:35:23,934 --> 00:35:25,059
Yes, it was great!

490
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,811
You guys were fantastic.

491
00:35:25,812 --> 00:35:28,104
- She’s so touchy, huh?
- I really did my best.

492
00:35:28,105 --> 00:35:30,524
‘Cause, you know,
it’s our last year.

493
00:35:30,983 --> 00:35:31,983
Right?

494
00:35:32,192 --> 00:35:34,193
Oh yeah, we’ll see each other

495
00:35:34,194 --> 00:35:37,905
- on-site next year.
- Again… So touchy!

496
00:35:37,906 --> 00:35:39,115
As an engineer, okay?

497
00:35:39,116 --> 00:35:40,909
Hey! You might jinx it.

498
00:35:41,356 --> 00:35:43,537
I’m sure it’s going to be
easy for you.

499
00:35:44,496 --> 00:35:45,955
You know what Ely,

500
00:35:45,956 --> 00:35:47,749
if looks could kill,

501
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:51,962
that poor girl
is double dead by now.

502
00:35:53,505 --> 00:35:54,882
Okay, I’ll go now.

503
00:35:55,257 --> 00:35:56,758
- All right, take care!
- Bye!

504
00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:07,101
You didn’t mention

505
00:36:07,102 --> 00:36:10,438
that you have another
cheerleader friend

506
00:36:10,439 --> 00:36:11,857
from another school.

507
00:36:12,774 --> 00:36:13,983
Yes,

508
00:36:13,984 --> 00:36:15,276
she’s Bianca,

509
00:36:15,277 --> 00:36:16,904
and she’s also
an engineering student.

510
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,283
Well, I guess you like her
more than me.

511
00:36:22,659 --> 00:36:24,119
I mean, after all,

512
00:36:25,704 --> 00:36:27,289
they got first place.

513
00:36:30,209 --> 00:36:31,543
They were great.

514
00:36:35,672 --> 00:36:36,840
Elyse...

515
00:36:42,429 --> 00:36:43,931
you’re the only one I like.

516
00:36:53,315 --> 00:36:54,315
Come on.

517
00:36:54,483 --> 00:36:55,775
I’ll go with you
to the parking lot

518
00:36:55,776 --> 00:36:56,985
so you can rest.

519
00:36:59,238 --> 00:37:00,239
Let me carry your stuff.

520
00:37:02,074 --> 00:37:03,075
Let’s go.

521
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:13,418
So lucky!

522
00:37:20,717 --> 00:37:22,969
Good evening, Ma’am Elyse
and Ma’am Ida.

523
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:25,054
- Hello.
- To my room please.

524
00:37:25,055 --> 00:37:26,055
Okay, ma’am.

525
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,228
Where’s Auntie?

526
00:37:32,229 --> 00:37:33,397
Yes, wait…

527
00:37:34,189 --> 00:37:35,482
Where’s Mommy?

528
00:37:36,066 --> 00:37:39,194
Ma'am Elyse, Ma'am Erin is
having food prepared.

529
00:37:40,445 --> 00:37:41,405
Huh?

530
00:37:41,406 --> 00:37:42,698
- Really?
- Yes, ma’am.

531
00:37:44,324 --> 00:37:45,492
Excuse me.

532
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:47,992
[phone ringing]

533
00:37:48,787 --> 00:37:49,913
It’s Mommy.

534
00:37:52,499 --> 00:37:54,418
Hello, dear?
Are you home?

535
00:37:54,918 --> 00:37:56,003
Hi, Mommy!

536
00:37:56,545 --> 00:37:57,379
Yes.

537
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,506
What’s with the preparations?

538
00:38:00,924 --> 00:38:02,133
We’re going to celebrate

539
00:38:02,134 --> 00:38:03,509
because you did your best.

540
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,802
Remember, Elyse,

541
00:38:04,803 --> 00:38:07,139
you danced in front
of thousands of people!

542
00:38:07,597 --> 00:38:09,266
That alone is a big achievement.

543
00:38:09,975 --> 00:38:12,311
See? We’re all proud of you.

544
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:14,020
Auntie, me,

545
00:38:14,021 --> 00:38:15,022
the squad…

546
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,696
Even the Panthers
are proud of you.

547
00:38:17,983 --> 00:38:18,983
Ida...

548
00:38:19,008 --> 00:38:20,009
Panthers?

549
00:38:23,697 --> 00:38:25,448
Just a friend, Mommy.

550
00:38:25,449 --> 00:38:26,782
A female friend.

551
00:38:26,783 --> 00:38:28,197
Yes, Auntie.

552
00:38:28,952 --> 00:38:29,999
A cheerleader...

553
00:38:30,024 --> 00:38:32,901
A cheerleader female friend.

554
00:38:33,415 --> 00:38:35,083
The line’s choppy, Mommy.

555
00:38:37,553 --> 00:38:39,388
You are so good at lying, Ely,

556
00:38:39,413 --> 00:38:40,830
but you can’t lie to your mom.

557
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:42,273
I can hear it in your voice.

558
00:38:42,924 --> 00:38:44,383
Invite that friend of yours.

559
00:38:44,384 --> 00:38:46,219
I want to meet him.

560
00:38:50,849 --> 00:38:51,849
Really?

561
00:38:54,186 --> 00:38:55,514
I was just testing you.

562
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:58,041
But I guess my hunch was right?

563
00:38:58,565 --> 00:38:59,774
Okay.

564
00:38:59,775 --> 00:39:00,650
Just invite that friend of yours

565
00:39:00,651 --> 00:39:01,735
to have dinner with us.

566
00:39:05,364 --> 00:39:06,364
Wait…

567
00:39:06,365 --> 00:39:07,406
But Mommy,

568
00:39:07,407 --> 00:39:09,325
you know that
if Daddy finds out,

569
00:39:09,326 --> 00:39:10,869
he’s going to ground me.

570
00:39:11,703 --> 00:39:14,330
Your dad is out
on a business trip

571
00:39:14,331 --> 00:39:15,833
and won’t be back for two weeks.

572
00:39:15,858 --> 00:39:17,025
It’s fine.

573
00:39:17,376 --> 00:39:19,044
It’ll be our little secret.

574
00:39:19,378 --> 00:39:20,879
Tell her already!

575
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:25,092
Okay, Mommy.

576
00:39:25,675 --> 00:39:28,845
I’ll have Roel fetch him.

577
00:39:30,013 --> 00:39:31,013
Good.

578
00:39:31,473 --> 00:39:32,473
See you later.

579
00:39:32,474 --> 00:39:33,934
Okay. I love you.

580
00:39:34,434 --> 00:39:36,103
Bye-bye.
See you, Mommy.

581
00:39:44,027 --> 00:39:46,279
Oh my god.

582
00:39:46,696 --> 00:39:47,989
Ida, I’m scared.

583
00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:50,074
You know that I’ve never
introduced a guy

584
00:39:50,075 --> 00:39:51,381
to my mom before.

585
00:39:51,576 --> 00:39:54,121
I wonder what Sevi’s
thinking right now?

586
00:39:54,663 --> 00:39:55,539
I mean,

587
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,416
I’m introducing him to Mommy

588
00:39:57,707 --> 00:39:59,167
but we’re not even official.

589
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:01,419
Calm down, girl.

590
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,463
I know Auntie Erin
will like him.

591
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,507
Same goes for Sevi.

592
00:40:06,216 --> 00:40:07,634
And chill, girl.

593
00:40:08,135 --> 00:40:09,594
It’s just dinner.

594
00:40:11,388 --> 00:40:13,306
Wait, have you confessed to him?

595
00:40:13,723 --> 00:40:14,723
No.

596
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:15,851
Should I?

597
00:40:16,226 --> 00:40:17,144
Duh!

598
00:40:17,145 --> 00:40:19,479
If you like someone
who also likes you back,

599
00:40:19,855 --> 00:40:21,689
then you should be together.

600
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:22,982
And that will only happen

601
00:40:22,983 --> 00:40:24,401
if you confess
your feelings to him.

602
00:40:24,813 --> 00:40:26,398
I’m scared, okay?

603
00:40:26,736 --> 00:40:30,031
You know that I’ve never had
a boyfriend before.

604
00:40:31,074 --> 00:40:32,993
And that will soon change.

605
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,871
I can see how
Sevi’s good for you.

606
00:40:36,455 --> 00:40:37,887
He’s mature.

607
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,622
Good looking

608
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:41,274
and has good values.

609
00:40:41,751 --> 00:40:43,795
And he's
a good influence on you, too.

610
00:40:44,129 --> 00:40:46,422
I mean, look at your closet.

611
00:40:46,423 --> 00:40:48,175
You’re not a shopaholic anymore.

612
00:40:48,758 --> 00:40:49,468
Plus,

613
00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:50,969
you’re donating to charity.

614
00:40:51,595 --> 00:40:52,720
Most of all,

615
00:40:52,721 --> 00:40:54,264
you’re not grumpy anymore.

616
00:40:55,765 --> 00:40:57,893
So this is how you are
when you have a crush.

617
00:40:59,644 --> 00:41:01,937
What if I’m not
ready to tell him

618
00:41:01,938 --> 00:41:03,231
my real feelings?

619
00:41:03,523 --> 00:41:04,941
Are you still unsure?

620
00:41:06,735 --> 00:41:07,861
I am.

621
00:41:09,321 --> 00:41:11,823
He does give me butterflies.

622
00:41:12,782 --> 00:41:13,782
I just think,

623
00:41:13,783 --> 00:41:16,202
maybe we should
spend more time together.

624
00:41:16,203 --> 00:41:19,038
So we know that
we’re a good match.

625
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:20,499
In that case,

626
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:22,751
ask him to court you first.

627
00:41:23,293 --> 00:41:25,461
That’s a good way
to get to know each other.

628
00:41:25,462 --> 00:41:26,463
Court?

629
00:41:27,339 --> 00:41:28,673
People still do that?

630
00:41:29,132 --> 00:41:30,217
Duh!

631
00:41:31,384 --> 00:41:33,428
My god, Elyse.

632
00:41:42,062 --> 00:41:44,523
I’m sorry for inviting you
so suddenly.

633
00:41:45,524 --> 00:41:47,275
Mommy was being
really persistent.

634
00:41:49,611 --> 00:41:50,611
It’s okay.

635
00:41:50,904 --> 00:41:52,864
I really wanted
to see you anyway.

636
00:42:02,582 --> 00:42:04,417
Is it okay with your mom that

637
00:42:04,918 --> 00:42:06,586
it's just the two of us here?

638
00:42:08,421 --> 00:42:09,881
Yes, it’s okay.

639
00:42:12,175 --> 00:42:13,552
Do you think...

640
00:42:14,052 --> 00:42:15,512
she liked me?

641
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,350
I— I don’t know.

642
00:42:20,934 --> 00:42:21,935
Maybe?

643
00:42:23,186 --> 00:42:25,063
I just told her we’re friends.

644
00:42:26,231 --> 00:42:27,231
Friends?

645
00:42:27,691 --> 00:42:29,401
Since when have we been friends?

646
00:42:30,151 --> 00:42:32,112
Well, I didn’t know what to say.

647
00:42:33,405 --> 00:42:35,282
You’re not doing anything.

648
00:42:38,201 --> 00:42:40,537
What am I supposed to do?

649
00:42:43,665 --> 00:42:44,791
Well…

650
00:42:47,127 --> 00:42:49,129
I’m asking you to court me.

651
00:42:58,138 --> 00:43:00,889
Why...
Why is he laughing?

652
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:03,100
Did I sound so demanding?

653
00:43:03,101 --> 00:43:05,895
Maybe I should have
never listened to Ida!

654
00:43:06,479 --> 00:43:08,273
So, I just want to make sure…

655
00:43:09,774 --> 00:43:11,317
You want me to court you?

656
00:43:11,318 --> 00:43:12,318
Yes.

657
00:43:16,072 --> 00:43:17,073
You should.

658
00:43:20,118 --> 00:43:21,286
I should?

659
00:43:22,537 --> 00:43:23,538
Yes.

660
00:43:24,873 --> 00:43:25,873
I mean,

661
00:43:26,124 --> 00:43:27,751
you said you like me, right?

662
00:43:28,877 --> 00:43:31,837
And Ida told me that
if you like me,

663
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:33,423
then you should court me.

664
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,555
You know what, never mind.

665
00:43:41,056 --> 00:43:42,682
I shouldn’t have said anything.

666
00:43:47,604 --> 00:43:48,605
Okay.

667
00:43:50,649 --> 00:43:52,150
I’m sorry

668
00:43:54,235 --> 00:43:55,904
I didn’t ask you sooner.

669
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:12,671
Ely,

670
00:44:15,048 --> 00:44:16,716
can I court you?

671
00:44:32,232 --> 00:44:33,232
Okay.

672
00:44:54,796 --> 00:44:58,258
@elydezma: Sevi…
My mom wants you here. Now.

673
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,929
@elydezma: I’ll ask Roel to
pick you up wherever you are.

674
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:05,890
My mom wants to meet you.

675
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:08,893
@sevirous:
Huh? Hold on.

676
00:45:09,227 --> 00:45:11,104
Wait, is she mad?

677
00:45:11,354 --> 00:45:13,022
@sevirous:
We’re not even a couple yet!

678
00:45:15,483 --> 00:45:16,609
@elydezma:
Just go.

679
00:45:38,173 --> 00:45:39,174
Roel.

680
00:45:40,341 --> 00:45:42,594
Is what I’m wearing okay?

681
00:45:43,219 --> 00:45:44,428
It’s fine, sir.

682
00:45:44,429 --> 00:45:46,473
Is Elyse’s mom nice?

683
00:45:47,223 --> 00:45:48,599
I’m a bit scared.

684
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,643
Got any tips?

685
00:45:54,439 --> 00:45:56,775
Ma’am Erin is nice.

686
00:45:57,525 --> 00:45:59,568
Just be yourself

687
00:45:59,569 --> 00:46:02,363
because she wants
to know the real you.

688
00:46:03,072 --> 00:46:05,491
So that she’ll get
to know you better.

689
00:46:05,492 --> 00:46:06,825
You’re actually

690
00:46:06,826 --> 00:46:09,078
the first guy

691
00:46:09,621 --> 00:46:12,165
Ma’am Erin wants to get to know.

692
00:46:13,166 --> 00:46:15,125
That’s how important you are

693
00:46:15,126 --> 00:46:16,377
to Ma’am Elyse.

694
00:46:16,836 --> 00:46:18,087
Thanks, Roel.

695
00:46:19,589 --> 00:46:21,007
I hope she likes me.

696
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,384
Are you ready?

697
00:46:23,676 --> 00:46:25,636
- Yes, I am.
- Let’s go.

698
00:46:45,949 --> 00:46:48,200
@sevirous: I’m fine.
My body’s just a bit sore.

699
00:46:48,201 --> 00:46:50,161
@sevirous:
Because I fell for you.

700
00:46:50,245 --> 00:46:51,578
Sevi’s amazing, huh?

701
00:46:51,579 --> 00:46:52,622
You want to know why?

702
00:46:52,997 --> 00:46:54,331
It’s because he’s inspired

703
00:46:54,332 --> 00:46:55,291
by you.

704
00:46:55,292 --> 00:46:56,625
- Really?
- Really!

705
00:46:56,626 --> 00:46:58,293
I think he really likes you.

706
00:46:58,294 --> 00:46:59,712
I’m really nervous.

707
00:47:00,004 --> 00:47:01,381
Believe in yourself.

708
00:47:01,714 --> 00:47:03,194
That’s why
you’re the only one for me.

709
00:47:03,508 --> 00:47:05,133
Just one word from you

710
00:47:05,134 --> 00:47:06,426
and I feel more confident.

711
00:47:06,427 --> 00:47:07,762
Wear this for Game 2, okay?

712
00:47:08,471 --> 00:47:09,972
I don’t think I can, Sevi.

713
00:47:09,973 --> 00:47:11,224
I’m sorry.

714
00:47:11,808 --> 00:47:13,016
Is this okay?

715
00:47:13,017 --> 00:47:15,270
You know
I can’t ruin the surprise.

716
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:17,020
Don’t worry about it.

717
00:47:17,021 --> 00:47:19,232
It will all be worth it
once he sees your banner.

718
00:47:20,275 --> 00:47:21,025
Hi, Dad!

719
00:47:21,025 --> 00:47:21,943
Hi!

720
00:47:21,944 --> 00:47:23,402
We’re just...

721
00:47:23,403 --> 00:47:25,028
working on a new project.

722
00:47:25,029 --> 00:47:26,238
Can I take a look at it?

723
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:28,031
Don’t be shy,
I just want to see it.

724
00:47:28,032 --> 00:47:29,492
No...
