1
00:00:10,656 --> 00:00:12,615
Sevi!
Break a leg!

2
00:00:12,616 --> 00:00:13,992
But not literally, okay?

3
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:15,869
I’m really nervous.
I'm sweating bullets.

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,746
You wanna know why he's nervous?

5
00:00:17,747 --> 00:00:19,832
‘Cause his cheerleader
isn't here.

6
00:00:20,249 --> 00:00:23,001
You're really into the basketball
finals this season, huh?

7
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:26,464
Are you finally
the King Panther’s queen?

8
00:00:27,506 --> 00:00:29,215
How’s practice?

9
00:00:29,216 --> 00:00:31,016
Are you ready for the
cheer dance competition?

10
00:00:31,218 --> 00:00:32,927
Ely, are you okay?

11
00:00:32,928 --> 00:00:34,804
I’m really nervous about that.

12
00:00:34,805 --> 00:00:36,181
I’ll be watching.

13
00:00:36,182 --> 00:00:37,767
I’ll be your cheerleader.

14
00:00:47,985 --> 00:00:48,986
Oh my god.

15
00:00:49,695 --> 00:00:52,113
We’re going to celebrate
because you did your best.

16
00:00:52,114 --> 00:00:53,782
Invite that friend of yours.

17
00:00:53,783 --> 00:00:55,242
I want to meet him.

18
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:57,660
@elydezma:
My mom wants you here.

19
00:00:57,661 --> 00:00:58,370
Now.

20
00:00:58,371 --> 00:01:00,205
I’m introducing him to Mommy

21
00:01:00,206 --> 00:01:01,581
but we’re not even official.

22
00:01:01,582 --> 00:01:03,583
Is Elyse’s mom nice?

23
00:01:03,584 --> 00:01:04,835
I’m a bit scared.

24
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:18,993
Just place it there.

25
00:02:19,785 --> 00:02:20,578
There…

26
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:21,871
Thank you.

27
00:02:22,288 --> 00:02:23,080
There you go.

28
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:24,914
And make sure to prepare
the dessert too, okay?

29
00:02:24,915 --> 00:02:25,499
Yes, ma’am.

30
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,292
Thank you, Ida, for helping.

31
00:02:27,293 --> 00:02:29,043
- No problem, Auntie.
- Oh!

32
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:30,462
Mommy.

33
00:02:32,089 --> 00:02:33,257
Good morning.

34
00:02:34,008 --> 00:02:35,926
I mean, good afternoon.

35
00:02:37,178 --> 00:02:38,511
Hey, it’s nighttime already.

36
00:02:38,512 --> 00:02:39,805
Oh, good night.

37
00:02:40,931 --> 00:02:41,599
Huh?

38
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,017
It’s evening.

39
00:02:44,393 --> 00:02:46,353
Good evening.

40
00:02:48,245 --> 00:02:50,605
Oh no, he’s so nervous.

41
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,923
I’m getting nervous now, too.

42
00:02:52,948 --> 00:02:55,462
What if Mommy does not like him?

43
00:02:56,989 --> 00:02:58,324
Good evening to you, too.

44
00:03:00,618 --> 00:03:02,869
Mom, this is Sevi.

45
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,163
Sevi, my mom.

46
00:03:04,538 --> 00:03:05,914
- Hi, Sevi.
- Hello.

47
00:03:05,915 --> 00:03:07,249
Don’t be shy, come on.

48
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:08,958
Sit down.

49
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,085
Take your seat.

50
00:03:12,004 --> 00:03:13,005
Thank you.

51
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,340
Thank you.

52
00:03:26,602 --> 00:03:29,261
Don’t be shy.
Go ahead and eat up.

53
00:03:29,396 --> 00:03:30,439
Let’s eat.

54
00:03:30,648 --> 00:03:31,649
What do you want?

55
00:03:32,274 --> 00:03:33,484
I’m still full.

56
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,528
Still full?

57
00:03:37,821 --> 00:03:38,821
Are you saying

58
00:03:38,822 --> 00:03:40,698
you won’t even taste

59
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:42,800
the food we prepared for you?

60
00:03:44,018 --> 00:03:45,351
Actually, I’m hungry.

61
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:47,295
I got hungry
from the ride earlier.

62
00:03:47,873 --> 00:03:49,541
That’s good. Go ahead, then.

63
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:13,274
Do you want this?

64
00:04:17,528 --> 00:04:18,612
Thank you.

65
00:04:19,221 --> 00:04:21,991
Where are you from, Sevi?

66
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:25,308
I live in Sampaloc.

67
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:29,206
And you go to school
in España, right?

68
00:04:29,873 --> 00:04:30,666
Yes.

69
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:32,251
How are your studies going?

70
00:04:33,502 --> 00:04:34,502
It's okay.

71
00:04:34,503 --> 00:04:36,004
It’s a bit hectic

72
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:37,463
because it’s my 5th year

73
00:04:37,464 --> 00:04:41,218
and it’s also the finals
for the basketball season.

74
00:04:41,911 --> 00:04:43,637
That’s right!

75
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,973
You’re the captain, right?

76
00:04:47,182 --> 00:04:50,643
So, you and Elyse
are both student-athletes.

77
00:04:50,644 --> 00:04:52,895
You know, it’s admirable that

78
00:04:52,896 --> 00:04:55,983
you both manage
to balance sports and studies.

79
00:04:56,442 --> 00:05:00,029
I’ve seen Elyse do it
and it’s not easy, right?

80
00:05:00,612 --> 00:05:02,822
It’s really hard
to balance them,

81
00:05:02,823 --> 00:05:04,782
so strong discipline

82
00:05:04,783 --> 00:05:06,702
and good time management
is needed.

83
00:05:07,036 --> 00:05:08,077
But

84
00:05:08,078 --> 00:05:11,957
I make sure to give time
to my top priorities.

85
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:17,670
So, does that mean,

86
00:05:17,671 --> 00:05:19,381
you being here

87
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:22,426
is one of your top priorities?

88
00:05:23,093 --> 00:05:24,094
Mom!

89
00:05:25,012 --> 00:05:26,472
I’m just asking.

90
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:31,477
Well, that’s true.

91
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:37,858
I think he’s just here
for the free food.

92
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:39,969
He just can’t say no
to free food.

93
00:05:42,863 --> 00:05:43,864
But...

94
00:05:44,615 --> 00:05:46,324
I really wanted to see Elyse

95
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:48,988
and check on her because I knew

96
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,661
she must be feeling down

97
00:05:50,662 --> 00:05:52,498
after the
cheer dance competition.

98
00:05:58,962 --> 00:06:01,131
That’s really nice of you.

99
00:06:01,507 --> 00:06:03,842
To think of Elyse.

100
00:06:06,553 --> 00:06:08,555
You’re really such a good...

101
00:06:08,972 --> 00:06:11,141
friend of Elyse.

102
00:06:13,977 --> 00:06:15,813
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

103
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,149
You’re not drinking
enough water.

104
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:21,902
Just slow down.

105
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:24,780
We’re not in a marathon
or something.

106
00:06:27,116 --> 00:06:28,158
Have some more.

107
00:06:46,593 --> 00:06:49,805
Thanks for the food.

108
00:06:50,472 --> 00:06:51,765
I’m really full.

109
00:06:57,479 --> 00:06:59,260
Is it okay with your mom that

110
00:06:59,815 --> 00:07:01,400
it's just the two of us here?

111
00:07:03,318 --> 00:07:04,570
Yes, it’s okay.

112
00:07:05,154 --> 00:07:06,447
She’s also resting now.

113
00:07:06,905 --> 00:07:09,032
Your mom is so nice, Ely.

114
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:11,994
Yes, she’s an angel.

115
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,044
Do you think...

116
00:07:16,507 --> 00:07:17,883
she liked me?

117
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:21,511
I don’t know.

118
00:07:21,753 --> 00:07:22,753
Maybe?

119
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,215
I just told her we’re friends.

120
00:07:25,707 --> 00:07:26,717
Friends?

121
00:07:26,718 --> 00:07:28,342
Since when have we been friends?

122
00:07:28,343 --> 00:07:30,345
Well, I didn’t know what to say.

123
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,265
You’re not doing anything.

124
00:07:34,391 --> 00:07:36,602
What am I supposed to do?

125
00:07:39,104 --> 00:07:40,105
Well...

126
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:44,359
I’m asking you to court me.

127
00:07:53,368 --> 00:07:55,245
So, I just want to make sure…

128
00:07:55,704 --> 00:07:57,330
You want me to court you?

129
00:07:57,331 --> 00:07:58,331
Yes.

130
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,170
You should.

131
00:08:04,796 --> 00:08:05,839
I mean,

132
00:08:06,173 --> 00:08:07,758
you said you like me, right?

133
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,177
And Ida told me
that if you like me,

134
00:08:11,178 --> 00:08:12,804
then you should court me.

135
00:08:17,017 --> 00:08:18,519
You know what, never mind.

136
00:08:18,894 --> 00:08:20,729
I shouldn’t have said anything.

137
00:08:22,356 --> 00:08:23,690
I’m sorry.

138
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:27,569
I didn’t ask you sooner.

139
00:08:39,206 --> 00:08:40,207
Ely,

140
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:44,211
can I court you?

141
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,351
Okay.

142
00:09:09,994 --> 00:09:11,421
[phone notification]

143
00:09:19,596 --> 00:09:20,929
@sevirous:
Good morning!

144
00:09:20,954 --> 00:09:22,456
How was your sleep?

145
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:29,672
@elydezma: Good morning.
It was great. You?

146
00:09:33,468 --> 00:09:34,996
@sevirous:
I’m okay.

147
00:09:35,028 --> 00:09:37,000
My body’s just a bit sore.

148
00:09:37,158 --> 00:09:39,244
@elydezma:
Aww, why?

149
00:09:42,161 --> 00:09:44,396
@sevirous:
Because I fell for you.

150
00:09:56,013 --> 00:10:00,369
@elydezma: So corny
this early morning.

151
00:10:00,863 --> 00:10:02,997
@sevirous: But you felt giddy,
didn’t you?

152
00:10:03,022 --> 00:10:04,565
Admit it.

153
00:10:06,111 --> 00:10:07,446
@elydezma:
Yes.

154
00:10:11,596 --> 00:10:14,391
@sevirous:
Camero scores three points!

155
00:10:30,321 --> 00:10:32,197
@sevirous: We just
finished our training.

156
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,533
Are you still at the cafe?

157
00:10:35,404 --> 00:10:38,452
@elydezma: Yes, I’m still
finishing my paper.

158
00:10:47,042 --> 00:10:48,502
@sevirous:
Are you with Ida?

159
00:10:51,021 --> 00:10:52,479
@elydezma:
No, I’m alone.

160
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,389
She’s done with her paper.

161
00:10:54,414 --> 00:10:57,500
I don’t think I’ll meet
the deadline tonight.

162
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,261
@sevirous:
I’m sure you can do it.

163
00:11:07,262 --> 00:11:08,971
Stop using your phone now

164
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:11,474
and focus on your paper.

165
00:11:13,744 --> 00:11:16,576
@elydezma: Okay, I will.
I can do this.

166
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:18,328
Talk to you later.

167
00:11:25,396 --> 00:11:27,147
What are you doing here?

168
00:11:27,172 --> 00:11:29,257
It’s lonely cramming
all by yourself.

169
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:32,408
Did you commute here?
Isn’t it rush hour already?

170
00:11:33,034 --> 00:11:35,161
You worry too much.

171
00:11:35,703 --> 00:11:37,997
Is that practice for when
you become my girlfriend?

172
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:42,335
I’m just asking.

173
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:44,085
But...

174
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,542
thank you for coming.

175
00:11:47,114 --> 00:11:48,365
You’re welcome.

176
00:12:31,802 --> 00:12:32,844
Thank you.

177
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:34,720
You’re welcome.

178
00:12:40,017 --> 00:12:41,017
Wow.

179
00:12:41,347 --> 00:12:42,347
Here.

180
00:12:42,771 --> 00:12:44,397
Great! Now, here.

181
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,108
And then, here.

182
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:49,449
Then… here.

183
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,586
Is it a bad idea
to surprise Sevi here?

184
00:13:15,245 --> 00:13:17,024
There are too many
people inside.

185
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:19,006
I don’t want to make a scene.

186
00:13:20,848 --> 00:13:21,848
Elyse!

187
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:25,143
Sorry,

188
00:13:25,144 --> 00:13:26,270
you might’ve forgotten...

189
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:28,814
I’m Luna, Sevi’s friend.

190
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:31,669
Yes, I remember you.

191
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:35,448
How can I not remember you?

192
00:13:35,473 --> 00:13:37,100
You’re Sevi’s ex-crush.

193
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,491
Why are you just standing here?

194
00:13:39,492 --> 00:13:40,492
Let’s sit there.

195
00:13:40,546 --> 00:13:42,452
- Are you sure?
- Yes, let’s go.

196
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:43,745
Come with me.

197
00:13:43,746 --> 00:13:44,746
Come on.

198
00:13:58,969 --> 00:14:00,429
Sevi’s amazing, huh?

199
00:14:01,305 --> 00:14:02,556
You want to know why?

200
00:14:02,665 --> 00:14:04,266
It’s because he’s inspired…

201
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,319
Because of you.

202
00:14:08,395 --> 00:14:09,395
No!

203
00:14:09,772 --> 00:14:11,064
I think it’s just ‘cause

204
00:14:11,065 --> 00:14:13,776
he really wants
to win the championship.

205
00:14:15,736 --> 00:14:17,445
But you're a big reason why

206
00:14:17,446 --> 00:14:20,366
Sevi is so motivated
this season.

207
00:14:21,116 --> 00:14:23,451
Whenever we have

208
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:25,787
a get-together with
our group of friends,

209
00:14:25,788 --> 00:14:28,332
do you know what
he always talks about?

210
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,793
Elyse! Elyse! Elyse!

211
00:14:33,504 --> 00:14:35,088
- Really?
- Really!

212
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:37,173
I think he really likes you.

213
00:14:37,174 --> 00:14:39,051
And I’m happy that he’s happy.

214
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,381
I guess they really
are just friends.

215
00:14:44,406 --> 00:14:47,159
And I can see Luna
is a great friend to Sevi.

216
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,288
Hold on,
I'll just call that dummy.

217
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:52,930
Hey, Sevirous!

218
00:14:54,653 --> 00:14:55,653
Come!

219
00:14:56,942 --> 00:14:57,942
Come here!

220
00:14:59,069 --> 00:15:01,071
Elyse, what are you doing here?

221
00:15:01,488 --> 00:15:03,741
Hi, I brought you food.

222
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,910
Thanks.

223
00:15:07,953 --> 00:15:10,455
You’re so lucky, Sevi.

224
00:15:10,456 --> 00:15:12,457
Don’t ever let her go, okay?

225
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:13,625
Take care of her

226
00:15:13,626 --> 00:15:15,085
or you’ll be in trouble.

227
00:15:15,502 --> 00:15:17,128
Bye-bye.

228
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:18,964
- Do your best!
- Take care.

229
00:15:19,423 --> 00:15:20,423
Bye!

230
00:15:21,974 --> 00:15:25,762
I like Luna. I think
I kinda vibe with her.

231
00:15:28,906 --> 00:15:29,906
Sorry,

232
00:15:30,434 --> 00:15:32,686
I’m really sweaty.

233
00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:33,749
I'll just change.

234
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,009
Oh my god, those abs.

235
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:51,372
Okay,

236
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,872
you can look now.

237
00:15:52,873 --> 00:15:53,873
I’m dressed.

238
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,834
It’s not like this is the first
time you’ve seen me like this.

239
00:15:56,835 --> 00:15:58,920
Wow, he’s so handsome—
Is he even real?

240
00:15:58,921 --> 00:16:00,649
Let’s get a picture with him.

241
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,967
Hi Sevi, can we take
a picture with you?

242
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:08,097
Is it okay?

243
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,725
Hurry up, give it to her.

244
00:16:12,726 --> 00:16:14,395
Miss, can you take our picture?

245
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:29,579
Sorry, one more, please.

246
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:33,571
I think that’s enough.

247
00:16:34,843 --> 00:16:36,124
Sorry…

248
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:40,212
We have to go.

249
00:16:41,714 --> 00:16:44,834
- It’s okay.
- Thank you.

250
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,759
Thanks.

251
00:16:47,761 --> 00:16:49,214
But he’s so handsome!

252
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:50,239
Let's go?

253
00:16:56,478 --> 00:16:59,606
So, are you ready
for Game 2 tomorrow?

254
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:05,279
Our team is prepared.

255
00:17:06,488 --> 00:17:07,488
But...

256
00:17:07,865 --> 00:17:09,158
I’m still nervous.

257
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:12,494
Our opponents are really good,

258
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:16,623
so I’m already ready for a loss.

259
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,293
Stop, don’t say that.

260
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:21,712
Just believe in yourself.

261
00:17:22,087 --> 00:17:24,922
That’s why I let you court me.

262
00:17:24,923 --> 00:17:26,175
Because I trust you.

263
00:17:26,925 --> 00:17:28,405
That’s why you’re
the only one for me.

264
00:17:28,761 --> 00:17:30,428
Just one word from you

265
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:31,847
and I feel more confident.

266
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:34,850
You’re so corny and dramatic.

267
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:38,353
It’s fine, I’m your type anyway.

268
00:17:40,773 --> 00:17:42,149
Who told you?

269
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:45,486
That’s why you’re
letting me court you, right?

270
00:17:46,153 --> 00:17:47,321
You even said,

271
00:17:47,821 --> 00:17:49,698
I’m asking you to court me.

272
00:17:52,493 --> 00:17:53,493
By the way,

273
00:17:54,972 --> 00:17:55,973
I have something for you.

274
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,084
Wear this for Game 2, okay?

275
00:18:01,085 --> 00:18:02,419
Can you make it to the game?

276
00:18:03,921 --> 00:18:05,089
About that...

277
00:18:06,423 --> 00:18:08,216
I don’t think I can, Sev.

278
00:18:08,217 --> 00:18:09,343
I’m sorry.

279
00:18:11,553 --> 00:18:13,722
We have a quiz tomorrow.

280
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,726
That's too bad,

281
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:20,646
you missed Game 1

282
00:18:21,522 --> 00:18:23,273
and now you can't make it
to Game 2 either.

283
00:18:25,943 --> 00:18:27,528
I feel bad, too.

284
00:18:28,737 --> 00:18:29,738
But...

285
00:18:30,197 --> 00:18:31,197
it’s okay.

286
00:18:31,406 --> 00:18:32,574
Studies first.

287
00:18:43,502 --> 00:18:44,836
Shocks Ida,

288
00:18:44,837 --> 00:18:46,546
I feel really bad.

289
00:18:46,547 --> 00:18:49,549
I told Sevi that
I can’t watch his game.

290
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,260
He looked really sad.

291
00:18:51,718 --> 00:18:54,304
And you know
I can’t ruin the surprise.

292
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:56,055
Don’t worry about it.

293
00:18:56,056 --> 00:18:58,559
It will all be worth it
once he sees your banner.

294
00:19:00,936 --> 00:19:02,146
I guess.

295
00:19:04,898 --> 00:19:05,899
Well...

296
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,694
What do you think?

297
00:19:09,611 --> 00:19:10,653
Is this okay?

298
00:19:10,654 --> 00:19:12,990
Yes!
It’s witty.

299
00:19:14,158 --> 00:19:15,868
Short but powerful.

300
00:19:16,535 --> 00:19:17,536
Like

301
00:19:18,078 --> 00:19:20,497
a good boy, that bites.

302
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,416
Wow.

303
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:28,338
But…

304
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,280
it feels like
it’s missing something.

305
00:19:48,442 --> 00:19:49,443
Oh my god.

306
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,570
Ely,

307
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,364
don’t we need
to start cleaning up?

308
00:19:55,365 --> 00:19:57,951
Your dad might come in
and see the banner.

309
00:19:58,535 --> 00:20:01,205
No, it’s okay, Dad won’t
be home until next week.

310
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,876
No wonder you’ve
been seeing Sevi

311
00:20:06,877 --> 00:20:08,295
almost every day.

312
00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:10,464
While the cat's away,

313
00:20:10,964 --> 00:20:13,716
the mice will play.

314
00:20:13,717 --> 00:20:16,511
- Crazy!
- What? It’s true!

315
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:18,889
Yes, I guess you’re right.

316
00:20:19,765 --> 00:20:20,515
See.

317
00:20:20,766 --> 00:20:23,602
I can only enjoy my freedom
when Dad is not around.

318
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,813
Make the most of it, Ely.

319
00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:33,570
- Good evening po, sir.
- Good evening.

320
00:20:34,988 --> 00:20:35,697
Good evening, sir.

321
00:20:35,698 --> 00:20:37,551
Should I get your things
from the car?

322
00:20:37,576 --> 00:20:38,577
No need.

323
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:41,160
Where are Erin and Elyse?

324
00:20:41,161 --> 00:20:42,536
Ma’am Erin is in the study,

325
00:20:42,537 --> 00:20:45,374
and Ma’am Elyse is in
her room with Ma’am Ida.

326
00:20:45,874 --> 00:20:47,417
Okay, thank you.

327
00:20:49,795 --> 00:20:50,796
Elyse?

328
00:20:51,463 --> 00:20:52,463
Elyse?

329
00:20:55,968 --> 00:20:56,969
Your dad?

330
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:02,891
Elise.

331
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:04,558
Hurry! Hide it.

332
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,477
Where? How?

333
00:21:06,478 --> 00:21:08,146
- I don’t know, just hide it.
- Elyse?

334
00:21:15,338 --> 00:21:16,338
Just...

335
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,532
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

336
00:21:19,157 --> 00:21:19,741
Hello.

337
00:21:19,742 --> 00:21:21,493
I thought you were
coming home next week?

338
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:24,788
I had a meeting with
the Tuazons a while ago.

339
00:21:25,205 --> 00:21:27,082
So I decided to
stop by the house first,

340
00:21:27,374 --> 00:21:29,626
but I’m still going on my
flight to the U.S. tonight.

341
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,960
What are you guys doing?

342
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:34,216
We’re just...

343
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:37,592
working on a new project.

344
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:39,973
Hi, Uncle.

345
00:21:40,304 --> 00:21:41,304
Hi!

346
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,681
Wow, nice.

347
00:21:43,056 --> 00:21:44,266
Can I take a look at it?

348
00:21:44,878 --> 00:21:46,018
No, it’s okay.

349
00:21:46,727 --> 00:21:48,102
Maybe next time, Dad.

350
00:21:48,103 --> 00:21:49,562
Come on. Don’t be shy.

351
00:21:49,563 --> 00:21:50,604
I just want to see it.

352
00:21:50,605 --> 00:21:52,565
- No, next time, Dad.
- Come on.

353
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:53,191
Let me see it.

354
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:55,067
No, I’ll show it next time, Dad.

355
00:21:55,068 --> 00:21:57,028
I just want to check
what this project is about.

356
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:58,237
When we’re done maybe.

357
00:21:58,238 --> 00:22:00,031
- I just want to see it.
- We’re not done yet.

358
00:22:00,032 --> 00:22:00,949
Come on, I just
wanna take a look at it.

359
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,075
- No, it’s okay.
- Alfred?

360
00:22:04,077 --> 00:22:05,870
I thought I just
heard your voice,

361
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:06,788
but you’re here.

362
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:09,291
I just dropped by
the house first.

363
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,085
Good. Come,
I’ll prepare your food.

364
00:22:12,836 --> 00:22:14,316
Your Daddy and I
will eat first, okay?

365
00:22:14,671 --> 00:22:15,756
Okay, excuse us.

366
00:22:16,381 --> 00:22:19,134
- Come.
- Eat and rest first, Dad.

367
00:22:25,223 --> 00:22:26,350
That was so close.

368
00:22:26,767 --> 00:22:28,851
Yes, oh my god.

369
00:22:28,852 --> 00:22:30,812
Dad would’ve been so mad.

370
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,690
That got me nervous, Ely.

371
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:36,943
Make sure you
raise that banner, okay?

372
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:39,363
So that all our efforts
will be worth it.

373
00:22:39,946 --> 00:22:41,365
Oh my god.

374
00:22:41,865 --> 00:22:42,991
You’re so dramatic.

375
00:22:48,205 --> 00:22:50,248
Let’s go!

376
00:22:55,337 --> 00:22:58,382
- Defense!
- Defense!

377
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,409
Okay guys, listen...

378
00:23:25,951 --> 00:23:29,703
Our defense hasn’t been great.

379
00:23:29,704 --> 00:23:31,373
What’s up with Sevi?

380
00:23:32,207 --> 00:23:33,917
Maybe it’s just a bad quarter.

381
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,188
He’ll come around.

382
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,336
Or maybe it’s because

383
00:23:36,337 --> 00:23:38,713
his number one
supporter isn’t around.

384
00:23:44,636 --> 00:23:45,929
Oh, right there!

385
00:23:46,513 --> 00:23:47,556
She’s right there!

386
00:23:48,515 --> 00:23:49,515
She’s here!

387
00:23:51,643 --> 00:23:53,185
Yes!

388
00:23:53,186 --> 00:23:54,104
All right. Look.

389
00:23:54,105 --> 00:23:55,564
- Yes.
- He’ll bounce back.

390
00:23:58,862 --> 00:24:01,115
If we need to double team,

391
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,077
then we double team.

392
00:24:08,336 --> 00:24:10,846
Let’s go, Captain!

393
00:24:10,871 --> 00:24:13,290
Let’s go, Captain!

394
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:16,064
Go, Cameroar!

395
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,544
Let’s go, Captain!

396
00:24:18,545 --> 00:24:19,879
One more time!

397
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,506
Louder!

398
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,643
Let’s go, Captain!

399
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:32,893
Let’s go, Captain!
Go, Cameroar!

400
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:41,092
Let’s go!

401
00:24:48,047 --> 00:24:49,047
What a scam!

402
00:24:49,117 --> 00:24:51,661
You said you weren’t coming
‘cause you had a class.

403
00:24:52,287 --> 00:24:55,538
And now you’re here
with this poster.

404
00:24:56,374 --> 00:24:58,167
Sorry, I came a bit late.

405
00:24:58,168 --> 00:25:00,419
But your lucky charm is here.

406
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,504
Don’t you want it?

407
00:25:01,505 --> 00:25:02,964
Of course, I do.

408
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,175
Okay, good.

409
00:25:05,842 --> 00:25:06,926
By the way,

410
00:25:06,927 --> 00:25:08,886
Mom said you better play well.

411
00:25:08,887 --> 00:25:11,598
Or else she’ll
report you to Daddy.

412
00:25:11,892 --> 00:25:13,560
She’s watching the livestream.

413
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:16,352
No way?

414
00:25:16,353 --> 00:25:17,437
Seriously?

415
00:25:17,646 --> 00:25:18,646
Yes,

416
00:25:18,688 --> 00:25:20,323
so you better play well, okay?

417
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:23,109
Because of that,
I'll do my best.

418
00:25:27,364 --> 00:25:28,531
You got this, Sev.

419
00:25:28,532 --> 00:25:29,991
I know you’ll win this game.

420
00:25:30,992 --> 00:25:32,577
I’ll win this for you.

421
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,654
Oh my gosh!

422
00:26:07,946 --> 00:26:09,655
Did you just kiss him?

423
00:26:09,656 --> 00:26:11,950
In front of everyone?

424
00:26:12,576 --> 00:26:13,702
Wait,

425
00:26:14,035 --> 00:26:15,870
I never expected that.

426
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:18,497
Auntie! Auntie!

427
00:26:18,498 --> 00:26:19,040
Hey!

428
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:21,251
Your daughter is a flirt now.

429
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,854
I was just caught in the moment.

430
00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:27,006
You’ve probably been planning it

431
00:26:27,007 --> 00:26:28,842
since last night.
Am I right?

432
00:26:29,342 --> 00:26:30,342
I figured.

433
00:26:30,444 --> 00:26:32,136
- Shut up!
- Why?

434
00:26:32,137 --> 00:26:34,180
Shut up.
Let’s just cheer for them.

435
00:26:34,431 --> 00:26:36,641
Okay, if you say so.

436
00:26:38,852 --> 00:26:40,603
Go, Sevi!

437
00:26:40,604 --> 00:26:42,480
She said we should cheer!

438
00:26:43,315 --> 00:26:50,405
- Defense!
- Defense!

439
00:26:51,615 --> 00:26:54,618
- Defense!
- Defense!

440
00:26:57,245 --> 00:26:58,245
Yes!

441
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:05,337
- Defense!
- Defense!

442
00:27:08,673 --> 00:27:13,261
- Defense!
- Defense!

443
00:27:32,822 --> 00:27:34,783
Yes!

444
00:27:40,288 --> 00:27:41,831
Go, Sevi!

445
00:27:51,549 --> 00:27:58,473
- Defense!
- Defense!

446
00:29:27,662 --> 00:29:28,747
Congratulations!

447
00:29:28,772 --> 00:29:31,148
See, I told you.
I’m so proud of you.

448
00:29:31,149 --> 00:29:32,984
My lucky charm came, that’s why.

449
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,612
Guys, let’s take a picture.

450
00:29:36,613 --> 00:29:38,739
Ida, wait. My Dad…

451
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,991
Come on.

452
00:29:40,094 --> 00:29:42,368
Let’s just do it
as a remembrance.

453
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:46,080
One more.

454
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,790
Kiss!

455
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:51,022
- Ida!
- I’m kidding.

456
00:29:52,295 --> 00:29:54,922
But you guys
really did so great.

457
00:29:54,923 --> 00:29:56,799
I can’t believe
you guys caught up.

458
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,218
Do you know why?

459
00:29:58,593 --> 00:29:59,593
Why?

460
00:29:59,886 --> 00:30:02,931
I was scared of your mom.
I couldn’t afford to mess up.

461
00:30:03,348 --> 00:30:04,765
You know, I should ask her

462
00:30:04,766 --> 00:30:06,433
to watch the next game live.

463
00:30:06,434 --> 00:30:07,644
Hey, don’t do that.

464
00:30:08,269 --> 00:30:10,062
Hey, Sevi! Congratulations!

465
00:30:10,063 --> 00:30:11,814
Congratulations, Sevi!

466
00:30:11,815 --> 00:30:14,359
- Hello!
- Hi, Elyse!

467
00:30:19,072 --> 00:30:21,241
- Okay, we’ll go ahead.
- Enjoy.

468
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:23,784
- Bye!
- Take care.

469
00:30:23,785 --> 00:30:24,868
- Hello!
- Hi!

470
00:30:24,869 --> 00:30:25,787
Let’s go.

471
00:30:25,788 --> 00:30:28,946
She smells like Shan.

472
00:30:29,123 --> 00:30:30,123
Take care.

473
00:30:32,502 --> 00:30:34,503
My mom told me earlier

474
00:30:34,504 --> 00:30:36,756
that she prepared
dinner for you.

475
00:30:37,841 --> 00:30:38,841
Really?

476
00:30:39,884 --> 00:30:41,301
She shouldn’t have.

477
00:30:41,302 --> 00:30:43,118
Of course.
Actually,

478
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:45,348
I think you’re more
like her child now.

479
00:30:47,725 --> 00:30:48,852
Will your dad be there?

480
00:30:49,638 --> 00:30:51,144
No, he was here yesterday

481
00:30:51,145 --> 00:30:53,356
but now he’s
on the way to the U.S.

482
00:30:53,731 --> 00:30:56,359
So, he won’t be back
until next week.

483
00:30:57,402 --> 00:30:58,402
Okay.

484
00:30:59,028 --> 00:31:00,530
Come by the house later, okay?

485
00:31:00,989 --> 00:31:02,239
Besides the celebration,

486
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,368
I have something
important to tell you.

487
00:31:06,494 --> 00:31:07,494
About what?

488
00:31:08,413 --> 00:31:09,664
I’ll tell you later.

489
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:13,292
Okay.

490
00:31:14,294 --> 00:31:15,295
I’ll go ahead.

491
00:31:16,087 --> 00:31:17,297
See you later, okay?

492
00:31:17,755 --> 00:31:19,548
- Take care.
- Bye.

493
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:20,549
Let’s go.

494
00:31:37,775 --> 00:31:40,235
Ma’am, thank you for the food.

495
00:31:40,236 --> 00:31:41,486
Everything was delicious.

496
00:31:41,487 --> 00:31:44,324
And this is the first time
I’ve tried something like that.

497
00:31:44,574 --> 00:31:46,659
The carcotery.

498
00:31:47,952 --> 00:31:49,370
It's charcuterie.

499
00:31:50,455 --> 00:31:51,623
That one, ma’am.

500
00:31:52,582 --> 00:31:54,626
Sevi, you can call me Auntie.

501
00:31:55,043 --> 00:31:56,501
And anytime you wanna come over,

502
00:31:56,502 --> 00:31:58,546
just let me know.
I’ll cook for you.

503
00:31:59,088 --> 00:32:00,715
Or better yet,

504
00:32:01,257 --> 00:32:03,593
let’s have Elyse cook for us.

505
00:32:05,803 --> 00:32:06,803
Me?

506
00:32:07,513 --> 00:32:10,642
Elyse, it’s about time
you learn how to cook.

507
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:13,102
But Mom, you know

508
00:32:13,103 --> 00:32:14,938
I don’t have
the talent for cooking.

509
00:32:15,521 --> 00:32:16,574
It’s a skill.

510
00:32:16,814 --> 00:32:18,240
You can learn it.

511
00:32:18,566 --> 00:32:20,109
Yes, you can do it.

512
00:32:22,362 --> 00:32:23,987
Hold on, I have to
take this call

513
00:32:23,988 --> 00:32:25,323
because it’s Mr. Enriquez.

514
00:32:25,615 --> 00:32:26,741
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

515
00:32:33,164 --> 00:32:34,164
Why?

516
00:32:35,124 --> 00:32:37,460
I get really nervous whenever
I speak with your mom.

517
00:32:38,753 --> 00:32:39,754
You know what,

518
00:32:40,338 --> 00:32:41,844
I can tell that she likes you.

519
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,216
I know her.

520
00:32:44,926 --> 00:32:46,051
I hope so.

521
00:32:46,052 --> 00:32:47,052
Trust me.

522
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,097
I can feel it.

523
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,439
Wait, what are you doing?

524
00:32:59,691 --> 00:33:01,400
This is my second free dinner,

525
00:33:01,401 --> 00:33:03,485
so I’ll just clean up
after our meal.

526
00:33:03,486 --> 00:33:05,112
No, it’s okay.

527
00:33:05,113 --> 00:33:06,447
Just leave it there.

528
00:33:06,823 --> 00:33:08,824
You’re our guest and plus,

529
00:33:08,825 --> 00:33:10,576
the celebration is for you.

530
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:11,953
So, just leave it.

531
00:33:13,705 --> 00:33:14,705
Are you sure?

532
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,461
And…

533
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,132
I have something to show you.

534
00:33:27,593 --> 00:33:29,302
What are you going to show me?

535
00:33:29,303 --> 00:33:30,596
Are you proposing?

536
00:33:33,307 --> 00:33:34,308
Silly!

537
00:33:35,143 --> 00:33:36,144
I’m joking.

538
00:33:36,436 --> 00:33:37,854
I’m just nervous.

539
00:33:38,396 --> 00:33:39,897
Is it good or bad news?

540
00:33:41,315 --> 00:33:43,735
You know, you’re really cute
when you’re nervous.

541
00:33:44,694 --> 00:33:46,487
Only when I’m nervous?

542
00:33:48,281 --> 00:33:49,323
All the time.

543
00:33:50,199 --> 00:33:51,950
You’re just changing the topic.

544
00:33:51,951 --> 00:33:53,578
What are you going to show me?

545
00:33:58,082 --> 00:33:59,082
Okay…

546
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,600
The poster?

547
00:34:16,601 --> 00:34:18,186
I already saw that earlier.

548
00:34:18,686 --> 00:34:20,021
Are you sure?

549
00:34:21,007 --> 00:34:22,007
Huh?

550
00:34:23,441 --> 00:34:24,442
Well,

551
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:26,749
have you seen…

552
00:34:28,946 --> 00:34:29,947
this?

553
00:34:42,835 --> 00:34:44,921
I like you, Sevi.

554
00:34:48,716 --> 00:34:51,410
What’s with that reaction?

555
00:34:56,015 --> 00:34:57,350
It’s a confession.

556
00:35:01,687 --> 00:35:03,147
So, are we a couple now?

557
00:35:07,193 --> 00:35:08,361
I don’t know…

558
00:35:10,446 --> 00:35:11,781
Well, we don’t have to be yet.

559
00:35:12,198 --> 00:35:13,908
I’ll continue to court you.

560
00:35:14,325 --> 00:35:16,284
We don’t need to rush.

561
00:35:16,285 --> 00:35:18,285
I know you’re not allowed
to have a boyfriend yet.

562
00:35:18,412 --> 00:35:20,163
No, I want to be with you.

563
00:35:20,164 --> 00:35:21,999
I want to be in a
relationship with you.

564
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,126
I feel the same way.

565
00:35:23,127 --> 00:35:24,334
But...

566
00:35:24,335 --> 00:35:26,796
I can wait until you graduate.

567
00:35:27,421 --> 00:35:28,421
But...

568
00:35:28,589 --> 00:35:29,841
Why wait?

569
00:35:30,174 --> 00:35:32,593
When we can be
in a relationship now.

570
00:35:32,927 --> 00:35:35,638
I mean, we like
each other, right?

571
00:35:38,349 --> 00:35:39,975
You’re not allowed
to have a boyfriend yet.

572
00:35:39,976 --> 00:35:41,602
Your dad will be mad.

573
00:35:44,105 --> 00:35:45,356
He won’t know.

574
00:35:56,951 --> 00:35:57,952
Look...

575
00:36:00,538 --> 00:36:03,124
I’m going to graduate
in two years.

576
00:36:03,875 --> 00:36:05,710
That’ll pass by quickly.

577
00:36:06,377 --> 00:36:07,879
In the meantime,

578
00:36:08,754 --> 00:36:10,298
we can keep it a secret,

579
00:36:11,716 --> 00:36:14,093
if that’s okay with you?

580
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,930
Maybe you just
enjoy being with me,

581
00:36:18,931 --> 00:36:21,184
or maybe you’re just
overwhelmed with emotions?

582
00:36:22,643 --> 00:36:24,187
No, Sevi.

583
00:36:24,979 --> 00:36:26,606
It’s more than that.

584
00:36:29,817 --> 00:36:33,153
Do you want me to tell you
all of the things,

585
00:36:33,154 --> 00:36:34,322
one by one?

586
00:36:35,323 --> 00:36:36,824
All of the things that

587
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,451
I like about you?

588
00:36:38,993 --> 00:36:40,119
Sure.

589
00:36:40,995 --> 00:36:42,496
Just kidding.

590
00:36:43,164 --> 00:36:45,332
We might take forever

591
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:47,167
if you have to list down

592
00:36:47,168 --> 00:36:49,045
all of my likeable qualities.

593
00:36:50,087 --> 00:36:52,465
- Wow.
- So, I’ll just believe in you.

594
00:36:55,218 --> 00:36:56,928
You’re really
so full of yourself.

595
00:37:04,852 --> 00:37:06,603
Why are you
quiet all of a sudden?

596
00:37:06,604 --> 00:37:07,855
What’s on your mind?

597
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,031
I’ve...

598
00:37:17,573 --> 00:37:19,575
I’ve never been this happy.

599
00:37:26,457 --> 00:37:27,750
Me too, Ely.

600
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,128
I like you.

601
00:37:50,898 --> 00:37:51,899
Ely?

602
00:37:54,568 --> 00:37:55,777
Ely, it’s getting late.

603
00:37:55,778 --> 00:37:57,905
Sevi needs to go home.

604
00:37:59,073 --> 00:38:02,001
Thank you, Auntie,
for the delicious food.

605
00:38:02,201 --> 00:38:04,331
You’re always welcome, Sevi.

606
00:38:04,495 --> 00:38:05,495
And I’m looking forward

607
00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:08,582
to many more dinners
with you and Ely.

608
00:38:10,584 --> 00:38:12,122
All right, I’ll head out now.

609
00:38:13,575 --> 00:38:14,576
Bye, Ely.

610
00:38:15,214 --> 00:38:16,215
Take care.

611
00:38:16,757 --> 00:38:18,759
Message me when you get home.

612
00:38:21,012 --> 00:38:22,013
Karen,

613
00:38:22,305 --> 00:38:24,724
- please escort Sevi outside.
- Okay.

614
00:38:25,516 --> 00:38:28,102
Come on, sir, Roel is
already waiting outside.

615
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,570
So…

616
00:38:38,821 --> 00:38:40,948
Let’s have a chat, my dear.

617
00:38:43,451 --> 00:38:44,452
What?

618
00:38:46,287 --> 00:38:47,413
Do you like him?

619
00:38:48,706 --> 00:38:51,167
Mommy, why are you
asking me that question?

620
00:38:52,084 --> 00:38:54,128
Because I want you to be happy.

621
00:38:54,628 --> 00:38:56,130
And if you like him,

622
00:38:56,839 --> 00:38:58,174
I’ll support you.

623
00:38:59,675 --> 00:39:01,594
But… But Dad...

624
00:39:02,887 --> 00:39:04,138
Forget about Dad.

625
00:39:04,513 --> 00:39:06,891
Love, all dads are strict.

626
00:39:07,224 --> 00:39:08,975
As long as you know
your limitations,

627
00:39:08,976 --> 00:39:10,353
I’m fine with it.

628
00:39:11,854 --> 00:39:13,022
Thank you, Mommy.

629
00:39:13,814 --> 00:39:15,524
But, what about you?

630
00:39:15,983 --> 00:39:17,902
What do you think about him?

631
00:39:19,445 --> 00:39:20,528
Well,

632
00:39:20,529 --> 00:39:22,156
I think he’s good for you.

633
00:39:23,032 --> 00:39:25,284
He’s kind. He’s smart.

634
00:39:27,036 --> 00:39:29,622
And, I think he has
his goals straight.

635
00:39:30,748 --> 00:39:32,290
Your dad actually
mentioned it to me,

636
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:34,543
that’s why I think
he’s a great guy.

637
00:39:36,128 --> 00:39:37,421
He really is.

638
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,801
Mommy,

639
00:39:42,218 --> 00:39:43,928
you’re taking your meds, right?

640
00:39:44,345 --> 00:39:46,931
I’m okay. I’m okay.
Don’t worry about me.

641
00:39:49,475 --> 00:39:52,686
You know, you should really
lessen your workload.

642
00:39:53,312 --> 00:39:56,440
Stress really is not
good for you, Mommy.

643
00:39:57,316 --> 00:39:58,650
I can’t wait to graduate

644
00:39:58,651 --> 00:40:01,445
so that I can help you
run our family company.

645
00:40:02,863 --> 00:40:04,323
Don’t worry about me.

646
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,451
You have to focus
on your studies.

647
00:40:08,786 --> 00:40:11,789
I was just out of breath going
up and down the stairs earlier.

648
00:40:12,498 --> 00:40:13,666
But don’t worry.

649
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:15,751
I can handle this.

650
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:21,424
But you know,

651
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,301
I’m actually more
worried about Sevi.

652
00:40:25,302 --> 00:40:26,302
Huh?

653
00:40:26,637 --> 00:40:29,056
I’m worried about him
because of you.

654
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,433
Wow. Mom,

655
00:40:31,434 --> 00:40:34,228
just a reminder, I’m your child.

656
00:40:34,812 --> 00:40:37,063
I’m just joking, you know.

657
00:40:37,064 --> 00:40:40,985
You know, you’re lucky
with each other.

658
00:40:42,611 --> 00:40:43,612
But maybe

659
00:40:44,113 --> 00:40:45,448
you’re a little luckier.

660
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:48,576
Mommy!

661
00:40:57,501 --> 00:40:58,501
You know,

662
00:40:58,502 --> 00:41:01,254
I feel really lucky
to have you as my mom

663
00:41:01,255 --> 00:41:02,590
and best friend.

664
00:41:03,924 --> 00:41:05,259
Best friend?

665
00:41:06,574 --> 00:41:10,306
But you know what,
best friends share secrets.

666
00:41:10,806 --> 00:41:11,599
And until now,

667
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,684
you still haven’t
answered my question.

668
00:41:14,268 --> 00:41:16,645
Do you like him?

669
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:24,737
Yes, Mommy, I do like him.

670
00:41:25,529 --> 00:41:26,529
Good.

671
00:41:27,573 --> 00:41:32,036
My little baby is growing up
right in front of my eyes.

672
00:41:32,828 --> 00:41:35,164
But, don’t tell Daddy.

673
00:41:36,624 --> 00:41:38,459
Best friends keep secrets.

674
00:41:39,543 --> 00:41:40,419
I won’t.

675
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,921
I’m just joking, I won’t.

676
00:41:42,922 --> 00:41:44,882
- Okay.
- I won’t.

677
00:41:55,153 --> 00:41:56,529
@sevirous:
Good night.

678
00:42:11,617 --> 00:42:14,870
@elydezma: Good night
Sleep well, babe.

679
00:42:25,266 --> 00:42:26,490
@sevirous:
Babe?

680
00:42:31,595 --> 00:42:33,055
@elydezma:
Yes, babe.

681
00:42:42,578 --> 00:42:44,152
@sevirous:
Let’s meet.

682
00:43:00,541 --> 00:43:01,541
Elyse!

683
00:43:02,918 --> 00:43:03,918
Hi!

684
00:43:04,295 --> 00:43:05,295
What’s that?

685
00:43:05,296 --> 00:43:07,922
To boost your mood
and relieve your stress.

686
00:43:07,923 --> 00:43:09,300
I know this is your favorite.

687
00:43:10,134 --> 00:43:11,635
You remembered.

688
00:43:11,927 --> 00:43:12,928
Thank you.

689
00:43:13,047 --> 00:43:14,048
Let me carry that.

690
00:43:15,442 --> 00:43:17,265
- Thank you!
- Let’s go?

691
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:19,462
Okay.

692
00:43:31,614 --> 00:43:33,115
Horns, Santos!

693
00:43:39,997 --> 00:43:40,873
Nice!

694
00:43:40,874 --> 00:43:41,874
Water break.

695
00:43:45,836 --> 00:43:46,961
Good job.

696
00:43:46,962 --> 00:43:47,962
Are you okay?

697
00:43:48,172 --> 00:43:49,548
Yes. Are you?

698
00:43:49,882 --> 00:43:50,966
Do you want water?

699
00:43:52,468 --> 00:43:53,469
I’m okay.

700
00:43:53,927 --> 00:43:55,554
I wanted to hug you but...

701
00:43:55,971 --> 00:43:57,389
I stink of sweat.

702
00:44:01,727 --> 00:44:03,562
It’s fine. I don’t care.

703
00:44:04,855 --> 00:44:06,190
I’m so lucky.

704
00:44:37,137 --> 00:44:38,388
Wow!

705
00:44:38,389 --> 00:44:40,641
You’re definitely
not a kid anymore.

706
00:44:40,974 --> 00:44:41,974
Next time, you’ll be ready

707
00:44:41,975 --> 00:44:43,227
to cross the road on your own.

708
00:44:44,353 --> 00:44:45,521
Thanks to you.

709
00:44:46,146 --> 00:44:47,647
But of course,

710
00:44:47,648 --> 00:44:49,899
it’s still better
to cross with a partner

711
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,443
while holding hands.

712
00:44:52,152 --> 00:44:53,153
Wow,

713
00:44:53,946 --> 00:44:55,614
that’s so cheesy.

714
00:44:55,833 --> 00:44:56,834
Let’s go?

715
00:45:02,037 --> 00:45:04,790
If you want more,
you can still order.

716
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:07,251
Let’s see.

717
00:45:07,751 --> 00:45:08,751
That’s really good.

718
00:45:10,129 --> 00:45:12,339
Master!

719
00:45:12,798 --> 00:45:14,132
I didn’t know you were here.

720
00:45:14,133 --> 00:45:15,801
Let’s play a game.

721
00:45:16,135 --> 00:45:17,510
Can’t, bro.

722
00:45:17,511 --> 00:45:19,012
I’ll pass.
It's babe time for me.

723
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:20,430
Babe?

724
00:45:20,723 --> 00:45:21,932
Your girlfriend, Master?

725
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,100
Yes, this is Elyse.

726
00:45:24,101 --> 00:45:24,924
My girlfriend.

727
00:45:24,949 --> 00:45:26,564
That’s right.
I’m his girlfriend.

728
00:45:26,589 --> 00:45:28,424
Fuck you.

729
00:45:29,231 --> 00:45:31,608
You got yourself a girl now.

730
00:45:32,735 --> 00:45:35,154
Jeez, Master, how were
you able to trick her.

731
00:45:35,696 --> 00:45:36,739
He’s right.

732
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:39,115
What love potion did you use?

733
00:45:39,116 --> 00:45:40,284
It’s seems effective.

734
00:45:40,993 --> 00:45:41,994
Miss,

735
00:45:42,661 --> 00:45:43,995
if you’re in danger,

736
00:45:43,996 --> 00:45:44,996
blink twice.

737
00:45:46,248 --> 00:45:47,248
Hey!

738
00:45:47,499 --> 00:45:50,961
Chill, don’t be
too impressed. Relax.

739
00:45:51,712 --> 00:45:53,004
Okay, Master.

740
00:45:53,005 --> 00:45:54,505
If she’s really your girlfriend,

741
00:45:54,506 --> 00:45:56,382
show her off and shout it out.

742
00:45:56,383 --> 00:45:57,633
- Yes.
- Do it.

743
00:45:57,634 --> 00:45:59,093
If you’re so confident, do it.

744
00:45:59,094 --> 00:46:00,387
- Well?
- Do it.

745
00:46:00,763 --> 00:46:02,639
- Is that all?
- Yes, fucker.

746
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,808
She’s my girlfriend!

747
00:46:05,809 --> 00:46:06,268
Sevi!

748
00:46:06,269 --> 00:46:08,978
Everyone, this girl
is my girlfriend.

749
00:46:08,979 --> 00:46:10,980
Sir, she’s my girlfriend.

750
00:46:10,981 --> 00:46:11,982
Sevi!

751
00:46:12,566 --> 00:46:13,691
Sit down.

752
00:46:13,692 --> 00:46:15,401
Well, you morons?

753
00:46:15,402 --> 00:46:16,820
Isn’t she my girlfriend?

754
00:46:18,515 --> 00:46:19,531
Yes, Master.

755
00:46:19,532 --> 00:46:20,615
She really is your girlfriend.

756
00:46:20,749 --> 00:46:22,125
We’re sorry, Master.

757
00:46:22,701 --> 00:46:24,328
We’ll go ahead now

758
00:46:24,787 --> 00:46:26,580
so you can enjoy your babe time.

759
00:46:27,581 --> 00:46:28,956
Okay, you guys take care.

760
00:46:28,957 --> 00:46:30,667
Don’t forget to do
Sir Ferdie’s homework.

761
00:46:32,294 --> 00:46:33,796
Yes, Master.

762
00:46:39,885 --> 00:46:41,427
Your blockmates?

763
00:46:41,428 --> 00:46:44,263
Yes, Mark and Theo.

764
00:46:44,264 --> 00:46:45,556
They were the ones

765
00:46:45,557 --> 00:46:47,226
who bothered us
at the eatery before.

766
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,729
I remember.

767
00:47:00,364 --> 00:47:01,698
How messy.

768
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:03,826
But it’s okay.

769
00:47:04,368 --> 00:47:05,577
You’re still cute.

770
00:47:19,341 --> 00:47:20,551
All right, everyone,

771
00:47:22,094 --> 00:47:24,304
tomorrow is our
last game of the season.

772
00:47:26,557 --> 00:47:29,184
Many of us are graduating,

773
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,602
and I’m one of them.

774
00:47:33,647 --> 00:47:35,107
I know...

775
00:47:35,941 --> 00:47:38,025
it hasn’t been easy and
we’ve gone through a lot

776
00:47:38,026 --> 00:47:40,153
to make it to the finals.

777
00:47:41,071 --> 00:47:42,489
But even just
making it this far,

778
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:45,158
I’m already so proud of you all.

779
00:47:47,661 --> 00:47:49,454
And to the coaches…

780
00:47:50,122 --> 00:47:53,625
Coach, thank you so much
for guiding us.

781
00:47:55,502 --> 00:47:56,503
And...

782
00:47:57,754 --> 00:48:01,341
no matter what happens
in tomorrow's game,

783
00:48:02,718 --> 00:48:05,220
it's an honor to be
your team captain.

784
00:48:40,464 --> 00:48:43,508
Go, Sevi!

785
00:48:46,345 --> 00:48:48,221
Panthers for the win!

786
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,140
This is it, Ida!
It’s now or never.

787
00:48:51,141 --> 00:48:53,310
Here, hold on to this.
That’s your banner.

788
00:48:53,644 --> 00:48:54,644
Banner?

789
00:48:57,773 --> 00:49:00,274
Wow! That’s a lot of effort!

790
00:49:00,275 --> 00:49:01,234
I know.

791
00:49:01,235 --> 00:49:02,277
This is mine.

792
00:49:03,236 --> 00:49:06,531
What, babe? Such a flirt.

793
00:49:07,074 --> 00:49:08,074
What did I miss?

794
00:49:08,075 --> 00:49:09,493
Do you guys have pet names now?

795
00:49:09,952 --> 00:49:12,453
That’s a conversation
for another time.

796
00:49:12,454 --> 00:49:14,039
Just cheer for them for now

797
00:49:14,414 --> 00:49:15,790
since it’s their last game.

798
00:49:15,791 --> 00:49:17,834
Go, Sevi!

799
00:49:19,461 --> 00:49:21,087
Wow, you were so shy before,

800
00:49:21,088 --> 00:49:23,923
and now you’re the loudest.

801
00:49:23,924 --> 00:49:25,299
I’m impressed.

802
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,509
I don’t even care anymore.

803
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:28,928
Basta I’m going to cheer
for my boyfriend.

804
00:49:28,929 --> 00:49:30,138
Boyfriend?

805
00:49:33,016 --> 00:49:34,017
Such a show-off.

806
00:49:34,393 --> 00:49:36,018
Go, Sevi Camero!

807
00:49:36,019 --> 00:49:37,854
Let’s go!

808
00:49:41,942 --> 00:49:43,193
Panthers!

809
00:49:52,244 --> 00:49:54,371
Miss, is Camero your boyfriend?

810
00:49:54,913 --> 00:49:56,455
Yes, why?

811
00:49:56,456 --> 00:49:58,417
Wow, you’re so lucky.

812
00:49:58,667 --> 00:50:00,836
- She’s so lucky.
- You’re so lucky!

813
00:50:03,688 --> 00:50:05,649
I really am lucky.

814
00:50:08,093 --> 00:50:10,136
- It’s starting!
- It’s starting!

815
00:50:10,137 --> 00:50:11,513
Go, Panthers!

816
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:15,559
You can do this!

817
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:24,810
- Defense!
- Defense!

818
00:50:34,745 --> 00:50:36,329
Go, Sevi!

819
00:51:03,857 --> 00:51:04,649
Run!

820
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:05,650
Defense!

821
00:51:12,824 --> 00:51:15,619
- Defense!
- Defense!

822
00:51:26,838 --> 00:51:28,048
Let’s go!

823
00:51:29,716 --> 00:51:31,301
Go, Sevi!

824
00:51:39,808 --> 00:51:42,985
I don’t want to see this.
I’m going to cry.

825
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:44,093
The lead is so big.

826
00:51:45,941 --> 00:51:47,233
You guys can do this!

827
00:51:47,234 --> 00:51:49,861
Let’s go, Panthers!

828
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:55,075
Let’s go!

829
00:52:14,594 --> 00:52:16,555
Yes!

830
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:28,650
- Defense!
- Defense!

831
00:52:45,718 --> 00:52:46,884
Oh my gosh, Sevi!

832
00:52:46,909 --> 00:52:48,309
- Oh my god, it’s Sevi—
- Hey! Sevi!

833
00:52:50,678 --> 00:52:54,805
Stand up, please.
Sevi, I hope you’re okay.

834
00:53:22,037 --> 00:53:23,121
Let’s go!

835
00:53:23,455 --> 00:53:24,831
Let’s go, Sevi!

836
00:56:00,327 --> 00:56:02,121
I’m still so proud of you, okay?

837
00:56:42,015 --> 00:56:43,640
Sevi…

838
00:56:52,407 --> 00:56:54,734
Come on, congratulations.

839
00:56:54,735 --> 00:56:55,901
You did great.

840
00:56:55,902 --> 00:56:59,238
We’re always proud of you, okay?

841
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:03,327
We know you gave it
your all for our school.

842
00:57:04,912 --> 00:57:07,457
It’s a bummer. We still lost.

843
00:57:08,206 --> 00:57:09,666
We may have lost the game,

844
00:57:10,042 --> 00:57:11,751
but you still won in...

845
00:57:11,752 --> 00:57:13,503
your love life.

846
00:57:14,671 --> 00:57:16,505
She’s so pretty.

847
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:18,799
And charming, too.

848
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,550
Sevi’s heart is going...

849
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:24,973
He’s actually
the number one winner.

850
00:57:26,308 --> 00:57:28,118
He’s feeling giddy now.

851
00:57:28,143 --> 00:57:30,729
Cheer up now.

852
00:57:34,399 --> 00:57:35,400
Where is she?

853
00:57:35,984 --> 00:57:37,736
But seriously…

854
00:57:38,111 --> 00:57:40,780
Thanks for all your support.

855
00:57:40,781 --> 00:57:42,658
Even though we didn’t win,

856
00:57:43,283 --> 00:57:44,743
I really appreciate you guys.

857
00:57:45,366 --> 00:57:48,537
Now there’s that smile.
I love that smile.

858
00:57:49,244 --> 00:57:51,799
I wonder what Luna said to Sevi.

859
00:57:54,378 --> 00:57:55,379
Camero…

860
00:57:57,881 --> 00:57:59,383
Cheer up!

861
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,301
You already won.

862
00:58:32,376 --> 00:58:33,333
I missed you.

863
00:58:33,334 --> 00:58:34,334
I missed you, too.

864
00:58:34,335 --> 00:58:36,752
I can stay before dinner today.

865
00:58:36,753 --> 00:58:38,087
Won’t your dad look for you?

866
00:58:38,088 --> 00:58:39,672
You think Sofia will like it?

867
00:58:39,673 --> 00:58:40,424
Of course.

868
00:58:40,632 --> 00:58:41,841
What do you think about this?

869
00:58:41,842 --> 00:58:44,301
I don’t think
that’s going to fit her.

870
00:58:44,302 --> 00:58:46,345
This is for my friend’s baby.

871
00:58:46,346 --> 00:58:48,681
Our first monthsary
is coming up.

872
00:58:48,682 --> 00:58:50,975
Is it okay if we
celebrate at my place?

873
00:58:50,976 --> 00:58:52,768
Where’s your papa, by the way?

874
00:58:52,769 --> 00:58:54,019
If we have a problem,

875
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:55,468
Let’s sort it out
right away, okay?

876
00:58:55,493 --> 00:58:58,204
No walking out
without saying anything.
