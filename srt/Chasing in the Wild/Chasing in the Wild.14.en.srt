1
00:00:10,281 --> 00:00:13,324
The groundbreaking ceremony
for Project Aruga in Batangas

2
00:00:13,325 --> 00:00:14,452
will be next weekend.

3
00:00:15,911 --> 00:00:18,288
You know what?
You and Austin here

4
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:19,956
should hang out more, Elyse.

5
00:00:19,957 --> 00:00:22,500
Austin has been
a really great friend

6
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:23,669
throughout the years.

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,422
I heard you’re working together.

8
00:00:26,672 --> 00:00:28,591
So that means you
see each other a lot.

9
00:00:29,091 --> 00:00:31,302
No wonder you’re
always at the gym.

10
00:00:31,844 --> 00:00:33,929
Why is he staring at me?

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,141
Am I that pretty?

12
00:00:38,142 --> 00:00:39,768
Your shovel is facing backward.

13
00:00:39,769 --> 00:00:41,937
Where the fuck am I?

14
00:00:43,272 --> 00:00:44,522
Sevi!

15
00:00:44,523 --> 00:00:47,401
I got lost and then—
I’m so bad with, with...

16
00:00:47,818 --> 00:00:48,818
Directions.

17
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:51,446
Just follow me so
you can get home.

18
00:00:51,447 --> 00:00:53,991
Fine.
I’ll go after you.

19
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:54,950
Sam!

20
00:00:54,951 --> 00:00:55,951
- Ely, hi!
- Hi!

21
00:00:55,952 --> 00:00:57,952
Girls, I ordered
you drinks, okay?

22
00:00:57,953 --> 00:00:59,829
- Enjoy the night, girls.
- Thank you, Sam.

23
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,331
Thank you, Miss Samantha.

24
00:01:01,332 --> 00:01:04,042
Thank you so much for
inviting me here, ma’am.

25
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:06,836
You can call me Elyse.

26
00:01:06,837 --> 00:01:08,547
We’re outside of work anyway.

27
00:01:09,256 --> 00:01:10,257
Cheers!

28
00:01:16,806 --> 00:01:20,309
Roel is already waiting outside.
Let’s go?

29
00:01:22,728 --> 00:01:23,728
What the fuck?

30
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:41,681
What the fuck?

31
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:44,017
- What are you doing here?
- Oh my god!

32
00:02:44,018 --> 00:02:45,768
Fuck! You creep!

33
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:48,689
Mommy!
Pervert!

34
00:02:54,653 --> 00:02:56,780
What the hell
are you doing here?

35
00:02:57,448 --> 00:02:59,115
I should be the one
asking you that.

36
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:00,116
What are you doing here?

37
00:03:00,117 --> 00:03:03,037
Did your GPS mess up again
and lead you here?

38
00:03:04,163 --> 00:03:05,371
I don’t...

39
00:03:05,372 --> 00:03:07,498
I don’t know what the fuck
you’re talking about.

40
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:12,213
I just want to sleep
and not see any...

41
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,880
dick.

42
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:16,299
Wow!

43
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,010
Well, I didn’t expect to
find a drunk woman

44
00:03:19,011 --> 00:03:20,929
causing a scene when
I came out of the bathroom.

45
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,597
What are you even doing here?

46
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:25,935
Do I even need a reason?
Why, you know what...

47
00:03:26,143 --> 00:03:26,936
You’re...

48
00:03:26,937 --> 00:03:30,648
You're not the
only owner of this unit.

49
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:34,585
Can you just put something on?

50
00:04:34,586 --> 00:04:35,796
For Pete’s sake.

51
00:04:36,964 --> 00:04:40,259
You just vomited, but
you still manage to act sassy.

52
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:41,509
Here.

53
00:04:44,013 --> 00:04:45,306
Where did you even go drinking?

54
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,811
Sam’s.

55
00:04:51,812 --> 00:04:54,231
Don’t drink if
you can’t handle it.

56
00:05:00,362 --> 00:05:02,656
I feel dizzy.

57
00:05:03,157 --> 00:05:05,075
I want to lie down.

58
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:09,413
God. Fuck alcohol.

59
00:05:10,122 --> 00:05:12,874
Here, put this on.

60
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,918
Don’t lie on my bed
until you change, okay?

61
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,839
Hey! You know,
that’s my bed too.

62
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,842
I just bought the bedsheet.
That bedsheet is mine.

63
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:25,346
Whatever…

64
00:05:28,932 --> 00:05:30,476
Learned your lesson now?

65
00:06:07,304 --> 00:06:10,641
You're really good at
popping up out of nowhere.

66
00:06:47,803 --> 00:06:51,682
Shit. My head hurts so bad.

67
00:06:57,521 --> 00:06:59,273
Where am I?

68
00:07:07,156 --> 00:07:10,409
Oh fuck!
What the hell happened?

69
00:07:16,415 --> 00:07:17,415
Yes!

70
00:07:22,588 --> 00:07:23,755
What the fuck?

71
00:07:24,131 --> 00:07:25,591
What are you doing here?

72
00:07:31,763 --> 00:07:33,474
Here, put this on.

73
00:07:39,354 --> 00:07:43,191
He was so nice to
me last night. Weird.

74
00:07:43,192 --> 00:07:46,820
But what happened next?
I can’t remember!

75
00:08:03,712 --> 00:08:05,755
He didn’t wake me up even though

76
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:09,259
he knows we have a
meeting today! He’s so annoying.

77
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:39,539
Coffee, ma’am?

78
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,543
Oh my god. Yes, please.

79
00:08:43,043 --> 00:08:46,338
I had a rough night.

80
00:08:46,672 --> 00:08:47,798
Same.

81
00:09:04,356 --> 00:09:06,264
I apologize for being late.

82
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:08,347
I know everyone has work to do.

83
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,572
So, thank you for waiting.

84
00:09:13,824 --> 00:09:15,742
It’s okay, Miss Ledezma.

85
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,543
He’s really getting
on my nerves.

86
00:09:26,652 --> 00:09:28,570
Okay, let’s start the meeting.

87
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:15,134
That’s right.

88
00:10:15,135 --> 00:10:16,386
Keep drinking.

89
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:20,098
Are you about to head home?

90
00:10:21,683 --> 00:10:23,185
To my condo?

91
00:10:25,812 --> 00:10:27,980
May I just remind you

92
00:10:27,981 --> 00:10:30,233
that we’re co-owners
of that condo.

93
00:10:31,401 --> 00:10:33,945
Why are you even living there?

94
00:10:34,571 --> 00:10:35,906
Don’t you have a house?

95
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:40,661
The design is done,
but it’s not finished yet.

96
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,204
He’s already building a house.

97
00:10:43,205 --> 00:10:45,540
I guess he’s planning
to settle down soon.

98
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,669
And you? Why are you
staying in the condo?

99
00:10:49,086 --> 00:10:50,239
What about your mansion?

100
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:53,878
I did live there for a bit.

101
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:55,962
But...

102
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:02,550
It’s just too big
for one person.

103
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,136
I prefer the condo.

104
00:11:05,602 --> 00:11:07,229
It’s the perfect size for me.

105
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,110
So, are you staying
at the condo later?

106
00:11:13,568 --> 00:11:17,280
No, I’ll stay at a hotel since
you’re at the condo now.

107
00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:19,116
Like you said,

108
00:11:19,574 --> 00:11:22,828
we’re co-owners,
so you have a right to it.

109
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,039
Look...

110
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,416
I don’t mind you
sleeping at the condo.

111
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:30,816
I’m only staying there
for a week or two anyways.

112
00:11:31,044 --> 00:11:32,169
Never mind.

113
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,171
I’m heading straight
to Batangas anyway,

114
00:11:34,172 --> 00:11:36,048
so you can have the
condo to yourself for now.

115
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:39,469
So you don't have to worry
about seeing my dick.

116
00:11:48,895 --> 00:11:49,646
Ma’am…

117
00:11:49,647 --> 00:11:50,647
Hi, Roel.

118
00:11:51,398 --> 00:11:52,398
Hey!

119
00:11:52,774 --> 00:11:53,774
Roel.

120
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:55,485
- Sevi!
- How are you?

121
00:11:56,194 --> 00:11:58,989
Sorry, I meant Engineer Sevi.

122
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,741
No need to call me that.

123
00:12:01,742 --> 00:12:04,369
Just Sevi is fine.

124
00:12:05,954 --> 00:12:08,206
It’s just like
the good old times.

125
00:12:09,624 --> 00:12:11,041
By the way,

126
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:13,294
could you teach your
madam how to use the GPS

127
00:12:13,295 --> 00:12:14,838
so she doesn’t get lost?

128
00:12:15,338 --> 00:12:18,340
She doesn’t even know
how to use Bluetooth either.

129
00:12:18,341 --> 00:12:20,384
Okay?
Nice seeing you.

130
00:12:20,385 --> 00:12:21,887
You too, sir.

131
00:12:25,974 --> 00:12:27,225
Really, ma’am?

132
00:12:27,476 --> 00:12:32,898
You don’t know how to use the
GPS or Bluetooth in your car?

133
00:14:08,618 --> 00:14:11,830
I wonder how long
he’s been staying here.

134
00:14:42,152 --> 00:14:46,323
Mommy gave these to us.
Is he still using these?

135
00:15:17,729 --> 00:15:19,897
Wow! ElVi, huh?

136
00:15:19,898 --> 00:15:21,649
That’s our couple name now.

137
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,736
We’ll watch shows here
in our shared account.

138
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,950
Still using the account
I made for us. Parasite.

139
00:16:10,782 --> 00:16:13,034
When we do move in together,

140
00:16:14,411 --> 00:16:17,998
I want a painting just like
that in our living room.

141
00:16:21,876 --> 00:16:25,755
He bought the painting? Why?

142
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,473
Alice - Secretary:
Good evening, ma’am.

143
00:16:36,474 --> 00:16:40,227
Sir Anthony and Sir Austin are
gonna be visiting the Project Aruga

144
00:16:40,228 --> 00:16:43,857
site tomorrow.
Are you coming with them?

145
00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:00,290
Elyse Ledezma:
Yes.

146
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:26,733
This is for you.
Eat first.

147
00:17:34,824 --> 00:17:35,825
Are you okay?

148
00:17:36,785 --> 00:17:38,161
Why do you look so pale?

149
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,246
I’m okay.

150
00:17:41,998 --> 00:17:43,750
Just tired from the trip.

151
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:47,128
I heard from your secretary that

152
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:49,589
you’re not eating on time

153
00:17:49,923 --> 00:17:52,050
and you're always
staying late at the office.

154
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:54,844
Are you sure you’re
getting enough rest?

155
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:58,473
Alice needs
to be less talkative.

156
00:17:59,808 --> 00:18:00,934
Thank you,

157
00:18:01,142 --> 00:18:04,771
but you don’t need to
worry about me, Austin.

158
00:18:05,396 --> 00:18:06,564
But I want to.

159
00:18:07,607 --> 00:18:10,317
Actually, you don’t really
need to visit the site.

160
00:18:10,318 --> 00:18:11,736
I can take care of things here.

161
00:18:14,322 --> 00:18:16,533
I want and need to stay here.

162
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,119
This project is special to me.

163
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:22,580
Okay.

164
00:18:22,956 --> 00:18:24,206
By the way,

165
00:18:24,207 --> 00:18:26,834
Dad and I are
going back to Manila.

166
00:18:26,835 --> 00:18:28,253
Are you coming with us?

167
00:18:29,045 --> 00:18:31,673
You guys go ahead,
I’ll finish this first.

168
00:18:33,174 --> 00:18:35,385
Roel will just pick me up later.

169
00:18:37,137 --> 00:18:38,137
Okay.

170
00:18:38,138 --> 00:18:40,515
You should eat. Please.

171
00:18:59,868 --> 00:19:01,202
It’s lunch break.

172
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,663
Architect Rosario
treated the staff to lunch.

173
00:19:04,664 --> 00:19:07,333
He told me to bring
you some, so eat up.

174
00:19:08,251 --> 00:19:10,044
It's bad to turn down food.

175
00:19:20,054 --> 00:19:22,389
He looks really hot.

176
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,601
His shoulders got broader.

177
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:53,254
Miss Ledezma?

178
00:19:54,214 --> 00:19:55,214
Are you okay?

179
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,301
Yes.

180
00:20:01,304 --> 00:20:04,057
Why the fuck was
I checking him out?

181
00:20:26,704 --> 00:20:27,705
Sev!

182
00:20:31,626 --> 00:20:33,169
Hi, Miss Ledezma.

183
00:20:34,545 --> 00:20:35,546
Hi.

184
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,632
Sev, let’s eat.

185
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:41,677
I brought kare-kare.
I also cooked more for you.

186
00:20:41,678 --> 00:20:43,972
Still with the kare-kare.

187
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,244
That’s really sweet of you

188
00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:49,688
to prepare lunch
for Engineer Camero.

189
00:20:50,036 --> 00:20:51,454
That's some serious effort.

190
00:20:52,397 --> 00:20:55,608
Of course.
Sevi loves my cooking.

191
00:21:02,782 --> 00:21:04,450
You go ahead, Biancs.

192
00:21:04,826 --> 00:21:06,868
- I’ll follow.
- All right, Sev.

193
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:08,162
I’ll wait for you, okay?

194
00:21:11,124 --> 00:21:13,375
Biancs? Sev?

195
00:21:13,376 --> 00:21:16,671
Wow, they’re on
nickname basis now, huh?

196
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,172
How cute.

197
00:21:39,402 --> 00:21:40,778
Back to work again?

198
00:21:42,155 --> 00:21:43,906
Weren’t you just
about to eat earlier?

199
00:21:44,741 --> 00:21:47,160
- You should eat first.
- I lost my appetite.

200
00:21:49,454 --> 00:21:50,454
And...

201
00:21:50,997 --> 00:21:53,374
Why do you care if I eat or not?

202
00:21:54,584 --> 00:21:56,793
Aren’t you busy,
Engineer Camero?

203
00:21:56,794 --> 00:21:59,964
Just go eat your lunch
so you can go back to work.

204
00:22:01,382 --> 00:22:03,258
Go eat your

205
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:06,178
delicious home-cooked meal

206
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:08,306
that Engineer Ramos
cooked for you.

207
00:22:11,934 --> 00:22:14,562
Eat or not.
Do whatever you want.

208
00:22:15,355 --> 00:22:19,149
I was just told by Architect
Rosario to bring you food.

209
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:22,111
Well, tell Architect Rosario
I said thanks.

210
00:22:38,002 --> 00:22:41,339
Thanks again for treating us
to pasta and pizza earlier.

211
00:22:42,215 --> 00:22:44,092
But wait...

212
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,552
Why did you suddenly treat us?

213
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:49,430
Oh my god!

214
00:22:49,931 --> 00:22:50,932
Master…

215
00:22:51,891 --> 00:22:52,892
Are you okay?

216
00:22:53,518 --> 00:22:54,851
Are you sick?

217
00:22:54,852 --> 00:22:56,145
Did you eat something bad?

218
00:22:56,562 --> 00:22:57,480
Dumbass!

219
00:22:57,481 --> 00:22:59,899
I was just craving, so
I bought food for everyone.

220
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,859
Really now?

221
00:23:02,485 --> 00:23:05,655
Or maybe because we have a
special visitor on-site today?

222
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:07,573
What are you talking about?

223
00:23:08,324 --> 00:23:09,951
Just kidding.

224
00:23:10,785 --> 00:23:11,786
But...

225
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,623
I hope you always get a craving

226
00:23:16,624 --> 00:23:19,168
so that next time,
we get to have steak.

227
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,963
You wish.

228
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:24,214
That’s the last time
I’ll do that.

229
00:23:24,215 --> 00:23:25,842
Damn it.

230
00:23:26,551 --> 00:23:28,009
You're such a buzzkill.

231
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,719
Anyway, I’ll go ahead now.

232
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
Okay.

233
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,701
Wow, Mom.

234
00:23:52,702 --> 00:23:56,539
I can really see your
passion project coming together.

235
00:24:28,196 --> 00:24:29,906
- Oh shit!
- What a hassle.

236
00:25:49,527 --> 00:25:50,570
Elyse?

237
00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:56,742
Elyse?

238
00:26:07,878 --> 00:26:09,630
I thought you left?

239
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:14,385
Aren’t you going back
to Batangas?

240
00:26:15,303 --> 00:26:16,971
I bought you medicine.

241
00:26:21,434 --> 00:26:22,727
Eat first.

242
00:26:23,936 --> 00:26:27,440
So you can take your medicine.

243
00:26:44,332 --> 00:26:45,666
You cooked this?

244
00:26:48,336 --> 00:26:50,171
You don’t have to.

245
00:26:50,713 --> 00:26:51,964
Thank you.

246
00:26:53,424 --> 00:26:54,967
Finish that up.

247
00:26:55,551 --> 00:26:56,927
Don’t leave any leftovers.

248
00:26:57,637 --> 00:26:59,679
I don’t—
I don’t know. I’m sick.

249
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,098
I don’t think
I have the appetite.

250
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:03,933
That's why you're getting sick.

251
00:27:03,934 --> 00:27:05,269
You’re not eating properly.

252
00:27:08,189 --> 00:27:09,356
Okay.

253
00:27:09,357 --> 00:27:10,900
I’ll finish it.

254
00:27:27,708 --> 00:27:30,460
His cooking is still
as good as ever.

255
00:27:30,461 --> 00:27:32,672
I checked your
temperature earlier.

256
00:27:33,464 --> 00:27:35,173
Your fever is still high.

257
00:27:35,174 --> 00:27:38,135
I’m not surprised,
I feel like shit.

258
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:42,764
But you know, you can
go back to your hotel.

259
00:27:42,765 --> 00:27:44,308
I’m fine on my own.

260
00:27:46,435 --> 00:27:47,895
Change of plans.

261
00:27:48,771 --> 00:27:50,355
Don’t go to work.

262
00:27:50,356 --> 00:27:51,774
Just rest here.

263
00:27:52,441 --> 00:27:53,984
Yes, I won’t.

264
00:27:54,735 --> 00:27:56,737
I’m too weak to work anyway.

265
00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:00,615
But again, you can go ahead.

266
00:28:00,616 --> 00:28:02,075
It’s already getting late.

267
00:28:02,076 --> 00:28:03,953
I can take care of myself.

268
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:08,248
I don’t believe you can
take care of yourself.

269
00:28:08,249 --> 00:28:10,835
If you could, then you
wouldn’t have gotten sick.

270
00:28:16,465 --> 00:28:19,468
Are you staying here tonight?

271
00:28:29,019 --> 00:28:30,312
Finish that up.

272
00:28:30,813 --> 00:28:32,648
So you can take your medicine.

273
00:28:36,193 --> 00:28:37,194
Okay.

274
00:29:16,358 --> 00:29:17,526
Oh, you're awake.

275
00:29:18,402 --> 00:29:19,653
How are you feeling?

276
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,155
Do you want me to bring
your food to the room?

277
00:29:22,156 --> 00:29:23,740
No, it’s okay.

278
00:29:23,741 --> 00:29:25,408
I’ll just eat here.

279
00:29:25,409 --> 00:29:26,869
I’m feeling a bit better.

280
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:33,959
You still have a fever.

281
00:29:34,794 --> 00:29:39,006
Have you informed the office
that you’re taking a sick leave?

282
00:29:41,217 --> 00:29:44,470
Yes, I told Alice not to
bother me the whole day.

283
00:29:45,721 --> 00:29:46,722
Good.

284
00:29:53,813 --> 00:29:54,814
Go ahead and eat.

285
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,443
Thank you.

286
00:30:00,528 --> 00:30:02,696
You already cooked twice for me.

287
00:30:04,406 --> 00:30:06,909
Next time, I'll cook for you.

288
00:30:07,868 --> 00:30:11,247
Next time? Is there still
a next time after this?

289
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,124
We still haven’t decided
who’s going to live here.

290
00:30:18,462 --> 00:30:20,589
Well, since you’re already here,

291
00:30:21,006 --> 00:30:22,715
there is something
that I’ve been wanting

292
00:30:22,716 --> 00:30:25,010
to discuss with you about.

293
00:30:29,431 --> 00:30:30,641
Okay, well...

294
00:30:31,725 --> 00:30:33,810
I know that I told you that

295
00:30:33,811 --> 00:30:36,772
I’ll only stay here
for a week or two.

296
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,860
But I’ve decided that I want
to stay here indefinitely.

297
00:30:43,237 --> 00:30:46,155
I like living here, and
it's close to the office.

298
00:30:46,156 --> 00:30:48,074
We can discuss
the living arrangement

299
00:30:48,075 --> 00:30:49,994
that we’re both
comfortable with.

300
00:30:56,208 --> 00:31:01,129
But if it’s too weird
or awkward for you,

301
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,007
I’ll understand.

302
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:05,967
I can leave since
you looked after

303
00:31:05,968 --> 00:31:07,845
the property while I was away.

304
00:31:09,513 --> 00:31:10,598
What do you think?

305
00:31:14,226 --> 00:31:14,894
Shit.

306
00:31:14,895 --> 00:31:18,521
He’s going to say no.
He hates my guts.

307
00:31:18,522 --> 00:31:20,816
Why would he want
to live with me?

308
00:31:27,823 --> 00:31:28,823
Okay.

309
00:31:36,999 --> 00:31:40,210
Okay, I’ll go pack my stuff now.

310
00:32:02,107 --> 00:32:03,108
Okay.

311
00:32:03,442 --> 00:32:05,110
Let’s live together again.

312
00:32:16,664 --> 00:32:17,664
I said

313
00:32:18,207 --> 00:32:21,293
I'm okay with us living here
together again.

314
00:32:25,756 --> 00:32:29,468
Wow, I didn’t expect you
to say yes that quickly.

315
00:32:32,721 --> 00:32:34,473
Why would I ask you to leave?

316
00:32:36,433 --> 00:32:39,770
You paid for half of this condo.

317
00:32:40,729 --> 00:32:41,814
Plus,

318
00:32:42,481 --> 00:32:44,274
the unit is big enough.

319
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:47,694
It can fit two people who

320
00:32:47,695 --> 00:32:49,405
won’t get on each
other’s nerves.

321
00:32:49,947 --> 00:32:52,448
Right, and usually,

322
00:32:52,449 --> 00:32:55,285
you won’t even see me the whole
day because I’m at work.

323
00:32:55,661 --> 00:32:57,829
You’ll only see me
at night and then

324
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:00,249
I leave early morning
the next day.

325
00:33:00,916 --> 00:33:01,917
Just...

326
00:33:02,543 --> 00:33:04,795
think of me as a boarder.

327
00:33:06,046 --> 00:33:09,383
I'm usually not here either,
so go ahead.

328
00:33:11,844 --> 00:33:14,804
Why is he so
nonchalant about this?

329
00:33:14,805 --> 00:33:17,766
I guess he really
doesn’t care anymore.

330
00:33:20,602 --> 00:33:21,812
Well, how about this…

331
00:33:22,771 --> 00:33:26,400
I’ll pay the utility bills
for this month.

332
00:33:27,109 --> 00:33:28,902
I’ve already made
an advance payment.

333
00:33:30,821 --> 00:33:34,366
Okay, well then,
I’ll just pay you my share.

334
00:33:35,117 --> 00:33:38,494
And for the groceries,
I think it would be better if

335
00:33:38,495 --> 00:33:40,914
we did a community pantry.

336
00:33:41,457 --> 00:33:44,710
You can take some of my food
and I can take some of yours.

337
00:33:45,961 --> 00:33:47,463
Is that okay?

338
00:33:50,424 --> 00:33:53,385
Does that include my clothes?

339
00:33:54,928 --> 00:33:57,388
Well, sorry. It’s just cold.

340
00:33:57,389 --> 00:33:58,599
I can take it off.

341
00:33:59,725 --> 00:34:01,935
Nevermind.
I already lent it to you.

342
00:34:04,104 --> 00:34:05,522
One more rule...

343
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:07,900
no walking around in the nude.

344
00:34:08,776 --> 00:34:10,568
Excuse me,

345
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:14,405
you literally showed me
your dick the other day.

346
00:34:14,406 --> 00:34:15,824
I never meant to.

347
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:18,242
Fine.

348
00:34:18,243 --> 00:34:19,244
But also,

349
00:34:19,787 --> 00:34:22,288
let’s mind our
own business, okay?

350
00:34:22,289 --> 00:34:23,664
No visitors allowed

351
00:34:23,665 --> 00:34:26,584
unless there’s permission
from both sides.

352
00:34:26,585 --> 00:34:30,129
Other people can’t know
that we’re living together.

353
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:33,758
I’m literally your boss
because of the project.

354
00:34:33,759 --> 00:34:35,844
I don’t want any
issues at the office.

355
00:34:37,596 --> 00:34:39,222
You're the one losing out?

356
00:34:39,223 --> 00:34:40,474
Of course.

357
00:34:40,766 --> 00:34:41,767
Duh.

358
00:34:42,893 --> 00:34:44,228
You really are sick.

359
00:34:44,812 --> 00:34:45,812
What?

360
00:34:49,525 --> 00:34:50,942
Anyway,

361
00:34:50,943 --> 00:34:52,569
who’s sleeping on the bed?

362
00:34:56,156 --> 00:34:57,156
You can sleep on the bed.

363
00:34:57,157 --> 00:34:58,450
I’ll take the sofa.

364
00:34:58,742 --> 00:35:01,954
No, it’s fine.
We can take turns or something.

365
00:35:03,122 --> 00:35:05,582
Whatever.
Just finish eating.

366
00:35:06,458 --> 00:35:07,708
And

367
00:35:07,709 --> 00:35:08,961
here’s your medicine.

368
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,713
Don’t forget to take it.

369
00:35:18,178 --> 00:35:19,179
Thank you.

370
00:35:55,382 --> 00:35:56,757
Good morning, ma’am.

371
00:35:56,758 --> 00:35:59,178
Delivery for Miss Elyse Ledezma.

372
00:36:01,555 --> 00:36:03,182
- Thank you.
- You’re welcome.

373
00:36:20,282 --> 00:36:24,577
Finish the food and take
a picture of yourself eating,

374
00:36:24,578 --> 00:36:26,787
along with the empty container.

375
00:36:26,788 --> 00:36:29,832
No cheating,
or you’ll be washing the dishes

376
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:31,250
for a month.

377
00:36:31,251 --> 00:36:32,544
Sevi.

378
00:36:39,092 --> 00:36:42,429
Engineer Camero.

379
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:09,289
@elydezma:
Happy?

380
00:37:12,751 --> 00:37:15,671
@sevirous:
Such a good hamster.

381
00:37:19,216 --> 00:37:21,802
Hamster? Stupid ass!

382
00:38:02,467 --> 00:38:04,219
He looks…

383
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:07,014
Healthy.

384
00:39:45,487 --> 00:39:46,488
Eat up.

385
00:39:49,866 --> 00:39:52,994
It’s okay. I usually just eat
brunch at the office.

386
00:39:58,583 --> 00:40:04,548
What a waste of the tapsilog I cooked.

387
00:40:07,592 --> 00:40:11,888
That looks good.
And it smells nice.

388
00:40:15,267 --> 00:40:17,852
Well, I guess…

389
00:40:17,853 --> 00:40:19,813
I do feel kind of hungry.

390
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,442
Might as well take a bite…

391
00:40:24,317 --> 00:40:25,318
or two.

392
00:40:40,542 --> 00:40:41,543
Thank you.

393
00:40:48,008 --> 00:40:49,009
Go on, eat.

394
00:40:50,218 --> 00:40:52,179
Thank you.
You?

395
00:40:54,681 --> 00:40:55,682
Go ahead.

396
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:19,998
It’s delicious.

397
00:41:20,624 --> 00:41:21,625
Of course.

398
00:41:26,004 --> 00:41:27,839
Roel isn’t picking you up today?

399
00:41:29,883 --> 00:41:31,467
No, it’s his day off,

400
00:41:31,468 --> 00:41:33,928
but I can drive myself
to the office.

401
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:36,764
I hope you know
how to use the GPS now.

402
00:41:36,765 --> 00:41:38,892
You might end up
in Baguio if you don’t.

403
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,895
Let’s go down together.

404
00:41:43,688 --> 00:41:44,981
I’ll just grab my keys.

405
00:41:46,066 --> 00:41:47,067
Okay.

406
00:42:52,424 --> 00:42:53,799
Sevi!

407
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,426
I’m leaving.

408
00:42:55,427 --> 00:42:56,427
Hold on!

409
00:43:08,481 --> 00:43:09,524
Good morning.

410
00:43:11,484 --> 00:43:12,735
Good morning, madam.

411
00:43:12,736 --> 00:43:14,361
- Hi.
- How are you feeling today?

412
00:43:14,362 --> 00:43:16,780
I’m okay. What’s my
schedule for today?

413
00:43:16,781 --> 00:43:20,367
You have a meeting with
the Project Aruga team at 10AM.

414
00:43:20,368 --> 00:43:21,368
Okay.

415
00:43:21,995 --> 00:43:23,871
Are they in the
conference room already?

416
00:43:23,872 --> 00:43:25,039
Most of them are,

417
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,626
but we’re still waiting
for Engineer Camero.

418
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:30,795
Engineer Camero
is already there.

419
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:34,966
Did you arrive together, ma’am?

420
00:43:35,759 --> 00:43:38,428
No. No, I...

421
00:43:39,804 --> 00:43:41,973
I just ran into him
in the parking lot.

422
00:43:42,766 --> 00:43:43,892
Okay.

423
00:43:44,809 --> 00:43:46,602
Ely, good morning.

424
00:43:46,603 --> 00:43:47,604
You look great.

425
00:43:48,146 --> 00:43:51,733
I’m glad you were
able to rest well.

426
00:43:52,359 --> 00:43:54,402
Yeah, thanks.

427
00:43:56,696 --> 00:44:01,033
By the way, I got two
Broadway tickets for us.

428
00:44:01,034 --> 00:44:02,576
You like those, right?

429
00:44:02,577 --> 00:44:04,746
The show starts
at 8PM, Saturday.

430
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:07,582
Wear something nice.
I’ll fetch you.

431
00:44:09,209 --> 00:44:12,170
Wow. He decides
for me now, huh?

432
00:44:12,796 --> 00:44:15,130
I’m sorry but I can’t go.

433
00:44:15,131 --> 00:44:18,092
I already have plans
for the weekend, and also,

434
00:44:18,093 --> 00:44:20,511
I’m not going home for now.

435
00:44:20,512 --> 00:44:22,555
Huh?
Where are you staying then?

436
00:44:25,392 --> 00:44:27,851
So sorry to interrupt but

437
00:44:27,852 --> 00:44:29,562
the meeting is about to start.

438
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:33,650
Let’s discuss this another time.
We still have work to do.

439
00:44:34,317 --> 00:44:35,568
Shall we?

440
00:44:38,613 --> 00:44:39,906
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

441
00:44:43,785 --> 00:44:46,412
It’s been frequently
raining for the past month,

442
00:44:46,413 --> 00:44:49,456
so the construction slowed down
due to the bad weather.

443
00:44:49,457 --> 00:44:51,959
I’m proposing to add more
workers to speed up

444
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,211
the construction.

445
00:44:53,503 --> 00:44:55,546
Do you have a figure for this?

446
00:44:55,547 --> 00:44:58,757
Because we need to ensure

447
00:44:58,758 --> 00:45:02,469
that we stay within
the budget of the project.

448
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:03,762
Of course we do, sir.

449
00:45:03,763 --> 00:45:06,307
We’ll print the hard copy
and give it to you guys later.

450
00:45:08,435 --> 00:45:09,768
Sorry to interrupt,

451
00:45:09,769 --> 00:45:11,770
but it is almost lunch break.

452
00:45:11,771 --> 00:45:15,400
I think we should resume this
discussion in about an hour.

453
00:45:18,611 --> 00:45:19,611
Master?

454
00:45:19,988 --> 00:45:20,989
Let’s eat.

455
00:45:21,322 --> 00:45:22,532
You guys go ahead.

456
00:45:23,825 --> 00:45:25,994
Miss Ledezma, Mr. Guerrero.

457
00:45:35,628 --> 00:45:37,005
Miss Ledezma.

458
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:47,640
Elyse,

459
00:45:49,142 --> 00:45:51,644
I got you lunch.
I’ll just get it.

460
00:46:13,374 --> 00:46:14,875
What the fuck is he doing?

461
00:46:14,876 --> 00:46:16,878
Alice might see!

462
00:46:26,262 --> 00:46:28,223
So annoying.

463
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,727
Excuse me, ma’am.
I’ll just go have lunch.

464
00:46:33,728 --> 00:46:34,729
Of course.

465
00:46:45,406 --> 00:46:47,033
What are you doing?

466
00:46:47,742 --> 00:46:48,909
What?

467
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:51,245
You put meds on my table.

468
00:46:51,246 --> 00:46:54,040
What if Alice starts suspecting
something about us?

469
00:46:55,208 --> 00:46:57,502
We need to be careful.

470
00:46:58,211 --> 00:47:00,213
Why, what are we anyway?

471
00:47:11,266 --> 00:47:12,892
Housemates.

472
00:47:14,727 --> 00:47:17,897
It will be a problem if they
know that we’re living together.

473
00:47:20,149 --> 00:47:22,944
Just because I gave you medicine
she’ll get suspicious?

474
00:47:23,444 --> 00:47:25,946
Maybe you just don’t want
Austin to get jealous?

475
00:47:25,947 --> 00:47:26,948
What?

476
00:47:27,282 --> 00:47:29,951
Austin has nothing
to do with this.

477
00:47:35,373 --> 00:47:37,667
Can I drink some water?

478
00:47:38,001 --> 00:47:39,001
Please?

479
00:47:39,711 --> 00:47:41,170
I already drank from that.

480
00:47:43,923 --> 00:47:45,758
Why? Are you sensitive
to other’s saliva?

481
00:47:47,176 --> 00:47:48,928
Aren’t you the
one who’s sensitive?

482
00:47:52,098 --> 00:47:54,182
Go ahead,
drink it if you’re okay

483
00:47:54,183 --> 00:47:55,863
with the fact that
I already drank from it.

484
00:48:10,033 --> 00:48:10,783
Shit.

485
00:48:10,784 --> 00:48:12,785
This is no different
from me kissing him.

486
00:48:14,746 --> 00:48:18,248
By the way, I’m going
grocery shopping later.

487
00:48:18,249 --> 00:48:19,769
Do you need me
to buy anything for you?

488
00:48:21,502 --> 00:48:23,962
Yes, I actually have
a lot to buy. Can I...

489
00:48:23,963 --> 00:48:25,340
Can I go with you?

490
00:48:26,174 --> 00:48:27,174
Sure.

491
00:48:27,425 --> 00:48:29,135
Are you free after the meeting?

492
00:48:29,802 --> 00:48:30,928
Yes,

493
00:48:30,929 --> 00:48:34,307
but is it okay if we
leave later this evening?

494
00:48:35,224 --> 00:48:37,064
My car’s under the traffic
coding scheme today.

495
00:48:37,268 --> 00:48:39,437
We can just use my car.

496
00:48:41,606 --> 00:48:42,898
It’s such a hassle
to go grocery shopping

497
00:48:42,899 --> 00:48:44,608
when you don’t have a car.

498
00:48:44,609 --> 00:48:47,861
Let’s not do this when my car is
under the traffic coding scheme.

499
00:48:47,862 --> 00:48:49,279
Don’t worry,

500
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,199
I’ll soon buy Luna’s car.

501
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,453
No coding scheme will stop us
from grocery shopping anymore.

502
00:48:57,455 --> 00:48:58,706
Okay, babe.

503
00:49:18,851 --> 00:49:20,061
Okay, love.

504
00:49:22,855 --> 00:49:23,982
Stop it.

505
00:50:43,436 --> 00:50:45,938
You know, you’ve always
been a good cook.

506
00:50:46,689 --> 00:50:48,441
You can get a girlfriend now.

507
00:50:50,151 --> 00:50:53,821
Since we’re both co-owners,

508
00:50:54,447 --> 00:50:57,282
we thought,
why not be housemates?

509
00:50:57,283 --> 00:51:00,661
I just went with Austin
because it’s his birthday.

510
00:51:03,498 --> 00:51:04,499
Hey…

511
00:51:05,583 --> 00:51:07,251
Are you mad at me?

512
00:51:09,796 --> 00:51:11,130
You’re mad at me.

513
00:51:12,131 --> 00:51:13,673
I'm not mad.

514
00:51:13,674 --> 00:51:15,259
You’re being annoying, Amora.

515
00:51:16,302 --> 00:51:17,303
Amora?

516
00:51:17,804 --> 00:51:20,680
Why are you calling me
by my first name now,

517
00:51:20,681 --> 00:51:21,973
Sebastian?

518
00:51:21,974 --> 00:51:26,228
Just admit that
you're angry, okay?

519
00:51:26,229 --> 00:51:28,106
That you're jealous.
