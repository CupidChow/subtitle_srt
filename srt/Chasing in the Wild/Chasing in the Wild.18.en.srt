1
00:00:10,393 --> 00:00:12,195
Where's your
birthday gift for me?

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,225
I pawned it off already.

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,889
- What did you buy?
- A ring.

4
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:17,267
- He bought you a what?
- A ring!

5
00:00:17,292 --> 00:00:19,173
Look at you, you’re all smiles.

6
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:20,645
Let me help you,
I'll put it on for you.

7
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:21,688
I can do it for myself.

8
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,357
It looks like Miss Ledezma
and Austin are getting close.

9
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,942
Does Miss Ledezma
not have a boyfriend?

10
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,360
She told me she was single.

11
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,755
- Single?
- What should I say?

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,032
I didn’t want to assume.

13
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,469
- Do you like him?
- You’re the man that I like.

14
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:38,121
You seem to be very
hardworking, Engineer Camero.

15
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,456
Yes, very hands-on, sir!

16
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,583
Let’s go.

17
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,601
Ely.

18
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:47,881
It sucks being a Ledezma.

19
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,883
Do you want to change
your last name to mine?

20
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,010
Amora Elyse Ledezma—

21
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,178
Will you marry me?

22
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,055
Yes, I will!

23
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,599
Let’s cheers for
the newly engaged.

24
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,346
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

25
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:00,914
I did have a lot of fun.

26
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,104
It’s Austin.

27
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,481
Elyse, emergency meeting!

28
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,531
One of the guest villas collapsed!

29
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,387
Miss Ledezma,

30
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,097
I’m sorry for what happened.

31
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,516
Based on our initial findings—

32
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,102
The collapse was due
to substandard materials.

33
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,106
No one wanted this to happen.

34
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,315
Can someone from your team

35
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,733
please tell me how this happened?

36
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:34,070
Because we only source
from trusted suppliers.

37
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,074
The recent batch delivery

38
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:41,035
didn’t pass our
quality and safety standards.

39
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,079
They said it was due to
a manufacturing defect.

40
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,540
That is why
Engineer Camero and I

41
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,543
decided to order from
a different supplier.

42
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,544
But—

43
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,464
they still used old
materials for the construction

44
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,466
these past few days.

45
00:02:55,491 --> 00:02:56,575
What?

46
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,720
How did this happen?

47
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,933
Maybe our—

48
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,352
head engineer here can explain.

49
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,360
I’m sorry, Miss Ledezma.

50
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,863
This is my team and—

51
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,073
I take full
responsibility for it.

52
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,911
No.

53
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,370
It’s my—

54
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,748
It’s my fault.

55
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,834
I’m the person in
charge of the guest villas.

56
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,669
I was also the one who gave

57
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,839
the go-ahead
to resume construction—

58
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:38,218
without doing a full
inspection of the materials.

59
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,762
Engineer Camero instructed me to

60
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,680
discard the old materials.

61
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:46,242
However, since we
were running out of time,

62
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,895
we just segregated them

63
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,231
in different parts
of the on-site storage.

64
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:57,111
But how did the
workers access them?

65
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,405
And use that for construction?

66
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,076
I don’t understand it
either, Miss Ledezma.

67
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,704
You should’ve called me first
before going through with it.

68
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,499
Or consulted Engineer Lavin.

69
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,043
I didn’t know anything
about it, Engineer.

70
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,963
Engineer Ramos
didn’t even inform me.

71
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,923
That’s exactly it.

72
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,299
Why don’t you know
what’s happening on-site?

73
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,134
Weren’t there a lot of you there?

74
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:22,387
No one even bothered to call me?

75
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,597
I thought it was fine

76
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,391
since it came from
Engineer Ramos herself.

77
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,812
All I know is that five workers
were sent on-site.

78
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,063
Who sent them?

79
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,110
They said it was you.

80
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,065
Me?

81
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,573
I didn’t send or hire any new workers.

82
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,367
Where did that info come from?

83
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,872
Looks like there was
some miscommunication.

84
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,000
Miss Ledezma,

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,294
you don’t have to
worry about anything.

86
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,046
VGC will pay
for all the damages,

87
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,173
the bills, and the materials.

88
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,342
We will take care of everything.

89
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,845
Our legal team will
take care of the case, too.

90
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:07,432
Can’t we remove Engineer
Camero from this project?

91
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,686
I believe

92
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,063
he was negligent, right?

93
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,107
It’s stated in the contract

94
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,651
that we can remove anyone

95
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,361
due to non-performance,

96
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,282
misconduct, or breach of duties.

97
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,492
Right?

98
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:30,448
Nothing has yet
been proven, Mr. Guerrero.

99
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,916
The investigation is
still yet to be conducted.

100
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,003
Of course, you won’t dismiss him.

101
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,048
I was already expecting that.

102
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,259
Because he is your damn fiance!

103
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,719
Excuse me.

104
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,264
Leave my personal life
out of this, Mr. Guerrero.

105
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,324
Huh?

106
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,850
What’s this?

107
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,852
Do you seriously still
believe this person?

108
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,145
Huh?

109
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,171
And you—

110
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,857
Are you purposely trying
to ruin this company

111
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,568
that your father gave you
because you hate him?

112
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:05,073
I’m expecting your resignation
letter ASAP, Mr. Guerrero.

113
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,367
I want you to leave.

114
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,744
I want you to leave right now.

115
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,011
Miss Ledezma,

116
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,764
VGC will keep in touch.

117
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,975
Our legal team will contact you
one of these days.

118
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,727
For now,

119
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,605
Engineer Lavin will be in charge

120
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,565
or oversee Project Aruga.

121
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:43,778
Engineer Ramos and
Engineer Camero

122
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,946
are in question.

123
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:45,947
Is that okay?

124
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,449
Yes, thank you.

125
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:34,996
Elyse—

126
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,584
I'm sorry you got dragged into
this because of me.

127
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,087
I've done you wrong
so many times.

128
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,882
First, with your mom,

129
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,301
and now, this.

130
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,470
Sev,

131
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,347
don’t worry about it.

132
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,682
I’m fine.

133
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,935
And we will fix this,

134
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:58,936
okay?

135
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,731
None of it was your fault.

136
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,110
I know it's not all my fault.

137
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,988
But I’m still
partly to blame, Elyse.

138
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,992
I was careless with
what happened in Batangas.

139
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,328
That’s my fault.

140
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,079
No, it wasn’t.

141
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,832
Sev, stop it.

142
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,195
Stop putting the
blame on yourself.

143
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:25,148
It was just a mistake.

144
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,711
But five people almost died, Elyse.

145
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,167
We can’t afford to make
mistakes with things like this.

146
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,890
It’s better if I just resign.

147
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,518
What? No!

148
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,770
Okay—

149
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,356
Engineer Ramos made a mistake;

150
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,525
Engineer Lavin made a mistake.

151
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,235
Your team made a mistake

152
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,903
while you were away.

153
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,864
You should take
responsibility for it?

154
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,866
Sure. Yes.

155
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:57,537
But it wasn’t entirely
your fault, okay?

156
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,414
Do you understand me?

157
00:09:06,402 --> 00:09:07,528
Sevi—

158
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,132
We need to be strong,

159
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,686
okay?

160
00:09:11,711 --> 00:09:14,095
We can’t let this destroy you.

161
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:18,241
Because to me, you are the
best engineer out there.

162
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,561
So, for now—

163
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,312
We should just

164
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,023
let the investigation
take its course.

165
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,150
The truth will come out.

166
00:09:29,448 --> 00:09:30,991
What about you?

167
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,591
I can handle this.

168
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,620
This whole thing won’t break me.

169
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:42,749
And—

170
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,251
with what happened
with my mom…

171
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,629
It was a tragedy

172
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:52,258
and we were all victims of it.

173
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,220
But

174
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,180
we can’t go over it again

175
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,057
because it will just
hurt me even more.

176
00:10:00,805 --> 00:10:02,891
Why don’t you
just get mad at me?

177
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,771
Or just leave me?

178
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,524
Because, I love you.

179
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,361
I mean—

180
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,406
Aren’t you also mad at me?

181
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,367
Especially after everything

182
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,286
that happened with your mom?

183
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,385
But you’re still here, aren’t you?

184
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,625
Why?

185
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,670
Because I love you too.

186
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,264
We forgive the people
that we love.

187
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,184
No matter how painful it is.

188
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,687
Unless they are monsters.

189
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:49,565
But

190
00:10:50,222 --> 00:10:51,598
my mom—

191
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:56,282
I loved her so much.

192
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:01,143
And I know that
she loved you too.

193
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,624
My mom had such a pure heart.

194
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,918
And I know she wouldn’t want you

195
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,836
to put the blame on yourself.

196
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,006
So Sevi, please.

197
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,677
Please don’t blame
yourself, okay?

198
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,388
It was never your fault.

199
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,848
Just let it go.

200
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,102
Because I did already.

201
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,729
You haven’t yet.

202
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,232
You haven’t let go, Ely.

203
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,120
What?

204
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,903
You’re still angry.

205
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,280
You’re still sad.

206
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,491
You’re still blaming yourself.

207
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,535
I can see that.

208
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,539
And I know that anger is what’s
keeping you going.

209
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,128
I know where this is going.

210
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,549
Please don’t talk about this.

211
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:02,054
I can tell that you want me
to talk to my dad, huh?

212
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,058
Sevi, I can’t.

213
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,520
I can’t. I don't think I can.

214
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,398
I still don’t think I can.

215
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,360
I understand that.

216
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,531
I just hope you
can understand that

217
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,617
I can't let go of what
happened to your mom.

218
00:12:26,374 --> 00:12:28,001
I’m sorry, Elyse.

219
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,040
I’m sorry.

220
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,930
One day—

221
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,629
we'll be free from all of this.

222
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,558
You still haven’t resigned yet?

223
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,788
Why don’t you
just fire me, Elyse?

224
00:13:09,616 --> 00:13:10,636
Right now.

225
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,335
I see.

226
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,370
Okay.

227
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:17,963
You can’t do it.

228
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,926
Is it because you're afraid
the board might get involved?

229
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,095
Are you scared of my dad?

230
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,057
Look,

231
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,249
I’m not scared of anyone.

232
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:31,936
In fact,

233
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,897
you should be thankful
that I am still nice to you.

234
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,775
Because the moment
that I find out

235
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,194
that you are
involved with all of this—

236
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,863
I can fire you on the spot.

237
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,785
Excuse me, ma'am,

238
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,371
Attorney Martinez is here.

239
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,039
Okay.

240
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,917
- Please gather everyone here.
- Yes, ma’am.

241
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:55,995
Thank you.

242
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,554
These are information
sheets of the seven workers

243
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,597
who were on-site
at the guest villas

244
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,057
on the day of the accident.

245
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,934
They’re not our workers.

246
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,145
Five of them are
currently in the hospital

247
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,939
because of the injuries they—

248
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,192
actually did to themselves.

249
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,819
Well, allegedly.

250
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,363
What do you mean by,

251
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,574
they purposefully
hurt themselves?

252
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,827
Well, they didn’t
actually hurt themselves.

253
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,579
See, I’ve been thinking

254
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,747
about this a long time and—

255
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,835
to me it looks like
it was orchestrated.

256
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:42,256
See, the workers were
hired a few days prior

257
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,362
the accident—

258
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,885
which they were
just instructed to use

259
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,386
substandard materials.

260
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:52,016
Are you saying
it’s an inside job, Attorney?

261
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,643
I’m not saying anything, sir.

262
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,645
I’m just speaking facts.

263
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,356
I’ve talked to dozens of people

264
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,108
from our construction managers,

265
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,068
to our staffing agency.

266
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,988
Even to witnesses on the site.

267
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,658
And the paper trail leads to

268
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,327
Mr. Guerrero and his accomplice.

269
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,871
I mean, sorry. Son?

270
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,247
What’s the relation here?

271
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,957
Sir Austin?

272
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:17,958
What about me?

273
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,002
Why am I involved?

274
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,087
That’s a baseless
accusation, Attorney.

275
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,132
Maybe we should be
the ones to sue you.

276
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,384
I’m gonna call my lawyers now.

277
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,054
We have strong evidence

278
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,514
to support my statement,
Mr. Guerrero.

279
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,601
I would actually invite

280
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,186
the both of you to

281
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,104
speak privately with my team

282
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,773
and answer some
of our questions.

283
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,858
We may start with Sir Austin.

284
00:15:42,883 --> 00:15:45,219
Why would I answer your questions?

285
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,201
I am not forcing you to answer

286
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,454
my questions to prove
you’re innocent,

287
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,622
Sir Austin.

288
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,708
I would just like to remind you,

289
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,794
that if you refuse to cooperate…

290
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,090
It’s just gonna
make you look more—

291
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,633
What’s the word?

292
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,593
Suspicious?

293
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,431
And yes,

294
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,976
Mr. Guerrero,
you may call your lawyer.

295
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,229
As a matter of fact,
they are encouraged

296
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,689
to join our conversation.

297
00:16:22,501 --> 00:16:23,711
So, go ahead.

298
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,820
Okay.

299
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,891
Fine.

300
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,705
Shall we?

301
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,878
I don’t know what to think.

302
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,729
I don’t know what to expect.

303
00:16:46,754 --> 00:16:51,217
If Austin is involved in this,
I’ll never forgive him.

304
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,854
Our family treated them
well all these years,

305
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:57,673
and this is how they repay us?

306
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,949
So, what did he say?

307
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,451
Is he involved?

308
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,329
Let’s just say—

309
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,294
It’s better to keep things
within the legal team

310
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,713
while the whole investigation
is still ongoing.

311
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,257
Okay.

312
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,677
Thank you, Attorney Martinez.

313
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,181
Love, huh?

314
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,436
Makes us do the fucking worst.

315
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,962
Why did you do that?

316
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:14,593
God! You are no
different from my father.

317
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,471
Elyse—

318
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:19,973
I resigned.

319
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,106
I love you.

320
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,531
I love you, I swear I do.

321
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,405
But I was—

322
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,575
I was so pressured by my father.

323
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,705
He wanted me to—

324
00:18:44,907 --> 00:18:46,283
to end up with you.

325
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:51,296
Hoping that the company
would fall into my hands.

326
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,175
I didn’t know what to do.

327
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,136
I don’t know.

328
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,559
I don't—

329
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,437
I don't want to drag
the company down.

330
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,068
Why are you crying?

331
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,946
I just wanted to ask…

332
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,201
Why him?

333
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,456
He was never there.

334
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,795
He hurt you.

335
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:35,857
That’s just a part of—

336
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,554
loving someone
unconditionally, Austin.

337
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,684
I love him

338
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:49,188
despite all of the pain

339
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,148
that we shared in the past.

340
00:19:54,925 --> 00:19:57,344
You may not
understand that now.

341
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,160
But I really hope
that you do someday.

342
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,586
I’m very sorry.

343
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,089
I’m very sorry for what I did.

344
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,443
I'm sorry for everything, Elyse.

345
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,681
I hope—

346
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,725
I hope you can forgive me.

347
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:47,871
It’s so hard.

348
00:20:51,486 --> 00:20:53,654
Hello!

349
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,046
Hi!

350
00:20:56,467 --> 00:20:57,467
Ma.

351
00:20:59,035 --> 00:21:00,067
Hi, Sevi!

352
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,169
- Hi!
- Pa.

353
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,140
The soon-to-be-married
couple is here.

354
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,852
Elyse,

355
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,437
this is Papa.

356
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,064
- Pa, this is Elyse.
- Hello!

357
00:21:14,568 --> 00:21:16,191
Hello, Uncle.

358
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,442
Hello, Elyse!

359
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,529
You’re still
so beautiful, Elyse.

360
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,949
Thank you.
You’ve grown so much!

361
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,117
You too, Steven.

362
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:29,052
Shucks! You’ve
grown taller too, Elyse!

363
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,374
Elyse, dear, please
put down your hand,

364
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,402
your ring is blinding me.

365
00:21:33,427 --> 00:21:36,753
- Yes, it’s really beautiful!
- I know.

366
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,964
Thank you.
It’s so beautiful.

367
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,474
You know, you really sound
and look like him.

368
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,053
He’s definitely my dad, huh?

369
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,681
Pretty ring, right?

370
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,641
I was with Sevi
when we bought that.

371
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,184
And he didn't take time
to choose.

372
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,353
When he saw that ring,

373
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,980
he was sure right away.

374
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,275
Just like the future you
two have together.

375
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,318
He’s certain.

376
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,570
So, thank you, Elyse.

377
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:05,126
You’re a big part
of who Sevi is now.

378
00:22:06,256 --> 00:22:09,593
Come on, let’s stop this
before we start crying!

379
00:22:09,915 --> 00:22:11,288
Go and order,

380
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,832
and you two can go
wash your hands, okay?

381
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,833
So we can eat. Go!

382
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,669
- Okay. Let’s go, Steven.
- First dibs on the buffet.

383
00:22:21,713 --> 00:22:22,737
Auntie…

384
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:30,432
I just want to say
that I’m really sorry

385
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,267
for everything that my dad did.

386
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,437
My dear, you know—

387
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,482
It wasn’t your fault.

388
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,442
And it’s okay now.

389
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:45,781
So many good and happy things
have happened since then.

390
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,075
And I’m sure

391
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:51,333
many more wonderful
things will come.

392
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,124
Elyse, I just want
to thank you and Shan.

393
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,711
You helped me get a good lawyer.

394
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,422
Thank you so much.

395
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,536
Of course.

396
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,177
I just want you to know that

397
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:11,890
I’ve moved on from
what happened back then.

398
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,809
I hope you feel the same.

399
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:19,356
It feels so much
better to live freely.

400
00:23:22,005 --> 00:23:25,193
- Yeah.
- What are you two talking about, huh?

401
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:30,450
I’m so happy that
the two most important

402
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,244
women in my life are here.

403
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,068
I love you, Ma!

404
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,622
I love you, Ely.

405
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,974
Such a smooth talker, huh?

406
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,042
My son is so sweet.

407
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,461
Wait a minute.

408
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,006
Okay, excuse me,
I got a phone call.

409
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,007
Sure, mom.

410
00:23:46,435 --> 00:23:47,467
Hello?

411
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,490
Yes?

412
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:52,973
Sevi.

413
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:57,561
The board will
convene this week to

414
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,689
discuss the removal of
Mr. Guerrero from his position.

415
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,235
Hopefully, this will be
the last of this issue.

416
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,945
The worst is over,

417
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,781
and we can finally breathe easy.

418
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:16,943
Ely—

419
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,041
once this is all over,

420
00:24:21,222 --> 00:24:22,807
I want to marry you.

421
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,842
I really want to marry you, too.

422
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,095
But,

423
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,890
there is one more thing
that I have to do.

424
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:37,767
What is it?

425
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,142
Elyse?

426
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,377
Elyse.

427
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,964
You’ve grown so much.

428
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,475
I lost my mom.

429
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,108
I lost my mom four years ago…

430
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:12,696
Because of you.

431
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,536
It’s because of you!

432
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,333
You manipulative bastard!

433
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,005
You killed mom.

434
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,678
And she died after
knowing how much

435
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,681
of a horrible monster
you have become.

436
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,728
And you know, it ruined me.

437
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:49,274
You ruined me so badly.

438
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,031
Elyse, I’m sorry.

439
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,369
I loved you so much.

440
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,001
You treated me

441
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,711
like a princess.

442
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,798
You treated me
with so much love

443
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,968
and care.

444
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,763
I just don’t understand,

445
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,931
how could you do that to me?

446
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,019
How could you do that to mom?

447
00:27:33,348 --> 00:27:34,558
Elyse, I’m sorry.

448
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,075
I know it’s not enough.

449
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:44,371
I have no valid reason for
all the things I’ve done to you.

450
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:48,072
I just wanna say sorry.

451
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,585
Sorry?

452
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,467
Do you even know

453
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:01,596
how much damage
that you have caused?

454
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,227
I had to go to therapy!

455
00:28:08,905 --> 00:28:11,407
Not just physically—

456
00:28:12,711 --> 00:28:14,463
but mentally!

457
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:21,074
No apology could ever
bring back what happened!

458
00:28:22,413 --> 00:28:26,083
I lost everyone that I loved.

459
00:28:30,128 --> 00:28:32,588
I didn’t just lose Mommy.

460
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,882
But I even lost you.

461
00:28:40,241 --> 00:28:43,536
A father that I looked up to.

462
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:50,979
A father that I believed
was caring and loving.

463
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,899
But then it turns out

464
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,694
that you were
the complete opposite.

465
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:03,993
Elyse, believe me.

466
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,873
I love you so much.

467
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,209
You’re my daughter,

468
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,799
and I love you and your mom.

469
00:29:16,186 --> 00:29:17,854
I love you, dear.

470
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,596
But if you love me—

471
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:29,184
How could you hurt me?

472
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,271
How could you do that to me?

473
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:34,793
How?

474
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,319
Not a day goes by—

475
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,907
that I don’t regret everything.

476
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,287
I regret everything I did.

477
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:51,915
To you—

478
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,170
Especially to the family of Sevi.

479
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:02,175
If only I could be in a
real prison instead of here—

480
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,344
Just to prove to you
that I'm sorry.

481
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:07,931
But I can’t.

482
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:10,892
I’m sick.

483
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,824
I will forgive you.

484
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:32,507
But I’m not doing this just to
let you back into my life again.

485
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:36,081
I’m doing this because I am so,

486
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,211
so tired

487
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:41,542
of keeping this
anger inside of me.

488
00:30:45,335 --> 00:30:48,213
I am so tired of being angry.

489
00:30:50,903 --> 00:30:53,864
I just want to let go of this

490
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,856
and of you completely.

491
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,693
And it is the only way
that I will be free.

492
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,738
Just...

493
00:31:06,601 --> 00:31:08,728
just the thought
of your forgiveness,

494
00:31:10,409 --> 00:31:12,244
whatever is the reason—

495
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,207
is enough for me.

496
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,391
You know what, Dad?

497
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,269
Sometimes, I still wish that

498
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:39,230
you would be beside me
like a normal father.

499
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,112
That you would protect me

500
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:50,074
from all of the monsters that
you hired in the company.

501
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,119
Like a dad would do.

502
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:57,498
Why?

503
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:00,168
Is there something wrong?

504
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,005
Well if there is,
then I can handle it.

505
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,926
I know that my wishes
won’t come true anyway.

506
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,845
And my mom raised a brave woman.

507
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,432
I don’t need your
protecting anymore, dad.

508
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,563
I’m going now.

509
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,067
And I will take your dear friend

510
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,027
out of the board.

511
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,529
And I will not let anyone

512
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:31,407
betray me just like how he did.

513
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,411
Just like how you did.

514
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,807
You’re a strong woman.

515
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,047
I’m proud of you, Elyse.

516
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,550
I’m really sorry.

517
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:52,887
Ely…

518
00:33:00,283 --> 00:33:01,868
Engineer Camero—

519
00:33:10,853 --> 00:33:12,062
I’m sorry.

520
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,044
Don’t worry—

521
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,548
I’ll take care of Elyse,

522
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,385
even though you
nearly ruined my family.

523
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,432
I will never do to her
what you did to us.

524
00:33:40,926 --> 00:33:41,927
Please—

525
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,814
Just please…

526
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,400
Please make her happy.

527
00:33:52,673 --> 00:33:55,384
I wish you a life
that you deserve.

528
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,786
Just stay healthy

529
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:02,081
and enjoy your last days.

530
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,668
I hope you can live with
a peaceful heart.

531
00:34:07,124 --> 00:34:10,252
That is the nicest thing
that I can say to you.

532
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,721
Just please be happy, Elyse.

533
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,556
I am.

534
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,489
This is goodbye, Dad.

535
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:38,114
Now,

536
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:40,767
this may be the last time

537
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,331
that we would see each other.

538
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,876
But don’t worry about me.

539
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,670
Because I’m doing good

540
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,422
and I’m happy and I am well.

541
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:56,385
I am feeling much better now.

542
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,229
I’m really sorry, Elyse.

543
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,957
Goodbye, sir.

544
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:38,237
Linda, please call Roel.

545
00:36:58,849 --> 00:36:59,989
Yes, ma’am.

546
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,052
You called, ma’am?

547
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,724
I wanted to tell you something.

548
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:10,337
I've been thinking
about this for a while now.

549
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:11,812
What is it, ma'am?

550
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:14,774
Well,

551
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,027
I want to give you the mansion

552
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,196
and the car
left over by my dad.

553
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,823
They were all
transferred to my name.

554
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:26,702
Why, ma'am?

555
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:28,664
Are you not coming home anymore?

556
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,498
No, not anymore.

557
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,541
I’m just here to get my things.

558
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,794
Whatever is left over
you can have it.

559
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,421
And Shan already got his.

560
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,715
But if you don’t want the house,

561
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:40,800
I can sell it.

562
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,721
Roel—

563
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,142
Thank you
for your service, Roel.

564
00:37:51,372 --> 00:37:52,749
You’re the best!

565
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,348
Ma'am,

566
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:02,196
it’s an honor to serve you.

567
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,198
Both of you.

568
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:09,412
As for the house, ma’am,

569
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,747
could I—

570
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:15,584
bring and have
my family live here as well?

571
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,045
Huh? Family?

572
00:38:18,934 --> 00:38:21,228
I thought you’re not married?

573
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:22,990
No, ma’am.

574
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:26,762
But I have my
parents and siblings.

575
00:38:27,383 --> 00:38:30,636
They’re just
living in the province.

576
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:34,645
Well, of course, Roel!

577
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:38,316
It would be really
nice to have another family

578
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,901
make new happy
memories in this house.

579
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:44,405
Roel,

580
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,241
if you need help
with the renovation—

581
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:48,451
just call me.

582
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,119
It's free of charge.

583
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,473
Free?

584
00:38:52,665 --> 00:38:54,458
Thank you, Engineer.

585
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,462
I just remembered when

586
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,297
you were both in college.

587
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,966
Good thing I didn’t catch you

588
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,301
when you ran away.

589
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,305
Good thing, Roel.

590
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:15,864
Ma’am—

591
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,192
Even though I'm not your father,

592
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,739
I’m very proud of you.

593
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,245
And of everything
you've accomplished.

594
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,442
Roel,

595
00:39:39,488 --> 00:39:41,574
you’re not my father by blood—

596
00:39:43,022 --> 00:39:44,982
but you are a father to me

597
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,593
by how much
you’ve taken care of me.

598
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,390
And that’s
what a real father is—

599
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,810
a person

600
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,896
who takes care of his children.

601
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:04,610
And I’m so thankful
to you, Roel.

602
00:40:08,877 --> 00:40:11,880
Thank you too, ma’am and sir.

603
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,497
Sorry, ma’am,

604
00:40:16,835 --> 00:40:18,837
I really look bad when I cry.

605
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,255
No.

606
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,426
Thank you, ma’am.

607
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,479
Thanks for everything, Roel.

608
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,567
You really don’t want to stay
in this house anymore?

609
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:02,668
This place holds
too many memories,

610
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,545
I want to start a new life.

611
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:08,299
And besides, no one
will be living here anymore.

612
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,009
And

613
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,845
we’ll have our
new house soon, right?

614
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,016
Of course.

615
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:21,353
I will make our
dream house come true!

616
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,023
And of course,

617
00:41:24,278 --> 00:41:27,490
all my dreams for us.

618
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,824
By the way,
what about your brother?

619
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,702
He never liked this place.

620
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,163
He always treated it as hell.

621
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:43,000
This is a decision
that’s on me now.

622
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,131
Okay.

623
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,592
Whatever decision you make,

624
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:53,719
I’ll support you.

625
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:10,986
Wow!

626
00:42:12,188 --> 00:42:13,212
What?

627
00:42:13,237 --> 00:42:14,405
Look at this, babe.

628
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,617
We were so young here!

629
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:21,492
We were still kids, look at us.

630
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,133
But—

631
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,169
seriously, is this really

632
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,712
how you looked back then?

633
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:30,586
What?

634
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:33,742
Do you have a problem?

635
00:42:35,779 --> 00:42:38,031
No, I don’t. You look
really beautiful here.

636
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,601
So, you only noticed just now?

637
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,521
Huh? No! I’ve noticed it before.

638
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,147
I’ve noticed it before.

639
00:42:47,328 --> 00:42:48,381
Okay.

640
00:42:48,406 --> 00:42:49,708
No wonder

641
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,027
people always stare at us, right?

642
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:53,571
When we’re together.

643
00:42:53,906 --> 00:42:55,614
Because they’re
probably thinking

644
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,157
that you were out of my league.

645
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,160
Or maybe they’re wondering

646
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,871
how you hit the jackpot with me?

647
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,291
Wow!

648
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:08,805
Are you serious, babe?
Do you have a fever?

649
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,423
No, just kidding.

650
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,466
But seriously,

651
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,594
I really hit
the jackpot with you.

652
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,989
Or was it you
who hit the jackpot?

653
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,124
No, it was me.

654
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,145
But kidding aside—

655
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,566
Can you believe
how far we’ve come?

656
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,651
Right?

657
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,656
Those are the things

658
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,492
I don’t want to forget.

659
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,406
But

660
00:43:43,641 --> 00:43:45,196
this mansion,

661
00:43:48,219 --> 00:43:50,753
it’s time to leave it
behind and forget it.

662
00:43:54,587 --> 00:43:57,465
I really want
a new life with you, Sevi.

663
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:06,769
Me too, Ely—

664
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:10,105
I want this life.

665
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:12,493
With you by my side.

666
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,196
No one else.

667
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,398
Ely, you have a visitor.

668
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:20,050
Shan!
What brought you here?

669
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:23,137
It’s so beautiful!

670
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,639
Mommy really knew me so well.

671
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:27,683
Thank you for doing this for me.

672
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,474
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

673
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:32,855
Did you guys plan this for me?

674
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,149
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

675
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,591
Hi, mommy!
I’m getting married!
