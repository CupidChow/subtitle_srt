1
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:15,896
Turning 18 used to scare me.

2
00:00:16,526 --> 00:00:20,826
And I am afraid of all the changes
that’s going to happen in my life.

3
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,359
But I do have everyone I love
here with me, cheering me on.

4
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:29,352
So, maybe growing up isn’t so bad.

5
00:00:29,837 --> 00:00:31,255
So adulting…

6
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:32,689
Bring it on.

7
00:00:33,226 --> 00:00:35,912
Happy birthday to me!

8
00:00:39,315 --> 00:00:40,108
Okay!

9
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:42,859
Enough with these one-shot drinks.

10
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,571
Since you’re 18 now,
it’s time to level up!

11
00:00:46,572 --> 00:00:48,825
Let’s do a five-second shot.

12
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:53,002
Wait, wait!
Don’t give her too much.

13
00:00:53,027 --> 00:00:54,788
It’s her first time drinking hard liquor.

14
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:58,080
It’s okay because I’m 18 now!

15
00:01:00,136 --> 00:01:02,832
- Five seconds!
- Ready?

16
00:01:02,857 --> 00:01:04,342
- Five seconds!
- You okay with it?

17
00:01:08,237 --> 00:01:09,431
Let's go, Elyse!

18
00:01:09,978 --> 00:01:10,978
One...

19
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:13,377
One!

20
00:01:13,402 --> 00:01:14,528
Two!

21
00:01:14,553 --> 00:01:15,679
Three!

22
00:01:15,704 --> 00:01:16,830
Four!

23
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:23,944
What the hell is that?
It’s so bitter.

24
00:01:24,777 --> 00:01:26,283
It’s burning my throat.

25
00:01:26,308 --> 00:01:29,227
Don’t worry, Ely. It’s just tequila.

26
00:01:29,826 --> 00:01:30,368
God!

27
00:01:30,393 --> 00:01:31,367
Let’s go, birthday girl!

28
00:01:31,368 --> 00:01:34,995
- I’m sorry, Shan. It’s her 18th birthday.
- Let’s go!

29
00:01:34,996 --> 00:01:35,538
One more.

30
00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:37,289
Come on, Shan.

31
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,207
One more.

32
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:39,291
Let’s do ten seconds now!

33
00:01:39,292 --> 00:01:41,339
- Go, Elyse!
- Ten seconds is easy!

34
00:01:41,364 --> 00:01:42,522
One more time.

35
00:01:42,547 --> 00:01:45,022
One more time!

36
00:01:46,877 --> 00:01:48,962
You can do ten seconds!

37
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:51,261
One more time, Ely.

38
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,705
Why is he still here?

39
00:01:54,007 --> 00:01:56,079
You can do this.
Ten seconds, okay?

40
00:01:56,953 --> 00:01:58,493
Well, another shot?

41
00:01:58,518 --> 00:01:59,933
- Ten seconds.
- Okay!

42
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,250
Come on, it’s your birthday.

43
00:02:02,108 --> 00:02:03,108
Go!

44
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,983
One!

45
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:06,009
Two!

46
00:02:07,098 --> 00:02:08,098
Hold on!

47
00:02:09,814 --> 00:02:11,014
Happy Birthday!

48
00:02:13,873 --> 00:02:18,309
Fuck them all for making me drink
that bad-tasting alcohol.

49
00:02:18,825 --> 00:02:23,705
I swear, I won’t ever drink again!

50
00:02:26,365 --> 00:02:27,908
Thank you...

51
00:02:29,538 --> 00:02:31,297
I see you had a lot to drink.

52
00:02:31,732 --> 00:02:32,976
You again?

53
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:34,294
Let’s talk!

54
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,906
I don't talk to drunks.

55
00:02:39,043 --> 00:02:40,336
Hey, you!

56
00:02:40,854 --> 00:02:42,564
We need to talk!

57
00:02:42,589 --> 00:02:43,632
I said, I don’t want to.

58
00:02:44,002 --> 00:02:45,715
What do you mean you don’t want to?

59
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,740
Fuck...

60
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:08,309
Nice one!

61
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:09,919
Good job, everyone!

62
00:04:09,944 --> 00:04:11,014
Nice one.

63
00:04:11,694 --> 00:04:13,446
Nice one, Ely!

64
00:04:19,832 --> 00:04:20,904
Hey, Elyse.

65
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,124
I must say,
you’ve improved so much since last year.

66
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:26,559
Keep it up.

67
00:04:26,584 --> 00:04:27,543
Thank you, Coach.

68
00:04:27,544 --> 00:04:31,214
I honestly still feel really unsure with
the second part of the routine.

69
00:04:31,463 --> 00:04:34,046
I still feel really
unstable with the lifts

70
00:04:34,071 --> 00:04:36,707
and I honestly think I
need to practice more.

71
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:38,596
I’m really nervous.

72
00:04:38,597 --> 00:04:41,275
I feel really unprepared
for the competition.

73
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:44,310
Come on. You’re doing great, Elyse.

74
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,437
Never doubt yourself, okay?

75
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:47,922
You’re a sophomore.

76
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:49,073
You’re still learning.

77
00:04:49,398 --> 00:04:52,235
Just attend our practices
and be consistent.

78
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:54,946
- We will get there.
- Okay.

79
00:04:55,404 --> 00:04:58,282
Thank you, Coach
and I will work hard for it.

80
00:04:58,307 --> 00:05:02,770
She’s right, Ely.
Coach did say that you’re on track.

81
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:05,260
Besides, why are you
stressing yourself out today?

82
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:06,285
Isn’t it...

83
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,918
your birthday?

84
00:05:09,006 --> 00:05:10,720
What is this, Raya?

85
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:13,331
Happy legality, Ely!

86
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:18,261
Happy birthday to you!

87
00:05:18,803 --> 00:05:21,806
Happy birthday to you!

88
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,642
- Happy birthday, happy birthday,
- So cute!

89
00:05:25,643 --> 00:05:28,396
Happy birthday to you!

90
00:05:30,268 --> 00:05:31,514
Make a wish.

91
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:39,780
Thank you, guys!

92
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:42,409
Don’t forget my party tomorrow, okay?

93
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,371
Of course, Ely.
We’ve got our gowns ready.

94
00:05:45,396 --> 00:05:47,372
Will you be having an open bar, Ely?

95
00:05:47,373 --> 00:05:51,377
Of course,
overflowing drinks and champagne.

96
00:05:51,627 --> 00:05:53,671
Nice! Are you ready to get drunk?

97
00:05:55,381 --> 00:05:57,507
Okay, girls. That’s enough.

98
00:05:57,508 --> 00:05:59,066
Let’s get back to practice.
Let’s go?

99
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:00,628
Yes, Coach.

100
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:01,755
Happy birthday.

101
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,827
Let’s go!

102
00:06:14,144 --> 00:06:15,568
What are you doing here?

103
00:06:15,593 --> 00:06:17,671
Wait, where’s Roel?

104
00:06:17,862 --> 00:06:20,698
He had some errands to do
so I volunteered to pick you up.

105
00:06:20,972 --> 00:06:22,432
Let’s go, birthday girl!

106
00:06:22,457 --> 00:06:23,457
Okay.

107
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:30,415
Well? Let’s have dinner.
My treat.

108
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:31,652
Wait, OMG!

109
00:06:31,677 --> 00:06:34,389
Okay, so I have been craving Japanese food.

110
00:06:34,414 --> 00:06:37,292
Or, actually,
can we order steak instead?

111
00:06:37,317 --> 00:06:39,110
Wait, I’m torn.

112
00:06:39,553 --> 00:06:40,489
How about this,

113
00:06:40,514 --> 00:06:43,934
I’ll just order something expensive,
since it’s your treat.

114
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,677
You’re so annoying.

115
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:54,737
Ely, it’s time for you to experience
a different side of the world.

116
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:58,427
Besides, the food here is good.
Trust me.

117
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,871
Why? We have money.

118
00:07:00,896 --> 00:07:03,573
Why don’t we just go to Poblacion
and get drinks?

119
00:07:03,574 --> 00:07:04,557
Oops!

120
00:07:04,582 --> 00:07:06,040
Save the drinking for tomorrow.

121
00:07:06,065 --> 00:07:08,490
For sure, your friends will get you drunk
at your birthday party.

122
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:10,475
And I don't want to
bring you home drunk.

123
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,717
Your dad would be so mad.

124
00:07:13,116 --> 00:07:14,743
Our dad.

125
00:07:17,242 --> 00:07:18,452
So, anyways…

126
00:07:18,477 --> 00:07:19,687
How’s your studies?

127
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:21,577
It’s okay.

128
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:26,252
All of my classes are relatively easy,
so nothing too complicated.

129
00:07:27,225 --> 00:07:28,225
That’s good.

130
00:07:28,378 --> 00:07:31,381
Don’t you find it hard to balance
with your cheer dancing?

131
00:07:33,837 --> 00:07:35,046
Not gonna lie,

132
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:37,068
it is getting hard.

133
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,092
Especially with the cheer dance
competition coming up.

134
00:07:40,117 --> 00:07:43,246
And I have all of these grades
that I have to maintain.

135
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:45,261
If my grades go down,

136
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,826
Dad’s gonna make me quit the cheer squad,

137
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:49,794
or just cheer dance in general.

138
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,626
But Ely, don’t put too much pressure
on yourself, okay?

139
00:07:53,651 --> 00:07:56,956
Look at me,
I made the most out of my college years.

140
00:07:57,855 --> 00:07:59,106
I know, right?

141
00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:01,778
And you broke a lot of hearts, too.

142
00:08:03,878 --> 00:08:05,546
Those were the days, okay?

143
00:08:07,804 --> 00:08:09,472
How’s law school going?

144
00:08:09,925 --> 00:08:11,427
It’s really different from college.

145
00:08:11,452 --> 00:08:14,345
Everybody’s so serious,
even the professors are so intense.

146
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,080
That's why I can't slack off.

147
00:08:18,758 --> 00:08:20,168
I miss my friends, though.

148
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:22,703
I wonder what Hiro is doing right now…

149
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:28,010
So...

150
00:08:28,622 --> 00:08:30,338
speaking of Hiro,

151
00:08:31,391 --> 00:08:32,892
when is he coming back to visit?

152
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,216
I don’t know.

153
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:37,938
But I know that he
can’t come to your party.

154
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:41,616
I know, Shan.
You don’t have to remind me.

155
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,341
Let him be.
I’ll be there, anyway.

156
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:46,701
So?

157
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:49,530
You can be so annoying, Shan.

158
00:08:49,882 --> 00:08:53,094
You know,
this isn’t counted as my birthday treat.

159
00:08:53,772 --> 00:08:57,359
You need to treat me to
a fine dining restaurant.

160
00:08:57,645 --> 00:08:59,022
Whatever you say.

161
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:00,837
I’m serious.

162
00:09:01,397 --> 00:09:02,397
Fine!

163
00:09:04,588 --> 00:09:05,672
It’s good, right?

164
00:09:13,922 --> 00:09:15,226
I’m home!

165
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:15,831
Thank you.

166
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,566
Please bring the bags to my room,
Thank you!

167
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:22,170
Hi, Jewel! Hi, Baby!

168
00:09:22,171 --> 00:09:23,764
I missed you.

169
00:09:24,782 --> 00:09:27,785
You look so cute — thank you —
In your dress.

170
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,353
Please bring her to my room.

171
00:09:29,378 --> 00:09:30,378
Thank you.

172
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:32,936
Where’s Mommy and Daddy?

173
00:09:32,961 --> 00:09:36,566
- Happy birthday, dear Elyse!
- Happy birthday!

174
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:40,552
Oh my god!

175
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,528
Come on, blow your candle.
Make a wish.

176
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:49,939
Thank you!

177
00:09:50,043 --> 00:09:51,044
Happy birthday.

178
00:09:51,908 --> 00:09:52,533
Thank you.

179
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,088
Roel, bring in the gifts.

180
00:09:56,855 --> 00:09:59,149
Oh my god, this is a lot.

181
00:09:59,174 --> 00:09:59,883
Yes!

182
00:09:59,908 --> 00:10:02,702
I’m excited to open them all.

183
00:10:03,473 --> 00:10:06,267
Shan, join us.
Let’s watch Elyse open her gifts.

184
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:08,009
Come.

185
00:10:20,021 --> 00:10:23,440
It’s fine, Auntie.
It’s getting late so I have to leave now.

186
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:30,965
Happy birthday, Ely.
I’ll see you tomorrow, okay?

187
00:10:32,062 --> 00:10:33,182
I’ll see you tomorrow, okay?

188
00:10:33,477 --> 00:10:34,478
Okay.

189
00:10:35,182 --> 00:10:36,183
Take care.

190
00:10:36,976 --> 00:10:38,976
Sir, I’ll send him off.

191
00:10:44,986 --> 00:10:46,488
Open your gift, my dear.

192
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:48,233
Here.

193
00:10:48,717 --> 00:10:49,628
Okay.

194
00:10:49,653 --> 00:10:50,797
Come, I’ll help.

195
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:52,260
Okay.

196
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:53,762
Thank you.

197
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:02,904
Oh my god!

198
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:06,474
Daddy, this is so expensive,
you didn’t have to.

199
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,473
Thank you, Daddy.
I’ve always wanted this.

200
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,432
You know what,
I’m glad you like it.

201
00:11:13,457 --> 00:11:14,959
Your mom chose that.

202
00:11:15,607 --> 00:11:17,067
It’s so cute.

203
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,386
Mommy, you know me so well.

204
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:21,496
Of course, you’re my mini me.

205
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:24,159
So, it’s time to go to bed.

206
00:11:24,411 --> 00:11:26,752
Let’s just continue the
celebration tomorrow.

207
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,353
You need to get some rest.

208
00:11:28,378 --> 00:11:30,380
You have to look presentable tomorrow.

209
00:11:30,762 --> 00:11:33,056
Most of our business partners
will attend your party.

210
00:11:34,851 --> 00:11:36,365
Of course, Daddy.

211
00:11:36,915 --> 00:11:41,080
I will be at my best tomorrow and
I won’t let you down.

212
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:43,806
Happy birthday.

213
00:11:45,797 --> 00:11:46,965
I’ll see you upstairs.

214
00:11:52,953 --> 00:11:53,953
Hey…

215
00:11:55,468 --> 00:11:59,138
I want you to look pretty for
yourself tomorrow.

216
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,681
It’s your birthday party.
It's for you.

217
00:12:03,664 --> 00:12:04,957
- Okay.
- Okay.

218
00:12:05,716 --> 00:12:06,508
I love you, Mommy.

219
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:08,869
- I love you, too, sweetheart.
- So much.

220
00:12:48,992 --> 00:12:50,118
Ida!

221
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:51,363
Ida!

222
00:12:51,518 --> 00:12:53,019
Coming, wait!

223
00:12:53,776 --> 00:12:56,279
Ida, they briefed you, right?

224
00:12:58,212 --> 00:12:59,443
Excuse me.

225
00:13:03,405 --> 00:13:05,949
You're going to give me
my birthday speech later.

226
00:13:06,109 --> 00:13:07,652
Make sure it’s perfect, please.

227
00:13:07,817 --> 00:13:09,486
You’re like my maid of honor here.

228
00:13:09,598 --> 00:13:12,058
Ely, this is just your 18th birthday
it’s not a wedding.

229
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,251
But still...

230
00:13:13,475 --> 00:13:17,062
You need to have the best speech
because you’re my best friend.

231
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:17,928
Fine.

232
00:13:17,953 --> 00:13:21,075
Then I’ll just say that I hope you
get a boyfriend soon.

233
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,531
Ida, no!
My dad’s gonna kill me.

234
00:13:23,556 --> 00:13:25,635
Why?
You’re 18 now.

235
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:31,018
Well, you know that I’m not allowed
until I’ve graduated college.

236
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:32,444
Besides,

237
00:13:32,668 --> 00:13:35,001
the guy I wanted to be my boyfriend

238
00:13:35,455 --> 00:13:37,165
has gone to Florida.

239
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:42,376
Oh come on, Ely.
Hiro was probably just a crush.

240
00:13:42,498 --> 00:13:44,583
Find someone suitable for you.

241
00:13:44,849 --> 00:13:47,602
Since he’s never going to go for you, ever!

242
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:49,545
He’s your brother’s friend.

243
00:13:50,055 --> 00:13:51,412
That’s not allowed.

244
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:52,798
Come on, girl.

245
00:13:52,857 --> 00:13:55,610
But, I haven’t liked anyone else yet.

246
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,332
Maybe because you’re not exploring.

247
00:13:58,654 --> 00:14:00,531
Maybe. But...

248
00:14:00,593 --> 00:14:03,762
no man can ever top Hiro for me, okay?

249
00:14:03,787 --> 00:14:06,582
He really set the standard high,
you know that.

250
00:14:06,905 --> 00:14:08,031
And plus,

251
00:14:08,545 --> 00:14:10,588
all the other boys around me are just…

252
00:14:11,203 --> 00:14:12,203
meh.

253
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:14,728
I know.

254
00:14:15,338 --> 00:14:16,839
Ladies and gentlemen,

255
00:14:16,864 --> 00:14:20,766
please join me in extending
our warmest welcome

256
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,037
to our very beautiful debutante,

257
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:27,024
Miss Amora Elyse Ledezma.

258
00:14:46,312 --> 00:14:47,522
Go, Ely!

259
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:17,373
Wow, my sister looks so pretty tonight.

260
00:15:17,398 --> 00:15:19,442
I’m always pretty, duh.

261
00:15:19,611 --> 00:15:22,614
You look nice, too,
and your suit looks good on you.

262
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,416
I know.

263
00:15:24,805 --> 00:15:25,890
Let’s go?

264
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,829
Elyse,

265
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:32,435
tonight marks a very significant milestone
in your journey

266
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:34,877
as you step into adulthood.

267
00:15:43,572 --> 00:15:45,657
Once again,
ladies and gentlemen,

268
00:15:45,682 --> 00:15:48,810
let’s give our debutante
a warm round of applause.

269
00:16:27,811 --> 00:16:29,341
You look beautiful.

270
00:16:30,084 --> 00:16:31,252
Make me proud.

271
00:16:53,659 --> 00:16:55,659
Lyle Garcia.

272
00:17:07,518 --> 00:17:09,422
Arman Rodriguez.

273
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:10,615
Happy birthday.

274
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,688
Thank you.

275
00:17:18,714 --> 00:17:20,714
Mio Hernandez.

276
00:17:25,426 --> 00:17:28,888
Next up, we have Larkin Sanchez.

277
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:31,707
Larkin Sanchez?

278
00:17:31,732 --> 00:17:33,048
- Isn't he the actor?
- Yes, he's...

279
00:17:33,072 --> 00:17:38,190
Larkin Sanchez,
it’s your turn to dance with our debutante.

280
00:17:38,215 --> 00:17:38,990
The actor?

281
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:41,015
Oh my god, it's Larkin.

282
00:17:42,032 --> 00:17:44,159
Larkin Sanchez...

283
00:17:44,184 --> 00:17:47,396
it’s your turn to dance with our debutante.

284
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,611
Who the fuck are you?

285
00:18:22,987 --> 00:18:24,572
Arkin’s in the bathroom.

286
00:18:24,597 --> 00:18:26,599
I’ll cover for him for now.

287
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,904
Go for it, Camero!

288
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:19,258
Yes! Go for it!

289
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,314
Yes!

290
00:19:23,524 --> 00:19:24,650
Ouch!

291
00:19:24,782 --> 00:19:27,743
You’re holding me
like you never want to let me go.

292
00:19:27,768 --> 00:19:29,770
You’re so full of yourself,
you know that?

293
00:19:30,275 --> 00:19:31,902
I don’t even know you.

294
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:39,246
And next up, we have...

295
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:41,299
Go, you prick!

296
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,668
Chill, no need to get mad.

297
00:19:52,243 --> 00:19:55,853
Who invited that
disrespectful man to my party?

298
00:20:01,882 --> 00:20:03,425
So, what happened?
Is it over?

299
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,900
- You fucker!
- Ouch!

300
00:20:05,277 --> 00:20:06,988
You took too long.

301
00:20:09,848 --> 00:20:14,087
- Ciandrei Kyle Lopez.
- I had a bad stomach ache. I can’t help it.

302
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:15,699
So? What happened?

303
00:20:15,724 --> 00:20:17,267
I just covered for you, bro.

304
00:20:18,543 --> 00:20:20,128
Thanks, bro.

305
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,305
I’ll make it up to you,
I promise.

306
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:24,889
Thank you.

307
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:01,739
My daughter, Elyse,

308
00:21:01,907 --> 00:21:04,367
the future CEO of the Ledezma Group.

309
00:21:05,593 --> 00:21:06,594
Hi, Elyse.

310
00:21:06,619 --> 00:21:07,370
Hello.

311
00:21:07,395 --> 00:21:10,481
Look at you,
you’ve grown into such a beautiful lady.

312
00:21:10,506 --> 00:21:12,133
Happy birthday to you.

313
00:21:12,158 --> 00:21:13,576
Thank you so much.

314
00:21:13,701 --> 00:21:15,870
You remember Mr. Anthony
Guerrero right?

315
00:21:15,895 --> 00:21:16,813
Our CFO?

316
00:21:16,838 --> 00:21:18,256
Yes, of course.

317
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:20,158
Thank you for coming,
Uncle Anthony.

318
00:21:20,183 --> 00:21:24,103
I hope you enjoyed the food.
I personally chose it myself.

319
00:21:24,828 --> 00:21:26,497
You have taste, Elyse.

320
00:21:26,782 --> 00:21:28,951
Who could she have inherited that from?

321
00:21:28,976 --> 00:21:30,181
Definitely…

322
00:21:30,627 --> 00:21:31,660
From her mom.

323
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:37,067
By the way, my son, Austin
can’t make it tonight to your party.

324
00:21:37,092 --> 00:21:39,761
You’re almost the same age as him,
you know?

325
00:21:39,786 --> 00:21:42,956
When you have time,
maybe I can introduce him to you?

326
00:21:44,822 --> 00:21:46,824
I’m sure,
Elyse would love to meet your son.

327
00:21:46,957 --> 00:21:47,499
Yes...

328
00:21:47,628 --> 00:21:49,380
Excuse me, Sir Ledezma...

329
00:21:49,405 --> 00:21:50,907
Excuse me, sir.
I’ll just be there.

330
00:21:50,932 --> 00:21:51,932
Thank you.

331
00:21:52,873 --> 00:21:55,042
Elyse, my secretary, Selene.

332
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:57,046
I’m sure you’ve seen
her in the office before.

333
00:21:57,071 --> 00:21:59,735
Yes.
Hi, Ma’am Elyse, happy birthday!

334
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,912
Sevi, greet Sir Ledezma’s daughter,
Ma’am Elyse.

335
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,492
Greetings.

336
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:10,743
Thanks.

337
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,263
How’s your studies, Sevi?

338
00:22:15,045 --> 00:22:16,338
You’re graduating soon?

339
00:22:16,489 --> 00:22:18,324
Yes, sir, but...

340
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:20,601
I’m scared that I might jinx it.

341
00:22:21,237 --> 00:22:22,529
You’ll be fine.

342
00:22:23,246 --> 00:22:27,250
I heard you’re doing well,
balancing sports and studies…

343
00:22:27,643 --> 00:22:29,103
Do your best this season.

344
00:22:29,588 --> 00:22:30,588
Thank you.

345
00:22:30,971 --> 00:22:32,055
Thank you, sir.

346
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:48,338
Cheers!

347
00:22:48,805 --> 00:22:49,848
Here you go, Ely.

348
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:51,104
Thank you.

349
00:22:51,566 --> 00:22:52,275
Cheers!

350
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,412
Cheers!

351
00:22:53,523 --> 00:22:54,527
To your birthday.

352
00:22:54,552 --> 00:22:56,311
To my birthday!

353
00:22:56,378 --> 00:23:00,300
So, how did it feel to dance
with Camero?

354
00:23:01,527 --> 00:23:03,488
Who the hell was that stranger?

355
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,788
Stranger?

356
00:23:05,813 --> 00:23:09,234
Babe, he’s the captain of the
Panthers basketball team.

357
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:10,260
Don’t you remember?

358
00:23:10,285 --> 00:23:12,328
We lost to them, like, last season.

359
00:23:12,353 --> 00:23:15,377
Yes and he’s like, hot and popular.
How could you not know him?

360
00:23:15,378 --> 00:23:16,378
True.

361
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:19,502
I’m just going to the restroom, Ely.

362
00:23:19,527 --> 00:23:21,145
- I’ll come with you.
- See you.

363
00:23:24,595 --> 00:23:26,764
Hello, Ely. Happy birthday.

364
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:29,333
And I’m really sorry about
what happened earlier.

365
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:30,651
It was an emergency.

366
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:32,053
I told Sevi

367
00:23:32,413 --> 00:23:35,958
to cover for me if I’m not back
by the time my name is called.

368
00:23:37,189 --> 00:23:38,774
Do you guys know each other already?

369
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:43,755
No, and I’m not interested.

370
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,093
Sevi, this is Elyse, the debutante.

371
00:23:47,118 --> 00:23:49,244
And Elyse,
this is Sevi, my best friend.

372
00:23:49,245 --> 00:23:50,633
Yeah, I don’t care.

373
00:23:52,033 --> 00:23:53,492
She’s got an attitude, bro.

374
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:56,020
Let it go.
She’s still young.

375
00:23:56,677 --> 00:23:58,011
I figured.

376
00:23:58,482 --> 00:24:01,109
Kids these days have such an attitude.

377
00:24:10,494 --> 00:24:12,022
Excuse me,

378
00:24:12,355 --> 00:24:14,941
I’m not a kid anymore.

379
00:24:16,233 --> 00:24:17,943
I’m not a kid anymore.

380
00:24:18,543 --> 00:24:20,254
Are you mocking me?

381
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:21,279
Huh?

382
00:24:21,647 --> 00:24:22,608
Of course not.

383
00:24:22,633 --> 00:24:26,428
Why would I?
It’s your birthday so just smile already.

384
00:24:27,142 --> 00:24:29,937
Actually, my birthday was yesterday.

385
00:24:30,015 --> 00:24:31,099
Not today.

386
00:24:31,124 --> 00:24:34,020
Well then, belated happy birthday.

387
00:24:37,968 --> 00:24:39,025
Come on, bro.

388
00:24:39,373 --> 00:24:41,584
She looks like she’s about to
throw a punch.

389
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:42,694
Stop annoying her.

390
00:24:42,719 --> 00:24:44,971
Ely, we’ll go ahead.
See you.

391
00:24:44,996 --> 00:24:45,928
Come on.

392
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:47,246
You idiot.

393
00:24:50,141 --> 00:24:53,144
I never want to see that
annoying guy’s face ever again.

394
00:25:00,302 --> 00:25:01,302
God!

395
00:25:01,692 --> 00:25:06,113
Fuck them all for making me drink
that bad-tasting alcohol.

396
00:25:06,657 --> 00:25:07,867
I swear,

397
00:25:07,946 --> 00:25:11,336
I won’t ever drink again!

398
00:25:13,991 --> 00:25:15,416
Thank you...

399
00:25:15,676 --> 00:25:17,416
I see you had a lot to drink.

400
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:19,183
You again?

401
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:20,418
Let’s talk!

402
00:25:20,795 --> 00:25:22,422
I don't talk to drunks.

403
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:25,425
Hey, you!

404
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,105
We need to talk.

405
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,256
I said, I don’t want to.

406
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,429
What do you mean you don’t want to?

407
00:25:30,454 --> 00:25:31,454
Fuck...

408
00:25:48,687 --> 00:25:49,687
Hey!

409
00:25:49,993 --> 00:25:52,370
What happened to you?
You’re such an idiot.

410
00:25:52,731 --> 00:25:54,512
Moron, I was just dragged into this.

411
00:25:56,414 --> 00:25:59,017
- Ely! What happened?
- Be careful, bro.

412
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,289
Shit! You’re soaking wet.

413
00:26:02,807 --> 00:26:04,266
Hey, your cellphone.

414
00:26:04,448 --> 00:26:05,657
- Oh no!
- What happened?

415
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,961
Oh my god!

416
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:12,958
Well?

417
00:26:13,058 --> 00:26:15,492
Fuck, bro. It’s not turning on.

418
00:26:15,517 --> 00:26:16,518
Give it to me.

419
00:26:17,812 --> 00:26:18,853
Shit.

420
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:20,146
It’s okay.

421
00:26:20,396 --> 00:26:22,743
Just let it go.
You don’t have a girlfriend anyway.

422
00:26:22,768 --> 00:26:24,067
No one’s going to look for you.

423
00:26:25,377 --> 00:26:28,672
You’re such a dumbass.
You’re not helping.

424
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,858
Oh boy.

425
00:26:31,728 --> 00:26:33,188
Whose fault is it?

426
00:26:33,784 --> 00:26:34,910
Who else?

427
00:26:56,895 --> 00:26:58,021
He really is an athlete.

428
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,345
Ely, are you okay?

429
00:27:02,623 --> 00:27:03,999
Yes, I’m fine.

430
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:08,082
I’m sorry about your coat.

431
00:27:08,824 --> 00:27:10,951
But don’t worry about it,
I’ll have it dry-cleaned.

432
00:27:11,416 --> 00:27:14,868
And about your phone,
I have a spare one.

433
00:27:14,893 --> 00:27:16,144
I’ll give it to you.

434
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:18,549
No need.

435
00:27:18,842 --> 00:27:20,051
It’s okay.

436
00:27:20,586 --> 00:27:22,379
Happy birthday, Elisa.

437
00:27:22,644 --> 00:27:23,644
What?

438
00:27:24,105 --> 00:27:25,148
Elyse, bro.

439
00:27:27,249 --> 00:27:28,625
Happy birthday,

440
00:27:29,085 --> 00:27:30,093
Elyse bro.

441
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,491
Fucker…

442
00:27:34,516 --> 00:27:35,767
I’m sorry.

443
00:27:41,095 --> 00:27:42,095
God!

444
00:27:44,348 --> 00:27:45,516
Sevi!

445
00:27:47,141 --> 00:27:48,141
Took you long enough.

446
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,278
Here’s my old phone.

447
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:53,597
How did you break your phone anyway?

448
00:27:55,311 --> 00:27:57,480
Some drunk girl with an attitude...

449
00:27:57,505 --> 00:27:58,047
Yes?

450
00:27:58,072 --> 00:27:59,282
Pulled me into the pool.

451
00:27:59,307 --> 00:27:59,933
What?

452
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:02,293
So, my phone got wet.
Really pissed me off.

453
00:28:02,318 --> 00:28:03,695
That would piss anyone off.

454
00:28:04,345 --> 00:28:05,329
- Hey…
- Yes?

455
00:28:05,354 --> 00:28:06,480
Thanks.

456
00:28:06,671 --> 00:28:09,424
I might find some messages from...

457
00:28:09,449 --> 00:28:10,449
Hey!

458
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,489
Out of sight, out of mind. All gone.
Everything’s deleted.

459
00:28:15,514 --> 00:28:16,806
I remember nothing.

460
00:28:19,682 --> 00:28:20,933
Don’t go crying now.

461
00:28:21,064 --> 00:28:22,899
Of course not,
I’ll make you cry instead.

462
00:28:22,924 --> 00:28:24,509
Give the phone back.

463
00:28:24,534 --> 00:28:25,827
No can do, bro.

464
00:28:25,855 --> 00:28:26,938
No can do…

465
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:30,734
You should be asking that girl
to give you a new phone.

466
00:28:30,735 --> 00:28:32,028
Do you even know her?

467
00:28:34,514 --> 00:28:35,432
Anyway, I have to go.

468
00:28:35,457 --> 00:28:38,001
I might be late for my class.
Bye-bye!

469
00:28:39,311 --> 00:28:40,369
Sure, thanks.

470
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,913
Be careful with that.

471
00:28:42,493 --> 00:28:44,036
Ely, focus.

472
00:28:45,305 --> 00:28:46,848
Lock your knees.

473
00:28:48,156 --> 00:28:50,367
Look straight, smile.

474
00:28:53,912 --> 00:28:55,539
Guys, that’s enough.
Bring her down.

475
00:28:55,564 --> 00:28:56,815
Bring her down.

476
00:28:59,376 --> 00:29:00,376
Ely…

477
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,260
Ely...

478
00:29:02,395 --> 00:29:03,395
you’re good?

479
00:29:04,858 --> 00:29:06,067
Everyone, listen.

480
00:29:06,092 --> 00:29:07,844
Get back in five, okay?
Water break.

481
00:29:08,314 --> 00:29:09,398
Yes, Coach.

482
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:10,233
Louder.

483
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:12,235
Yes, Coach!

484
00:29:54,633 --> 00:29:56,386
Why would he follow me, though?

485
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:02,677
Hey!

486
00:30:02,702 --> 00:30:03,911
That’s Camero.

487
00:30:04,465 --> 00:30:05,758
Why are you stalking him?

488
00:30:06,143 --> 00:30:07,436
I’m not stalking him.

489
00:30:08,499 --> 00:30:11,739
Ely’s actually stalking the enemy.

490
00:30:11,764 --> 00:30:14,892
I told you, I’m not.
I just clicked it accidentally.

491
00:30:14,917 --> 00:30:18,254
Okay, if you say so.

492
00:30:32,523 --> 00:30:36,318
He is so weird.
Like why did he follow me?

493
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:37,595
We’re not even close.

494
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,240
Raya even saw me checking his account.

495
00:30:41,265 --> 00:30:42,863
She thought I was stalking him.

496
00:30:42,887 --> 00:30:45,687
They might think that
I have a crush on him.

497
00:30:45,712 --> 00:30:47,588
Like eww, no.

498
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:48,823
What’s wrong with that?

499
00:30:49,002 --> 00:30:52,881
He’s actually hot and good-looking.

500
00:30:53,113 --> 00:30:55,490
No, he’s annoying as fuck!

501
00:30:55,515 --> 00:30:58,276
I don’t want the team to think
that I’m a traitor or something.

502
00:30:58,301 --> 00:31:01,179
Ida, you know that this is a
big deal for me.

503
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:03,947
Maybe, you’re the only one
thinking it’s a big deal.

504
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:08,082
Because you’re so dramatic.

505
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:09,937
I’m not!

506
00:31:10,831 --> 00:31:12,373
Here are your drinks, ma’am.

507
00:31:13,821 --> 00:31:14,822
Thank you.

508
00:31:16,711 --> 00:31:17,711
Ma’am, I’m so sorry.

509
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:19,611
Shi...

510
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,168
My bag!

511
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:22,681
Ma’am, I’m so sorry.

512
00:31:22,705 --> 00:31:23,591
- My bag—
- I didn’t mean to.

513
00:31:23,616 --> 00:31:25,618
Oh no, that’s your dad’s gift, right?

514
00:31:25,861 --> 00:31:27,679
- I’ll wipe it clean, ma’am—
- Ma’am?

515
00:31:28,149 --> 00:31:29,651
It’s okay.

516
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,725
Ma’am, I’m really sorry.
Let me wipe it off, ma’am.

517
00:31:31,749 --> 00:31:33,583
Stop, it’s only getting worse.

518
00:31:33,584 --> 00:31:35,211
It’s okay, it’s okay.

519
00:31:35,288 --> 00:31:36,123
I’m really sorry.

520
00:31:36,148 --> 00:31:38,734
Your bag is worth $3,000, Ely.

521
00:31:41,545 --> 00:31:43,338
Ma’am, I can’t pay for that.

522
00:31:43,363 --> 00:31:45,157
I don’t have that kind of money, ma’am.

523
00:31:45,438 --> 00:31:47,553
I’m really sorry.
I really didn’t mean for this to happen.

524
00:31:47,577 --> 00:31:50,517
Ma’am, I’m so sorry. I’m really sorry...

525
00:31:50,518 --> 00:31:52,776
I’m not asking you to pay for my bag.

526
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:55,695
Just please, be careful next time.

527
00:31:57,089 --> 00:31:58,507
All right, ma’am. Thank you.

528
00:31:58,748 --> 00:31:59,665
I’m really sorry.

529
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,649
It’s okay, just...

530
00:32:00,674 --> 00:32:02,176
Just bring out our coffee, please.

531
00:32:02,201 --> 00:32:03,202
Okay, ma’am.

532
00:32:03,227 --> 00:32:04,603
I’m sorry, ma’am. Sir…

533
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:07,827
I’m so sorry.

534
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:13,059
Oh my god…

535
00:32:13,828 --> 00:32:15,538
Are you sure you’re really okay?

536
00:32:15,588 --> 00:32:17,215
Of course, I’m not okay.

537
00:32:17,378 --> 00:32:19,005
This is my baby!

538
00:32:21,633 --> 00:32:23,093
Ida, I’m so down.

539
00:32:23,988 --> 00:32:25,406
Let’s go shopping?

540
00:32:25,968 --> 00:32:26,844
I’ll have to pass.

541
00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:29,465
Mom’s been a bit strict about
my spendings lately.

542
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,343
What if…

543
00:32:35,793 --> 00:32:38,691
we use this, instead?

544
00:32:39,568 --> 00:32:41,403
Won’t your dad get mad?

545
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,977
No, I don’t think so.
It’s still my birthday after all.

546
00:32:45,842 --> 00:32:48,357
Oh, to be a Ledezma.

547
00:32:52,788 --> 00:32:56,124
Hi, bring my shopping bags
to my room, okay?

548
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:57,125
Yes, ma’am.

549
00:33:00,671 --> 00:33:01,671
Hi Mommy.

550
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:03,215
Are you okay?

551
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:05,134
Are you not feeling well?

552
00:33:05,343 --> 00:33:06,343
What’s wrong?

553
00:33:07,637 --> 00:33:09,930
- I’m fine.
- Do you need me to take you to the E.R.?

554
00:33:09,931 --> 00:33:11,515
No.

555
00:33:12,516 --> 00:33:15,978
It’s just a headache.
I’ll take some medicine.

556
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:18,356
Are you sure?

557
00:33:18,856 --> 00:33:20,733
Yes. I’m good.

558
00:33:21,484 --> 00:33:24,362
Don’t worry.
I just had a big meeting.

559
00:33:24,528 --> 00:33:26,906
And I got tired.

560
00:33:27,698 --> 00:33:30,076
Don’t worry
I’ll be fine. I’m okay.

561
00:33:31,869 --> 00:33:34,829
Mom, please take care of your
health, okay?

562
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:37,541
Don’t tire yourself too much.

563
00:33:37,917 --> 00:33:39,834
You know it’s not good for you.

564
00:33:39,835 --> 00:33:43,130
I know, you are so cute when
you’re worried about me.

565
00:33:43,714 --> 00:33:45,257
Like I said, don’t worry.

566
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:46,884
I’m fine.

567
00:33:51,013 --> 00:33:52,013
Okay.

568
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:57,603
Well, I did bring you
and Daddy some cookies.

569
00:33:58,229 --> 00:34:01,357
See, you’re the sweetest.

570
00:34:01,941 --> 00:34:04,109
Now my headache is gone.

571
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:04,944
Love you.

572
00:34:04,945 --> 00:34:06,362
I love you.

573
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,092
You don’t talk to me like that, Shan.

574
00:34:10,574 --> 00:34:12,702
How dare you disrespect me!
You’re so ungrateful.

575
00:34:21,877 --> 00:34:22,877
Hi, Dad!

576
00:34:23,254 --> 00:34:27,133
I bought some cookies,
do you want me to go get you some?

577
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,555
Elyse, I just saw the maids.

578
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:35,391
They were carrying a lot of shopping bags.

579
00:34:35,943 --> 00:34:37,611
You spent a fortune again?

580
00:34:38,847 --> 00:34:40,307
That…

581
00:34:41,532 --> 00:34:42,532
Daddy,

582
00:34:42,631 --> 00:34:46,484
a waiter spilled coffee on my bag
and it got ruined.

583
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:47,611
I’m sorry.

584
00:34:48,696 --> 00:34:54,035
But, it’s okay ‘cause I went shopping
to go buy a new one instead.

585
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:58,748
What’s the name of the cafe?

586
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:02,578
No, it’s okay, Daddy.

587
00:35:02,603 --> 00:35:05,462
I bought a new one anyway and...

588
00:35:05,463 --> 00:35:07,089
- the waiter apologized.
- No...

589
00:35:07,798 --> 00:35:09,425
It’s not okay, dear.

590
00:35:10,718 --> 00:35:12,386
The waiter should learn his lesson.

591
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:13,678
Remember,

592
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:15,663
you should not tolerate
mistakes like that,

593
00:35:15,688 --> 00:35:17,065
no matter how small it is.

594
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:21,715
Everything has its price,
including forgiveness.

595
00:35:22,252 --> 00:35:24,254
So, what’s the name of the cafe?

596
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:31,530
Urban Brew, Dad.

597
00:35:32,081 --> 00:35:33,603
Urban Brew...

598
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,794
Hello, Selene.

599
00:35:41,645 --> 00:35:43,272
Can you look for Urban Brew?

600
00:35:44,835 --> 00:35:45,835
Yes.

601
00:35:46,003 --> 00:35:50,341
Call them and look for the waiter who
spilled coffee on my daughter’s bag.

602
00:35:50,633 --> 00:35:52,426
Make sure he pays for it.

603
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,847
And if he can’t,
make sure they fire him.

604
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:11,413
I should not have mentioned it to Dad.

605
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:23,356
@sevirous:
I need my coat.

606
00:36:24,959 --> 00:36:29,338
Is this why he followed me?
Just to get his damn coat?

607
00:36:31,781 --> 00:36:35,994
@elydezma: Okay, I can deliver
it to you or you can get it from me.

608
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:38,438
When do you need it?

609
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:46,470
@sevirous: We’re playing against
each other next game on Saturday, right?

610
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,997
I'll just get it then. Will you be there?

611
00:36:49,022 --> 00:36:50,274
Duh.

612
00:36:50,734 --> 00:36:52,444
@elydezma:
DUH.

613
00:36:57,741 --> 00:36:59,577
@

614
00:37:01,384 --> 00:37:04,345
Does this mean that
I have to see his face again?

615
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:09,011
@sevirous:
Tell your basketball team, good luck!

616
00:37:09,036 --> 00:37:10,730
@sevirous:
They better do their best, LOL XD.

617
00:37:10,754 --> 00:37:11,691
Wow,

618
00:37:11,716 --> 00:37:15,053
I can’t even—
He is so full of himself.

619
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:37,422
Hey, Elisa.

620
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,646
Did you bring my coat?

621
00:37:40,912 --> 00:37:42,580
Why would I have your coat?

622
00:37:42,698 --> 00:37:44,366
I didn’t even know
you were gonna be here.

623
00:37:47,426 --> 00:37:50,279
Wait, are you stalking me?

624
00:37:51,745 --> 00:37:52,830
Admit it!

625
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:56,787
Come on,
if you have a crush on me,

626
00:37:56,865 --> 00:38:01,536
I’m sorry but you won't win me over
with stuff like that.

627
00:38:01,561 --> 00:38:03,939
First, you followed me here.

628
00:38:03,964 --> 00:38:06,133
You even followed my IG account...

629
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:09,452
and sent me a message
just to get your coat.

630
00:38:09,477 --> 00:38:11,813
If I know,
that was just an excuse to...

631
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:17,863
Huh? What did you say?

632
00:38:18,382 --> 00:38:19,382
Elisa?

633
00:38:21,822 --> 00:38:23,156
It’s Elyse.

634
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:38,281
Whatever, Luna.
You’re crazy.

635
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:41,053
You’re toast!

636
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,660
All right already,
I’m still in the gym.

637
00:38:44,318 --> 00:38:45,318
Okay.

638
00:38:46,644 --> 00:38:48,604
Luna? Who’s that?

639
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,922
None of my business.

640
00:39:04,879 --> 00:39:05,964
Where are you going?

641
00:39:05,989 --> 00:39:07,073
Why are you asking?

642
00:39:07,327 --> 00:39:08,706
We’re not friends.

643
00:39:08,731 --> 00:39:10,483
I’m going to the mall to eat breakfast.

644
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:13,936
So, why did you answer?

645
00:39:16,089 --> 00:39:17,089
Let’s get breakfast!

646
00:39:17,711 --> 00:39:18,879
Stay there...

647
00:39:18,904 --> 00:39:20,624
and wait for me.
I’ll just take a shower.

648
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,067
Wait for me, okay?

649
00:39:33,615 --> 00:39:36,576
He's really making me wait.

650
00:39:36,601 --> 00:39:40,188
Who does he think he is,
that I should join him for breakfast?

651
00:39:42,071 --> 00:39:44,657
Why the hell am I waiting for that guy?

652
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:56,224
Welcome, everyone!

653
00:39:56,806 --> 00:40:00,888
Today, we have an exciting game
between two great teams!

654
00:40:00,919 --> 00:40:04,539
It's the Green Arrows'
physical and clamp-down defense

655
00:40:04,563 --> 00:40:08,953
facing off against the
Yellow Panthers' high-octane offense.

656
00:40:08,977 --> 00:40:12,078
It's going to be a wild and epic matchup!

657
00:40:12,626 --> 00:40:14,216
We stand as one!

658
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,032
Green Arrows, get it done!

659
00:40:30,871 --> 00:40:34,040
Roar! We’re Panthers,
we are always the best!

660
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:37,126
Fight and win, we never rest!

661
00:40:37,127 --> 00:40:40,297
Roar! We’re Panthers, we are the best!

662
00:41:02,528 --> 00:41:04,655
Go, Sevi!

663
00:41:06,657 --> 00:41:08,033
Go, Sevi!

664
00:41:12,532 --> 00:41:15,945
Damn. Camero is so hot.

665
00:41:20,764 --> 00:41:21,767
He’s okay.

666
00:41:21,792 --> 00:41:23,616
But he’s our enemy so...

667
00:41:23,641 --> 00:41:24,365
Still!

668
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,268
That doesn’t stop me
from appreciating his gorgeousness.

669
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,530
Go, Camero!

670
00:41:30,713 --> 00:41:32,214
Go, Sevi!

671
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,159
You’re so hot!

672
00:41:35,184 --> 00:41:37,227
We love you!

673
00:41:40,774 --> 00:41:42,276
Can I get a kiss?

674
00:41:43,944 --> 00:41:45,311
You’re all embarrassing!

675
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,071
Oh, really?

676
00:41:46,096 --> 00:41:47,973
Don’t you dare lose or I’ll punch you!

677
00:41:48,532 --> 00:41:50,409
Go, Sevi!

678
00:41:50,534 --> 00:41:53,337
Hey, you’re still treating us to
snacks after this.

679
00:41:53,362 --> 00:41:55,155
We’ll keep cheering for you!

680
00:41:59,498 --> 00:42:01,292
You're the best, Sevi!

681
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:11,762
Okay, let’s all just calm down.

682
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:14,975
We’ve been practicing,
so just stay confident.

683
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,336
But most importantly,
let’s enjoy the game.

684
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,521
- Yes, Captain!
- Of course...

685
00:42:20,522 --> 00:42:22,328
Let’s win for the Panthers.

686
00:42:22,352 --> 00:42:23,042
Yes, Captain!

687
00:42:23,066 --> 00:42:25,319
Okay? Panthers on three!

688
00:42:26,778 --> 00:42:28,513
One, two, three...

689
00:42:28,538 --> 00:42:29,542
- Panthers!
- Panthers!

690
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:30,572
Let’s go!

691
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:14,351
Defense!

692
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:28,896
Hey!

693
00:43:29,049 --> 00:43:30,049
What was that?

694
00:43:35,342 --> 00:43:36,428
That’s a foul!

695
00:43:37,099 --> 00:43:40,602
Boo!

696
00:43:42,563 --> 00:43:44,898
Boo!

697
00:43:45,399 --> 00:43:45,941
Boo!

698
00:43:45,942 --> 00:43:47,061
Go, Sevi!

699
00:43:47,093 --> 00:43:48,552
Sevi, you can do it!

700
00:43:56,443 --> 00:44:01,708
Boo!

701
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:04,590
Boo!

702
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,990
Boo!

703
00:44:32,029 --> 00:44:34,948
Defense!

704
00:44:36,491 --> 00:44:38,118
Defense!

705
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,349
Defense!

706
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:09,858
Defense!

707
00:45:18,826 --> 00:45:19,943
Too bad...

708
00:45:37,807 --> 00:45:39,928
Well, I get the appeal.

709
00:45:45,145 --> 00:45:46,995
But he’s still full of himself.

710
00:45:53,848 --> 00:45:55,516
Yes!

711
00:45:57,155 --> 00:45:58,824
For the win, Camero!

712
00:46:00,409 --> 00:46:02,618
You kept missing.
Camero my ass.

713
00:46:02,619 --> 00:46:03,619
You want me to be perfect?

714
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,871
- No missed shots?
- You had some free throws that you missed.

715
00:46:05,872 --> 00:46:07,791
I’ll treat you later,
what do you want?

716
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:09,083
- Wow!
- Beef and egg fried rice.

717
00:46:09,084 --> 00:46:11,086
Beef and egg fried rice,
what else?

718
00:46:11,545 --> 00:46:13,171
Let’s talk later,
let me change first.

719
00:46:14,641 --> 00:46:15,641
Hey…

720
00:46:15,799 --> 00:46:17,175
Sorry, have you been waiting?

721
00:46:18,093 --> 00:46:19,504
No. uhm..

722
00:46:20,067 --> 00:46:21,152
Congratulations.

723
00:46:21,513 --> 00:46:22,514
Thanks.

724
00:46:25,183 --> 00:46:26,183
Here’s your coat.

725
00:46:26,435 --> 00:46:27,728
Hey, thank you.

726
00:46:28,437 --> 00:46:30,063
I thought you weren’t going to bring it.

727
00:46:31,857 --> 00:46:33,191
Got plans later?

728
00:46:33,817 --> 00:46:34,901
Why are you asking?

729
00:46:37,487 --> 00:46:38,572
No reason.

730
00:46:39,656 --> 00:46:41,467
No, I’m not going home.

731
00:46:41,867 --> 00:46:43,577
We still have some training to do.

732
00:46:46,969 --> 00:46:48,001
Okay, good luck.

733
00:46:48,498 --> 00:46:49,498
Break a leg.

734
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:52,794
How dare you!

735
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:53,962
Just kidding.

736
00:46:53,963 --> 00:46:55,129
Hey, Sevirous!

737
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:56,900
Stop flirting already.

738
00:46:57,404 --> 00:46:58,341
- You’re too noisy…
- Come on!

739
00:46:58,341 --> 00:46:59,259
I’m hungry!

740
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:00,551
Let’s go!

741
00:47:00,552 --> 00:47:01,761
- I’m hungry!
- Wait a minute.

742
00:47:01,762 --> 00:47:03,162
I’m not going to treat you anymore!

743
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,683
I’ll go.

744
00:47:09,853 --> 00:47:10,853
Okay, take care.

745
00:47:11,772 --> 00:47:13,064
Again, break a leg.

746
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,151
- Well, Sevirous?
- You guys are so noisy.

747
00:47:17,152 --> 00:47:17,944
Let’s go!

748
00:47:17,945 --> 00:47:20,112
- Wait, I still need to change.
- You don’t have to.

749
00:47:20,113 --> 00:47:22,240
You’ll still stink even if you change.

750
00:47:22,991 --> 00:47:24,910
- Fuck you!
- Back to you!

751
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:32,793
Hey, Elisa!

752
00:47:35,499 --> 00:47:36,499
Such a snob.

753
00:47:38,206 --> 00:47:39,582
Because that’s not my name.

754
00:47:41,259 --> 00:47:42,594
Let’s have breakfast?

755
00:47:43,345 --> 00:47:44,930
Breakfast, my ass.

756
00:47:45,722 --> 00:47:47,974
Oh you’re naughty.

757
00:47:49,418 --> 00:47:50,669
Come on, let’s eat.

758
00:47:50,694 --> 00:47:52,694
There's a good beef and egg fried rice
dish nearby.

759
00:47:52,896 --> 00:47:55,190
Huh? What’s that?

760
00:47:55,357 --> 00:47:56,857
You don’t know that?

761
00:47:56,858 --> 00:47:58,401
Cured beef with fried rice and egg?

762
00:47:58,777 --> 00:47:59,777
It’s good.

763
00:47:59,778 --> 00:48:01,029
Come on, I’ll treat you.

764
00:48:01,863 --> 00:48:03,031
I have money.

765
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:05,492
But, you’ll come with me?

766
00:48:12,372 --> 00:48:13,665
That’s too bad.

767
00:48:14,042 --> 00:48:17,002
You were already in your fourth year,
why did you stop your police studies?

768
00:48:17,003 --> 00:48:20,047
Yes, ‘cause I had to start working.

769
00:48:20,048 --> 00:48:22,050
- So, you got married?
- Yes.

770
00:48:23,975 --> 00:48:25,184
What’s up?

771
00:48:30,308 --> 00:48:32,893
- You had a little more time left.
- Yes.

772
00:48:32,894 --> 00:48:36,677
Maybe if I can save up,
I can work and study...

773
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:45,489
Ouch!

774
00:49:21,943 --> 00:49:25,029
Ladies and gentlemen,
please join me

775
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:27,656
in extending our warmest welcome

776
00:49:27,657 --> 00:49:29,617
to our very beautiful debutante,

777
00:49:29,618 --> 00:49:33,413
Miss Amora Elyse Ledezma.

778
00:50:06,738 --> 00:50:08,198
Is she your type?

779
00:50:09,369 --> 00:50:11,121
I don’t like rich girls.

780
00:50:11,468 --> 00:50:12,677
They’re too snobbish.

781
00:50:13,448 --> 00:50:14,616
Okay.

782
00:51:01,155 --> 00:51:03,775
I’m willing to bet on how good this is.

783
00:51:04,182 --> 00:51:07,524
It's already hot in here,
and you keep pissing me off.

784
00:51:07,549 --> 00:51:08,861
If this happens again,

785
00:51:08,886 --> 00:51:11,055
you’ll lose your job!

786
00:51:16,676 --> 00:51:17,767
Go, go, Sevi!

787
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:19,692
Don’t be too hard on our team!

788
00:51:20,453 --> 00:51:23,328
You won't be doing the dare if you
didn't have a crush on him.

789
00:51:26,626 --> 00:51:28,545
I already saw it even if you unliked it.

790
00:51:29,138 --> 00:51:30,640
Nice one, stalker!
