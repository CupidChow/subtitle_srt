1
00:00:11,365 --> 00:00:13,742
Never introduce
someone to your family

2
00:00:13,743 --> 00:00:17,245
unless you’re 100% sure
about the person.

3
00:00:17,246 --> 00:00:18,246
Dad...

4
00:00:18,456 --> 00:00:22,208
Sevi is my boyfriend.

5
00:00:22,209 --> 00:00:24,335
- Is that true?
- It's my fault that

6
00:00:24,336 --> 00:00:25,879
we didn't mention it right away.

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,964
You all fucking lied to my face!

8
00:00:27,965 --> 00:00:29,507
Let’s welcome back Elyse.

9
00:00:29,508 --> 00:00:31,259
She’s our new
marketing specialist.

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,260
Hi!

11
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:35,055
Austin.

12
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:37,057
Hi, nice to meet you.

13
00:00:37,058 --> 00:00:40,061
We’re about to celebrate
our third anniversary.

14
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:41,561
Right?

15
00:00:41,687 --> 00:00:42,980
Time flies.

16
00:00:43,564 --> 00:00:45,608
And because of that,
we’re going to Bohol.

17
00:02:20,703 --> 00:02:23,497
You need to eat a lot
so you’ll gain more energy.

18
00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:26,458
And more veggies.

19
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,252
You need more veggies.
I already told Lani

20
00:02:29,253 --> 00:02:32,131
to include fruits and veggies
in your meals all the time.

21
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,301
Love, don’t worry
about me. I’m fine.

22
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,761
Don’t worry, I eat healthy.

23
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:39,972
And...

24
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:42,390
And your meds!
Don’t forget your meds, okay?

25
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:44,434
I promise I will call you
every single night

26
00:02:44,435 --> 00:02:45,686
so you won’t forget.

27
00:02:46,353 --> 00:02:47,688
Thank you, Elyse.

28
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:52,651
By the way, Elyse,
how’s your condominium?

29
00:02:53,194 --> 00:02:54,444
You know, I checked the location

30
00:02:54,445 --> 00:02:56,989
and I don’t think
it’s the safest neighborhood.

31
00:02:57,615 --> 00:02:58,991
Don’t worry, Dad.

32
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,201
The area is pretty safe,

33
00:03:01,202 --> 00:03:03,662
plus the building
security is tight.

34
00:03:04,496 --> 00:03:06,540
How about your furniture?
Have you bought any?

35
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,374
We’re almost done.

36
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:12,504
Although we are still saving
for some big purchases.

37
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:17,175
Honey...

38
00:03:17,885 --> 00:03:19,553
I heard you

39
00:03:20,137 --> 00:03:22,056
sold some of your bags?

40
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:24,016
Hey,

41
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:26,434
if you need
financial help, don’t...

42
00:03:26,435 --> 00:03:28,562
Mommy, it’s fine.

43
00:03:29,271 --> 00:03:31,606
Selling my bag
was just a little sacrifice

44
00:03:31,607 --> 00:03:34,026
I had to make for
more important things.

45
00:03:35,486 --> 00:03:37,571
Plus, I’m a grown-up now.

46
00:03:38,572 --> 00:03:40,866
I will provide for myself.

47
00:03:41,825 --> 00:03:42,825
Okay?

48
00:03:43,118 --> 00:03:46,288
Plus, Sevi’s saving up too.

49
00:03:48,415 --> 00:03:49,415
Wow.

50
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,336
You really are growing already.

51
00:03:55,673 --> 00:03:57,633
Sevi makes me grow, Dad.

52
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,511
You know what...

53
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,055
I think it’s about time

54
00:04:03,847 --> 00:04:06,267
to promote you
as Director of Operations.

55
00:04:06,976 --> 00:04:07,976
Huh?

56
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:10,144
I need you to be hands-on

57
00:04:10,145 --> 00:04:13,232
in overseeing and managing
our hotels and resorts.

58
00:04:16,735 --> 00:04:19,153
Oh my god. Really, Dad?

59
00:04:19,154 --> 00:04:20,154
Yes.

60
00:04:20,948 --> 00:04:23,116
The executive
management discussed

61
00:04:23,117 --> 00:04:24,910
the promotion a few months ago.

62
00:04:25,244 --> 00:04:26,829
And I said,

63
00:04:27,705 --> 00:04:29,330
let’s give it three more months.

64
00:04:29,331 --> 00:04:31,040
I need to see firsthand

65
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:33,585
if you can handle the position.

66
00:04:34,878 --> 00:04:36,005
And...

67
00:04:36,964 --> 00:04:38,340
I think you’re ready now.

68
00:04:39,925 --> 00:04:42,594
And we’ve seen your
hard work and dedication.

69
00:04:43,512 --> 00:04:45,597
And you do deserve
that promotion.

70
00:04:46,765 --> 00:04:49,685
Finally a bigger salary.
I badly need this!

71
00:04:50,644 --> 00:04:53,271
Thank you, Mommy.
Thank you, Daddy.

72
00:04:53,272 --> 00:04:55,691
I promise,
I will work hard for this.

73
00:04:55,983 --> 00:04:57,026
You better.

74
00:04:58,694 --> 00:05:01,030
Congratulations, honey.
You deserve it.

75
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:03,490
Thank you, Mommy.

76
00:05:06,618 --> 00:05:07,745
By the way, Elyse...

77
00:05:09,246 --> 00:05:11,665
I’ll drop by your unit
one of these days.

78
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,961
You know, I just want to check
if you’re safe and secure, okay?

79
00:05:18,088 --> 00:05:19,673
Sure, Dad.

80
00:05:20,257 --> 00:05:22,676
Just inform me when.

81
00:05:23,802 --> 00:05:24,802
Sure.

82
00:05:26,597 --> 00:05:27,598
Let’s eat.

83
00:05:28,724 --> 00:05:30,142
I want to try this.

84
00:05:30,726 --> 00:05:32,518
Let’s eat. You want that?

85
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,520
Go ahead.

86
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:35,939
Pack these too, Lani.

87
00:05:42,488 --> 00:05:44,072
I’m going to miss this room.

88
00:05:44,073 --> 00:05:46,075
And of course you, Jewel.

89
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,243
Take care of Mommy, okay?

90
00:05:49,203 --> 00:05:50,203
Honey?

91
00:05:50,496 --> 00:05:51,663
Are you packed already?

92
00:05:53,123 --> 00:05:54,249
Yes, Mommy.

93
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,167
Are you sure you brought
everything you need?

94
00:05:56,168 --> 00:05:58,295
You packed everything?
Your toiletries,

95
00:05:58,462 --> 00:06:00,631
other clothes,
all your stuff? You sure?

96
00:06:01,006 --> 00:06:02,424
Yes, it’s all packed.

97
00:06:03,008 --> 00:06:04,008
Good.

98
00:06:04,635 --> 00:06:06,177
How about your documents?

99
00:06:06,178 --> 00:06:08,137
Your passport,
just in case of emergency.

100
00:06:08,138 --> 00:06:10,057
Mom, don’t worry.

101
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:11,892
I have everything I need.

102
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:17,106
You’re really leaving, huh?

103
00:06:20,317 --> 00:06:22,945
For so many years,
you’ve been beside me.

104
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,531
Mom!

105
00:06:26,657 --> 00:06:27,783
It’s not like

106
00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:30,076
I’m getting married yet.

107
00:06:30,077 --> 00:06:32,787
And I’m just leaving the house.

108
00:06:32,788 --> 00:06:35,206
And like I said,
I’ll call you every night

109
00:06:35,207 --> 00:06:37,167
and we can set up
weekly bondings.

110
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:39,293
You can call me anytime you want

111
00:06:39,294 --> 00:06:41,504
and we can even
meet up at the office

112
00:06:41,505 --> 00:06:43,173
and have lunch together.

113
00:06:44,716 --> 00:06:46,051
Well, I’m not worried.

114
00:06:47,469 --> 00:06:49,221
I’m just really happy for you.

115
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:51,431
You know,

116
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:53,808
Elyse, I could really see

117
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:55,269
how much you love him.

118
00:06:56,186 --> 00:06:57,770
I love you more, Mom.

119
00:06:57,771 --> 00:06:59,648
I will always love you more.

120
00:07:01,316 --> 00:07:02,316
Honey,

121
00:07:02,651 --> 00:07:05,195
you don’t have to
measure your love for us.

122
00:07:05,737 --> 00:07:08,031
I know you love us
both in different ways.

123
00:07:08,574 --> 00:07:11,577
I’m just really happy
that you found someone

124
00:07:12,244 --> 00:07:14,246
who loves you equally.

125
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,916
And who cares for you,
like I do.

126
00:07:19,501 --> 00:07:20,961
But promise me,

127
00:07:21,712 --> 00:07:23,130
learn how to cook.

128
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,006
Clean the house.

129
00:07:25,007 --> 00:07:26,550
Do the groceries.

130
00:07:27,176 --> 00:07:30,971
Save money. Try to be a bit
more independent, okay?

131
00:07:32,681 --> 00:07:33,682
Mommy…

132
00:07:36,518 --> 00:07:39,146
You know I’m not going
to live forever, right?

133
00:07:40,022 --> 00:07:42,357
Mommy, stop saying that.

134
00:07:43,609 --> 00:07:46,028
But I’ll always,
always be here for you.

135
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:49,031
Because I’m your mother.

136
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:53,744
Thank you for everything, Mommy.

137
00:07:55,287 --> 00:07:56,872
I love you so much.

138
00:07:57,372 --> 00:07:59,291
I love you very much.

139
00:08:18,352 --> 00:08:20,270
Good evening, ma’am.
Good evening.

140
00:08:20,521 --> 00:08:21,522
Good evening.

141
00:08:24,691 --> 00:08:26,526
I can take it from here, Roel.

142
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:28,737
You can go home.
Thank you.

143
00:08:29,112 --> 00:08:30,451
Are you sure, ma’am?

144
00:08:30,781 --> 00:08:32,783
Yes, thank you.

145
00:08:37,663 --> 00:08:39,915
Take care of yourself
always, Ma’am Elyse.

146
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,459
You too, Roel.
Take care always.

147
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,461
And

148
00:08:45,212 --> 00:08:47,922
I hope it’s still okay
that I can request for you

149
00:08:47,923 --> 00:08:50,216
to give me a ride
from time to time.

150
00:08:50,217 --> 00:08:51,529
Of course, ma’am.

151
00:08:51,718 --> 00:08:55,138
Just message me,
and I’ll come right away.

152
00:08:57,307 --> 00:08:58,391
Thank you.

153
00:08:58,392 --> 00:09:00,310
- All right, then.
- I’ll see you.

154
00:09:03,063 --> 00:09:04,981
Ida! Look!

155
00:09:04,982 --> 00:09:07,441
This is our kitchen.
Isn’t it cute?

156
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:10,236
This is where I’ll be
cooking delicious meals.

157
00:09:10,237 --> 00:09:11,947
Really now?

158
00:09:13,282 --> 00:09:16,242
And this is our living room,

159
00:09:16,243 --> 00:09:18,744
and that’s our sofa.
It’s so nice, right?

160
00:09:18,745 --> 00:09:22,193
Girl, your unit looks so dope.

161
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:25,084
Make sure the
guest room is ready, okay?

162
00:09:25,085 --> 00:09:27,670
So I have a place to sleep when
I come back to Manila.

163
00:09:27,671 --> 00:09:29,420
We don’t have a guest room yet,

164
00:09:29,548 --> 00:09:30,882
but that is my next project.

165
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:33,759
I miss you already.

166
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,885
When I get a free schedule,

167
00:09:34,886 --> 00:09:37,139
I will fly to the U.S.
and visit you.

168
00:09:37,472 --> 00:09:39,170
I miss you too, Ely.

169
00:09:39,308 --> 00:09:41,601
Please visit me here,

170
00:09:41,602 --> 00:09:45,771
and make sure to bring Sevi.
I’ll take you guys around.

171
00:09:45,772 --> 00:09:48,733
Okay. I love you!
Take care. Bye, girl!

172
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:51,153
Babe! Have you seen the bed?

173
00:09:51,653 --> 00:09:54,155
Of course!
It’s beautiful, right?

174
00:09:54,156 --> 00:09:57,325
I told you that bed
is a very great investment.

175
00:09:57,326 --> 00:10:00,662
Yes, it’s nice. That’s also
why we’re broke now.

176
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,625
Don’t worry about it.
It’s worth it anyway.

177
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,501
Fine.

178
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,545
Then,

179
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:11,590
next on the list is a car.

180
00:10:12,174 --> 00:10:17,346
I’m thinking of buying
Luna's old car.

181
00:10:18,388 --> 00:10:19,389
Why?

182
00:10:22,017 --> 00:10:23,403
It’s a hassle to commute.

183
00:10:23,477 --> 00:10:25,329
And there’s always traffic.

184
00:10:25,646 --> 00:10:28,523
My boss is strict
about people being late.

185
00:10:29,274 --> 00:10:31,859
Why don’t you buy a new car?

186
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,155
Or you could even borrow
one of our family cars.

187
00:10:35,364 --> 00:10:38,074
We have three extra cars
that aren’t being used.

188
00:10:38,075 --> 00:10:39,618
I’m sure Dad won’t mind.

189
00:10:40,202 --> 00:10:42,120
I can’t afford
a brand-new one yet.

190
00:10:42,704 --> 00:10:46,583
And I don’t want to
use your family’s car.

191
00:10:47,584 --> 00:10:50,629
It’s still better if I work
hard to buy my own.

192
00:10:51,797 --> 00:10:55,509
Besides, I’m okay with
a second-hand car.

193
00:10:56,843 --> 00:10:58,303
One day,

194
00:11:01,473 --> 00:11:03,517
I’ll be able to buy
a brand-new car.

195
00:11:04,393 --> 00:11:09,606
But for now, my focus is
on saving for our condo.

196
00:11:11,441 --> 00:11:12,651
Sev…

197
00:11:13,819 --> 00:11:17,154
And I’m also trying
to impress my bosses.

198
00:11:17,155 --> 00:11:19,908
I’m putting in my best effort
at work so I can get promoted.

199
00:11:20,826 --> 00:11:23,286
You’re such
a dependable man, Sevi.

200
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:26,289
I’m so lucky to have you.

201
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,295
I'm luckier to have you, Elyse.

202
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,718
Wait!
Speaking of promotion…

203
00:11:39,136 --> 00:11:42,054
Sev, I just got promoted

204
00:11:42,055 --> 00:11:44,349
to the Director of Operations.

205
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,101
Wow!

206
00:11:46,435 --> 00:11:48,894
Ely, congrats!

207
00:11:48,895 --> 00:11:50,981
- Thank you.
- You’re amazing.

208
00:11:51,273 --> 00:11:53,817
All your sleepless nights
have paid off.

209
00:11:57,028 --> 00:11:58,280
I’m so happy for you.

210
00:11:58,905 --> 00:12:00,157
You deserve it.

211
00:12:02,784 --> 00:12:04,995
And someday,

212
00:12:05,537 --> 00:12:09,458
when I become the company CEO,

213
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:13,628
I will hire you for
a big resort project.

214
00:12:14,588 --> 00:12:17,256
Won't I get bashed because

215
00:12:17,257 --> 00:12:18,883
the CEO has favoritism?

216
00:12:18,884 --> 00:12:21,511
Just because the engineer is
cute, they hired him right away?

217
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:25,682
Well, you’re not cute…

218
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:30,187
Because you’re very handsome.

219
00:12:35,484 --> 00:12:36,860
I promise, Ely,

220
00:12:37,444 --> 00:12:39,112
we’ll achieve

221
00:12:39,738 --> 00:12:41,990
our dreams together.

222
00:13:09,226 --> 00:13:10,602
Elyse…

223
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:12,896
You're going to be late…

224
00:13:17,609 --> 00:13:21,196
Elyse!
I said wake up already.

225
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,034
Okay, I’m awake.

226
00:13:29,955 --> 00:13:32,706
Should we skip work today?

227
00:13:32,707 --> 00:13:34,251
Tempting.

228
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,338
But we have a lot bills to pay.

229
00:13:40,632 --> 00:13:44,177
I think we shouldn’t
skip work today.

230
00:13:46,471 --> 00:13:48,056
Five more minutes.

231
00:13:53,895 --> 00:13:55,605
Sevi, look!

232
00:13:56,106 --> 00:13:57,732
Isn’t it cute?

233
00:13:59,192 --> 00:14:01,361
It’s cute,
kinda like a scarecrow.

234
00:14:02,362 --> 00:14:03,696
Just kidding.

235
00:14:03,697 --> 00:14:04,697
It’s cute.

236
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,616
Here, taste it, quick.

237
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,835
You’re just like
these scrambled eggs,

238
00:14:17,043 --> 00:14:18,044
so sweet.

239
00:14:19,045 --> 00:14:20,629
You put sugar in it, didn’t you?

240
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,630
Huh?

241
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:33,351
Silly…

242
00:14:34,436 --> 00:14:36,605
I’m sorry, I’ll cook another...

243
00:14:37,731 --> 00:14:40,900
No need.
We shouldn’t waste food.

244
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:44,988
Besides, sweet
scrambled eggs are fine.

245
00:14:45,572 --> 00:14:46,573
As long as you made it.

246
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:50,660
You have to eat it.

247
00:14:57,667 --> 00:15:00,795
Sev, use a cup.
We need to conserve water.

248
00:15:01,922 --> 00:15:04,423
So we’re conserving water, huh?

249
00:15:04,424 --> 00:15:06,843
We should take
a shower together then.

250
00:15:08,595 --> 00:15:11,514
You really need to shower.
Your hair smells.

251
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:15,643
Babe! Here are some
snacks for you.

252
00:15:15,644 --> 00:15:18,771
I have fruits for you
and then some granola bars.

253
00:15:18,772 --> 00:15:21,983
And here’s your cold
brew for energy, okay?

254
00:15:22,484 --> 00:15:25,736
Wow! You’re giving me
so much food,

255
00:15:25,737 --> 00:15:27,656
but I’ll just be
in the office today.

256
00:15:28,782 --> 00:15:30,116
Still…

257
00:15:30,492 --> 00:15:32,452
I don’t want you to go hungry.

258
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:35,997
You know,

259
00:15:36,623 --> 00:15:39,793
your love’s already
got me so full.

260
00:15:45,632 --> 00:15:49,344
Okay, babe.
We still need more hangers.

261
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:54,306
And this shelf,

262
00:15:54,307 --> 00:15:56,851
I’ll just take this spot.
The rest is all yours.

263
00:15:57,227 --> 00:15:58,561
Huh? Why?

264
00:15:59,562 --> 00:16:01,689
You have so many things.

265
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:03,565
All of this won't
fit in one room.

266
00:16:03,566 --> 00:16:04,818
You need a…

267
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:06,903
a whole department store.

268
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:10,823
I hate you! I already
got rid of a lot.

269
00:16:10,824 --> 00:16:12,908
Are you serious?
We need to cut down more.

270
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:14,452
Because it really won’t fit.

271
00:16:14,786 --> 00:16:16,662
- Huh?
- Just kidding.

272
00:16:16,663 --> 00:16:18,123
All right, I’ll help you.

273
00:16:18,581 --> 00:16:19,833
Okay.

274
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:22,002
So, how do we do this?

275
00:16:22,377 --> 00:16:23,378
Like this?

276
00:16:24,546 --> 00:16:27,382
Well— No, it needs
to stand like this.

277
00:16:29,134 --> 00:16:30,301
Wow!

278
00:16:30,802 --> 00:16:32,178
ElVi, huh?

279
00:16:33,513 --> 00:16:35,140
That’s our couple name now.

280
00:16:36,391 --> 00:16:39,602
We’ll watch shows here
in our shared account.

281
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,856
So don’t watch our favorite
series without me, okay?

282
00:16:43,857 --> 00:16:45,900
Of course, I’ll wait for you.

283
00:16:46,651 --> 00:16:48,153
Okay, good.

284
00:16:52,782 --> 00:16:54,033
What do you want to watch?

285
00:16:54,034 --> 00:16:55,367
Let’s go with that.

286
00:16:55,368 --> 00:16:57,287
Yes, that sounds good.

287
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,553
Thank you.

288
00:17:20,894 --> 00:17:22,770
- Good morning, Miss Ledezma.
- Good morning, Miss Ledezma.

289
00:17:22,771 --> 00:17:23,812
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

290
00:17:23,813 --> 00:17:26,524
- Good morning, ma’am.
- Good morning, Miss Ledezma.

291
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,801
- Good morning, Miss Ledezma.
- Good morning.

292
00:17:35,778 --> 00:17:38,118
@sevirous: Babe! Good luck
on your first day

293
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:43,457
as Director of Operations!
I know you’ve got this!

294
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,575
@sevirous:
But take it easy, okay?

295
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,837
Don’t get too stressed!
Come home early.

296
00:17:48,838 --> 00:17:51,716
I’ll cook soup
and steak for you!

297
00:17:52,258 --> 00:17:59,390
But we need to go grocery
shopping first. I love you!

298
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:12,861
@elydezma:
Thank you, babe.

299
00:18:12,862 --> 00:18:14,863
I love you too.
See you later!

300
00:18:14,864 --> 00:18:22,079
Let’s meet at the grocery,
Also, no dessert?

301
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:29,712
@sevirous: We can have some,
or I could be your dessert.

302
00:18:35,802 --> 00:18:37,846
Is this from Sevi?

303
00:18:57,157 --> 00:18:58,700
You like the flowers?

304
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:02,745
They’re from me.

305
00:19:04,747 --> 00:19:05,748
Thanks.

306
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:13,548
Wow!

307
00:19:14,424 --> 00:19:16,217
Congratulations.

308
00:19:16,926 --> 00:19:20,929
Director of Operations.

309
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,766
You know, I kind of
expected this promotion.

310
00:19:24,392 --> 00:19:27,896
Because, well,
your dad is the CEO.

311
00:19:29,189 --> 00:19:32,066
Don’t get me wrong.
But still, congratulations.

312
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,651
Congratulations.

313
00:19:35,361 --> 00:19:37,405
What the fuck is he implying?

314
00:19:38,948 --> 00:19:40,241
Thanks.

315
00:19:40,658 --> 00:19:44,517
You know, it’s good to know that
our company runs on meritocracy.

316
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:46,705
But in case you missed the news,

317
00:19:46,706 --> 00:19:49,291
the properties that
I managed last year

318
00:19:49,292 --> 00:19:51,252
were the top
financial performers.

319
00:19:52,086 --> 00:19:53,175
Okay.

320
00:19:53,588 --> 00:19:55,298
Okay, all right. Chill.

321
00:19:55,798 --> 00:19:56,984
I got your point.

322
00:19:57,091 --> 00:20:00,470
But you don’t have
to get defensive.

323
00:20:02,764 --> 00:20:05,307
Still, you can’t deny
the fact that

324
00:20:05,308 --> 00:20:07,935
your dad is the
CEO of this company,

325
00:20:07,936 --> 00:20:11,813
which is why your position
is higher than the others.

326
00:20:11,814 --> 00:20:13,358
Don’t be ashamed of that,

327
00:20:14,025 --> 00:20:15,276
especially with me.

328
00:20:16,569 --> 00:20:20,281
As for me, my current
position is VP.

329
00:20:20,823 --> 00:20:21,824
Why?

330
00:20:22,992 --> 00:20:26,120
Because I am my father’s son.

331
00:20:27,455 --> 00:20:31,626
You know, that’s how
it is for people like us.

332
00:20:32,794 --> 00:20:35,255
When is this guy
going to shut up?

333
00:20:42,345 --> 00:20:47,850
Do you know what
our dads were planning?

334
00:20:49,978 --> 00:20:51,396
They wanted

335
00:20:52,563 --> 00:20:54,315
for us to end up together.

336
00:20:54,691 --> 00:20:57,943
Too bad it didn’t push through.

337
00:20:57,944 --> 00:21:00,029
What a shame, ‘cause we
actually look good together.

338
00:21:01,781 --> 00:21:03,950
Where does he get his audacity?

339
00:21:07,996 --> 00:21:09,705
Are you done, Mr. Guerrero?

340
00:21:09,706 --> 00:21:12,083
Because I have
tons of work to do.

341
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,752
Are you happy with
your boyfriend, Elyse?

342
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:16,254
I heard

343
00:21:17,088 --> 00:21:18,589
you moved in with him.

344
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:22,176
Yes, I am very much
happy with him.

345
00:21:22,468 --> 00:21:24,178
Why are you prying?

346
00:21:26,472 --> 00:21:27,473
You know what,

347
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:32,228
the thing about
romantic relationships

348
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:35,940
they are so unpredictable.

349
00:21:36,482 --> 00:21:39,860
One day, you’re in love.

350
00:21:39,861 --> 00:21:41,237
The next...

351
00:21:43,364 --> 00:21:44,741
you will feel empty.

352
00:21:45,408 --> 00:21:47,618
What the fuck is wrong with you?

353
00:21:48,828 --> 00:21:51,497
Relax.
Sorry, I’m just saying.

354
00:21:51,956 --> 00:21:52,957
Well…

355
00:21:53,624 --> 00:21:55,668
Congratulations on
your new position.

356
00:21:56,753 --> 00:21:57,753
See you later.

357
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,506
What a jerk!

358
00:22:10,224 --> 00:22:14,354
We only have a few weeks before
the opening of our new hotel.

359
00:22:15,021 --> 00:22:20,317
Elyse, can you provide us an
update on our staff recruitment?

360
00:22:20,318 --> 00:22:22,527
Yes, I am happy to announce that

361
00:22:22,528 --> 00:22:25,822
we have secured a two-year
contract with Jean Lambert

362
00:22:25,823 --> 00:22:26,990
as our Head Chef.

363
00:22:26,991 --> 00:22:28,283
He is a big name in France

364
00:22:28,284 --> 00:22:31,078
so that will definitely
generate a lot of buzz online.

365
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:34,749
Good. Can you please
schedule our dry run?

366
00:22:36,042 --> 00:22:39,711
And also, how about
our supplies inventory?

367
00:22:39,712 --> 00:22:41,129
About that...

368
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:45,385
Our toiletry supplier did back
out of our contract last week.

369
00:22:47,345 --> 00:22:51,181
Everything needs to be all set
by next week, Miss Ledezma.

370
00:22:51,182 --> 00:22:54,184
If you need help, we have
Austin here who can help you

371
00:22:54,185 --> 00:22:57,563
go over any outstanding issues.

372
00:23:01,484 --> 00:23:03,069
So annoying.

373
00:23:05,488 --> 00:23:09,116
It’s okay, Mr. Guerrero.
I’ve already handled it.

374
00:23:09,117 --> 00:23:12,119
I’ve already secured
an interim arrangement

375
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,872
with a secondary supplier
for the next six months.

376
00:23:15,873 --> 00:23:18,041
In the meantime,
I will be able to find

377
00:23:18,042 --> 00:23:19,876
a long-term supplier soon.

378
00:23:19,877 --> 00:23:21,671
I already have
a shortlist of vendors.

379
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:40,856
Thank you.

380
00:23:40,857 --> 00:23:42,774
It’s such a hassle
to go grocery shopping

381
00:23:42,775 --> 00:23:44,443
when you don’t have a car.

382
00:23:44,444 --> 00:23:46,319
Let’s not do this when my car

383
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,696
is under the
traffic coding scheme,

384
00:23:47,697 --> 00:23:50,283
or we can call Roel.

385
00:23:51,033 --> 00:23:54,996
Don’t worry, I’ll soon
buy Luna’s car.

386
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:59,041
No coding scheme will stop us
from grocery shopping anymore.

387
00:24:00,376 --> 00:24:01,668
Okay.

388
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:03,253
Good evening, sir.

389
00:24:03,254 --> 00:24:05,338
- I’m really hungry.
- I’ll cook for you later.

390
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:06,340
Elyse?

391
00:24:09,135 --> 00:24:11,095
I was trying to call you.

392
00:24:12,138 --> 00:24:13,890
- Good evening, sir.
- Dad.

393
00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:16,892
Good evening, Engineer Camero.

394
00:24:16,893 --> 00:24:19,311
Sorry, I was in the area
that’s why I decided

395
00:24:19,312 --> 00:24:20,729
to check on your place.

396
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:21,731
Is that okay?

397
00:24:23,566 --> 00:24:25,610
- It’s fine, sir.
- Yes.

398
00:24:26,652 --> 00:24:28,612
I actually brought
a housewarming gift.

399
00:24:28,613 --> 00:24:29,989
Roel is just getting it.

400
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,868
Dad, you didn’t have to,
but thank you.

401
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:38,331
Oh, you did some
grocery shopping.

402
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:43,503
Yes, some fresh food and snacks.

403
00:24:43,961 --> 00:24:45,212
Why are you guys in the lobby?

404
00:24:45,213 --> 00:24:46,773
Why aren’t you coming
from the basement?

405
00:24:46,881 --> 00:24:48,216
You didn’t bring a car, Elyse?

406
00:24:48,591 --> 00:24:50,791
No, my car’s under the traffic
coding scheme today, Dad.

407
00:24:51,594 --> 00:24:52,595
Coding scheme…

408
00:24:54,305 --> 00:24:55,556
How about you, Sevi?

409
00:24:56,557 --> 00:24:57,997
Is yours under the
coding scheme too?

410
00:25:08,986 --> 00:25:12,405
You know, Dad,
we should go upstairs.

411
00:25:12,406 --> 00:25:14,450
I’m excited to show
you our unit.

412
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,701
Sure.

413
00:25:16,202 --> 00:25:18,662
- Yes?
- Go ahead. Please.

414
00:25:18,663 --> 00:25:19,663
Let’s go.

415
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,589
Come in, sir.

416
00:25:28,923 --> 00:25:30,258
Come in, Daddy.

417
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:34,720
Roel, you can leave that here...

418
00:25:35,471 --> 00:25:36,472
Sure, ma’am.

419
00:25:38,266 --> 00:25:39,306
Let me help you with that.

420
00:25:47,733 --> 00:25:52,029
Why does it feel like my boss
is here to inspect my work?

421
00:26:04,834 --> 00:26:08,004
It looks like Engineer Camero
is taking good care of you.

422
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:13,259
He really is taking
good care of me, Dad.

423
00:26:14,385 --> 00:26:15,386
That’s good.

424
00:26:16,178 --> 00:26:17,846
Roel, please…

425
00:26:17,847 --> 00:26:19,755
- Sir.
- You might want to open my gift.

426
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,145
Excuse me, ma’am.

427
00:26:25,646 --> 00:26:26,646
Here you go…

428
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:28,399
Wow.

429
00:26:33,654 --> 00:26:35,281
You might need it for work.

430
00:26:50,296 --> 00:26:51,797
Oh my god!

431
00:26:53,883 --> 00:26:55,551
Daddy, thank you!

432
00:26:55,801 --> 00:26:58,179
We’ve been saving up for this.

433
00:26:58,346 --> 00:27:00,306
Anything for my only daughter.

434
00:27:01,557 --> 00:27:02,933
Thank you, sir.

435
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:06,228
Your gift is quite expensive.

436
00:27:08,064 --> 00:27:10,483
Don’t worry about it,
Engineer Camero.

437
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,860
I’m just making sure that
you’re taking good care

438
00:27:13,861 --> 00:27:14,861
of my daughter.

439
00:27:15,905 --> 00:27:18,407
The moment I find out that
you’re not treating her right,

440
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,035
I’ll bring her home immediately.

441
00:27:25,414 --> 00:27:26,624
Of course.

442
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:29,126
I will take good care of Elyse.

443
00:27:30,711 --> 00:27:34,965
Yes, Dad. You don’t have
anything to worry about.

444
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,801
That’s good.

445
00:27:37,968 --> 00:27:38,969
Anyway...

446
00:27:40,137 --> 00:27:41,930
It’s running late.
We got to go home.

447
00:27:41,931 --> 00:27:42,931
Okay.

448
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:44,599
See you.

449
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,061
- Engineer Camero…
- Thanks again, sir.

450
00:27:47,895 --> 00:27:49,562
Thank you, Daddy. Love you.

451
00:27:49,563 --> 00:27:50,564
Love you too.

452
00:27:51,148 --> 00:27:52,148
Take care.

453
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:53,150
You too.

454
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,699
Is that a lipstick stain?

455
00:28:01,784 --> 00:28:02,826
Let’s go, Roel.

456
00:28:02,827 --> 00:28:04,035
Yes, sir.

457
00:28:04,036 --> 00:28:05,621
- Ma’am, sir…
- See you.

458
00:28:07,456 --> 00:28:08,457
Bye.

459
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:10,376
Take care!

460
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,180
We got ourselves a computer.

461
00:28:28,227 --> 00:28:32,732
Maybe it was just dirt.
I might just be imagining things.

462
00:28:39,989 --> 00:28:40,990
Come on, Ma!

463
00:28:41,574 --> 00:28:43,867
I can’t handle that
with my salary.

464
00:28:43,868 --> 00:28:45,161
Welcome home!

465
00:28:46,662 --> 00:28:47,987
What happened?

466
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:49,545
Why did you resign?

467
00:28:49,747 --> 00:28:51,916
What? She resigned?

468
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:54,462
Ma, please, start looking
for a job right away.

469
00:28:55,129 --> 00:28:57,046
You know my salary
won't be enough

470
00:28:57,047 --> 00:28:59,799
if I’m the only one supporting
Sofia and Steven's education.

471
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,927
And I have so many bills to pay.

472
00:29:02,303 --> 00:29:03,637
Ma, please.

473
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:07,641
If you could at least
find a way to earn…

474
00:29:08,017 --> 00:29:10,310
Sevi, it’s just a
temporary situation.

475
00:29:10,311 --> 00:29:12,479
And don’t you have
a project going on?

476
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,857
My earnings from
that are not enough.

477
00:29:15,149 --> 00:29:17,193
You know I haven’t been promoted yet.

478
00:29:17,735 --> 00:29:21,447
Okay, I’m sorry, Sevi.
I’m sorry.

479
00:29:22,323 --> 00:29:24,575
All right, Ma.
I’ll take care of it.

480
00:29:30,247 --> 00:29:31,248
Hey…

481
00:29:32,374 --> 00:29:33,375
Let’s eat?

482
00:29:35,753 --> 00:29:36,754
Ely…

483
00:29:37,421 --> 00:29:38,964
I’m sorry, I don’t
feel like watching.

484
00:29:39,465 --> 00:29:40,807
I have a lot on my mind.

485
00:29:41,884 --> 00:29:43,928
It’s okay. I understand.

486
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:46,472
You know,

487
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,600
maybe I can ask Daddy.

488
00:29:50,893 --> 00:29:53,520
Maybe Auntie Selene
can retract her resignation.

489
00:29:53,521 --> 00:29:55,689
Ely, don’t. It’s embarrassing.

490
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,649
Whatever Mama’s problem is

491
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,526
and whatever happened
that made her resign,

492
00:29:59,527 --> 00:30:00,820
let’s stay out of it.

493
00:30:01,362 --> 00:30:03,656
Okay…
Okay.

494
00:30:03,989 --> 00:30:05,157
I understand.

495
00:30:06,492 --> 00:30:07,493
Well,

496
00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:10,788
I can cover the
bills for this month.

497
00:30:11,455 --> 00:30:13,582
Don’t worry about it, Sev, okay?

498
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:16,334
And if you need
any financial help,

499
00:30:16,335 --> 00:30:18,962
I can find more
ways to earn money...

500
00:30:18,963 --> 00:30:20,381
Thanks, Ely.

501
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,008
But this is my problem.

502
00:30:29,139 --> 00:30:32,852
Your problem is
my problem, okay?

503
00:30:33,561 --> 00:30:35,729
We will figure
this out together.

504
00:30:56,834 --> 00:31:00,713
Our bill’s a bit big
this month. We need to save.

505
00:31:02,923 --> 00:31:04,173
Babe, sorry.

506
00:31:04,174 --> 00:31:05,800
I need to go to
work this weekend.

507
00:31:05,801 --> 00:31:08,668
Let’s just reschedule our
out-of-town trip for next time, okay?

508
00:31:09,315 --> 00:31:11,830
Okay, babe. It’s okay,
don’t worry about it.

509
00:31:12,641 --> 00:31:14,267
Wait, eat breakfast first.

510
00:31:14,268 --> 00:31:15,519
I’ll cook for you.

511
00:31:16,395 --> 00:31:18,230
No need, babe. I’ll be late.

512
00:31:18,939 --> 00:31:20,867
- Are you sure?
- Yes, babe.

513
00:31:20,896 --> 00:31:22,356
I’ll make it up
to you next time.

514
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:48,469
No air conditioning for now.
It’s not that hot anyway.

515
00:32:28,592 --> 00:32:30,052
Sorry, baby.

516
00:32:30,552 --> 00:32:31,887
You have to go.

517
00:33:04,229 --> 00:33:05,856
I need to sell more.

518
00:33:10,843 --> 00:33:12,263
Dear Ms. Manansala,

519
00:33:12,288 --> 00:33:14,916
I hope this email
finds you well.

520
00:33:15,431 --> 00:33:17,223
I am writing to discuss

521
00:33:17,224 --> 00:33:19,559
the possibility
of a salary review

522
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,709
following my recent promotion

523
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:24,445
to Director of Operations.

524
00:33:28,277 --> 00:33:30,486
This new role has
brought with it

525
00:33:30,487 --> 00:33:33,823
increased responsibilities
and expectations.

526
00:33:33,824 --> 00:33:36,117
And I believe it is appropriate

527
00:33:36,118 --> 00:33:38,579
to reassess my compensation.

528
00:33:53,052 --> 00:33:56,262
Hi, babe!
Where are you?

529
00:33:56,263 --> 00:33:58,849
Sorry, Ely,
I'm still at the site.

530
00:33:59,308 --> 00:34:01,560
Don’t wait for me.
I might come home late.

531
00:34:04,354 --> 00:34:07,460
It’s okay.
I’ll just cook dinner.

532
00:34:07,485 --> 00:34:09,608
I’ll wait for you,
so we can eat together...

533
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:12,386
Wait, Elyse,
my boss is calling me.

534
00:34:13,972 --> 00:34:14,972
Okay.

535
00:34:45,746 --> 00:34:50,101
@elydezma:
Are you coming home now?

536
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,113
@elydezma:
Are you coming home now?

537
00:35:09,665 --> 00:35:15,413
@elydezma: I’m going to
sleep now, babe. I miss you.

538
00:35:18,011 --> 00:35:21,097
@sevirous: I’m sorry, babe.
This will be over soon.

539
00:35:21,098 --> 00:35:22,599
I promise.

540
00:35:55,966 --> 00:35:57,176
Mommy!

541
00:35:57,634 --> 00:35:59,511
I really missed your food.

542
00:36:00,105 --> 00:36:03,316
I can't get my cooking
to taste this good.

543
00:36:04,779 --> 00:36:08,061
You can learn it and
you just need to practice.

544
00:36:09,258 --> 00:36:11,009
And please, eat more.

545
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:14,651
You look very tired.
Are you getting enough sleep?

546
00:36:15,903 --> 00:36:17,111
Yes, Mommy.

547
00:36:19,114 --> 00:36:21,798
I’m just a little
stressed with work.

548
00:36:22,274 --> 00:36:25,138
You know, there’s so
much to do and...

549
00:36:26,413 --> 00:36:28,874
Daddy’s not a super chill boss.

550
00:36:29,575 --> 00:36:30,709
That’s true.

551
00:36:32,286 --> 00:36:33,286
And...

552
00:36:34,004 --> 00:36:39,676
I heard from HR that you were
asking them for a salary review.

553
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:45,514
Also, one of your aunties

554
00:36:45,515 --> 00:36:47,725
saw you selling
your bags and shoes

555
00:36:47,726 --> 00:36:49,853
on a marketplace website.

556
00:36:50,229 --> 00:36:54,399
Honey, are you okay?
Are you struggling financially?

557
00:36:54,775 --> 00:36:57,027
You know you can
ask for help, right?

558
00:36:57,986 --> 00:36:59,904
It’s okay, Mommy.

559
00:36:59,905 --> 00:37:02,032
Sevi and I are doing great.

560
00:37:03,742 --> 00:37:08,579
I just needed to sell some of
my old bags and shoes

561
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,040
for spring cleaning.

562
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:13,876
And about the salary review,

563
00:37:13,877 --> 00:37:16,003
I think it’s a fair
ask considering

564
00:37:16,004 --> 00:37:18,465
all of my new responsibilities.

565
00:37:19,174 --> 00:37:22,718
And Mom, there’s
nothing to worry about.

566
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:25,554
I mean, yes, we still struggle
with bills and payments

567
00:37:25,555 --> 00:37:27,139
as first-time homeowners,

568
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,309
but we can manage.

569
00:37:30,143 --> 00:37:33,397
And Sevi is really caring
and hardworking.

570
00:37:34,273 --> 00:37:35,560
Okay, my love.

571
00:37:35,691 --> 00:37:37,395
I’m just saying that,

572
00:37:37,776 --> 00:37:40,292
just in case you need help,

573
00:37:40,696 --> 00:37:42,929
please, we’re here to help.

574
00:37:43,282 --> 00:37:44,457
Okay?

575
00:37:46,535 --> 00:37:48,911
Yes, Mommy. Thank you.

576
00:37:48,912 --> 00:37:49,913
Okay.

577
00:37:55,043 --> 00:37:56,919
Speaking of help...

578
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,172
I do need help with something.

579
00:38:00,007 --> 00:38:01,008
With what?

580
00:38:01,967 --> 00:38:03,302
Okay, well...

581
00:38:04,136 --> 00:38:06,220
It’s Sevi’s birthday tomorrow

582
00:38:06,221 --> 00:38:11,101
and I’m thinking of planning a
birthday celebration for him.

583
00:38:11,977 --> 00:38:13,086
Can you help me?

584
00:38:13,111 --> 00:38:15,363
I remember he really
loved your Kare-kare

585
00:38:15,388 --> 00:38:17,389
and I really want
to cook that for him.

586
00:38:17,414 --> 00:38:18,039
Sure..

587
00:38:18,064 --> 00:38:19,064
You know what,

588
00:38:19,443 --> 00:38:22,362
let’s do grocery
shopping after this. Okay?

589
00:38:22,946 --> 00:38:24,030
Okay.

590
00:38:24,031 --> 00:38:25,365
That’s going to be fun.

591
00:38:25,824 --> 00:38:28,452
- Thank you, Mommy.
- You’re welcome.

592
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,037
Eat more.

593
00:38:32,831 --> 00:38:33,832
You too.

594
00:38:39,671 --> 00:38:40,881
Okay…

595
00:38:52,768 --> 00:38:54,602
@elydezma: See you in a bit!

596
00:38:54,603 --> 00:38:56,979
I cooked something
special for you.

597
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:59,524
What time are you coming home?

598
00:39:18,335 --> 00:39:20,545
Sevi, where the hell are you?

599
00:39:36,353 --> 00:39:38,521
Come on, pick up…

600
00:39:38,522 --> 00:39:39,522
Hello?

601
00:39:39,523 --> 00:39:40,949
Hi, Luna.

602
00:39:41,191 --> 00:39:42,820
Elyse, what’s up?

603
00:39:45,237 --> 00:39:48,371
Sorry, for calling you
at this hour but

604
00:39:48,949 --> 00:39:53,411
have you seen Sevi? Do you
know if he went to the site?

605
00:39:53,412 --> 00:39:56,129
He hasn’t been
answering his phone.

606
00:39:57,082 --> 00:40:00,167
He doesn’t need
to go to the site today.

607
00:40:00,168 --> 00:40:02,295
And we’ve all gone
home since earlier.

608
00:40:05,173 --> 00:40:07,216
Wait, let me help
you find him, okay?

609
00:40:07,217 --> 00:40:09,594
He might just be stuck
in traffic or something.

610
00:40:11,054 --> 00:40:13,431
Okay. Thank you, Luna.

611
00:40:13,432 --> 00:40:14,933
Okay, bye.

612
00:40:41,793 --> 00:40:43,003
Oh my god.

613
00:40:44,421 --> 00:40:46,381
Where the hell have you been?

614
00:40:47,048 --> 00:40:49,258
And why haven’t you been
answering your phone?

615
00:40:49,259 --> 00:40:52,888
I’ve been so worried and—
Are you drunk?

616
00:40:56,124 --> 00:40:58,043
Sev, what happened?

617
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:00,872
Elyse.

618
00:41:01,104 --> 00:41:02,439
What’s wrong?

619
00:41:03,815 --> 00:41:06,568
My mom really
surprised me with her gift.

620
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:08,320
Huh?

621
00:41:08,987 --> 00:41:09,988
A baby.

622
00:41:12,574 --> 00:41:14,701
She’s fucking pregnant.

623
00:41:16,862 --> 00:41:17,863
What?

624
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:20,160
What now?

625
00:41:24,044 --> 00:41:26,129
I’m so exhausted.

626
00:41:28,715 --> 00:41:29,716
Sev…

627
00:41:30,926 --> 00:41:34,804
Damn it. Another added
responsibility.

628
00:41:35,055 --> 00:41:36,512
I don’t even know

629
00:41:37,015 --> 00:41:39,392
how she’s going
to get a job now.

630
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:44,564
Ely, you’ve been doing
so much for me.

631
00:41:45,524 --> 00:41:46,889
I feel so ashamed of myself.

632
00:41:47,302 --> 00:41:48,303
What?

633
00:41:50,278 --> 00:41:54,699
You don’t have to be
ashamed of anything, okay?

634
00:41:55,242 --> 00:41:57,410
It’s okay.

635
00:41:57,911 --> 00:42:00,914
You’re slowly losing your stuff.

636
00:42:01,498 --> 00:42:03,832
Your bags, your clothes...

637
00:42:03,833 --> 00:42:06,794
Did you think
I haven’t noticed yet?

638
00:42:06,795 --> 00:42:08,420
What are you talking about?

639
00:42:08,421 --> 00:42:11,507
Sev, those are just
material things.

640
00:42:11,508 --> 00:42:14,885
You’re so much more
important than that.

641
00:42:14,886 --> 00:42:19,432
Our relationship is so much
more important than that.

642
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,687
I can’t let you deal with
your problems alone.

643
00:42:24,854 --> 00:42:26,982
I just want to help you.

644
00:42:29,859 --> 00:42:31,193
I don’t want your help

645
00:42:31,194 --> 00:42:32,874
if you’re going to
have to go through that.

646
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,242
Elyse, I promised your parents
that I’d take care of you.

647
00:42:39,578 --> 00:42:42,260
But now you’re
struggling because

648
00:42:42,584 --> 00:42:44,419
of all my damn problems.

649
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:46,209
No…

650
00:42:48,086 --> 00:42:49,462
But, Elyse...

651
00:42:52,007 --> 00:42:53,592
I'll find a way.

652
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:57,970
I’ll look for, maybe
take on a side gig...

653
00:42:57,971 --> 00:43:00,723
- Huh?
- Someone offered me

654
00:43:00,724 --> 00:43:02,891
a part-time teaching job.

655
00:43:02,892 --> 00:43:05,352
What the fuck, Sevi?

656
00:43:05,353 --> 00:43:08,857
Are you kidding me?
Another fucking job?

657
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,371
Do you know how much
you have been draining yourself?

658
00:43:12,396 --> 00:43:14,398
And now you want another job?

659
00:43:15,196 --> 00:43:16,547
Sevi…

660
00:43:16,572 --> 00:43:18,823
You haven’t been eating.

661
00:43:18,848 --> 00:43:21,076
You haven’t even
been sleeping right.

662
00:43:21,077 --> 00:43:24,288
And oh my god, we haven’t
even been seeing each other

663
00:43:24,289 --> 00:43:26,875
and we live under
the same damn roof.

664
00:43:29,336 --> 00:43:31,296
Do I even have a choice?

665
00:43:34,007 --> 00:43:36,635
I don’t even know
what to do anymore.

666
00:43:38,553 --> 00:43:41,264
I’m so exhausted!

667
00:43:41,765 --> 00:43:44,100
I’m so exhausted…

668
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:46,019
I’m so...

669
00:43:50,023 --> 00:43:51,191
I know…

670
00:43:52,651 --> 00:43:55,017
I’m so exhausted…

671
00:44:05,288 --> 00:44:06,472
Just...

672
00:44:06,706 --> 00:44:10,286
Please, just set your
fucking pride aside

673
00:44:10,311 --> 00:44:14,005
and let me help you.
Just accept my help. Please.

674
00:44:15,382 --> 00:44:16,424
Babe…

675
00:44:17,801 --> 00:44:21,554
I know that you are so tired.

676
00:44:23,723 --> 00:44:26,976
But we’re in this
together, okay?

677
00:44:29,062 --> 00:44:32,816
You letting me help you
is not a failure on your end.

678
00:44:34,317 --> 00:44:36,902
And I know that if
I’m in the same situation,

679
00:44:36,903 --> 00:44:39,155
you’d do the same for me.

680
00:44:46,788 --> 00:44:48,289
Elyse…

681
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:51,710
I’m sorry, okay?

682
00:44:53,503 --> 00:44:56,172
I'm sorry for being
a burden to you.

683
00:44:57,424 --> 00:44:58,717
No…

684
00:44:59,801 --> 00:45:02,387
I’m so sorry, okay?

685
00:45:03,138 --> 00:45:05,807
Don’t apologize, okay?

686
00:45:07,976 --> 00:45:09,769
Everything will be okay…

687
00:45:10,478 --> 00:45:12,647
Everything will be okay.

688
00:46:06,493 --> 00:46:08,119
Sevi?

689
00:46:24,803 --> 00:46:26,262
Ida…

690
00:46:27,483 --> 00:46:29,849
Ely, are you okay?

691
00:46:30,725 --> 00:46:31,726
Hi!

692
00:46:35,629 --> 00:46:37,464
It’s about Sevi…

693
00:46:41,653 --> 00:46:44,613
You know last week,
his mom resigned

694
00:46:44,614 --> 00:46:48,493
and then last night we
found out that she’s pregnant.

695
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:54,281
He’s been juggling so many jobs

696
00:46:55,041 --> 00:46:58,837
just to make ends
meet for us and his family.

697
00:46:59,254 --> 00:47:03,465
Ely, I’m sorry
you’re going through this.

698
00:47:03,466 --> 00:47:06,994
I wish I could hug you right now.
How are you coping?

699
00:47:07,595 --> 00:47:11,390
I’m doing everything I can
to make more money,

700
00:47:11,391 --> 00:47:15,395
but with his mom
being pregnant…

701
00:47:16,729 --> 00:47:20,191
His responsibilities
just got even heavier.

702
00:47:20,608 --> 00:47:24,028
Ely, if money is your
problem at the moment,

703
00:47:24,445 --> 00:47:27,072
why not ask your
parents for help?

704
00:47:27,073 --> 00:47:29,826
I’m sure they are more
than willing to help you.

705
00:47:30,451 --> 00:47:32,619
He doesn’t want to.

706
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:35,957
I mean, I guess
I understand him.

707
00:47:36,749 --> 00:47:38,500
And the situation is tricky

708
00:47:38,501 --> 00:47:40,973
because his mom
used to work for my dad.

709
00:47:41,017 --> 00:47:43,927
How about Auntie Erin?
You can ask her.

710
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:47,902
It’s not shameful to admit
that you guys need help.

711
00:47:47,927 --> 00:47:50,929
And you’ll just borrow
money anyway. You’ll return it.

712
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:53,766
My mom offered
me help. She did.

713
00:47:53,933 --> 00:47:55,310
But I...

714
00:47:56,185 --> 00:47:59,980
I didn’t mention to her that
we’re financially struggling.

715
00:47:59,981 --> 00:48:05,054
Ely, it’s your mom! You can tell
her anything without judgment.

716
00:48:06,613 --> 00:48:07,906
I know.

717
00:48:08,281 --> 00:48:09,949
I know, but...

718
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,202
I’m just thinking
about Sevi, though…

719
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:16,663
What if he doesn’t want that?

720
00:48:16,664 --> 00:48:19,124
You have to convince Sevi.

721
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:22,712
You know, no matter how
perfect your relationship is,

722
00:48:23,212 --> 00:48:25,465
money is a different matter.

723
00:48:26,215 --> 00:48:29,468
You guys should resolve
this before it drives a wedge

724
00:48:29,469 --> 00:48:30,970
in your relationship.

725
00:48:37,518 --> 00:48:39,019
Not him, you moron!

726
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:40,979
Just because you met a girl...

727
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,273
You have a date again, huh?

728
00:48:43,149 --> 00:48:45,817
You are such a womanizer.

729
00:48:46,442 --> 00:48:48,570
I hope this cheers him up.

730
00:48:48,571 --> 00:48:50,448
Where are you
going for your date?

731
00:48:53,701 --> 00:48:55,870
- Excuse me. Hi!
- Yes?

732
00:48:55,871 --> 00:48:58,413
Do you know where
Engineer Camero is?

733
00:48:58,414 --> 00:49:00,123
Engineer Camero?

734
00:49:00,124 --> 00:49:01,291
He’s there.

735
00:49:01,292 --> 00:49:02,835
He's with Engineer Ramos.

736
00:49:09,926 --> 00:49:11,386
Okay, thank you.

737
00:49:14,139 --> 00:49:16,015
- What did you put in this?
- That’s my secret.

738
00:49:18,476 --> 00:49:20,937
- This is really good.
- Right? I told you.

739
00:49:24,393 --> 00:49:27,443
Huh. He doesn’t
look stressed.

740
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,527
And he’s smiling?

741
00:49:29,922 --> 00:49:33,074
Something I haven’t
seen for a long time.

742
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:35,590
[indistinct chattering]

743
00:49:36,494 --> 00:49:38,413
Hey! Hi, Elyse!

744
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:43,334
Ely! What are you doing here?

745
00:49:44,585 --> 00:49:46,086
I have a meeting nearby

746
00:49:46,087 --> 00:49:49,257
so I just decided to
drop by and say hi.

747
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,592
Let’s eat!

748
00:49:52,427 --> 00:49:54,094
Yes, join us.

749
00:49:54,095 --> 00:49:56,847
It’s kare-kare, it’s really
delicious. Bianca made it.

750
00:49:56,848 --> 00:49:58,433
Theo and the
others like it, too.

751
00:49:59,892 --> 00:50:01,560
Sevi really likes it.

752
00:50:01,561 --> 00:50:03,061
He’s always asking for some,

753
00:50:03,062 --> 00:50:04,980
so I decided to just
cook for him too.

754
00:50:04,981 --> 00:50:06,399
It’s my birthday gift to him.

755
00:50:08,609 --> 00:50:11,029
Do you want to taste it?
Try it.

756
00:50:13,698 --> 00:50:14,699
I’m okay.

757
00:50:20,329 --> 00:50:24,459
So he likes her cooking
more than mine.

758
00:50:27,879 --> 00:50:29,504
Is this food for me?

759
00:50:29,505 --> 00:50:30,840
No!

760
00:50:31,549 --> 00:50:33,468
It’s just my lunch.

761
00:50:36,763 --> 00:50:38,723
Okay, I’ll head out then.

762
00:50:39,307 --> 00:50:41,893
I have a meeting to catch.

763
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:43,519
Bye, babe.

764
00:50:48,357 --> 00:50:49,358
Ely…

765
00:50:56,741 --> 00:50:58,743
Let’s have dinner
together later?

766
00:50:58,998 --> 00:51:02,038
Should I still hope
it’ll push through?

767
00:51:04,165 --> 00:51:07,335
If you come home early,

768
00:51:09,045 --> 00:51:10,171
Sure.

769
00:51:15,843 --> 00:51:18,054
Okay. Bye.

770
00:51:23,226 --> 00:51:26,646
Why the hell am
I crying over kare-kare?

771
00:52:09,021 --> 00:52:10,690
Good morning, babe.

772
00:52:13,651 --> 00:52:14,902
Good morning!

773
00:52:19,615 --> 00:52:21,241
Breakfast in bed.

774
00:52:21,242 --> 00:52:22,914
I made your favorite.

775
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:24,732
Bacon and waffle.

776
00:52:35,214 --> 00:52:36,257
What’s wrong?

777
00:52:36,716 --> 00:52:38,384
Nothing, I just...

778
00:52:41,429 --> 00:52:45,683
I miss this. I miss
your surprises like this.

779
00:52:49,228 --> 00:52:51,022
I missed you too.

780
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:57,278
I’m sorry for always being busy.

781
00:52:59,197 --> 00:53:02,366
It’s okay, you don’t have
to apologize for that.

782
00:53:03,766 --> 00:53:06,018
I understand. Okay?

783
00:53:09,999 --> 00:53:13,335
But now, I have time.

784
00:53:13,336 --> 00:53:14,295
Really?

785
00:53:14,296 --> 00:53:17,548
I told the office not to
bother me this weekend.

786
00:53:18,424 --> 00:53:19,425
Really?

787
00:53:20,301 --> 00:53:22,844
- Really?
- Yes, really.

788
00:53:22,845 --> 00:53:24,179
How about an out-of-town trip?

789
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:25,431
Out of town?

790
00:53:26,098 --> 00:53:28,808
Wait, can we go glamping?

791
00:53:28,809 --> 00:53:30,977
Sure, let’s go!
To Baguio?

792
00:53:30,978 --> 00:53:32,146
Baguio?

793
00:53:32,438 --> 00:53:35,983
Wait, you can really drive
from Manila to Baguio?

794
00:53:36,442 --> 00:53:37,568
Of course!

795
00:53:37,735 --> 00:53:42,362
If you want, I’ll drive you
from Batanes to Jolo.

796
00:53:42,448 --> 00:53:44,158
Wow!

797
00:53:44,992 --> 00:53:46,452
I would love that.

798
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:48,600
I’ve really missed you, Sev.

799
00:53:50,915 --> 00:53:52,416
I missed you!

800
00:53:55,461 --> 00:53:56,504
Thank you.

801
00:53:57,463 --> 00:53:59,130
- That looks so good.
- Eat now.

802
00:53:59,131 --> 00:54:01,509
I know that
this is your favorite.

803
00:54:08,349 --> 00:54:10,935
I think we’re
all set now, right?

804
00:54:13,104 --> 00:54:14,229
What are you talking about?

805
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:17,440
I’ve been set for life ever
since you came into my life.

806
00:54:17,441 --> 00:54:20,236
Wow, you’re so corny.

807
00:54:20,695 --> 00:54:24,698
I made a playlist
for our long drive.

808
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:26,117
Nice!

809
00:54:26,993 --> 00:54:30,120
Not only are you the passenger
princess, but also the DJ.

810
00:54:30,121 --> 00:54:32,790
Of course, I can’t
let you fall asleep.

811
00:54:33,207 --> 00:54:37,377
I think we have snacks now
and our favorite drinks.

812
00:54:37,378 --> 00:54:39,588
And then you have me, of course.

813
00:54:40,006 --> 00:54:41,006
What else…

814
00:54:41,007 --> 00:54:42,591
And then...

815
00:54:43,926 --> 00:54:46,512
- Okay, so…
- Hold on, Ely.

816
00:54:52,143 --> 00:54:53,394
Hello, Bianca?

817
00:54:54,228 --> 00:54:56,896
Didn't I tell you guys not
to bother me this weekend?

818
00:54:56,897 --> 00:54:58,649
Can’t it wait until Monday?

819
00:55:01,942 --> 00:55:02,943
Huh?

820
00:55:04,488 --> 00:55:05,818
It collapsed?

821
00:55:07,231 --> 00:55:08,565
Fuck, what happened?

822
00:55:08,917 --> 00:55:11,620
Hold on...
Are you still at the site?

823
00:55:15,416 --> 00:55:17,793
Am I the only engineer
that can go there?

824
00:55:21,088 --> 00:55:23,923
Alright, damn it… Fuck this.

825
00:55:23,924 --> 00:55:26,761
I guess we’re not going
through with our plans again.

826
00:55:37,355 --> 00:55:38,356
Ely…

827
00:55:39,148 --> 00:55:41,150
I need to go to the site first.

828
00:55:41,817 --> 00:55:42,818
Then go.

829
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:48,199
Leave already.

830
00:55:51,035 --> 00:55:52,453
Just go.

831
00:55:57,666 --> 00:55:58,709
Ely…

832
00:55:59,126 --> 00:56:01,419
I’m sorry, I promise
I’ll make it up to you.

833
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:03,422
I’ve heard that before.

834
00:56:04,048 --> 00:56:07,676
But you never do, Sev.
You never fucking do.

835
00:56:09,053 --> 00:56:11,596
I just look like a fool.

836
00:56:11,597 --> 00:56:12,932
Elyse, come on.

837
00:56:13,766 --> 00:56:16,476
Please understand, this is work.

838
00:56:16,477 --> 00:56:18,062
And what about me?

839
00:56:23,692 --> 00:56:28,447
Sev, I feel like I just
have to beg for your time.

840
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:41,127
I’m tired, Sev.

841
00:56:47,216 --> 00:56:49,849
I’m so tired

842
00:56:49,874 --> 00:56:52,918
of always having
to beg for your time.

843
00:57:00,229 --> 00:57:01,605
I think…

844
00:57:03,149 --> 00:57:05,943
I think I’ll just go to my
parents’ house for a bit.

845
00:57:07,903 --> 00:57:09,613
I just need to rest.

846
00:57:11,824 --> 00:57:15,786
My life was better
back when I lived there.

847
00:57:18,122 --> 00:57:21,667
I’ve never felt
this fucking tired.

848
00:57:26,297 --> 00:57:28,174
I’m tired too, you know?

849
00:57:29,633 --> 00:57:33,262
But I’m enduring it for
my family and for you.

850
00:57:33,804 --> 00:57:35,431
Isn’t that enough?

851
00:57:37,641 --> 00:57:38,642
Sev!

852
00:57:40,144 --> 00:57:42,480
I work overtime.

853
00:57:43,355 --> 00:57:46,357
I come home to clean the unit.

854
00:57:46,358 --> 00:57:48,276
And then I cook food for us that

855
00:57:48,277 --> 00:57:52,281
you don’t even eat because
you always come home late.

856
00:57:55,117 --> 00:57:58,286
I would go to sleep hoping
that you would be there

857
00:57:58,287 --> 00:58:00,956
the next day,
but you’re always not.

858
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:06,377
We only got to see
each other this weekend

859
00:58:06,378 --> 00:58:10,216
and you still can’t
make time for me?

860
00:58:12,801 --> 00:58:16,096
Ely, you know I have
a lot to do, right?

861
00:58:18,224 --> 00:58:21,100
You said you understand me.

862
00:58:21,101 --> 00:58:23,812
So why are you bringing
all this up against me?

863
00:58:25,648 --> 00:58:27,232
You said you wanted to help me,

864
00:58:27,233 --> 00:58:30,568
but now you’re holding it
all against me.

865
00:58:30,569 --> 00:58:33,030
I’m not holding it
against you, Sev.

866
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:43,874
I’m just so fucking fed up,
I just want to breathe.

867
00:58:48,045 --> 00:58:50,798
I just want to breathe, Sev.

868
00:59:07,189 --> 00:59:08,691
Let’s take a break.

869
00:59:12,945 --> 00:59:15,072
We need to take a break.

870
00:59:46,353 --> 00:59:48,521
Sir, you're early today.

871
00:59:48,522 --> 00:59:50,231
Of course,
someone’s waiting for me.

872
00:59:50,232 --> 00:59:51,775
I need to make it up to her.

873
00:59:52,651 --> 00:59:54,778
- All right, sir.
- Thanks.

874
00:59:58,212 --> 00:59:59,796
@elydezma:
See you in a bit!

875
00:59:59,821 --> 01:00:01,947
I cooked something
special for you.

876
01:00:01,972 --> 01:00:03,723
What time are you coming home?

877
01:00:03,829 --> 01:00:07,124
I have something
special for you, too.

878
01:00:17,078 --> 01:00:18,079
Yes, Ma?

879
01:00:18,104 --> 01:00:20,064
Sevi...

880
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:23,118
I have to tell you something...

881
01:00:25,225 --> 01:00:27,227
Sevi, I’m pregnant.

882
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:11,126
Ely, I don't understand...

883
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:15,234
Are you breaking up with me?

884
01:01:27,413 --> 01:01:30,498
Can you really live
without me, Elyse?

885
01:01:30,499 --> 01:01:32,166
Why are you talking like that?

886
01:01:32,167 --> 01:01:35,003
The doctor said that
you’re feeling better now.

887
01:01:35,394 --> 01:01:38,397
You’re still a big baby, Elyse.
