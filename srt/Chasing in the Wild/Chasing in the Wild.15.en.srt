1
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:13,470
You're not the only
owner of this unit.

2
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:16,433
You're really good at
popping up out of nowhere.

3
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,770
Are you staying here tonight?

4
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:23,397
Finish that up.

5
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:24,898
So you can take your medicine.

6
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,569
But I’ve decided that I
want to stay here indefinitely.

7
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,784
Let’s live together again.

8
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,078
It’s lunch break.

9
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,580
Eat up.

10
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,043
Sev, let’s eat.

11
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,501
I brought kare-kare.

12
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:45,920
I also cooked more for you.

13
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:48,298
Still with the kare-kare?

14
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,304
I’m going grocery
shopping later.

15
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,722
Do you need me
to buy anything for you?

16
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,474
Yes, I actually
have a lot to buy.

17
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,475
Can I go with you?

18
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,435
Sure.

19
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:01,436
Okay, babe.

20
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,233
Okay, love.

21
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,186
What are you cooking?

22
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,398
Caldereta.

23
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,066
Bring some tomorrow,

24
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,069
you shared in
the expenses anyway.

25
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,196
Okay.

26
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,412
By the way…

27
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,706
Is it really okay that

28
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,751
Engineer Lavin saw us
at the grocery?

29
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,337
What if he tells other people?

30
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,174
Don’t worry,

31
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,675
Theo’s a close friend.

32
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,219
I trust him.

33
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,447
You know, you’ve always
been a good cook.

34
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,453
You can get yourself
a girlfriend now.

35
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,424
Speaking of girlfriend...

36
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,220
Are you...

37
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,764
seeing someone?

38
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:48,895
No.

39
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,275
Really?

40
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:55,944
Why?

41
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,906
I mean, your career
is doing great.

42
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,325
You could be married by now.

43
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,456
It's hard.

44
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,377
It's hard to

45
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,713
open up to someone new again.

46
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,550
I’ll have to tell my
story all over again.

47
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,887
It’s exhausting.

48
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,027
Girl, you what?

49
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,239
I said that
I’m living with Sevi.

50
00:04:41,264 --> 00:04:42,864
Wait, wait...

51
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,768
So are you guys back together?

52
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:47,444
No, we’re not.

53
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,802
We just think that it’s,

54
00:04:50,827 --> 00:04:55,836
you know, convenient for us
to live in the condo together

55
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:59,757
and since we are
both... shared... co-owners,

56
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,926
we thought why not
just be housemates?

57
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,304
Housemates?

58
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,765
Wow, this is mindblowing.

59
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,226
And you don’t feel
uncomfortable?

60
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:14,730
Not really. You know,
it’s fine living with Sevi.

61
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:18,359
It’s nice to live with someone
that you already know and trust.

62
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,404
And

63
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,032
honestly,

64
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,409
ever since living with him,

65
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,870
I feel less alone.

66
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:34,478
It’s nice too, just having
someone to eat with,

67
00:05:34,503 --> 00:05:37,840
someone to come home to…

68
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,672
But girl, don’t get me wrong.

69
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,425
There are still some awkward

70
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:48,597
moments between us, especially
when the past gets brought up.

71
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:53,185
It’s great that you guys have
become amicable exes,

72
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,688
but how long can
you keep this up?

73
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,734
There’s an elephant in the room
that you’re not addressing.

74
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:05,781
I don’t think we want to
talk about that, you know?

75
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,786
Maybe time just heals
all wounds, you know.

76
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,871
I think it’s just better for us

77
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,541
to forget everything that
happened in the past.

78
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,961
So, we’re okay for now.

79
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:25,425
I still think you
need to talk about it.

80
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,470
It might cause you
problems sooner or later.

81
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:32,224
We’ll cross that
bridge eventually.

82
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,726
But for now, you know,

83
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:38,189
I don’t want to mess
with the status quo.

84
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,823
Okay, let’s have our lunch break

85
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,575
before we continue on
with the meeting.

86
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,052
Here’s your lunch, ma’am.

87
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,261
Thank you, Alice.

88
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,972
I already heated it up, ma’am.

89
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,099
It smells so good!
Did you cook it yourself?

90
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,226
It looks delicious.

91
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,436
Wow!

92
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,730
Beef Caldereta, Miss Ledezma?

93
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,817
Wow,

94
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:27,655
Engineer Camero also has
Beef Caldereta for lunch.

95
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,371
Oh my god,

96
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:39,792
is it Beef Caldereta Day today?

97
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,920
Excuse me, ma’am,

98
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,257
would you like a glass
of water with ice?

99
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,593
Yes, sure. Thank you.

100
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,890
Okay, anyway...

101
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,975
What’s our plan this weekend?

102
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,226
Hey,

103
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,435
let’s go drinking.

104
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,187
I’m down with that.

105
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,814
What about you, Sevi?

106
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,318
You haven’t been hanging out
with us for a while.

107
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,071
I’ll pass for now.

108
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,115
I just want to rest at home.

109
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,326
Sheesh!

110
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:14,660
You know, bro,

111
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,496
you've been a weak shit lately.

112
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,998
Since when did you
become such a homebody?

113
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,790
What’s up with you

114
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,673
suddenly wanting to stay
home all the time?

115
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:24,229
Honestly,

116
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,796
you're making me sad, Master.

117
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,007
Shit, Elyse!

118
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,969
Sorry, my friends are outside.

119
00:09:13,347 --> 00:09:14,347
What?

120
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,054
Shit!

121
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,357
Master, what’s up?

122
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,525
Master!

123
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,194
Why did you guys come
here without telling me?

124
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,655
Come on, we’re drinking, right?

125
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,782
You didn’t want to go out.

126
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,993
So change of plans.

127
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:42,080
- We brought the party to you.
- Yes. Let’s go.

128
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,873
I said I didn’t want
to drink, remember?

129
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,251
I’m busy!

130
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,587
Why, Sevi?

131
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,797
Are you with someone?

132
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:52,882
No.

133
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,011
No?

134
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,388
I said no!

135
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,974
Just leave already!

136
00:10:00,584 --> 00:10:02,334
I’ll follow.

137
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,645
You know what, guys...

138
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,978
Let’s just drink at
my place instead.

139
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,396
- Come on.
- Let’s go.

140
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,398
Wait a second.

141
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,363
Why are there bra
and panties here, Sevi?

142
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,285
They’re mine.

143
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,412
Whose are those?

144
00:10:23,225 --> 00:10:25,999
Just go already.
I’ve got things to do.

145
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,585
Yes, exactly.
So, come on, let’s go!

146
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,046
Sevi, whose are those?

147
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,133
They’re my wife’s!

148
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,429
Happy now?

149
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,472
Now leave.

150
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,682
She doesn’t like guests.

151
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,684
Let’s go, guys.

152
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,021
- All right.
- So, whose are they really...

153
00:11:01,104 --> 00:11:02,397
Wife?

154
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,207
Since when did I become
your damn wife, huh?

155
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,875
I didn’t know what to say, okay?

156
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,669
What was I supposed
to say, girlfriend?

157
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,337
I can’t say that because

158
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,838
they just asked
about it the other day.

159
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:14,839
Really?

160
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,133
Well, out of all the
things you could’ve said,

161
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,885
wife was what you went with?

162
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,887
There are bras and
panties lying around here.

163
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,806
What do you want me to say,

164
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,141
fuck buddy?

165
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,312
Well, that’s better than
calling me your wife.

166
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,231
I’m conservative, okay?

167
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,025
What about my reputation?

168
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,944
And wait a second...

169
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,905
Why are you even
stressed by this?

170
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,026
You’re not the one who’s
going to get grilled at work.

171
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,996
And don’t worry.
I’ll take it back.

172
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,997
Really?

173
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,126
What are you even gonna say?

174
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,919
Fuck buddy.

175
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,422
So your fuck buddy
washes her clothes

176
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,466
in your condo, huh?

177
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,718
You’re complaining too much.

178
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,805
Fine, I’ll just tell them
it’s my ex’s. Happy now?

179
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,891
You know what, never mind.

180
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,519
Hey, wait!

181
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,355
Hold on, this lovers’
quarrel isn’t over yet.

182
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,533
As of today

183
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:27,787
the construction of Aruga Resort
is 50% complete.

184
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:31,332
We’ve successfully navigated
through the initial challenges

185
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,043
and are still on schedule.

186
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,171
Good job, everyone.

187
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,172
Yes.

188
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,763
I am very, very happy
with the progress

189
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,474
that we’ve made on this project.

190
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:51,102
Are there any more issues that
need to be addressed, Engineer?

191
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,229
There’s nothing
to worry about, wif...

192
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,398
I mean,

193
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,609
Miss Ledezma.

194
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,076
That’s good to hear, Engineer.

195
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,497
Let’s keep this momentum going
and finish off strong.

196
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,498
Yes?

197
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,584
Thank you.

198
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,345
Good job, guys.

199
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,680
Ely,

200
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,226
do you want to have
dinner together?

201
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,520
I know a nice restaurant.

202
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,229
I’ll treat you.

203
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,442
I actually have something to...

204
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:43,279
Happy birthday to you!

205
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,491
- Happy birthday to you!
- OMG.

206
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,284
It’s his birthday?

207
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:53,332
Happy birthday, happy birthday,
happy birthday to you!

208
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,211
Happy birthday, Sir Austin!

209
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,795
Thank you.

210
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,924
Thank you, everyone.
I appreciate it.

211
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,270
Happy birthday, Sir Austin!

212
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,398
- Thank you!
- Happy birthday, Sir Austin!

213
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,569
Happy birthday.

214
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,655
Thank you,
I thought you had forgotten.

215
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,241
So, let’s have dinner?

216
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,118
Make it my birthday gift.

217
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,248
It would be very nice
if you could join us for dinner.

218
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,501
We’ll see you tonight,
Miss Ledezma?

219
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,504
How can I say no?

220
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,551
Okay, sure.

221
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,552
Okay?

222
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,846
Yes.

223
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,223
Great, nice!

224
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,434
Thank you.

225
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,395
You know, for my birthday,
you're the only one

226
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,815
I want to be with, Elyse.
Thank you so much.

227
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:05,570
- Happy birthday, sir!
- Thank you!

228
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,322
Thank you!

229
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,406
Nice.

230
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,451
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you. Thank you, Dad.

231
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:14,996
Happy birthday.

232
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:15,956
Thank you.

233
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,917
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

234
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:26,133
If only your Dad agreed
to the arrangement.

235
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,519
It could’ve been you and Austin.

236
00:15:29,544 --> 00:15:33,557
You could’ve already been married
by now with two kids.

237
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,018
Marriage arrangement?

238
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,146
What’s this, the 18th century?

239
00:15:39,932 --> 00:15:44,068
It would’ve been really nice seeing
little Elyse,

240
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,780
little Austin, running around the office.

241
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:49,338
You know?

242
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:51,991
That’s cute.

243
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,368
And

244
00:15:53,491 --> 00:15:54,491
I know

245
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,207
that the two of you
would make a great couple.

246
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,920
But wait Elyse,
let me ask you…

247
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,839
Has Austin made a
move on you already?

248
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,636
No. Not yet, Dad.

249
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,763
We’re just friends.

250
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,767
But friends could be lovers.

251
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,353
Hold on, son.

252
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,730
You seem to be taking too long.

253
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:25,484
Remember what Dad
tells you most of the time?

254
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,195
You have to be
alert at all times.

255
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,615
I’m taking it slow, Dad.

256
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,868
I don’t want Elyse
to feel overwhelmed.

257
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,120
Also,

258
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:41,542
she’s our CEO and it
demands a lot of her time.

259
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:47,422
Yes, I’m also aware
of that, son.

260
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,550
But you know,
at the end of the day,

261
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,970
Elyse here is still a woman

262
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,180
and she needs a man.

263
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,268
I think I don’t need anyone, Uncle.

264
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,311
With all due respect,

265
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:05,107
a woman does not
need a man to live.

266
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,532
I was just saying...

267
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,412
that there will come a time

268
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,291
when you would
want to settle down.

269
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,419
Maybe.
Maybe not.

270
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,839
I’m okay with growing
old and single, Uncle.

271
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:34,178
Marriage isn’t something
I’m thinking about right now.

272
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,388
What?

273
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,289
You cannot be single forever.

274
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:42,268
There will come a time
when the company

275
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,646
will need an heir, Elyse.

276
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,816
Think of succession.

277
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,736
I knew it.

278
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,115
I'll think about it again

279
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,160
50 years from now, Uncle.

280
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:02,998
I will be running this company
for a very long time.

281
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,209
Women nowadays
prioritize themselves

282
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,755
over settling down
and having a family.

283
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,925
Mark my words,

284
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,887
the time will come when you
will need a man in your life

285
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,848
and I hope it will
not be too late.

286
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,811
Sorry, but I really don’t believe

287
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,438
that a woman’s happiness and success

288
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,025
are contingent on
having a man in their life.

289
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,779
Women are fully capable
of thriving on their own.

290
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,867
Women need men in their lives.

291
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:42,246
And that’s a reality
in life, Elyse.

292
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:47,334
Don’t you feel
lonely at times, dear?

293
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:56,593
Women are not made
to be slaves of love, Uncle.

294
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,265
We can totally
manage on our own.

295
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,851
Maybe I will marry
someone someday,

296
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,645
or maybe I will
stay single forever.

297
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,730
Now that is my choice.

298
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,525
Okay, guys.
Enough.

299
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,652
Enough. Let’s talk about
that some other time.

300
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,237
Okay?
It’s my birthday

301
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,990
so, let’s celebrate.

302
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,282
Okay?

303
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:21,994
Yes, I...

304
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,666
I have to go.

305
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,459
Austin, happy birthday.

306
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,086
Okay?

307
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:31,920
Thank you, Dad.

308
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:32,962
Miss Ledezma.

309
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,339
Excuse me, please.

310
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,393
Sorry about my dad.

311
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,770
You know how he is.

312
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,922
He’s eager to
have grandchildren.

313
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,224
It’s fine.

314
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,321
You know,

315
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:02,326
I’m feeling pressured too
with all these marriage talks.

316
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:03,784
It’s crazy.

317
00:20:03,979 --> 00:20:07,149
It’s really tough
having a dad like him.

318
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:10,958
So...

319
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,295
Do you want to grab a drink?

320
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,547
I know a place

321
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,425
or a club where we can
hang out and drink.

322
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:19,843
Are you up for it?

323
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,603
All right, sounds good.

324
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,897
It’s your birthday after all.

325
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,523
Thank you.

326
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,776
Cheers?

327
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:40,989
Happy birthday.

328
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,199
Thank you.

329
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,915
Yeah! Cheers!

330
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,003
Wow!

331
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,716
Thank you so much for
coming with me here, okay?

332
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:03,553
You’re really one of the most
important people in my life.

333
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,056
If not the most.

334
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,645
Well, it’s still too
early to go home,

335
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,523
so I decided to stay a bit longer.

336
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,692
And besides,

337
00:21:17,187 --> 00:21:20,273
I really just need to
destress and unwind.

338
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,741
Please don’t
misinterpret this, okay?

339
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,705
Hey!

340
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,791
Drink moderately, okay?

341
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,335
You’re not driving home
tonight, are you?

342
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,923
I seldom celebrate my birthday,

343
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,174
and we only get to enjoy
ourselves once in a while,

344
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,968
so just let me be, okay?

345
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,803
Let’s party, let’s go!

346
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,180
Yeah!

347
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,309
Hold on.

348
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,518
I’m just going to
the restroom, okay?

349
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,812
I’ll be right back.

350
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:13,957
Hey, beautiful.

351
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,542
Can I get you a drink?

352
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,129
I can buy myself one, thank you.

353
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,090
And I’m with someone.

354
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,637
Well, you look so pretty
and hot at the same time.

355
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:29,973
What’s your name?

356
00:22:30,604 --> 00:22:31,604
Hey!

357
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,769
Alright, just chill.

358
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,187
My bad, my bad.

359
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,984
I mean, we’re here
to have fun, right?

360
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,612
What the fuck?

361
00:22:44,857 --> 00:22:45,906
We’re just getting
to know each other...

362
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:46,281
Hey!

363
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:47,823
What do you think you’re doing?

364
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,116
- Huh?
- Hey, bro...

365
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,326
Were you disrespecting her?

366
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,327
- Austin.
- Huh?

367
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,370
- Austin, stop.
- I didn’t know that...

368
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,497
- Stop flirting with her.
- I didn’t know...

369
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,832
You understand me?

370
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,042
- Let’s just go.
- What?

371
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,543
Let’s just go. It’s okay.

372
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,837
No, this guy’s an ass.

373
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,798
Let’s just go.
It’s okay. Let’s...

374
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,673
- What, you think you’re tough?
- Austin!

375
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,300
Austin, stop. Stop!

376
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,178
- Stop, let’s just—
- You’re a coward.

377
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,388
- Let’s go. Let’s go.
- Well?

378
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,431
Let’s go.

379
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,442
Who was that?

380
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:24,820
Did you flirt with him?

381
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,656
What? No!
What are you on?

382
00:23:27,977 --> 00:23:29,562
Didn't I tell you

383
00:23:30,078 --> 00:23:32,455
not to flirt with someone else?

384
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,830
I already told you
before that I like you.

385
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,041
You were flirting with him.

386
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,917
Austin, stop holding me.

387
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,169
You’re hurting me.

388
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,506
I'm hurt too!

389
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,175
You're hurting me.

390
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,970
What?

391
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,432
Can you...

392
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:58,270
Please, if you're going
to flirt with someone,

393
00:23:59,351 --> 00:24:00,852
can it just be with me?

394
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,692
Austin,

395
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,610
I’ve told you over and over

396
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,697
that you’re just a friend from work.

397
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,700
Nothing more.

398
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,746
Why...

399
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:20,709
Why is it so hard
for you to like me?

400
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,586
What’s wrong with me?

401
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,088
What am I lacking?

402
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,299
You’re drunk, Austin.

403
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,759
You don’t know what you’re saying.

404
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,470
Just...

405
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:32,971
Go home.

406
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,115
Now, see…

407
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,325
Playing house with an ex.

408
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,994
That’s why you’re in this situation.

409
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,330
I came here to ask
for advice, okay?

410
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:03,210
- Not to be lectured.
- Well, we’re not lecturing you.

411
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,085
We just don’t want you to get hurt.

412
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,421
And what will you do
if Elyse leaves you again?

413
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:08,840
You’re going to cry again?

414
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,719
Is it bad to gamble on this?

415
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,887
In gambling, there are
only two outcomes,

416
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,097
you either win or lose.

417
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,806
There’s no such thing as a draw.

418
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,059
And remember,

419
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,645
too much of anything is bad.

420
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:24,439
When you’re gambling,
you should know your limits.

421
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,250
She’s calling.

422
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,211
Hold on, I need to take this call.

423
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,212
It’s work.

424
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,926
Hello, Miss Ledezma.

425
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,718
Hello, Sevi?

426
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,471
I need your help.

427
00:25:57,416 --> 00:26:00,016
I’m with Austin right now
and he’s really drunk.

428
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,101
I don’t feel safe right now.

429
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,395
Can you please come here?

430
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,146
I already sent my location.

431
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,941
Okay, I’m nearby anyway.

432
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,486
Guys, I need to go, okay?

433
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:13,487
Take care.

434
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,826
Don’t you like me?

435
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,076
You like me, right?

436
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,495
Stop touching me, Austin.

437
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,497
Elyse, you like me, right?

438
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,789
Say yes.

439
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,499
Answer me! Answer me!

440
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,959
- Come on!
- Austin, stop!

441
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,295
Austin, you’re drunk!

442
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,963
Elyse, just one kiss.

443
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,631
It’s my birthday.
Just one kiss!

444
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:35,009
- Austin, let go of me please.
- Give me a chance, please.

445
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,362
- Let go of me!
- Give me a chance.

446
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,679
Let go of me, you’re hurting me.

447
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,598
Please, just give me a chance.

448
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,057
- Let go!
- I really like you.

449
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,309
- Let go of me!
- Just say you like me!

450
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,227
- Just say you like me!
- Austin, stop!

451
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,104
- You’re scaring me!
- Please, I’m begging you!

452
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,105
- I’m begging—
- Austin!

453
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:55,322
Never, ever touch Elyse again!

454
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,247
Thanks for picking me up.

455
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,132
I just went with Austin
because it’s his birthday.

456
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,802
We just had dinner with his dad

457
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:03,014
and then we went here to have a few drinks.

458
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,477
Hey…

459
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,146
Are you mad at me?

460
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:14,984
Annoyed?

461
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,489
I feel like you’re mad at me.

462
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,157
I’m not.

463
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,013
You’re mad at me.

464
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,433
I'm not mad.

465
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,017
You’re being annoying, Amora.

466
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,394
Amora?

467
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,690
Why are you calling me
by my first name now,

468
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,023
Sebastian?

469
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,109
You’re just drunk.

470
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,028
Just tell me that you’re mad at me.

471
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,490
Elyse, I’m not mad.

472
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,700
I hope you sleep well tomorrow,

473
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,995
I hope your food tastes good tomorrow,

474
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,564
and I hope your pinky toe never
hits the edge of a table

475
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:11,841
for the rest of your life.

476
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:16,421
And now you’re being sarcastic.

477
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,005
What the...

478
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,298
You’re so stubborn.

479
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:23,510
Just admit that
you're angry, okay?

480
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,263
That you're jealous.

481
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:28,767
Why would I be jealous?
That guy’s ugly.

482
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,060
My elbow looks better than him.

483
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,187
And no matter who the guy is,

484
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,981
I wouldn’t be jealous.

485
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,984
There’s nothing between us.

486
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:41,487
So, just do whatever
you want, Elyse.

487
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,114
I don’t care.

488
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:46,409
Really?

489
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,619
Yes.

490
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,667
And you know what,

491
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:56,988
you two actually suit each other.

492
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,966
Where are you going?

493
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,739
I’ll look for a hotel

494
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,931
where I can get some good sleep.

495
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,743
All right, meeting adjourned.

496
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,118
Thank you, ma’am.

497
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,120
Thank you, ma’am.

498
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,804
Elyse, can we talk?

499
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,974
I have nothing to say to you.

500
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,393
Elyse, I’m sorry.

501
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:59,231
I know being drunk is not an excuse.

502
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,942
I was out of my mind.

503
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,779
I shouldn’t have touched you like that.

504
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,489
I tried to kiss you,

505
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:07,824
hug you…

506
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:12,160
I’m very sorry, Elyse.
Please forgive me.

507
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,162
I can’t even look at him.

508
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:17,083
What will it take for
him to leave me alone?

509
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,126
Apology accepted.

510
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,004
Now, can you please leave?

511
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,095
Engineer Camero,

512
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:30,804
your ex...

513
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,893
I remember him picking you up.

514
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,146
Are you guys back together?

515
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,691
No.

516
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:45,278
He only picked me up
because I couldn’t drive.

517
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,072
Besides, it’s none of your business.

518
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,784
Ely, he’s not good for you.

519
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,454
I am better than him.

520
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,665
If you give me a chance,

521
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,210
you won’t regret it
for the rest of your life.

522
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:17,101
This is my advance birthday gift for you.

523
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,436
Open it.

524
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,610
I can’t accept this, Austin.

525
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,237
You are just a colleague to me.

526
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:31,698
I’ve already made myself
clear on this many times.

527
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,699
Why?

528
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:36,162
Are you still hoping that
you two will get back together?

529
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,372
That person has hurt you too much already.

530
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,750
That is enough, Austin.

531
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,710
I am done talking to you.

532
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,253
Just leave.

533
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,255
Now.

534
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,088
He’s still not here?

535
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:39,559
He’s usually home by now.

536
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:07,086
Why do I feel this way?

537
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:38,862
Ida…

538
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,780
Hi.

539
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,950
Ely!

540
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,160
What’s the new development?

541
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,621
Has he come home yet?

542
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,583
Not yet.

543
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:54,169
You know, it’s been two weeks
since I’ve seen him.

544
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,254
And I don’t even see him at the office

545
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:58,299
because he’s always at the site.

546
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,801
Do you miss him?

547
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,560
Honestly,

548
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,854
I don’t know.

549
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:19,904
I honestly feel so unsure
about how I feel towards him.

550
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,450
I don’t know if I miss him,

551
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,371
or if I just don’t want to be alone.

552
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,581
I knew it.

553
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,376
You knew what?

554
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,628
That you still love Sevi.

555
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:40,675
From the moment you decided to live
with him again in that condo,

556
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,804
I knew it and felt it already.

557
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:48,224
So to answer your question,
yes to both.

558
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,767
You miss him and you
don’t want to be alone

559
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:55,314
because he’s the one who
makes you feel happy and safe.

560
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,607
Ely, be honest to yourself.

561
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,695
There’s no use denying it now.

562
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,407
So?

563
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,994
What are you going to do about it?

564
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,495
I...

565
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,416
I don’t know.

566
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:18,796
I don’t even know how
he feels towards me.

567
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,522
Sevi?

568
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:43,321
Hey!

569
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,156
What happened?

570
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,077
I can't find my keys.

571
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,122
Are you drunk?

572
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,711
Just a bit, bro.

573
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,503
Bro?

574
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,090
Oh my god, you are drunk.

575
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,177
Just tipsy.

576
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:11,474
I was drinking with Arkin and Theo.

577
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,853
I have a question for you, Elyse.

578
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,231
Are you a circle?

579
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:21,649
What?

580
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,112
‘Cause you look hot.

581
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,743
I don’t get it.
Let’s go.

582
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:32,744
Let’s go.

583
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:33,995
Come on.

584
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,501
Get up.

585
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,793
Okay.

586
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:43,255
360 degrees.

587
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,759
Okay.

588
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,558
Okay...

589
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,520
Let’s get you cleaned up.

590
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,396
Come on.

591
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,564
Watch your step.

592
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,030
Slowly…

593
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:09,781
Okay…

594
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,241
Okay…

595
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,536
Careful.

596
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:14,912
Okay, sleep here.

597
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,079
Sleep here.

598
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,713
I will get you water.

599
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,762
Hold on.

600
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:46,276
Can you drink some water?

601
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,987
Can you hold this in your hand?

602
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,249
Okay…

603
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,003
It’s okay.

604
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,280
Hey...

605
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,866
What are you doing?

606
00:41:35,102 --> 00:41:36,562
You little pervert…

607
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,913
You smell awful.

608
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,749
You need to change your shirt.

609
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,670
You know…

610
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,423
You two don’t suit each other.

611
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:52,927
I know.

612
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,262
I didn’t give him a chance.

613
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,972
And I will never give him a chance.

614
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:58,973
Just so you know.

615
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,476
I know.

616
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,603
I can tell.

617
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:08,025
Come on, let’s get you to bed.

618
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:16,158
I miss you.

619
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,666
You seem to have
enjoyed seeing my big bird.

620
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,710
FYI,

621
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,753
it’s a baby bird.

622
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,338
You know,

623
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,591
big bird doesn’t like liars.

624
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,468
He’s an angry bird now.

625
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,138
Surprise!

626
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,682
Happy birthday, Ely.

627
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:23,891
I’m sorry.

628
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,143
Don’t you like it?

629
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,606
I didn’t expect you to
remember my birthday.

630
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,858
- Happy birthday!
- Ida?

631
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,943
The best surprise ever.

632
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,529
But maybe I’m just not good for him.

633
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:39,617
But you left without saying anything.

634
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:40,784
Don’t be sad.

635
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,703
I have a surprise for you.

636
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:46,373
- Ely?
- Shan! Hiro!

637
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,125
I thought you and Elyse were okay?

638
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,918
I thought so too.

639
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,171
But then she suddenly left.
