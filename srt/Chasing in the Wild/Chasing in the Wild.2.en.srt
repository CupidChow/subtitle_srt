1
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:12,182
To our very beautiful debutante,

2
00:00:12,207 --> 00:00:15,327
Miss Elyse Ledezma.

3
00:00:15,327 --> 00:00:18,372
Larkin Sanchez,
it’s your turn

4
00:00:18,372 --> 00:00:20,717
to dance with our debutante.

5
00:00:21,665 --> 00:00:23,032
Who the fuck are you?

6
00:00:24,293 --> 00:00:25,252
Ouch!

7
00:00:25,277 --> 00:00:28,482
You’re holding me like you
never want to let me go.

8
00:00:28,507 --> 00:00:29,508
Go, you prick!

9
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:32,077
Happy birthday to me!

10
00:00:32,102 --> 00:00:33,283
Hey, you!

11
00:00:33,543 --> 00:00:35,086
We need to talk!

12
00:00:35,111 --> 00:00:36,237
Fuck—

13
00:00:37,892 --> 00:00:39,101
I’m sorry about your coat.

14
00:00:39,101 --> 00:00:41,256
But don’t worry about it,
I’ll have it dry-cleaned.

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,380
No need. It’s okay.

16
00:00:44,356 --> 00:00:45,858
Happy birthday, Elisa.

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,401
What?

18
00:00:47,858 --> 00:00:48,859
Elyse, bro.

19
00:00:50,976 --> 00:00:52,259
Happy birthday,

20
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:54,075
Elyse bro.

21
00:00:55,034 --> 00:00:57,203
@sevirous: I need my coat.

22
00:00:57,244 --> 00:00:58,287
Here's your coat.

23
00:00:58,496 --> 00:00:59,872
Hey, thank you.

24
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:01,874
There's a good beef and
egg fried rice place nearby.

25
00:01:01,874 --> 00:01:02,750
It’s good.

26
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,335
Come on, I’ll treat you.

27
00:01:06,045 --> 00:01:07,046
Ouch!

28
00:02:22,705 --> 00:02:23,706
Ouch!

29
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,323
Where are we heading?

30
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,373
There’s a shortcut here.

31
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,330
Okay.

32
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,609
Let's go.

33
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:17,651
Why were we running a while ago?

34
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:21,184
I just have to go back soon.

35
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,090
All right, then.

36
00:03:23,432 --> 00:03:25,976
Welcome to the best fried
rice eatery in Manila.

37
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:27,898
The best?

38
00:03:28,215 --> 00:03:30,508
Have you even tried every restaurant here?

39
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:35,361
You don't have to try every restaurant
to know which one's the best.

40
00:03:35,527 --> 00:03:38,072
But how would you even say
it’s the best though?

41
00:03:38,614 --> 00:03:41,075
‘Cause this is what I like.

42
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:43,327
Just the right blend,

43
00:03:43,535 --> 00:03:45,788
perfect for my taste.

44
00:03:46,312 --> 00:03:48,564
I don’t have to look elsewhere.

45
00:03:49,607 --> 00:03:51,279
You know what, let’s just eat.

46
00:03:51,585 --> 00:03:54,380
Let’s see if you really have good taste.

47
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,532
I swear, this place is delicious.

48
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,263
What are you having?

49
00:04:02,972 --> 00:04:04,473
But where’s the menu?

50
00:04:04,932 --> 00:04:05,975
Waiter?

51
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:08,402
Waiter? Miss? Miss!

52
00:04:08,427 --> 00:04:09,478
Waiter!

53
00:04:09,478 --> 00:04:10,813
What are you doing?

54
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:12,019
What, waiter?

55
00:04:12,564 --> 00:04:15,317
Can you just call the waiter
so we can order?

56
00:04:15,377 --> 00:04:17,004
That’s not how it goes here.

57
00:04:17,094 --> 00:04:19,930
This isn’t some fancy, fine dining.

58
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,365
I’m sorry.

59
00:04:21,365 --> 00:04:22,992
It’s my first time here.

60
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:27,288
We need to go to the vendor
to order what we want.

61
00:04:28,274 --> 00:04:30,151
Well then, I’ll just get the bestseller.

62
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:32,393
Beef and egg fried rice it is!

63
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,646
Okay, fine. And,

64
00:04:34,753 --> 00:04:36,880
it comes with egg, right?

65
00:04:38,048 --> 00:04:40,259
Yes, that’s what I just said.

66
00:04:40,426 --> 00:04:43,053
Okay, well then,
I’ll have my egg poached.

67
00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:44,553
Huh?

68
00:04:45,405 --> 00:04:46,959
Don’t you want it on the plate?

69
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:49,727
Huh? What are you saying?

70
00:04:49,727 --> 00:04:51,395
You just said—

71
00:04:52,489 --> 00:04:53,823
pouched egg.

72
00:04:56,515 --> 00:04:57,516
Poached,

73
00:04:57,596 --> 00:04:59,015
not pouched.

74
00:04:59,137 --> 00:05:00,722
Why do you want it in a pouch?

75
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,533
Poached egg.

76
00:05:05,301 --> 00:05:07,595
You know what,
just go order your usual

77
00:05:07,595 --> 00:05:10,514
and let’s see if your

78
00:05:10,514 --> 00:05:13,976
beef, fried rice, and egg is really good.

79
00:05:16,938 --> 00:05:19,315
Even if we bet on it,

80
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,029
my beef, fried rice,
and egg won’t disappoint.

81
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:31,661
So, it’s really your first time in
a place like this?

82
00:05:32,578 --> 00:05:33,578
Yes.

83
00:05:34,497 --> 00:05:36,707
I did eat at something like this in France,

84
00:05:36,707 --> 00:05:38,793
at kiosks along the street.

85
00:05:38,793 --> 00:05:39,961
Wow!

86
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:41,212
France!

87
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:43,130
French fries is all I know.

88
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,341
That’s not even French.

89
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:46,842
It has French in its name so—

90
00:05:47,343 --> 00:05:48,844
Go complain to France.

91
00:05:50,429 --> 00:05:53,933
It's already hot in here,
and you keep pissing me off.

92
00:05:54,642 --> 00:05:56,227
Grumpy little kid.

93
00:05:56,352 --> 00:05:58,437
Excuse me,

94
00:05:58,437 --> 00:06:00,564
you know that I just turned 18.

95
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:03,276
Right—

96
00:06:03,776 --> 00:06:06,028
You’re not a kid anymore.

97
00:06:13,246 --> 00:06:14,257
Thank you.

98
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:21,794
Smells good, right?

99
00:06:22,846 --> 00:06:24,681
Yes, it smells good.

100
00:06:25,548 --> 00:06:27,383
but it doesn't mean it tastes good.

101
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:30,219
I told you, didn’t I?

102
00:06:30,886 --> 00:06:34,724
I’m willing to
bet on how good this is.

103
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:37,435
Sure.

104
00:06:38,602 --> 00:06:42,064
But if this doesn’t taste good,

105
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:46,819
you’ll have to wear green at
the cheer dance competition.

106
00:06:49,655 --> 00:06:51,115
Okay.

107
00:06:52,116 --> 00:06:53,617
But if it’s delicious,

108
00:06:54,327 --> 00:06:57,204
you'll have to wear a
Panthers shirt to my next game.

109
00:06:59,874 --> 00:07:01,042
Deal?

110
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:02,960
Okay.

111
00:07:03,252 --> 00:07:04,128
Okay!

112
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,630
Let’s get this started, then.

113
00:07:15,014 --> 00:07:16,515
You’re eating with your hands?

114
00:07:17,058 --> 00:07:18,976
Should I use my feet?

115
00:07:20,102 --> 00:07:22,313
Did you even wash your hands at least?

116
00:07:22,563 --> 00:07:25,066
Of course! Right after I paid.

117
00:07:25,397 --> 00:07:27,358
How dirty do you think I am?

118
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,758
Well?

119
00:07:51,175 --> 00:07:52,343
Is it good?

120
00:07:54,887 --> 00:07:56,806
Do you have an extra Panthers shirt?

121
00:07:57,765 --> 00:07:59,225
I told you.

122
00:07:59,475 --> 00:08:00,810
What’s your size?

123
00:08:01,102 --> 00:08:03,687
Wait, can we do a different dare instead?

124
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:05,689
It’s embarrassing.

125
00:08:05,773 --> 00:08:07,400
What are my friends going to think?

126
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,320
I go to a different school but
I’m supporting the Panthers?

127
00:08:12,477 --> 00:08:13,645
Isn’t

128
00:08:14,782 --> 00:08:19,036
it more embarrassing
to back out of a deal?

129
00:08:19,412 --> 00:08:21,163
A deal is a deal.

130
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,628
Do you have a size small?

131
00:08:30,548 --> 00:08:33,384
Do you have some change?

132
00:08:33,884 --> 00:08:35,719
Do you have some change?

133
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:37,346
Wow, you finished it.

134
00:08:37,346 --> 00:08:39,723
Do you have some change?

135
00:08:40,683 --> 00:08:42,810
Just to buy some food.

136
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,062
You haven’t eaten?

137
00:08:45,187 --> 00:08:47,773
No, since last night.

138
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:00,661
Okay, here.

139
00:09:00,686 --> 00:09:04,607
Wow, Thank you!
I can finally eat.

140
00:09:04,957 --> 00:09:07,793
You should buy the beef and
egg fried rice, it’s delicious.

141
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:09,634
I’m sure you’ll enjoy it.

142
00:09:09,795 --> 00:09:11,338
Thank you.

143
00:09:18,804 --> 00:09:22,808
So, do you want to try
the best rice cake in Manila?

144
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,853
I have to go home.

145
00:09:26,896 --> 00:09:29,273
Oh right, you just snuck me away.

146
00:09:29,982 --> 00:09:31,233
Excuse me?

147
00:09:36,822 --> 00:09:38,282
Roel: Ma’am Elyse, where are you?

148
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:40,367
Mom: Ely, where are you?

149
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:41,660
How are you going home?

150
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:43,078
Want me to take you?

151
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:44,371
No, I’m good.

152
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:48,959
My friend’s driver is on his way here.

153
00:09:50,836 --> 00:09:52,087
Okay,

154
00:09:52,087 --> 00:09:54,757
I’ll just give you the
Panthers shirt next time.

155
00:09:55,925 --> 00:09:57,009
Okay.

156
00:09:58,636 --> 00:09:59,637
By the way,

157
00:10:00,012 --> 00:10:01,013
I enjoyed the food.

158
00:10:02,473 --> 00:10:04,725
I think I should try the other meals here.

159
00:10:10,481 --> 00:10:12,733
I’ll go now, the car’s here.

160
00:10:15,051 --> 00:10:16,344
All right, take care.

161
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:26,330
Do you have a crush on that girl?
She’s really pretty.

162
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,916
And kind.

163
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,543
You two look good together.

164
00:10:38,092 --> 00:10:40,052
How did you lose her, Roel?

165
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:44,014
If this happens again,
you’ll lose your job!

166
00:10:50,437 --> 00:10:52,273
Elyse, come here.

167
00:10:59,446 --> 00:11:00,531
You can go, Roel.

168
00:11:07,288 --> 00:11:08,289
What happened?

169
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:10,124
Why did you ditch Roel?

170
00:11:15,504 --> 00:11:16,964
I just wanted to eat.

171
00:11:16,964 --> 00:11:18,966
Then eat with the bodyguard around.

172
00:11:19,216 --> 00:11:20,593
Can’t you do that?

173
00:11:21,885 --> 00:11:23,895
I know, Dad. I’m sorry.

174
00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:25,556
I don’t understand.

175
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,683
You never did this before.

176
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,811
Do you have any idea how dangerous
it is for someone like you

177
00:11:30,811 --> 00:11:33,147
to roam around the streets
without a bodyguard?

178
00:11:33,355 --> 00:11:35,024
What if something happened to you?

179
00:11:35,608 --> 00:11:37,276
I just wanted to be alone.

180
00:11:37,276 --> 00:11:38,193
Alone?

181
00:11:38,193 --> 00:11:40,404
And when you’re alone,
what do you do?

182
00:11:41,196 --> 00:11:42,906
Spend money recklessly?

183
00:11:43,532 --> 00:11:45,492
I just saw your credit card statement.

184
00:11:45,492 --> 00:11:46,952
Your bill is huge.

185
00:11:47,661 --> 00:11:51,999
I just wanted to treat myself
because it was my birthday.

186
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,417
Birthday?

187
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:56,378
How many more days?

188
00:11:56,378 --> 00:11:58,505
You’ve been shopping almost everyday

189
00:11:58,756 --> 00:12:01,008
since the first week of your birthday.

190
00:12:01,342 --> 00:12:03,594
You’re giving me a headache, Elyse!

191
00:12:07,056 --> 00:12:08,432
Give me your credit card.

192
00:12:08,682 --> 00:12:09,350
But, Dad—

193
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,101
I said, give me your credit card!

194
00:12:26,742 --> 00:12:29,453
You won’t get this back
until you’ve learned your lesson.

195
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,918
Look, Elyse…

196
00:12:36,835 --> 00:12:39,004
You’ll be handling our companies very soon.

197
00:12:40,005 --> 00:12:42,841
Especially since it looks like
I can’t count on your brother anymore.

198
00:12:43,175 --> 00:12:47,179
I just want you to learn how to control
yourself when it comes to spending.

199
00:12:48,222 --> 00:12:51,850
Just because we gave you a credit card
and have the means to pay for it,

200
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,435
doesn’t mean you can spend recklessly.

201
00:12:53,686 --> 00:12:56,105
If you can’t manage your behavior,

202
00:12:56,105 --> 00:12:59,692
then I don’t think you’re fit to be
the next CEO of our companies.

203
00:13:02,111 --> 00:13:03,362
I know, Dad, I’m—

204
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:04,571
I’m sorry.

205
00:13:04,905 --> 00:13:06,824
It won’t happen again.

206
00:13:29,054 --> 00:13:30,305
Elyse…

207
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,058
What happened, my dear?

208
00:13:35,018 --> 00:13:37,229
I’m sorry, Mom.

209
00:13:39,022 --> 00:13:41,233
Why did you run off without Roel?

210
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:42,693
It’s so unlike you.

211
00:13:43,026 --> 00:13:46,655
I just want to eat with
a new friend at the gym.

212
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:50,409
So, a new friend means
you’ll disobey us?

213
00:13:51,535 --> 00:13:53,746
Elyse, I’m not mad.

214
00:13:53,746 --> 00:13:55,330
I’m just concerned.

215
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:57,040
It’s not like that.

216
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,460
I’m young and...

217
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,756
I just want to experience
life like other people do.

218
00:14:04,173 --> 00:14:05,507
Sweetheart,

219
00:14:06,175 --> 00:14:08,385
I’m happy you’re making new friends.

220
00:14:08,635 --> 00:14:10,846
But why didn’t you just tell us?

221
00:14:11,096 --> 00:14:14,600
You could at least tell
Roel so we don't have to worry.

222
00:14:15,058 --> 00:14:18,187
I didn’t think it was that big of a deal.

223
00:14:18,312 --> 00:14:21,440
It’s just that Dad is so strict.

224
00:14:22,316 --> 00:14:25,444
Sweetheart,
he’s strict because he cares about you.

225
00:14:25,694 --> 00:14:27,029
Same goes for me.

226
00:14:27,404 --> 00:14:29,782
I was so afraid something
might have happened to you.

227
00:14:30,407 --> 00:14:32,367
That's why, at least tell Roel.

228
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:35,579
I’m sorry, Mom.

229
00:14:38,123 --> 00:14:39,541
I know you’re young.

230
00:14:41,126 --> 00:14:42,834
You wanna enjoy things.

231
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:47,424
I was like that too when I was younger.

232
00:14:49,134 --> 00:14:51,635
Wow, so I got it from you?

233
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,144
Let’s just say that.

234
00:14:55,378 --> 00:14:56,296
But—

235
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,393
A reminder, just…

236
00:14:59,102 --> 00:15:01,146
do things with control.

237
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,065
Yes, Mom.

238
00:15:03,607 --> 00:15:07,194
And I promise that
I won’t break your trust.

239
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:09,905
Okay.

240
00:15:11,573 --> 00:15:13,283
Sweetheart, always remember…

241
00:15:14,451 --> 00:15:16,161
I’ll always be here for you.

242
00:15:18,163 --> 00:15:20,916
I’ll always have your back no matter what.

243
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:22,780
And please,

244
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:25,505
consider me as your best friend, too.

245
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:28,090
Even if I’m your mom, okay?

246
00:15:28,465 --> 00:15:29,633
Thank you, Mommy.

247
00:15:30,205 --> 00:15:32,081
I just needed to hear that.

248
00:15:33,637 --> 00:15:34,638
Okay.

249
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:37,683
So—

250
00:15:41,353 --> 00:15:42,855
who’s the new friend?

251
00:15:48,277 --> 00:15:49,319
Okay guys,

252
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:50,904
our goal this season,

253
00:15:51,071 --> 00:15:54,116
of course is to win the championship
for our school.

254
00:15:54,116 --> 00:15:57,536
We may not be the tallest or
the biggest players.

255
00:15:58,495 --> 00:16:00,455
But of course, we have this—

256
00:16:00,956 --> 00:16:01,999
our hearts!

257
00:16:02,165 --> 00:16:04,585
Being in the squad is not about

258
00:16:04,918 --> 00:16:06,169
the dance,

259
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:07,212
the stunts…

260
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:10,757
It’s about uplifting our school spirit.

261
00:16:10,841 --> 00:16:13,093
Supporting our athletes.

262
00:16:13,093 --> 00:16:18,473
Let us show the Arrows community
that we are proud of them.

263
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,103
Let’s show them what it means
to be a true Arrow.

264
00:16:23,103 --> 00:16:25,898
We’ll give our hearts to
the game we love the most.

265
00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:29,526
So let’s just trust each other, brothers.

266
00:16:30,027 --> 00:16:30,919
Okay?

267
00:16:30,944 --> 00:16:32,613
We can do this.

268
00:16:32,613 --> 00:16:33,947
Panthers on three—

269
00:16:34,323 --> 00:16:35,365
Understood?

270
00:16:35,574 --> 00:16:36,199
Yes, Coach.

271
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:37,826
I want it louder.

272
00:16:38,035 --> 00:16:39,202
Yes, Coach!

273
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,371
One, two, three—

274
00:16:41,371 --> 00:16:42,539
Panthers!

275
00:16:43,665 --> 00:16:45,334
Good practice.

276
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:46,543
Hands up.

277
00:16:47,044 --> 00:16:48,170
Home in three.

278
00:16:48,503 --> 00:16:49,713
One, two—

279
00:16:49,713 --> 00:16:50,923
Home!

280
00:16:50,923 --> 00:16:52,549
Bye, guys! Take care.

281
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,608
Bye, Coach!

282
00:16:54,635 --> 00:16:55,719
- Bye!
- Bye!

283
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:56,970
- Be safe!
- Take care!

284
00:16:57,387 --> 00:16:58,263
Bye!

285
00:16:58,597 --> 00:16:59,139
Take care!

286
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:00,015
Bye-bye!

287
00:17:00,098 --> 00:17:01,224
See you, see you tomorrow.

288
00:17:01,224 --> 00:17:02,351
See you!

289
00:17:03,101 --> 00:17:05,896
‘Cause I’m gonna see my boyfriend later.

290
00:17:07,981 --> 00:17:12,569
@sevirous: You might want to know that
we're training for the game this Saturday,

291
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:16,323
where you'll be wearing the Panthers shirt.

292
00:17:19,961 --> 00:17:22,881
@elydezma: You haven’t given me the shirt.

293
00:17:25,777 --> 00:17:27,077
[phone notification]

294
00:17:34,732 --> 00:17:37,260
Coach just talked about
supporting our team.

295
00:17:37,693 --> 00:17:39,805
Then I’ll support the Panthers’ game?

296
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:42,785
What will my teammates think?

297
00:17:44,592 --> 00:17:45,745
I hate this.

298
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,054
@elyledezma: Whatever.

299
00:17:53,347 --> 00:17:55,724
@elyledezma: I thought you were training
right now?

300
00:17:56,327 --> 00:17:59,122
@elyledezma: You can dribble while typing?
Stupid ass.

301
00:18:02,105 --> 00:18:04,232
@sevirous: Maybe I can.

302
00:18:06,944 --> 00:18:09,184
@sevirous: Let’s just
meet up so I can give

303
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,448
you the shirt you’ll be
wearing at our game.

304
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,134
OMG, Ely.

305
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,410
Who are you chatting with?

306
00:18:15,435 --> 00:18:17,395
Is that the captain of the Panthers?

307
00:18:17,746 --> 00:18:19,706
No, it’s not what you think.

308
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,501
There’s nothing going
on between Sevi and I.

309
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,795
Jeez! It’s okay, baby girl.

310
00:18:24,795 --> 00:18:28,440
We all fall for basketball
players sometimes.

311
00:18:28,465 --> 00:18:31,760
And it’s okay if you like
the captain of the Panthers.

312
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,179
Or even date them.

313
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,198
But,

314
00:18:35,223 --> 00:18:38,642
remember what Coach Tina said
about our loyalty?

315
00:18:38,642 --> 00:18:40,602
Being loyal to our school is vital.

316
00:18:40,602 --> 00:18:42,938
Especially if you’re in the cheer squad.

317
00:18:43,535 --> 00:18:44,535
[phone notification]

318
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:49,619
@sevirous: See you later!

319
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:01,873
Damn, she didn’t even reply.

320
00:19:08,588 --> 00:19:12,088
@sevirous: I’m here,
just in case you’ll come.

321
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:16,430
@sevirous: But if you’re
not coming, it’s fine.

322
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,408
@sevirous: I’ll just get
rid of this shirt, kidding.

323
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,203
@sevirous: Besides,
the coffee here is good.

324
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:24,405
@sevirous: I came here
for the coffee anyway.

325
00:19:36,144 --> 00:19:37,257
Thank goodness.

326
00:19:40,537 --> 00:19:42,664
Wrong timing, Luna.

327
00:19:44,624 --> 00:19:46,562
Luna? What’s up?

328
00:19:46,587 --> 00:19:48,170
You weren’t replying to our group chat.

329
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:50,005
So, are we drinking tonight?

330
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,645
I think I’ll pass.

331
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:55,427
I’m tired from training.

332
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,238
- Jeez!
- Come on.

333
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:58,388
Just say that you have a date.

334
00:19:58,388 --> 00:20:00,307
Reply to the group chat
if you’ll be joining us.

335
00:20:00,307 --> 00:20:02,100
Okay, fine. You talk too much.

336
00:20:03,685 --> 00:20:05,312
I’ll try to come later.

337
00:20:06,063 --> 00:20:07,355
Okay.

338
00:20:29,586 --> 00:20:31,379
Hey! It’s Camero!

339
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,038
Camero!

340
00:20:33,063 --> 00:20:34,356
We’re huge fans.

341
00:20:34,665 --> 00:20:36,073
Can we take a picture?

342
00:20:37,552 --> 00:20:38,754
Do you want me to take it,
or should I be in it too?

343
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,198
Of course, you'll be in it.
You're our idol.

344
00:20:41,295 --> 00:20:42,462
Come on!

345
00:20:42,516 --> 00:20:44,101
Ready!

346
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:46,703
My turn!

347
00:20:47,521 --> 00:20:49,356
Oh my god, you’re so handsome!

348
00:20:50,219 --> 00:20:51,554
I’ll take a selfie.

349
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,638
Let’s go?

350
00:21:21,638 --> 00:21:23,056
- Thank you, captain!
- Thank you!

351
00:21:23,056 --> 00:21:24,099
Thanks a lot and take care!

352
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:24,558
Bye-bye!

353
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:25,976
Bye!

354
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:32,607
I thought you weren’t coming.

355
00:21:33,024 --> 00:21:34,276
I was about to leave.

356
00:21:34,276 --> 00:21:35,902
I was planning to come.

357
00:21:35,902 --> 00:21:38,113
I just wasn’t able to reply.

358
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,617
But I’m not here for you
I’m here for our deal.

359
00:21:44,563 --> 00:21:46,523
A deal is a deal after all.

360
00:21:47,664 --> 00:21:49,166
A deal is a deal.

361
00:21:53,128 --> 00:21:55,547
What about him?
Will he just stay there?

362
00:21:56,673 --> 00:22:00,677
He said he’ll just stay there in case
I ditch him again.

363
00:22:01,344 --> 00:22:04,556
Right, you might sneak me away again.

364
00:22:06,141 --> 00:22:08,476
You know,
I think you need a facial

365
00:22:08,476 --> 00:22:10,937
because you’re too thick-skinned.

366
00:22:14,316 --> 00:22:16,318
Come on! Take a seat.

367
00:22:19,362 --> 00:22:20,655
What do you want?

368
00:22:20,655 --> 00:22:21,224
I’ll treat you.

369
00:22:21,249 --> 00:22:23,631
I still have enough from
my player allowance.

370
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,077
You don’t have to, I have money.

371
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,330
Come on.

372
00:22:28,371 --> 00:22:29,915
No need to be coy about it.

373
00:22:30,457 --> 00:22:31,416
Okay.

374
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,544
I do like an iced matcha latte.

375
00:22:35,045 --> 00:22:37,172
Okay, then. Wait there.

376
00:22:42,177 --> 00:22:43,929
What’s with the cookies?

377
00:22:44,346 --> 00:22:46,264
The lady vendor gave me some.

378
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,558
She said I was cute.

379
00:22:50,227 --> 00:22:51,728
Why is there an extra drink?

380
00:22:53,396 --> 00:22:54,522
For him.

381
00:22:54,522 --> 00:22:55,565
Wait a minute.

382
00:22:55,815 --> 00:22:56,858
I’ll just give it to him.

383
00:23:01,821 --> 00:23:03,865
Sir, have some coffee.

384
00:23:06,368 --> 00:23:08,078
It’s for you.

385
00:23:28,932 --> 00:23:30,809
By the way,

386
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,686
do you have the t-shirt?

387
00:23:32,936 --> 00:23:35,021
Yes, give me a second.

388
00:23:37,357 --> 00:23:39,526
Size extra large.

389
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:41,695
Just kidding.

390
00:23:41,695 --> 00:23:43,863
It’s small, I remembered.

391
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,157
And

392
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:47,971
two tickets.

393
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,453
You’d look pitiful if you’re alone.

394
00:23:50,745 --> 00:23:53,728
Wow, aren’t these hard to get?

395
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,126
Thanks.

396
00:23:56,126 --> 00:23:58,169
Yes, so—

397
00:23:58,169 --> 00:23:59,337
you better come, okay?

398
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:00,839
Promise me.

399
00:24:01,589 --> 00:24:02,882
Of course, I’ll go.

400
00:24:03,258 --> 00:24:05,510
But again, I’m not going for you. Okay?

401
00:24:05,969 --> 00:24:08,054
I’m just going there to fulfill our deal.

402
00:24:08,054 --> 00:24:12,267
Plus I’ll leave early since our deal
is just for me to attend.

403
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,769
All right, then.

404
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,498
Why are we even watching this?

405
00:24:36,082 --> 00:24:38,356
Our school’s not even playing.

406
00:24:39,093 --> 00:24:41,512
I lost a bet, okay?

407
00:24:42,589 --> 00:24:45,008
I thought you transferred already.

408
00:24:45,435 --> 00:24:47,255
I didn’t realize that you’re here to flirt.

409
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:48,595
Huh?

410
00:24:48,595 --> 00:24:49,596
Flirt?

411
00:24:49,596 --> 00:24:50,764
With who?

412
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,141
I’m only here because of a dare.

413
00:24:53,141 --> 00:24:54,726
Not for anyone else.

414
00:24:55,643 --> 00:24:57,312
I’m your best friend, okay?

415
00:24:57,312 --> 00:24:59,481
And I won’t judge if you want

416
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:03,218
to support a hot Panthers player.

417
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:04,736
AKA

418
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:08,531
Sevi Camero. The King Panther.

419
00:25:09,402 --> 00:25:10,987
Would you shut up?

420
00:25:11,034 --> 00:25:13,661
Come on, you won't be doing the dare

421
00:25:13,661 --> 00:25:15,293
if you didn't have a crush on him.

422
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:17,415
Oh my god,

423
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:20,062
I told you that I’m only
here to fulfill a dare.

424
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:21,061
And that’s it!

425
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,921
Besides, I’m not here for anyone else

426
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:25,965
because I am loyal to Team Arrows.

427
00:25:25,965 --> 00:25:27,384
As if.

428
00:25:28,423 --> 00:25:30,303
[crowd cheering]

429
00:25:35,097 --> 00:25:37,727
You know, let’s just cheer for them

430
00:25:37,727 --> 00:25:39,562
since we’re already here.

431
00:25:41,231 --> 00:25:44,301
How? We don’t even know the other cheers.

432
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:47,780
Girl, I already memorized
the cheers earlier.

433
00:25:48,196 --> 00:25:49,572
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

434
00:25:49,572 --> 00:25:50,281
What?

435
00:25:50,281 --> 00:25:53,635
P-A-N-T-H-E-R-S!

436
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:57,080
Roar! We’re Panthers,
we are always the best!

437
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,999
Fight and win, we never rest!

438
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:03,294
Yellow pride, we are the best!

439
00:26:03,294 --> 00:26:04,712
Roar!

440
00:26:06,237 --> 00:26:08,906
See? I told you.

441
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:12,220
Go, Sevi!

442
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,214
Let’s go, Panthers!

443
00:26:17,392 --> 00:26:18,893
You traitor.

444
00:26:18,893 --> 00:26:21,604
You shout louder than
the real Panthers here.

445
00:26:21,837 --> 00:26:24,639
Come on. Go cheer for them, too.

446
00:26:24,664 --> 00:26:26,664
No, I'm not cheering for them.

447
00:26:26,689 --> 00:26:28,340
Let’s go!

448
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:32,031
They’re here!

449
00:26:32,031 --> 00:26:33,825
They are here!

450
00:26:34,075 --> 00:26:36,035
Let’s go!

451
00:26:38,012 --> 00:26:39,973
Let’s go Panthers!

452
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,666
Sevi!

453
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:58,433
Go, Sevi!

454
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,988
Is he waving at you?

455
00:27:18,077 --> 00:27:19,496
Who’s that?

456
00:27:19,496 --> 00:27:20,955
Who’s he waving at?

457
00:27:22,499 --> 00:27:24,334
Girl, he’s waving at you!

458
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:26,127
Hey, stop it.

459
00:27:26,127 --> 00:27:28,046
I feel like a traitor right now.

460
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:36,260
You’re really here to support Camero.

461
00:27:36,426 --> 00:27:39,070
Just drop the lame excuses already.

462
00:27:39,103 --> 00:27:40,517
You’re so stubborn!

463
00:27:40,517 --> 00:27:43,265
I’m here just to fulfill a deal.

464
00:27:43,724 --> 00:27:46,643
Just join us and cheer for them.

465
00:27:47,006 --> 00:27:48,508
It’s so simple.

466
00:27:48,821 --> 00:27:49,947
No one from our school

467
00:27:49,972 --> 00:27:51,474
is going to see you.

468
00:27:51,945 --> 00:27:52,900
Come on.

469
00:27:52,925 --> 00:27:54,510
Let’s go, Panthers!

470
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:57,992
Go, go, Sevi!

471
00:27:58,017 --> 00:28:00,097
Don’t be too hard on our team!

472
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,624
Let’s go!

473
00:28:09,459 --> 00:28:10,961
Go, Panthers.

474
00:28:11,172 --> 00:28:12,423
Yes!

475
00:28:12,423 --> 00:28:14,342
Let’s go!

476
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,518
Let’s go, Panthers!

477
00:28:25,096 --> 00:28:26,396
Let’s go!

478
00:28:30,525 --> 00:28:32,652
Yes!

479
00:28:40,225 --> 00:28:42,769
Defense! Defense!

480
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:45,832
Defense! Defense!

481
00:28:46,332 --> 00:28:48,876
Defense! Defense!

482
00:28:51,043 --> 00:28:52,420
Let’s go!

483
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:08,938
Defense! Defense! Defense!

484
00:29:08,938 --> 00:29:10,398
Go, Camero!

485
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:15,945
Defense! Defense! Defense!

486
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:21,451
Defense! Defense! Defense!

487
00:29:29,316 --> 00:29:31,693
- Go, Sevi!
- Sevi!

488
00:29:32,462 --> 00:29:36,214
Defense! Defense! Defense! Defense!

489
00:29:45,642 --> 00:29:47,226
Dos, defense!

490
00:29:48,811 --> 00:29:51,189
Defense! Defense! Defense! Defense!

491
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:54,776
- Panthers! Panthers!
- Go, Camero!

492
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:30,853
Defense! Defense! Defense! Defense!

493
00:30:32,355 --> 00:30:35,817
Defense! Defense! Defense! Defense!

494
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:41,948
Ramon, defense!

495
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:53,584
Oh, shit.

496
00:31:16,315 --> 00:31:20,111
Defense! Defense! Defense! Defense!

497
00:31:20,451 --> 00:31:22,411
I think we need to go.

498
00:31:22,822 --> 00:31:23,781
Let’s just finish it.

499
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,717
The game is almost over anyway.

500
00:31:25,742 --> 00:31:27,243
I feel like they’re going to lose

501
00:31:27,243 --> 00:31:28,911
I can’t watch, let’s just go.

502
00:31:28,936 --> 00:31:30,538
Wait, believe in them.

503
00:31:30,538 --> 00:31:32,373
Let’s finish it.

504
00:31:38,671 --> 00:31:40,423
Go, Sevi!

505
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:08,701
Defense! Defense! Defense!

506
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:11,078
Defense! Defense! Defense!

507
00:32:11,078 --> 00:32:12,246
Go, Sevi!

508
00:32:17,293 --> 00:32:18,461
Go, Sevi!

509
00:32:22,298 --> 00:32:23,466
Go, Sevi!

510
00:32:50,576 --> 00:32:51,369
You lost!

511
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,204
Our school lost.

512
00:32:58,541 --> 00:32:59,478
We won!

513
00:32:59,502 --> 00:33:00,628
We won?

514
00:33:01,337 --> 00:33:03,422
We’re not Panthers, okay?

515
00:33:27,446 --> 00:33:28,446
Nice game.

516
00:33:31,158 --> 00:33:32,243
Hey.

517
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:34,412
Congratulations.

518
00:33:36,163 --> 00:33:37,623
You finished the game.

519
00:33:37,623 --> 00:33:39,208
I thought you were going to leave early.

520
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:41,335
I wanted to, but

521
00:33:41,502 --> 00:33:43,796
Ida insisted that we finish it.

522
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,549
That's my best friend,
by the way.

523
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,801
Congratulations.

524
00:33:49,176 --> 00:33:50,176
Thanks.

525
00:33:51,846 --> 00:33:54,499
Important thing is
that I fulfilled our deal

526
00:33:54,524 --> 00:33:56,693
And look, I wore the shirt.

527
00:34:03,582 --> 00:34:05,042
Sevi, here.

528
00:34:05,067 --> 00:34:07,028
Take a picture, I’ll just send it to you.

529
00:34:07,528 --> 00:34:08,362
There he is—

530
00:34:08,362 --> 00:34:09,030
Wait!

531
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:11,649
I probably look dumb, delete that!

532
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,566
As if! Your face wasn’t even in it.

533
00:34:13,591 --> 00:34:14,618
Can I see?

534
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:17,663
Hey, Sevi!

535
00:34:17,872 --> 00:34:19,605
- Hey!
- Congratulations!

536
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,131
You guys beat us again.

537
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:23,044
Of course!

538
00:34:23,215 --> 00:34:25,050
Where’s Ke?

539
00:34:25,075 --> 00:34:26,422
She went ahead.

540
00:34:26,661 --> 00:34:27,328
I see…

541
00:34:27,572 --> 00:34:28,707
And Luna?

542
00:34:28,841 --> 00:34:30,176
She’s finishing her plates,

543
00:34:30,176 --> 00:34:32,261
didn’t you read her chat?

544
00:34:32,261 --> 00:34:33,012
Right…

545
00:34:33,012 --> 00:34:34,347
Oh yeah, she sent me a message earlier.

546
00:34:35,455 --> 00:34:36,476
You were great earlier.

547
00:34:36,501 --> 00:34:39,150
- Why is he looking for this girl, Luna?
- You were awesome.

548
00:34:39,175 --> 00:34:41,594
My idol!

549
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:43,147
Picture, please!

550
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:44,148
Take a picture with us!

551
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:45,399
So famous.

552
00:34:46,524 --> 00:34:47,610
Oh my god.

553
00:34:47,981 --> 00:34:49,987
Take a photo for me, please.

554
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,457
A photo.

555
00:34:58,245 --> 00:34:59,455
- How about you?
- One more.

556
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,414
One more.

557
00:35:00,748 --> 00:35:01,374
One more.

558
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:06,133
The Panthers are on a winning streak with

559
00:35:06,158 --> 00:35:08,589
Sevi Camero at the helm of the team.

560
00:35:08,798 --> 00:35:10,883
He leads the league in points per game

561
00:35:10,883 --> 00:35:12,426
and the Panthers are currently on

562
00:35:12,426 --> 00:35:14,053
top of the standings.

563
00:35:14,752 --> 00:35:16,906
We are with the Panthers team captain,

564
00:35:16,931 --> 00:35:18,391
Sevi Camero.

565
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:19,284
So Sevi,

566
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,286
What can you say that most likely

567
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:22,787
you will get the MVP

568
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,456
honor at the end of this season?

569
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,794
I’m not aiming to be MVP this season.

570
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:32,764
What’s important is that we bring

571
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,382
the championship to our school.

572
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,176
And if there is an MVP,

573
00:35:36,284 --> 00:35:37,427
it’s my teammates.

574
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:38,678
Come on, everyone!

575
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,349
- Sevi!
- Sevi!

576
00:35:42,414 --> 00:35:45,477
- Sevi!
- Sevi!

577
00:35:45,638 --> 00:35:47,390
Also, our coaches.

578
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,248
So, do you have any message

579
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,107
to your supporters?

580
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,486
To our supporters,

581
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,071
to everyone from our Panthers school,

582
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,614
thank you very much!

583
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,117
- Panthers!
- Panthers!

584
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,870
And even if you’re not our schoolmate,

585
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:06,414
you’re still welcome to support us.

586
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,207
See you at our next game.

587
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,638
Should I chat him

588
00:36:28,663 --> 00:36:30,105
to return that shirt?

589
00:36:31,113 --> 00:36:34,655
He might think that I like
him because I messaged first.

590
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:37,714
Whatever,

591
00:36:37,972 --> 00:36:39,807
I need to get rid of that shirt.

592
00:36:39,832 --> 00:36:42,116
My squad mates might see it.

593
00:36:45,151 --> 00:36:47,158
@elydezma:
I need to return your shirt.

594
00:36:48,766 --> 00:36:49,846
[phone notification]

595
00:36:49,871 --> 00:36:52,043
@sevirous:
Are you sure you want to return it?

596
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:55,093
Wow, that was quick.

597
00:36:57,126 --> 00:36:58,294
@elydezma:
Why not?

598
00:37:00,163 --> 00:37:01,540
@sevirous:
You’ve had it for two weeks now

599
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,625
so I thought you weren’t giving it back.

600
00:37:03,709 --> 00:37:06,378
Maybe you’ve been
using it as pajamas already.

601
00:37:11,593 --> 00:37:13,365
@elydezma:
Eew, you are so disgusting.

602
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:16,310
I’ll shove this shirt down your throat.

603
00:37:18,356 --> 00:37:20,233
@sevirous:
Where is it then? Give it back.

604
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:24,360
@elydezma:
Get it from me.

605
00:37:29,353 --> 00:37:30,854
@sevirous:
Why should I?

606
00:37:31,635 --> 00:37:34,277
@elydezma:
You should come to me since you need it.

607
00:37:34,302 --> 00:37:35,553
This is your shirt.

608
00:37:37,929 --> 00:37:40,223
@sevirous:
You can have it, then.

609
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:41,876
No need to pretend.

610
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,398
Wow! If I don’t give it back,

611
00:37:44,423 --> 00:37:46,825
he will think that I have a crush on him!

612
00:37:49,804 --> 00:37:52,682
Fine. I’ll just go give it to him myself.

613
00:37:53,721 --> 00:37:56,265
My teammates might see him in school

614
00:37:56,265 --> 00:37:58,502
and think something’s going on between us.

615
00:37:59,505 --> 00:38:01,382
@elydezma:
Fine. I’ll go.

616
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:05,049
[phone notification]

617
00:38:05,073 --> 00:38:08,513
@sevirous:
Okay, come to my school. See you at 2PM.

618
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:11,791
God! You’re so annoying!

619
00:38:18,621 --> 00:38:20,798
My balls taste weird. Try it.

620
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:22,625
Your balls?

621
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:23,792
Let me have a sip.

622
00:38:23,918 --> 00:38:26,170
Give me some! I’m choking here.

623
00:38:26,587 --> 00:38:28,422
You should have just ordered.
This isn’t enough for me.

624
00:38:28,422 --> 00:38:31,050
I’m trying to save up, don’t be stingy.

625
00:38:33,631 --> 00:38:34,920
You almost finished it.

626
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:37,723
Why are they sharing a straw?

627
00:38:37,723 --> 00:38:39,558
Are they a couple or something?

628
00:38:42,937 --> 00:38:43,937
Elyse.

629
00:38:49,443 --> 00:38:50,569
Here, your shirt.

630
00:38:50,986 --> 00:38:51,779
Okay.

631
00:38:51,779 --> 00:38:52,488
Bye.

632
00:38:52,821 --> 00:38:53,989
Elyse, wait!

633
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:55,199
What?

634
00:38:55,224 --> 00:38:58,460
I gave you your shirt so I’ll go now.

635
00:38:58,786 --> 00:38:59,578
Huh?

636
00:38:59,745 --> 00:39:00,788
You’re leaving already?

637
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:07,836
Elyse, this is Luna, my best friend.

638
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:09,630
Luna, this is Elyse.

639
00:39:11,077 --> 00:39:13,246
So, this is the famous Luna.

640
00:39:14,499 --> 00:39:17,373
What’s all this about, Sevi?

641
00:39:18,013 --> 00:39:19,885
We just happened to know each other.

642
00:39:23,959 --> 00:39:24,972
Hi!

643
00:39:25,145 --> 00:39:25,843
Hello,

644
00:39:25,868 --> 00:39:27,369
Nice to meet you.

645
00:39:28,152 --> 00:39:30,028
She seems nice.

646
00:39:31,277 --> 00:39:32,436
Have you eaten yet?

647
00:39:33,153 --> 00:39:34,153
Come on, let’s eat.

648
00:39:34,518 --> 00:39:36,228
Asking me out again?

649
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:38,343
I don’t know. I’m on a diet—

650
00:39:38,492 --> 00:39:40,672
And it seems like

651
00:39:40,697 --> 00:39:42,865
you guys are already full.

652
00:39:44,498 --> 00:39:46,667
This? This is just the appetizer.

653
00:39:47,307 --> 00:39:48,307
I’m still hungry.

654
00:39:48,634 --> 00:39:49,712
Well?

655
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:51,254
Do you like me?

656
00:39:52,131 --> 00:39:53,131
Luna.

657
00:39:54,357 --> 00:39:56,651
I’ll go ahead. Going back to class—

658
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:58,721
Nice meeting you.

659
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:01,849
Well?

660
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:03,142
Come on, let’s eat.

661
00:40:03,142 --> 00:40:05,369
Just so you know, I don’t like you.

662
00:40:05,394 --> 00:40:06,394
Okay?

663
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:11,608
Whatever!

664
00:40:11,608 --> 00:40:12,693
Wait.

665
00:40:12,693 --> 00:40:13,777
What?

666
00:40:15,321 --> 00:40:16,907
We don’t have to

667
00:40:16,932 --> 00:40:19,116
like each other

668
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:20,784
to eat together.

669
00:40:23,078 --> 00:40:24,078
So…

670
00:40:24,663 --> 00:40:25,663
come on.

671
00:40:26,623 --> 00:40:28,042
‘Cause I’m hungry.

672
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:29,043
Let’s go.

673
00:40:30,169 --> 00:40:31,169
I’m really hungry.

674
00:40:45,471 --> 00:40:46,973
It's so hot here.

675
00:40:47,263 --> 00:40:48,905
Don’t we have any drinks?

676
00:40:51,473 --> 00:40:52,527
What do you want?

677
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:53,761
I’ll order you a soda

678
00:40:54,107 --> 00:40:55,608
I don’t drink soda.

679
00:40:56,155 --> 00:40:57,310
Is there juice?

680
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,782
They don’t have that here.

681
00:41:00,366 --> 00:41:01,366
What about water?

682
00:41:02,868 --> 00:41:04,968
I don't drink service water either.

683
00:41:06,038 --> 00:41:07,539
Is there bottled water?

684
00:41:08,665 --> 00:41:09,659
No.

685
00:41:09,684 --> 00:41:11,018
They don’t sell that here.

686
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,062
Okay...

687
00:41:16,757 --> 00:41:18,470
I’ll have a soda, then.

688
00:41:19,802 --> 00:41:21,261
Okay, wait.

689
00:41:21,261 --> 00:41:23,020
I’ll buy you bottled water outside.

690
00:41:23,222 --> 00:41:24,098
Okay.

691
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,176
Thank you.

692
00:41:38,445 --> 00:41:41,073
If that’s not enough,
I’ll just buy more.

693
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:46,536
Okay, then.

694
00:41:47,454 --> 00:41:49,706
By the way, where did you buy this?

695
00:41:49,915 --> 00:41:51,207
You took a while.

696
00:41:52,876 --> 00:41:54,086
Just outside.

697
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,046
The line was quite long.

698
00:42:19,324 --> 00:42:21,034
It’s Master… Come on.

699
00:42:22,091 --> 00:42:23,866
Master!

700
00:42:23,904 --> 00:42:24,946
You’re here.

701
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,327
Are you cutting classes again?

702
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:28,662
Fucker, the professor’s absent!

703
00:42:28,662 --> 00:42:29,580
Where are you going?

704
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,747
We’re going to Paci, Master.

705
00:42:31,165 --> 00:42:32,833
Want to join us? Let’s go!

706
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,127
Okay, I’ll follow later.

707
00:42:39,131 --> 00:42:40,507
Master’s busy.

708
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,217
Let’s not bother him anymore.

709
00:42:42,759 --> 00:42:45,179
Dumbass! Go already.

710
00:42:46,346 --> 00:42:48,140
- Yes, Master.
- Yes, Master.

711
00:42:49,016 --> 00:42:50,536
Alright, Take care!

712
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:55,772
Those were my blockmates.

713
00:42:55,772 --> 00:42:56,982
Theo and Mark.

714
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:59,318
They can be playful
but they're good in class.

715
00:42:59,318 --> 00:43:00,444
I didn’t ask.

716
00:43:01,902 --> 00:43:03,155
So grumpy!

717
00:43:07,576 --> 00:43:09,495
Why do they call you “master” anyway?

718
00:43:12,414 --> 00:43:13,415
They said that it’s because

719
00:43:13,415 --> 00:43:15,334
I can balance my engineering
studies with basketball.

720
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:16,168
That’s all.

721
00:43:16,168 --> 00:43:18,574
What a load of bull, right?

722
00:43:19,379 --> 00:43:21,965
Actually, how do you do that?

723
00:43:22,758 --> 00:43:24,149
You must be smart?

724
00:43:24,343 --> 00:43:25,344
Not really.

725
00:43:25,844 --> 00:43:28,689
I’m just good with math so it seems easy.

726
00:43:30,516 --> 00:43:31,934
You’re so cocky.

727
00:43:32,935 --> 00:43:34,561
Why did you take that course?

728
00:43:42,705 --> 00:43:43,705
I just wanted to.

729
00:43:43,946 --> 00:43:46,031
Why? Can’t I?

730
00:43:49,201 --> 00:43:51,286
Seems like there’s a deeper reason why.

731
00:43:54,414 --> 00:43:56,083
What about you? What’s your course?

732
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:59,002
Applied Corporate Management.

733
00:43:59,628 --> 00:44:00,254
Wow.

734
00:44:01,296 --> 00:44:02,130
Now, that’s deep.

735
00:44:02,589 --> 00:44:03,423
Do you like it?

736
00:44:04,216 --> 00:44:05,050
Yes.

737
00:44:05,551 --> 00:44:06,760
I chose the course.

738
00:44:06,927 --> 00:44:07,594
Why?

739
00:44:08,262 --> 00:44:09,262
You don’t like yours?

740
00:44:09,954 --> 00:44:10,954
I do!

741
00:44:11,431 --> 00:44:12,891
That’s why I can’t let go of it.

742
00:44:13,678 --> 00:44:15,683
They're asking me to
go for commerce instead.

743
00:44:15,936 --> 00:44:19,273
But the basketball
schedule is really tough.

744
00:44:20,148 --> 00:44:21,858
But, I was able to work around it.

745
00:44:24,111 --> 00:44:25,487
You really are a master.

746
00:44:26,655 --> 00:44:27,531
How about you?

747
00:44:27,739 --> 00:44:29,199
Why did you choose your course?

748
00:44:29,591 --> 00:44:30,597
Well,

749
00:44:30,742 --> 00:44:33,704
I will be taking over the family
company in the future.

750
00:44:34,324 --> 00:44:35,539
Wow!

751
00:44:36,623 --> 00:44:38,333
You’re really a nepo baby, aren’t you?

752
00:44:38,667 --> 00:44:40,127
Your future is secured.

753
00:44:41,044 --> 00:44:43,422
There's already a position
waiting for you in your company.

754
00:44:45,048 --> 00:44:45,882
And you?

755
00:44:46,258 --> 00:44:47,843
You don’t have plans for your future?

756
00:44:48,468 --> 00:44:49,511
Of course, I do.

757
00:44:50,012 --> 00:44:51,221
But after graduation,

758
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,142
I won’t be able to get a job immediately.

759
00:44:55,475 --> 00:45:00,147
I’ll still need to work hard to get
to the position I want.

760
00:45:00,172 --> 00:45:03,050
That’s why my future’s
not as secure as yours.

761
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:05,819
Well, you are really lucky, though.

762
00:45:06,111 --> 00:45:08,643
I mean, you like what you do,

763
00:45:09,031 --> 00:45:13,243
you like your course, and you
get to do your passions freely.

764
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:14,870
Like basketball.

765
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:16,455
Unlike me,

766
00:45:16,913 --> 00:45:18,707
I didn’t get a chance to think about it.

767
00:45:19,625 --> 00:45:21,835
Ever since I was young,

768
00:45:21,835 --> 00:45:24,379
I already knew that I’m next in line
for our family company.

769
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:29,843
So, my whole life has
been leading up to that moment.

770
00:45:30,135 --> 00:45:33,555
But, don’t get me wrong.
I do like what I do.

771
00:45:37,851 --> 00:45:38,851
Know what,

772
00:45:39,102 --> 00:45:40,896
just hire me in the future.

773
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:43,398
That way, I won’t have to work so hard.

774
00:45:44,483 --> 00:45:45,692
Hard pass

775
00:45:46,109 --> 00:45:48,445
Attention-seekers are not allowed
in my company.

776
00:45:49,112 --> 00:45:53,200
Just you wait, soon companies
will be competing for me

777
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,408
and you'll regret this day.

778
00:45:56,036 --> 00:45:58,622
Wow! Really, now?

779
00:45:59,122 --> 00:46:00,374
Let’s see.

780
00:46:14,377 --> 00:46:16,390
Want me to take you home?

781
00:46:22,437 --> 00:46:23,605
Fine then!

782
00:46:25,589 --> 00:46:26,965
You’re crazy.

783
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:28,293
Crazy for you?

784
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,574
Don’t go blushing now

785
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:36,325
Don’t be delusional.

786
00:46:37,452 --> 00:46:38,745
You’re delusional.

787
00:46:41,248 --> 00:46:42,833
Anyway,

788
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:45,954
my ride is picking me up soon

789
00:46:46,215 --> 00:46:47,466
so you can leave now.

790
00:46:47,923 --> 00:46:49,174
I’ll just wait here.

791
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:51,266
Huh?

792
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,010
It's fine.
It’s still early anyway.

793
00:46:54,254 --> 00:46:55,547
Early?

794
00:46:55,572 --> 00:46:59,382
There aren’t any students left.
You really are crazy.

795
00:47:33,969 --> 00:47:35,009
Hello?

796
00:47:36,094 --> 00:47:37,345
Hi, Roel!

797
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:40,640
You’re here?

798
00:47:42,881 --> 00:47:43,881
Just—

799
00:47:44,209 --> 00:47:45,419
stay right there.

800
00:47:45,444 --> 00:47:46,611
I’ll go to you.

801
00:47:50,083 --> 00:47:51,251
You’re ride’s here?

802
00:47:52,068 --> 00:47:53,236
Yes, I need to go.

803
00:47:57,949 --> 00:47:59,117
Elyse.

804
00:48:58,301 --> 00:48:59,636
Do you have a crush on me?

805
00:49:01,263 --> 00:49:02,597
What’s with the hug?

806
00:49:03,682 --> 00:49:04,766
Huh?

807
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:06,350
No!

808
00:49:06,852 --> 00:49:08,228
It’s just that you did this.

809
00:49:08,228 --> 00:49:09,813
I was giving you your bag.

810
00:49:14,854 --> 00:49:16,856
Okay. Bye.

811
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:32,502
It was so embarrassing.

812
00:49:33,453 --> 00:49:36,715
I hugged him,
now he thinks I like him

813
00:49:37,048 --> 00:49:38,466
Why, don’t you?

814
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:39,426
After all,

815
00:49:39,426 --> 00:49:42,429
you went all the way to his school
just to return the shirt.

816
00:49:42,429 --> 00:49:45,307
You could have just had it delivered.

817
00:49:45,307 --> 00:49:46,308
No.

818
00:49:47,142 --> 00:49:47,684
I mean,

819
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:52,439
I only went there in person to return
the shirt and just say goodbye.

820
00:49:52,439 --> 00:49:55,442
That would have been
the end of our  silly interactions.

821
00:49:56,067 --> 00:49:57,277
Besides,

822
00:49:58,945 --> 00:50:01,656
I think he’s into his friend, Luna.

823
00:50:01,948 --> 00:50:03,199
What makes you think so?

824
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:05,327
Are you psychic now, girl?

825
00:50:05,619 --> 00:50:06,912
I mean, one,

826
00:50:06,912 --> 00:50:09,080
he’s always on the phone with her.

827
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,665
And then two,

828
00:50:10,665 --> 00:50:13,101
he’s always looking
for her during his games.

829
00:50:13,126 --> 00:50:15,921
And oh my god, three,

830
00:50:16,504 --> 00:50:19,071
they were sharing a single straw.

831
00:50:19,884 --> 00:50:21,448
Oh no.

832
00:50:21,509 --> 00:50:24,262
Number three is definitely a red flag.

833
00:50:24,387 --> 00:50:24,930
Right?

834
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:27,703
But girl, those were all assumptions.

835
00:50:28,196 --> 00:50:31,336
Wait, have you stalked
them on their socials?

836
00:50:31,811 --> 00:50:32,938
Not yet.

837
00:50:35,523 --> 00:50:36,900
But that would be a good idea.

838
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,236
Wait a minute,
I thought you didn’t like him?

839
00:50:40,236 --> 00:50:43,406
Why are you so invested in those two?

840
00:50:52,874 --> 00:50:54,000
Hello?

841
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,834
Hello?

842
00:50:54,834 --> 00:50:55,794
Sorry.

843
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:57,087
What’s that?

844
00:50:57,712 --> 00:50:58,755
The line’s breaking.

845
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,209
I’ll call you back later.

846
00:51:00,423 --> 00:51:01,466
Bye.

847
00:51:21,366 --> 00:51:24,364
Now everything is making sense!

848
00:51:24,389 --> 00:51:27,793
He liked her?
Or he likes her until now?

849
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:31,230
Or it’s Luna who likes Sevi?

850
00:51:39,087 --> 00:51:41,339
Oh my gosh!

851
00:51:41,339 --> 00:51:42,382
Shit!

852
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:46,386
I don’t think he’ll notice it, right?

853
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:48,471
I unliked it immediately.

854
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:54,447
I already saw it even if you unliked it.

855
00:51:55,895 --> 00:51:57,731
Nice one, stalker!

856
00:52:22,064 --> 00:52:23,064
Miss!

857
00:52:23,506 --> 00:52:25,300
Miss, do you have bottled water?

858
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,885
We don’t have that.

859
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:36,770
Sir, bottled water please?

860
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:38,313
We’ve run out, boy.

861
00:52:43,651 --> 00:52:44,486
Bottled water, please?

862
00:52:44,486 --> 00:52:46,196
Oh no,
they haven’t delivered it yet.

863
00:52:57,457 --> 00:52:59,542
Miss, let me guess,
you don’t have any bottled water?

864
00:52:59,542 --> 00:53:01,086
We do, how many do you need?

865
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:03,170
Two, please.

866
00:53:08,968 --> 00:53:09,968
Thank you.

867
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:19,228
Thank you.

868
00:53:19,938 --> 00:53:20,955
If that’s not enough,

869
00:53:21,296 --> 00:53:22,313
I’ll just buy more.

870
00:53:22,338 --> 00:53:24,153
By the way,
where did you buy this?

871
00:53:24,274 --> 00:53:25,651
You took a while.

872
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,920
Just outside.

873
00:53:28,553 --> 00:53:29,929
The line was quite long.

874
00:54:06,526 --> 00:54:07,902
I think my phone got hacked

875
00:54:07,902 --> 00:54:08,361
Huh?

876
00:54:08,361 --> 00:54:09,279
Hacked, my ass!

877
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:12,157
Roel, he’ll ride with us to the mall.

878
00:54:12,157 --> 00:54:13,408
I heard something about you.

879
00:54:13,408 --> 00:54:15,285
They picked you up in
España the other day.

880
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:16,494
How’s your love life?

881
00:54:16,494 --> 00:54:18,172
As if I have one.

882
00:54:19,013 --> 00:54:20,139
Hey, Ely.

883
00:54:20,164 --> 00:54:21,457
Why do you have Camero’s I.D.?

884
00:54:22,511 --> 00:54:23,554
What if my Dad finds out?

885
00:54:23,877 --> 00:54:25,253
He’s going to be really mad.

886
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:27,547
He will definitely ground me.

887
00:54:27,755 --> 00:54:29,382
Did I do something wrong?

888
00:54:29,382 --> 00:54:31,009
I told you, I’m not mad at you.
