1
00:00:10,281 --> 00:00:12,116
Have you ever tried kissing?

2
00:00:22,168 --> 00:00:23,918
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

3
00:00:23,919 --> 00:00:26,379
I can stay before dinner today.

4
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,630
Won’t your dad look for you?

5
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:29,174
You think Sofia will like it?

6
00:00:29,175 --> 00:00:30,175
Of course.

7
00:00:30,217 --> 00:00:31,384
What do you think about this?

8
00:00:31,385 --> 00:00:33,762
I don’t think
that’s going to fit her.

9
00:00:33,763 --> 00:00:35,930
This is for my friend’s
soon-to-be baby.

10
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:38,183
Our first monthsary
is coming up.

11
00:00:38,184 --> 00:00:40,560
Is it okay if
we celebrate at my place?

12
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:41,937
Where’s your papa, by the way?

13
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:46,983
Sebastian!

14
00:00:46,984 --> 00:00:48,652
Who the hell is that woman...

15
00:00:49,695 --> 00:00:50,695
Oh…

16
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,492
Your boyfriend is really sweet.

17
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:55,993
He’s really caring.

18
00:00:58,162 --> 00:00:59,330
Can I borrow him for now?

19
00:01:01,373 --> 00:01:02,582
If we have a problem,

20
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:03,917
let’s sort it out
right away, okay?

21
00:01:03,918 --> 00:01:06,629
No walking out
without saying anything.

22
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:51,817
This is it.

23
00:02:54,278 --> 00:02:56,363
This is really happening.

24
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,667
This is the last one.

25
00:03:09,543 --> 00:03:11,212
I still can’t believe it.

26
00:03:12,046 --> 00:03:13,547
We’re homeowners now.

27
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,845
This is one
of the most important

28
00:03:20,846 --> 00:03:22,514
milestones of our lives.

29
00:03:32,816 --> 00:03:35,903
Adulting here we come!

30
00:04:01,971 --> 00:04:02,971
Sevi.

31
00:04:04,682 --> 00:04:05,682
Look.

32
00:04:12,773 --> 00:04:13,774
Wow!

33
00:04:14,858 --> 00:04:16,568
It feels like
it was just yesterday.

34
00:04:17,778 --> 00:04:18,778
Right.

35
00:04:20,322 --> 00:04:23,116
You know, when I look
at this picture,

36
00:04:23,117 --> 00:04:25,244
I can still feel
how tired I was then.

37
00:04:30,874 --> 00:04:31,875
Why?

38
00:04:34,962 --> 00:04:36,630
I don’t want to remember

39
00:04:37,715 --> 00:04:39,425
how hard those days were.

40
00:04:42,303 --> 00:04:44,805
Those times were
really tough for us.

41
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,728
That's true.

42
00:04:52,563 --> 00:04:55,357
We really went
through a lot back then.

43
00:04:55,816 --> 00:04:57,526
And there were
so many challenges.

44
00:04:58,777 --> 00:04:59,778
But

45
00:05:00,446 --> 00:05:02,406
I like looking at this picture.

46
00:05:03,407 --> 00:05:05,408
Because it's proof

47
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:07,286
of how far we've come.

48
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:10,622
Started from the bottom
now we’re here.

49
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:14,168
You like that?

50
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:20,466
And look at this.

51
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:23,427
Look at us,

52
00:05:23,635 --> 00:05:26,430
we're here in our own condo.

53
00:05:28,891 --> 00:05:30,392
We're still together.

54
00:05:31,977 --> 00:05:33,354
You still love me.

55
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:36,899
And I love you even more.

56
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,111
And...

57
00:05:42,905 --> 00:05:45,991
if we haven't gone through
all that hardship,

58
00:05:46,742 --> 00:05:48,452
we might not be here today.

59
00:05:49,495 --> 00:05:50,495
Yes,

60
00:05:51,163 --> 00:05:53,207
I guess you’re right.

61
00:05:53,582 --> 00:05:57,503
It is really good to remember

62
00:05:58,545 --> 00:05:59,797
where we came from.

63
00:06:00,672 --> 00:06:02,840
And all of the hardships

64
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:05,094
that we faced
and all of the lessons

65
00:06:05,386 --> 00:06:06,553
that we’ve learned.

66
00:06:10,391 --> 00:06:13,394
I’m really glad to be doing
this life thing with you.

67
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:16,480
Of course!

68
00:06:17,147 --> 00:06:19,108
We're partners in crime.

69
00:06:19,858 --> 00:06:20,859
Like...

70
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,611
Batman and Robin.

71
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,491
Tom and Jerry.

72
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,703
Mario and Luigi.

73
00:06:34,873 --> 00:06:35,874
Elvi.

74
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:39,336
Elyse and Sevi.

75
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:45,342
ElVi…

76
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:49,847
I like that.

77
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:06,988
It’s my 7th term in college

78
00:07:06,989 --> 00:07:10,867
and it’s my first day as an
intern in our own company.

79
00:07:10,868 --> 00:07:13,286
I don’t want
any special treatment

80
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:15,456
so I’m using my mom’s surname.

81
00:07:15,956 --> 00:07:17,833
Hi, can I ask a...

82
00:07:20,127 --> 00:07:21,128
Okay.

83
00:07:23,685 --> 00:07:25,561
Hi, good morning.

84
00:07:25,586 --> 00:07:26,878
I’m the new intern.

85
00:07:27,468 --> 00:07:28,927
Okay, what’s your name?

86
00:07:30,304 --> 00:07:32,431
Sarria. Elyse Sarria.

87
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:34,516
Okay, please come with me.

88
00:07:45,486 --> 00:07:48,321
Okay, you don’t have an
assigned cubicle for now.

89
00:07:48,322 --> 00:07:49,804
You can stay here, okay?

90
00:07:50,032 --> 00:07:51,033
Okay.

91
00:08:08,578 --> 00:08:11,136
@sevirous: Good luck
on your first day, babe.

92
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:15,556
He’s so caring and thoughtful

93
00:08:15,557 --> 00:08:19,144
even though he’s also busy
studying for the board exam.

94
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,402
No texting at work.

95
00:08:29,696 --> 00:08:30,697
I’m sorry.

96
00:08:32,282 --> 00:08:33,659
Are you an intern?

97
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:35,035
Yes, ma’am.

98
00:08:36,036 --> 00:08:37,871
I thought so.

99
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,331
Are you busy?

100
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,207
No. No, ma’am.

101
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,333
- I’m not—
- Good.

102
00:08:42,334 --> 00:08:43,877
Can you get us coffee?

103
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:44,795
Huh?

104
00:08:44,796 --> 00:08:48,339
If it's an intern’s
first day here,

105
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,801
that’s how they greet us,
with coffee.

106
00:08:51,093 --> 00:08:53,428
I guess you’re not
aware of that?

107
00:08:53,971 --> 00:08:54,680
I...

108
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:56,056
I didn’t know.

109
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:59,476
You don’t know?
So, I’m letting you know now.

110
00:08:59,935 --> 00:09:01,227
- Okay.
- So, can you get us coffee

111
00:09:01,228 --> 00:09:02,228
or not?

112
00:09:02,437 --> 00:09:05,147
Yes, ma’am.
I can... I can do that.

113
00:09:05,148 --> 00:09:06,148
Good.

114
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:09,236
Mine is americano,
hot, no sugar.

115
00:09:09,364 --> 00:09:12,321
Then, get their orders.
Each of them.

116
00:09:12,322 --> 00:09:13,448
- Okay.
- Okay.

117
00:09:14,157 --> 00:09:16,423
Make sure it’s ready
when I get back.

118
00:09:16,491 --> 00:09:17,784
- Okay.
- All right?

119
00:09:21,123 --> 00:09:22,124
Americano, hot…

120
00:09:25,002 --> 00:09:26,920
Hi. What can I
get for you, ma’am?

121
00:09:27,202 --> 00:09:31,729
[INDISTINCT CHATTERING]

122
00:09:40,642 --> 00:09:41,642
I’m sorry, ma’am.

123
00:09:43,645 --> 00:09:44,489
Elyse?

124
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:45,564
It’s okay. It’s okay.

125
00:09:46,356 --> 00:09:47,899
Okay, you can go ahead.

126
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:50,151
Auntie.

127
00:09:51,612 --> 00:09:52,613
Hello.

128
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:56,325
What are you doing here?

129
00:09:57,367 --> 00:09:59,745
I’m buying coffee
for the employees.

130
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:01,413
Huh? Why?

131
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:06,960
You’re an intern?

132
00:10:08,128 --> 00:10:09,337
What department?

133
00:10:09,338 --> 00:10:11,590
And why are they
making you buy coffee?

134
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,301
Internships are supposed
to be for training.

135
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,804
They said it’s a greeting.
But it’s okay.

136
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,723
Don’t tell my dad, please.

137
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:21,557
Do you want me to talk to them?

138
00:10:21,558 --> 00:10:22,850
Please don’t.

139
00:10:22,851 --> 00:10:24,936
I don’t want any
special treatment here.

140
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:27,439
Do they even know that...

141
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,401
you're Sir Ledezma’s daughter?

142
00:10:36,156 --> 00:10:38,658
I just want to experience
an internship like

143
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:40,994
how other interns experience it.

144
00:10:41,286 --> 00:10:42,871
I just want to learn by myself.

145
00:10:44,414 --> 00:10:45,956
You're really admirable.

146
00:10:45,957 --> 00:10:47,772
I'm proud of you.

147
00:10:48,043 --> 00:10:51,254
All right. Just call me
if you need anything, okay?

148
00:10:52,172 --> 00:10:53,131
Thank you, Auntie.

149
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:54,423
Go now or that coffee
might get cold.

150
00:10:54,424 --> 00:10:56,550
- Can you carry it all?
- Yes, I got it.

151
00:10:56,551 --> 00:10:57,599
- Okay then.
- Thank you.

152
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:58,625
Be careful.

153
00:11:01,262 --> 00:11:02,849
For Sir Hunter.

154
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,020
And Ma’am Ghie, right?

155
00:11:07,938 --> 00:11:09,147
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

156
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,263
And sir jm.

157
00:11:13,694 --> 00:11:14,694
Here.

158
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:17,030
Excuse me.

159
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,242
I think you made a mistake.
This isn’t my order.

160
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,788
You ordered white chocolate
mocha, right?

161
00:11:24,913 --> 00:11:27,416
This is wrong.
I said no whipped cream,

162
00:11:27,624 --> 00:11:29,126
and it should be oat milk.

163
00:11:30,127 --> 00:11:31,127
What?

164
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,914
Wait, you didn’t say that.

165
00:11:35,132 --> 00:11:35,924
Jeez…

166
00:11:35,925 --> 00:11:38,342
White chocolate mocha,
Sir Hunter.

167
00:11:38,343 --> 00:11:40,094
I actually told you.
You think you know better?

168
00:11:40,095 --> 00:11:41,638
This is my usual order.

169
00:11:43,014 --> 00:11:44,307
I’m sorry.

170
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,741
Such a simple order,
and you can’t even get it right.

171
00:11:47,766 --> 00:11:49,476
What’s with this intern?

172
00:11:49,811 --> 00:11:51,523
How did she even get in here?

173
00:11:52,153 --> 00:11:53,859
I can get you a new one.

174
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:55,402
Don’t bother,

175
00:11:55,736 --> 00:11:57,069
I’m in a hurry.

176
00:11:57,094 --> 00:11:58,387
I have a meeting.

177
00:12:07,748 --> 00:12:08,957
Ma’am Laine?

178
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Here you go.

179
00:12:11,543 --> 00:12:12,543
Elyse?

180
00:12:12,794 --> 00:12:13,794
You’re Elyse?

181
00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:15,279
Yes. Yes, ma’am.

182
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:18,549
Hi, I’m Eunice Garcia.
I’m one of your team leaders.

183
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,885
Hello, how can I help?

184
00:12:20,886 --> 00:12:22,846
I’m just giving you
your first assignment.

185
00:12:23,305 --> 00:12:26,641
So, here. We’re building
a new resort in Zambales

186
00:12:26,808 --> 00:12:29,018
and I want you to present
our marketing strategies

187
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:30,729
to our CEO tomorrow.

188
00:12:31,897 --> 00:12:33,440
The ceo?

189
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,151
Yes. It’s their special request.

190
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,736
They want a modern take on this.

191
00:12:38,943 --> 00:12:40,196
Do your best.

192
00:12:40,197 --> 00:12:41,572
This opportunity
doesn’t come often.

193
00:12:41,573 --> 00:12:43,283
Make the most out of it, okay?

194
00:12:44,534 --> 00:12:46,375
Okay. Yes, ma’am.

195
00:12:46,411 --> 00:12:50,371
By the way, just tell me
if they’re treating you badly.

196
00:12:50,989 --> 00:12:53,490
If somebody’s making you
do something unethical.

197
00:12:53,584 --> 00:12:55,920
You already know
what’s good and bad.

198
00:12:56,213 --> 00:12:58,089
I’m here to take care
of the interns, okay?

199
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,841
Thank you.

200
00:13:21,321 --> 00:13:22,321
Ely.

201
00:13:37,504 --> 00:13:38,755
How’s your first day?

202
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:40,340
How was work?

203
00:13:41,985 --> 00:13:43,509
They’re so mean

204
00:13:43,534 --> 00:13:45,953
but I don’t want Sevi
to worry about it.

205
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,227
Yes, it was great.

206
00:13:53,144 --> 00:13:54,855
They were very welcoming.

207
00:13:55,981 --> 00:13:57,440
I have my first task.

208
00:13:57,774 --> 00:13:58,941
I have to create a deck

209
00:13:58,942 --> 00:14:00,986
and present it tomorrow.

210
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:02,279
Wow.

211
00:14:02,946 --> 00:14:05,740
I'm glad you're enjoying
your internship.

212
00:14:08,952 --> 00:14:10,536
How about you? How are you?

213
00:14:10,537 --> 00:14:11,829
Did you eat?

214
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,247
Did you hydrate?

215
00:14:13,248 --> 00:14:15,125
Did you get enough
sleep last night?

216
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:18,587
I was able to sleep and...

217
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:20,130
I’ve eaten already.

218
00:14:20,505 --> 00:14:23,215
I’ve also drank a lot of water

219
00:14:23,216 --> 00:14:26,928
because I remembered
your reminders.

220
00:14:27,554 --> 00:14:28,889
Okay, that’s good.

221
00:14:39,024 --> 00:14:41,026
I have something for you.

222
00:14:42,569 --> 00:14:43,570
What’s this?

223
00:14:43,862 --> 00:14:46,573
I call this
the “Ely-mergency Kit”.

224
00:14:47,365 --> 00:14:49,116
“Ely-mergency Kit”?

225
00:14:49,117 --> 00:14:50,117
Yup.

226
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:53,288
Wow!

227
00:14:54,998 --> 00:14:57,459
My girlfriend is so sweet.

228
00:14:57,876 --> 00:15:00,086
She even brought vitamins and...

229
00:15:00,545 --> 00:15:01,630
snacks.

230
00:15:02,881 --> 00:15:04,215
I'm really lucky.

231
00:15:07,427 --> 00:15:08,427
Thanks.

232
00:15:08,845 --> 00:15:10,055
You’re always welcome.

233
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:16,561
I’ll give you something too.

234
00:15:17,354 --> 00:15:18,354
What?

235
00:15:23,109 --> 00:15:29,366
My promise to give you a life
that’s more than you deserve.

236
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:32,911
I love you.

237
00:15:37,457 --> 00:15:39,000
I love you, Elyse.

238
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,391
Drink.

239
00:17:32,697 --> 00:17:33,864
Oh my gosh!

240
00:17:33,865 --> 00:17:35,992
I haven’t finished
my presentation yet!

241
00:17:40,163 --> 00:17:43,833
I finished your presentation.
Good thing you had notes.

242
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,009
I really am so lucky
to have you, Sev.

243
00:18:29,462 --> 00:18:32,673
Zambales may not be
as popular as Cebu,

244
00:18:32,674 --> 00:18:34,092
Boracay, or Palawan.

245
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:39,054
But it does offer a less
commercialized atmosphere

246
00:18:39,055 --> 00:18:41,598
and unique local
culture and traditions

247
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:44,935
which provides a more
authentic adventure experience

248
00:18:44,936 --> 00:18:47,260
and that applies more
to the younger market.

249
00:18:47,772 --> 00:18:50,357
And with an aggressive
social media presence

250
00:18:50,358 --> 00:18:52,776
and influencer partnerships,

251
00:18:52,777 --> 00:18:56,573
we can make Zambales
the next It summer destination.

252
00:18:56,865 --> 00:18:59,151
Can you give us an example?

253
00:18:59,284 --> 00:19:01,327
A specific content
that we can post?

254
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:03,829
Sure.

255
00:19:04,122 --> 00:19:05,122
Well,

256
00:19:05,373 --> 00:19:06,833
the younger market

257
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,335
doesn’t just look
for a place to stay.

258
00:19:09,836 --> 00:19:12,629
They look for fun, adventures

259
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:16,496
and a chance to make more
friends and more connections.

260
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:18,927
And so, because of that,

261
00:19:19,108 --> 00:19:20,943
we can provide...

262
00:19:22,414 --> 00:19:23,614
[PHONE RINGING]

263
00:19:28,396 --> 00:19:29,397
I’m sorry.

264
00:19:30,064 --> 00:19:31,357
I’m really sorry.

265
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:34,444
Sir, I’m sorry.

266
00:19:34,777 --> 00:19:35,987
I’m so sorry.

267
00:19:39,115 --> 00:19:40,533
It’s okay, continue.

268
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,456
As I was saying,

269
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,040
because of that,

270
00:19:48,124 --> 00:19:50,460
we will primarily post content

271
00:19:50,668 --> 00:19:54,380
like call-to-action art cards
that will help push our market

272
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:56,591
to visit the Zambales town more.

273
00:19:57,217 --> 00:19:59,843
And a couple examples for that

274
00:19:59,844 --> 00:20:02,429
would be vibrant
social activities,

275
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,847
community stories,

276
00:20:03,848 --> 00:20:06,434
and unique experiences.

277
00:20:08,061 --> 00:20:09,103
That’s all.

278
00:20:10,146 --> 00:20:11,648
Any questions?

279
00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:13,649
Questions?

280
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:15,567
- I like it.
- So far so good.

281
00:20:15,568 --> 00:20:16,236
Yes.

282
00:20:16,569 --> 00:20:17,569
It’s interesting.

283
00:20:18,321 --> 00:20:19,321
Thank you.

284
00:20:21,282 --> 00:20:22,367
Thank you.

285
00:20:28,122 --> 00:20:30,040
Elyse, next time

286
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,124
turn your phone off.

287
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,125
It’s embarrassing, especially
in front of the boss.

288
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:34,545
Yes, I’m sorry.

289
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:36,714
That's standard procedure, okay?

290
00:20:38,424 --> 00:20:40,760
Well, anyway, props to you.

291
00:20:41,928 --> 00:20:42,887
You did a great job.

292
00:20:42,888 --> 00:20:44,973
I think they were impressed.

293
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:46,724
- Really?
- Yes.

- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

296
00:20:53,648 --> 00:20:54,648
In advance.

297
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:59,404
So are you ready to see
the results of your board exam?

298
00:21:01,114 --> 00:21:02,573
I'm nervous, Ely.

299
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:04,533
It’s okay.

300
00:21:04,884 --> 00:21:07,512
You know,
even if you don’t get in,

301
00:21:07,537 --> 00:21:08,745
we’ll still celebrate.

302
00:21:08,746 --> 00:21:09,746
And plus,

303
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:13,126
we have our
first year anniversary.

304
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:15,319
So double the celebration.

305
00:21:16,921 --> 00:21:17,921
Right,

306
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,798
the important thing is

307
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:21,497
that I’m with you now.

308
00:21:22,468 --> 00:21:24,929
So, let’s do this.

309
00:21:26,306 --> 00:21:27,557
Wait, I’m not ready yet.

310
00:21:29,017 --> 00:21:32,019
Why? You’ve been
waiting for this all day.

311
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,563
Let’s do this.

312
00:21:36,024 --> 00:21:37,316
Just a moment, Ely.

313
00:21:37,317 --> 00:21:38,818
Wait, I can’t breathe.

314
00:21:42,155 --> 00:21:43,156
Okay.

315
00:21:43,614 --> 00:21:44,614
Look,

00:21:44,782 --> 00:21:46,284
whatever happens,

00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:48,536
I’m still proud of you, okay?

318
00:21:48,995 --> 00:21:51,664
And you can retake
the exam next time.

319
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,876
So let’s do this.

320
00:22:14,437 --> 00:22:15,688
Oh no…

00:22:51,506 --> 00:22:53,100
Yes! Of course, it’s you.

the board exams.

anniversary to us.

I know that this past year
has not been easy,

00:24:01,794 --> 00:24:03,880
but we made it through.

To more years with you, love.

It’s so fun here
in Valeria, isn’t it?

00:24:34,994 --> 00:24:37,120
I know, I’m really excited that

00:24:37,121 --> 00:24:38,915
we’re doing our
second internship here.

360
00:24:39,207 --> 00:24:40,374
Excited?

361
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:43,753
Maybe because your
baby works here too?

Office romance? Whatever.

365
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,260
Of course,

366
00:24:52,345 --> 00:24:54,305
I’m excited to learn a lot here.

367
00:24:54,847 --> 00:24:57,641
He’s just one of the reasons.

368
00:24:57,642 --> 00:24:58,642
See?

369
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:02,355
All right, I’ll go ahead.

370
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,356
Okay.

371
00:25:03,357 --> 00:25:04,649
I still need to finish a report.

372
00:25:05,608 --> 00:25:06,609
Just a report?

373
00:25:06,984 --> 00:25:07,984
Babe!

374
00:25:08,945 --> 00:25:10,196
- See you!
- I’ll see you.

375
00:25:13,282 --> 00:25:21,282
@elydezma:
I’m tired. Can we have lunch?

376
00:25:24,168 --> 00:25:26,963
Why is he not responding
to my messages?

377
00:25:32,476 --> 00:25:34,269
When I tell you
to go to the site,

378
00:25:34,554 --> 00:25:36,222
do exactly what I say.

379
00:25:36,806 --> 00:25:39,559
And don’t go home
until you get it done.

380
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,932
It’s just that...

381
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:43,019
For crying out loud...

382
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,314
Didn’t I tell you
not to answer back?

383
00:25:45,815 --> 00:25:47,066
You keep making excuses.

384
00:25:47,775 --> 00:25:49,734
I’m sorry. I’ll fix it.

385
00:25:49,735 --> 00:25:51,654
It’s been so long.

386
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,574
Do your jobs properly.

387
00:25:55,116 --> 00:25:57,243
All I hear are
apologies and excuses.

388
00:25:57,994 --> 00:25:59,995
- I need results.
- What can I do

389
00:25:59,996 --> 00:26:01,497
to make him feel better?

390
00:26:02,456 --> 00:26:04,336
I’m the one getting pressured
by the management.

391
00:26:35,823 --> 00:26:36,532
Ely…

392
00:26:36,532 --> 00:26:37,199
Hi!

393
00:26:37,199 --> 00:26:38,199
You're still here.

394
00:26:38,659 --> 00:26:40,870
Yes, I brought you food.

395
00:26:41,203 --> 00:26:43,080
Wow, thanks.

396
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:45,333
Have you been waiting long?

397
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,500
It’s okay.

398
00:26:49,879 --> 00:26:51,589
You shouldn’t have waited.

399
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,175
I don’t want you to get hungry.

400
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:56,010
It’s okay,

401
00:26:56,761 --> 00:26:58,471
I want to eat dinner with you.

402
00:27:01,223 --> 00:27:03,184
Are you tired?

403
00:27:04,018 --> 00:27:05,019
So tired.

404
00:27:05,603 --> 00:27:09,022
We might not be
able to get a ride easily

405
00:27:09,023 --> 00:27:10,823
at this time, plus
we’ll get stuck in traffic.

406
00:27:13,444 --> 00:27:15,363
But thanks for everything, Ely.

407
00:27:16,656 --> 00:27:18,282
You’re always welcome.

408
00:27:20,701 --> 00:27:22,035
I promise,

409
00:27:22,036 --> 00:27:25,665
someday we won’t have to
struggle with commuting anymore.

410
00:27:26,165 --> 00:27:29,259
I’m already saving up
to buy a car and...

411
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,797
so we can rent
a condo near the office.

412
00:27:33,422 --> 00:27:34,964
That way,
everything will be closer

413
00:27:34,965 --> 00:27:36,217
and it will be easier for us.

414
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:41,013
Or we can have
a place to call our own.

415
00:27:42,098 --> 00:27:45,309
Not just a place to rent,
but we own it.

416
00:27:46,162 --> 00:27:48,186
Yes, a big condo.

417
00:27:48,187 --> 00:27:50,356
A very, very big condo.

418
00:27:52,858 --> 00:27:54,235
I promise, Elyse,

419
00:27:54,944 --> 00:27:57,405
we’ll achieve
all of that together.

420
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,949
Just with me, right?

421
00:28:01,033 --> 00:28:03,160
I promise, just you.

422
00:28:12,128 --> 00:28:13,128
Elyse!

423
00:28:13,838 --> 00:28:14,838
Elyse!

424
00:28:17,091 --> 00:28:19,634
I saw your boyfriend with
a woman at the pantry.

425
00:28:19,635 --> 00:28:20,428
Huh?

426
00:28:20,594 --> 00:28:21,595
With who?

427
00:28:22,471 --> 00:28:23,638
Maybe she’s just his workmate.

428
00:28:23,639 --> 00:28:26,141
No! She looked familiar.

429
00:28:26,142 --> 00:28:27,142
I think

430
00:28:27,351 --> 00:28:29,019
I’ve seen her before.

431
00:28:30,896 --> 00:28:34,775
So that's why he’s not
replying to my messages.

432
00:28:40,823 --> 00:28:41,866
Crazy, right?

433
00:28:41,991 --> 00:28:45,744
The test got harder by the end.

434
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:49,665
Is that Bianca?

435
00:28:50,124 --> 00:28:51,750
She also works here?

436
00:28:51,751 --> 00:28:53,961
- I’m just so glad!
- I knew you would pass.

437
00:28:54,462 --> 00:28:57,006
And she’s flirting with him?

438
00:28:57,465 --> 00:28:59,545
- Barbecued chicken intestines.
- Even acting cutesy.

439
00:29:01,688 --> 00:29:03,262
What? What are
you talking about?

440
00:29:05,055 --> 00:29:06,056
Babe!

441
00:29:06,557 --> 00:29:07,557
Babe!

442
00:29:09,175 --> 00:29:12,121
This is Engineer Bianca Ramos.

443
00:29:12,146 --> 00:29:14,472
You’ve met at the
cheerdance competition.

444
00:29:17,026 --> 00:29:18,255
Yes!

445
00:29:18,836 --> 00:29:19,754
Hi!

446
00:29:19,779 --> 00:29:20,779
Hello!

447
00:29:23,157 --> 00:29:26,743
We're here because we're working

448
00:29:26,744 --> 00:29:28,078
on a project together.

449
00:29:28,954 --> 00:29:31,123
So you’re having
a meeting right now?

450
00:29:31,832 --> 00:29:34,585
No, we're just discussing ideas.

451
00:29:36,212 --> 00:29:37,212
Okay.

452
00:29:52,895 --> 00:29:54,646
By the way, I’ll go ahead

453
00:29:54,647 --> 00:29:57,608
because I still have things to do.

454
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:59,359
Bye!

455
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:08,635
Why are you laughing?

456
00:30:09,328 --> 00:30:10,788
I think you scared her.

457
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:12,038
Huh?

458
00:30:12,206 --> 00:30:13,207
No, I didn’t.

459
00:30:14,834 --> 00:30:17,878
So that’s why you weren’t
replying to my messages.

460
00:30:19,922 --> 00:30:20,923
Are you mad?

461
00:30:21,924 --> 00:30:22,925
I’m sorry.

462
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:24,759
No,

463
00:30:24,969 --> 00:30:26,846
I’m just pissed.

464
00:30:28,681 --> 00:30:29,932
It’s the same thing.

465
00:30:31,058 --> 00:30:33,852
Well, yes, you weren’t
replying to my messages

466
00:30:33,853 --> 00:30:36,522
and then I see you laughing
here with that woman.

467
00:30:37,314 --> 00:30:38,898
You were having so much fun.

468
00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:40,234
I wasn’t having fun.

469
00:30:40,651 --> 00:30:42,027
You were laughing.

470
00:30:42,653 --> 00:30:44,779
No, that’s just…

471
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,780
What?

472
00:30:46,323 --> 00:30:48,993
I was just massaging my jaw.

473
00:30:49,952 --> 00:30:51,787
Massaging?

474
00:30:52,663 --> 00:30:55,291
You know that I always
wear a poker face, right?

475
00:30:55,624 --> 00:30:57,876
Sometimes my jaw gets tired,

476
00:30:57,877 --> 00:31:02,089
so I need to laugh
to massage it.

477
00:31:06,719 --> 00:31:08,595
You’re laughing now,
you’re not angry anymore.

478
00:31:08,596 --> 00:31:09,596
No!

479
00:31:10,514 --> 00:31:12,390
Just don’t do that again

480
00:31:12,391 --> 00:31:13,851
and bring your phone with you.

481
00:31:14,476 --> 00:31:15,476
Yes.

482
00:31:16,937 --> 00:31:17,937
Good.

483
00:31:24,695 --> 00:31:27,031
Dad: Ely, what time
are you coming home?

484
00:31:35,831 --> 00:31:36,831
Sev?

485
00:31:39,209 --> 00:31:41,377
What? You’re making me nervous.

486
00:31:41,378 --> 00:31:42,546
Well...

487
00:31:43,964 --> 00:31:46,549
I thought, just now,

488
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:50,262
maybe I can introduce you
now to my dad.

489
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:54,515
I mean, you’re a
significant part of my life

490
00:31:54,516 --> 00:31:56,602
and I want to
share that with him.

491
00:32:00,189 --> 00:32:01,190
Are you sure?

492
00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:03,776
You don’t want me to?

493
00:32:03,901 --> 00:32:05,444
Of course, I do.

494
00:32:06,236 --> 00:32:07,862
I’m just scared.

495
00:32:07,863 --> 00:32:11,200
He might get angry
and force us to break up.

496
00:32:12,117 --> 00:32:14,119
What is this? Some drama show?

497
00:32:16,747 --> 00:32:18,457
But kidding aside,

498
00:32:20,376 --> 00:32:23,002
I think it’s time for me
to introduce you to him

499
00:32:23,003 --> 00:32:24,212
as my boyfriend.

500
00:32:24,213 --> 00:32:27,006
I mean, I’m graduating next year

501
00:32:27,007 --> 00:32:29,342
and I’m a full-fledged
adult now.

502
00:32:29,343 --> 00:32:32,805
I think it’s finally time
I can decide for myself.

503
00:32:41,271 --> 00:32:42,147
Okay.

504
00:32:42,148 --> 00:32:45,484
As long as you’re
comfortable with this.

505
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,821
Okay.

506
00:32:51,991 --> 00:32:53,591
Let’s just finalize
everything this week.

507
00:32:54,618 --> 00:32:55,618
Yes, sir.

508
00:32:55,619 --> 00:32:56,620
All right, bye.

509
00:33:02,918 --> 00:33:04,085
You just got home?

510
00:33:04,086 --> 00:33:05,337
Yes, Daddy.

511
00:33:05,671 --> 00:33:07,047
- Hi!
- How are you?

512
00:33:07,423 --> 00:33:08,423
Good.

513
00:33:10,634 --> 00:33:13,387
I want to talk to you
about something important.

514
00:33:14,054 --> 00:33:15,055
What is it?

515
00:33:17,391 --> 00:33:20,185
How would you feel if

516
00:33:20,811 --> 00:33:24,773
I told you that I have a...

517
00:33:27,818 --> 00:33:28,986
boyfriend?

518
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,280
Or something?

519
00:33:32,948 --> 00:33:35,784
Or something? I don’t get it.
What do you mean?

520
00:33:36,952 --> 00:33:41,040
Well, what if I have
a boyfriend right now?

521
00:33:45,586 --> 00:33:47,421
Do you have a boyfriend?

522
00:33:51,341 --> 00:33:53,718
- Elyse, it’s a simple question…
- I mean…

523
00:33:53,719 --> 00:33:54,719
Yes or no?

524
00:33:55,804 --> 00:33:57,639
Do you have a boyfriend?

525
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,311
Yes, Dad. I have a boyfriend.

526
00:34:05,022 --> 00:34:06,814
I know that you told me

527
00:34:06,815 --> 00:34:09,526
that I can’t have
a boyfriend until I graduate.

528
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:12,236
But I know that
I have proven myself

529
00:34:12,237 --> 00:34:14,490
to be a really good student.

530
00:34:15,407 --> 00:34:16,991
No, not just good.

531
00:34:16,992 --> 00:34:19,577
I’ve been an
excellent student, Dad.

532
00:34:19,578 --> 00:34:22,455
I am on track to
graduate with latin honors

533
00:34:22,456 --> 00:34:24,416
and not just that...

534
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:26,042
I know that I have been

535
00:34:26,043 --> 00:34:28,462
a really good
daughter to you, Dad.

536
00:34:29,213 --> 00:34:30,716
All of these years.

537
00:34:31,191 --> 00:34:33,175
And, I’m turning 21.

538
00:34:33,842 --> 00:34:35,385
I am an adult.

539
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:37,637
I am old and I am mature enough

540
00:34:37,638 --> 00:34:39,556
to make decisions for myself.

541
00:34:40,808 --> 00:34:43,142
And I’ve decided to be
in a serious relationship

542
00:34:43,143 --> 00:34:46,688
and I really think
that it’s good for me.

543
00:34:59,118 --> 00:35:00,118
Okay.

544
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:03,246
What? Is that all
he has to say?

545
00:35:03,247 --> 00:35:06,041
What do you mean by just okay?

546
00:35:07,459 --> 00:35:09,962
You said you’re
an adult already.

547
00:35:10,379 --> 00:35:12,339
You can make
decisions for yourself.

548
00:35:13,799 --> 00:35:16,009
I just hope you
can stand by that.

549
00:35:18,178 --> 00:35:20,305
Won’t you ask who he is?

550
00:35:24,476 --> 00:35:26,520
Just make sure, Elyse,

551
00:35:27,563 --> 00:35:29,898
never introduce
someone to your family

552
00:35:30,315 --> 00:35:31,650
unless

553
00:35:32,484 --> 00:35:35,028
you’re 100% sure
about the person.

554
00:36:01,013 --> 00:36:02,014
Close the door.

555
00:36:10,189 --> 00:36:12,274
Are you 100% sure about this?

556
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
Yes.

557
00:36:14,651 --> 00:36:16,903
My parents are not going
to be home this weekend.

558
00:36:16,904 --> 00:36:18,321
They’re on a business trip.

559
00:36:18,322 --> 00:36:21,700
So, we have the
whole place to ourselves.

560
00:36:24,494 --> 00:36:26,872
How about your housemaids?

561
00:36:29,416 --> 00:36:30,626
They’re sleeping already.

562
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:34,879
Wow,

563
00:36:34,922 --> 00:36:36,380
seems like you’ve got
this all planned out, huh?

564
00:36:36,381 --> 00:36:38,884
Perfect for
our second anniversary.

565
00:36:39,176 --> 00:36:42,054
Huh? As if.

566
00:36:43,013 --> 00:36:44,013
Come on.

567
00:36:44,514 --> 00:36:46,058
What are we going to do?

568
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,604
Well, we can do
anything we want.

569
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,191
Anything?

570
00:36:54,816 --> 00:36:55,816
Yes,

571
00:36:56,568 --> 00:36:57,568
anything.

572
00:36:59,029 --> 00:37:00,029
Huh?

573
00:37:02,157 --> 00:37:03,574
What do you mean, anything?

574
00:37:03,575 --> 00:37:05,535
What are you doing there?

575
00:37:06,161 --> 00:37:07,371
Let’s go.

576
00:37:08,664 --> 00:37:10,040
Where are we going?

577
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:13,000
Let’s go to my room.

578
00:37:13,001 --> 00:37:14,378
Huh? No way!

579
00:37:15,545 --> 00:37:17,965
It’s way better here.
It’s so nice here.

580
00:37:19,841 --> 00:37:20,842
Come on.

581
00:37:20,968 --> 00:37:24,012
Let’s watch a movie
or something.

582
00:37:30,852 --> 00:37:32,132
We’re just going to watch, okay?

583
00:37:33,647 --> 00:37:34,647
Yes.

584
00:38:07,681 --> 00:38:08,932
Okay. That’s enough.

585
00:38:09,641 --> 00:38:10,627
We've reached our quota

586
00:38:10,652 --> 00:38:12,611
for our second anniversary.

587
00:38:12,853 --> 00:38:15,314
- What?
- Your dad might see us.

588
00:38:17,441 --> 00:38:18,441
What?

589
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:21,610
No.

590
00:38:22,779 --> 00:38:24,906
We don’t have to hide
from my dad anymore.

591
00:38:25,949 --> 00:38:27,868
Huh? Why?

592
00:38:28,327 --> 00:38:29,869
Well, I mean,

593
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,787
I’m ready to tell Dad about us

594
00:38:31,788 --> 00:38:34,791
and introduce you
as my boyfriend.

595
00:38:38,587 --> 00:38:39,587
Ely,

596
00:38:40,213 --> 00:38:41,965
you’ll graduate in a few months.

597
00:38:42,924 --> 00:38:44,760
We just have to
wait a little longer.

598
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:48,555
It’s better to tell your dad
after your graduation.

599
00:38:49,848 --> 00:38:51,933
So he won’t get too angry.

600
00:38:55,354 --> 00:38:56,354
Okay.

601
00:38:57,773 --> 00:38:59,816
We’ll wait until I graduate,

602
00:39:00,233 --> 00:39:01,568
and then we’ll tell him.

603
00:39:02,736 --> 00:39:03,736
Okay.

604
00:39:04,529 --> 00:39:05,947
One more kiss, please?

605
00:39:06,615 --> 00:39:07,616
Please?

606
00:39:24,091 --> 00:39:25,467
Okay, thank you.

607
00:39:26,385 --> 00:39:29,346
So, Elyse,
is your brother coming?

608
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:31,723
No, but we’ll
celebrate tomorrow.

609
00:39:32,766 --> 00:39:34,601
We don’t have to look for him.

610
00:39:35,394 --> 00:39:36,395
But seriously,

611
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,271
I am so proud of you.

612
00:39:39,564 --> 00:39:41,649
You can finally help us
in the company now.

613
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,901
Jeez, don’t pressure
your daughter.

614
00:39:43,902 --> 00:39:44,903
I’m not.

615
00:39:45,404 --> 00:39:48,490
I'm actually trusting her
with it, right dear?

616
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:49,991
Thanks, Dad.

617
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:52,828
Congratulations.

618
00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:53,829
Thank you.

619
00:39:54,996 --> 00:39:55,996
Let’s eat.

620
00:40:05,549 --> 00:40:06,800
Engineer Camero?

621
00:40:07,426 --> 00:40:08,676
Good afternoon.

622
00:40:08,677 --> 00:40:10,010
Good afternoon, Sevi.

623
00:40:10,011 --> 00:40:11,847
Long time no see,
Engineer Camero.

624
00:40:12,597 --> 00:40:13,598
What brings you here?

625
00:40:16,101 --> 00:40:17,101
Dad...

626
00:40:21,064 --> 00:40:22,274
Sevi

627
00:40:22,816 --> 00:40:24,818
is my boyfriend.

628
00:40:31,616 --> 00:40:32,616
Your what?

629
00:40:36,705 --> 00:40:38,165
He’s my boyfriend, Dad.

630
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:40,167
Really?

631
00:40:44,421 --> 00:40:45,421
Sevi,

632
00:40:46,214 --> 00:40:47,215
is that true?

633
00:40:49,551 --> 00:40:50,551
Yes, sir.

634
00:40:50,844 --> 00:40:53,513
I'm sorry if we didn't
mention it right away.

635
00:40:58,518 --> 00:41:00,103
Oh, wow.

636
00:41:04,524 --> 00:41:07,235
I’m surprised. I mean...

637
00:41:07,861 --> 00:41:09,237
Engineer Camero,

638
00:41:09,738 --> 00:41:11,031
I don’t know what to say.

639
00:41:13,283 --> 00:41:15,242
It's okay. It's my fault that

640
00:41:15,243 --> 00:41:17,077
we didn't mention it right away.

641
00:41:17,078 --> 00:41:18,078
Huh?

642
00:41:18,955 --> 00:41:20,373
Why are you saying that?

643
00:41:20,874 --> 00:41:22,209
Dad, it was my fault.

644
00:41:22,834 --> 00:41:25,587
He’s the one who wanted
to tell you right away but

645
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,632
I asked him to
wait until I graduated.

646
00:41:32,552 --> 00:41:34,304
So you’ve been
together for a while,

647
00:41:34,846 --> 00:41:36,014
and I didn’t know.

648
00:41:36,723 --> 00:41:38,058
How come I didn’t know?

649
00:41:39,226 --> 00:41:41,520
Hon, dear, you were busy.

650
00:41:41,853 --> 00:41:43,771
And besides if you knew,

651
00:41:43,772 --> 00:41:46,316
you’re just going to give them
an unnecessary hard time.

652
00:41:47,526 --> 00:41:48,527
So, wait…

653
00:41:49,402 --> 00:41:50,403
You knew?

654
00:41:51,738 --> 00:41:52,864
Yes!

655
00:41:56,243 --> 00:41:58,327
I’m sure Roel
knows about this too.

656
00:41:58,328 --> 00:41:59,371
Am I right?

657
00:42:01,373 --> 00:42:02,165
No...

658
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:03,917
I am firing your driver.

659
00:42:04,486 --> 00:42:05,584
- Huh?
- Huh?

660
00:42:05,585 --> 00:42:07,754
- Alfred, don’t do that!
- No!

661
00:42:08,088 --> 00:42:10,257
I told him to report
everything to me.

662
00:42:10,924 --> 00:42:13,343
So he hasn’t been doing
his job all this time.

663
00:42:14,219 --> 00:42:15,604
I trusted that guy.

664
00:42:15,629 --> 00:42:17,680
Dad, no! Please don’t.

665
00:42:17,681 --> 00:42:19,891
He didn’t know. It was my fault.

666
00:42:20,392 --> 00:42:22,142
I’ll pay for his salary.

667
00:42:22,143 --> 00:42:24,019
I’ll sell my clothes,
I’ll sell my bags,

668
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,230
just please…

669
00:42:27,065 --> 00:42:28,065
Alfred…

670
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:30,133
I told Roel not to tell you.

671
00:42:30,344 --> 00:42:32,930
But he was
reporting to me directly.

672
00:42:33,154 --> 00:42:35,073
I just didn’t want
to stress you out.

673
00:42:35,907 --> 00:42:37,241
And besides,

674
00:42:37,242 --> 00:42:39,577
our daughter is not
doing anything bad.

675
00:42:39,578 --> 00:42:41,955
She even graduated with honors.

676
00:42:42,789 --> 00:42:44,748
So, there’s nothing
to be mad about.

677
00:42:44,749 --> 00:42:46,542
What do you mean?

678
00:42:46,543 --> 00:42:48,711
You all fucking lied to my face!

679
00:42:48,712 --> 00:42:51,131
You made a fool out of me
behind my back!

680
00:42:51,525 --> 00:42:53,319
Alfred, it wasn’t like that.

681
00:42:55,176 --> 00:42:56,176
Okay,

682
00:42:56,761 --> 00:42:57,762
let’s do it this way...

683
00:42:58,722 --> 00:43:01,725
Since you keep saying that
you’re already an adult,

684
00:43:02,392 --> 00:43:04,102
starting today, Elyse,

685
00:43:04,561 --> 00:43:06,937
you will be financially
independent from me.

686
00:43:06,938 --> 00:43:08,272
No more allowances,

687
00:43:08,273 --> 00:43:09,608
no more credit card.

688
00:43:10,817 --> 00:43:13,194
Learn to live with your salary.

689
00:43:13,695 --> 00:43:14,779
Alfred...

690
00:43:15,196 --> 00:43:16,572
That’s too much!

691
00:43:16,573 --> 00:43:18,783
No.
Mom, it’s okay.

692
00:43:21,745 --> 00:43:23,955
If that’s what will make Dad

693
00:43:25,957 --> 00:43:28,960
accept our relationship
then, I’ll do it.

694
00:43:31,671 --> 00:43:32,672
My dear…

695
00:43:33,715 --> 00:43:34,716
Elyse…

696
00:43:35,175 --> 00:43:36,509
One more thing,

697
00:43:37,802 --> 00:43:40,472
I will let you stay
in the house until next year.

698
00:43:41,389 --> 00:43:42,432
But after that,

699
00:43:43,266 --> 00:43:45,351
I expect you to move out.

700
00:43:45,376 --> 00:43:46,502
Do you understand?

701
00:43:51,316 --> 00:43:53,276
Alfred, where is she
going to stay?

702
00:43:53,735 --> 00:43:54,735
No.

703
00:43:55,612 --> 00:43:56,946
Mom, it’s okay.

704
00:43:58,907 --> 00:43:59,908
I can do it.

705
00:44:00,784 --> 00:44:03,577
I know that I’m only
in an entry level

706
00:44:03,578 --> 00:44:07,123
position in our family company
but I will work my way.

707
00:44:09,668 --> 00:44:10,669
And we...

708
00:44:12,754 --> 00:44:14,588
We will save up

709
00:44:14,589 --> 00:44:16,924
for our own place and we will
take care of each other

710
00:44:16,925 --> 00:44:18,842
and I will not add

711
00:44:18,843 --> 00:44:20,595
anymore to your worries.

712
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:24,473
But, Elyse, if you
need help just...

713
00:44:24,474 --> 00:44:25,474
No.

714
00:44:26,309 --> 00:44:28,137
Let her work hard for it.

715
00:44:28,162 --> 00:44:30,831
She can’t run our company
without getting in the dirt.

716
00:44:32,565 --> 00:44:34,275
She needs to learn on her own.

717
00:44:40,281 --> 00:44:41,282
Let’s eat.

718
00:44:51,459 --> 00:44:52,459
Everyone,

719
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,919
let’s welcome back Elyse.

720
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,713
She’s our new
marketing specialist.

721
00:44:55,714 --> 00:44:57,298
She was our intern before.

722
00:44:58,466 --> 00:44:59,884
- Hi!
- Hello!

723
00:45:00,969 --> 00:45:02,804
So this will be your desk.

724
00:45:03,513 --> 00:45:05,180
You can do whatever you want.

725
00:45:05,181 --> 00:45:06,181
Design…

726
00:45:07,058 --> 00:45:08,935
So, I’ll leave you to it.

727
00:45:09,394 --> 00:45:11,103
Congratulations, I’ll come back.

728
00:45:11,104 --> 00:45:12,104
- Shirley…
- Thank you.

729
00:45:34,127 --> 00:45:35,127
Hi!

730
00:45:36,963 --> 00:45:37,963
Austin.

731
00:45:39,507 --> 00:45:41,760
Hi, nice to meet you.

732
00:45:47,974 --> 00:45:49,224
I’m new, just like you.

733
00:45:49,225 --> 00:45:50,560
If you need any help,

734
00:45:51,102 --> 00:45:52,103
I’ll be right here.

735
00:46:06,201 --> 00:46:09,537
Finally, this work week
is almost over.

736
00:46:13,541 --> 00:46:14,542
Elyse?

737
00:46:16,085 --> 00:46:17,295
Check your email.

738
00:46:17,796 --> 00:46:20,255
I need you to make
a detailed summary

739
00:46:20,256 --> 00:46:21,841
of the feasibility report.

740
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:23,885
Can I have it tonight?

741
00:46:25,053 --> 00:46:27,889
The presentation to the
bosses is on Monday...

742
00:46:30,725 --> 00:46:32,100
You don’t want to?

743
00:46:32,101 --> 00:46:33,353
Got plans tonight?

744
00:46:34,437 --> 00:46:35,437
No,

745
00:46:36,064 --> 00:46:37,649
I can do it.

746
00:46:38,024 --> 00:46:40,360
I need it tonight, okay?

747
00:46:40,735 --> 00:46:41,735
Okay.

748
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:58,753
You can do this, Elyse.

749
00:47:00,672 --> 00:47:02,090
For your dreams.

750
00:47:16,437 --> 00:47:17,438
Good morning!

751
00:47:18,273 --> 00:47:19,273
For you,

752
00:47:19,607 --> 00:47:20,607
coffee and bread.

753
00:47:23,987 --> 00:47:26,239
Thanks, but you
don’t need to do that.

754
00:47:26,656 --> 00:47:27,657
You know what,

755
00:47:28,241 --> 00:47:30,285
you and I are alike.

756
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,705
Both of our parents are
in C-level positions.

757
00:47:34,706 --> 00:47:37,249
But we’re forced
to do this entry level

758
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:38,626
to prove ourselves.

759
00:47:39,085 --> 00:47:40,253
Bullshit, right?

760
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:45,925
I actually think that
it’s better this way.

761
00:47:46,342 --> 00:47:48,803
We learn everything
from the ground up.

762
00:47:49,262 --> 00:47:50,262
Well,

763
00:47:50,763 --> 00:47:52,515
if we need to prove ourselves,

764
00:47:53,683 --> 00:47:55,560
we might as well stick together.

765
00:47:58,688 --> 00:48:01,329
This corporate world
can be ruthless.

766
00:48:03,484 --> 00:48:05,695
We need to start
collecting allies.

767
00:48:10,658 --> 00:48:12,201
I have to work now.

768
00:48:30,845 --> 00:48:32,347
Will this be enough
to fill you up?

769
00:48:32,931 --> 00:48:34,682
It’s just a burger, no rice.

770
00:48:35,224 --> 00:48:36,516
Of course,

771
00:48:36,517 --> 00:48:38,603
we can save money doing this.

772
00:48:40,647 --> 00:48:42,273
You’re trying to save now too?

773
00:48:42,857 --> 00:48:45,944
Come on, it’s my
character development.

774
00:48:46,277 --> 00:48:48,196
And I also really want to save.

775
00:48:53,534 --> 00:48:54,661
How’s work?

776
00:48:56,287 --> 00:48:57,455
It’s fine,

777
00:48:57,872 --> 00:49:00,457
but there’s this one workmate

778
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:03,211
who’s so annoying, Austin.

779
00:49:03,503 --> 00:49:06,089
He’s so full of himself,
it’s irritating.

780
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:09,759
Just let it go, don’t mind him.

781
00:49:13,137 --> 00:49:14,138
By the way,

782
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:17,975
I saw Mama looking for a job.

783
00:49:17,976 --> 00:49:19,602
Is she okay with your dad?

784
00:49:22,605 --> 00:49:24,774
I didn’t notice
anything different.

785
00:49:25,149 --> 00:49:28,820
I mean, maybe she just wants
a change in environment?

786
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:31,656
She has been working
for Dad for years now.

787
00:49:32,156 --> 00:49:35,742
Didn’t she recently just
celebrate her 10th year at work?

788
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,744
Right?

789
00:49:38,371 --> 00:49:39,579
Yes,

790
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:40,665
and

791
00:49:41,457 --> 00:49:44,910
we’re about to celebrate
our third year anniversary.

792
00:49:45,169 --> 00:49:47,838
Right?
Time flies.

793
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:49,882
It’s already been three years.

794
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,176
Aren’t you tired of me yet?

795
00:49:53,177 --> 00:49:55,471
I’m never going
to get tired of you.

796
00:49:57,932 --> 00:49:59,433
And because of that,

797
00:49:59,434 --> 00:50:01,060
we’re going to celebrate.

798
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,354
We’re going to Bohol.

799
00:50:04,022 --> 00:50:05,022
Huh?

800
00:50:05,023 --> 00:50:06,733
Oh my god, really?

801
00:50:06,983 --> 00:50:07,983
Wait!

802
00:50:08,276 --> 00:50:10,902
I don’t want
anything grand, okay?

803
00:50:10,903 --> 00:50:13,280
We’re still saving up
for our condo.

804
00:50:13,281 --> 00:50:16,034
We can just celebrate simply.

805
00:50:16,576 --> 00:50:17,784
What are you talking about?

806
00:50:17,785 --> 00:50:19,245
I saved up for it.

807
00:50:22,165 --> 00:50:23,249
Thank you, babe.

808
00:50:26,169 --> 00:50:27,169
So sweet.

809
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:45,641
Happy Anniversary, babe.

810
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,103
Happy Anniversary, babe.

811
00:52:51,063 --> 00:52:52,607
Are you happy?

812
00:52:53,065 --> 00:52:54,317
Super.

813
00:54:07,223 --> 00:54:08,557
I’m so happy.

814
00:54:10,309 --> 00:54:12,520
I’m really grateful that

815
00:54:12,895 --> 00:54:16,107
we’re celebrating our third
anniversary here together.

816
00:54:16,357 --> 00:54:17,733
Me too, Ely.

817
00:54:20,027 --> 00:54:21,903
I’m so happy

818
00:54:21,904 --> 00:54:23,364
we celebrated here.

819
00:54:24,532 --> 00:54:26,658
Isn’t Bohol beautiful?

820
00:54:26,659 --> 00:54:28,119
It really is.

821
00:54:30,746 --> 00:54:32,123
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

822
00:54:33,165 --> 00:54:36,085
- Cheers to more adventures.
- Cheers to more adventures.

823
00:54:42,633 --> 00:54:44,802
I also have something
else to tell you.

824
00:54:46,012 --> 00:54:47,805
Another reason to celebrate.

825
00:54:48,097 --> 00:54:49,097
What is it?

826
00:54:50,182 --> 00:54:51,183
Well,

827
00:54:51,642 --> 00:54:53,852
my marketing manager

828
00:54:53,853 --> 00:54:56,355
actually told me that I have

829
00:54:57,148 --> 00:54:58,691
a chance for promotion.

830
00:54:59,525 --> 00:55:00,526
Wow!

831
00:55:02,695 --> 00:55:04,113
Congratulations, Ely.

832
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:05,781
You’re amazing.

833
00:55:07,158 --> 00:55:09,327
Thank you, but

834
00:55:10,328 --> 00:55:11,661
I honestly think that my mom

835
00:55:11,662 --> 00:55:13,873
has something to do
with that promotion.

836
00:55:15,666 --> 00:55:16,959
You worked hard for it,

837
00:55:18,002 --> 00:55:19,337
so you deserve it.

838
00:55:19,754 --> 00:55:20,754
Okay?

839
00:55:22,048 --> 00:55:23,673
In a way, I think that

840
00:55:23,674 --> 00:55:26,844
we’ll be able to start saving up
more for our future.

841
00:55:29,013 --> 00:55:30,222
What if

842
00:55:30,973 --> 00:55:33,893
we start saving up for the
down payment of the condo?

843
00:55:35,561 --> 00:55:37,855
Sure, I’m all for it.

844
00:55:38,606 --> 00:55:39,607
Really?

845
00:55:40,316 --> 00:55:42,985
Don’t you want to treat yourself
first and go shopping?

846
00:55:45,154 --> 00:55:46,154
No.

847
00:55:46,572 --> 00:55:50,034
Saving up for our future
is a treat for me.

848
00:55:52,286 --> 00:55:53,286
Okay?

849
00:55:54,705 --> 00:55:56,289
Are you really Ely?

850
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:57,290
Huh?

851
00:55:57,708 --> 00:55:59,250
I’m not used to this.

852
00:55:59,251 --> 00:56:01,003
It’s hard to believe.

853
00:56:06,092 --> 00:56:07,093
But...

854
00:56:08,427 --> 00:56:09,720
Seriously,

855
00:56:10,262 --> 00:56:12,515
the next thing we’ll save for

856
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,558
will be a house.

857
00:56:14,809 --> 00:56:16,309
Then...

858
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:17,937
we’ll start a family.

859
00:56:19,772 --> 00:56:23,483
I’m really looking forward
to growing old with you,

860
00:56:23,484 --> 00:56:25,778
and growing together…

861
00:56:26,946 --> 00:56:29,740
Who would have thought we would
reach three years, right?

862
00:56:43,754 --> 00:56:45,047
Me, Ely.

863
00:56:47,425 --> 00:56:50,469
I never doubted
that we would last.

864
00:56:51,512 --> 00:56:52,763
I love you.

865
00:56:56,934 --> 00:56:58,185
I love you.

866
01:01:40,968 --> 01:01:44,638
Isn’t it time to advance?

867
01:01:46,473 --> 01:01:47,808
Advance?

868
01:01:48,267 --> 01:01:51,145
It’s our third anniversary.

869
01:02:25,929 --> 01:02:27,514
What are you doing?

870
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:30,893
It’s hot.

871
01:03:05,302 --> 01:03:06,303
Bed.

872
01:04:43,525 --> 01:04:44,568
Babe…

873
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:50,282
Do you remember this?

874
01:04:53,493 --> 01:04:54,912
Of course.

875
01:04:55,913 --> 01:04:58,582
I’ll never forget that.

876
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:04,671
It feels like...

877
01:05:06,757 --> 01:05:08,216
it’s getting hot in here.

878
01:05:12,846 --> 01:05:16,683
I actually feel a bit cold.

879
01:05:17,601 --> 01:05:19,353
I need something

880
01:05:19,686 --> 01:05:21,146
to warm me up.

881
01:05:22,064 --> 01:05:23,315
I mean,

882
01:05:23,649 --> 01:05:24,900
something to help me rest.

883
01:05:26,234 --> 01:05:29,446
Do you want to relax?

884
01:06:08,318 --> 01:06:10,194
Can I see? Oh no...

885
01:06:10,195 --> 01:06:11,195
Here...

886
01:06:11,279 --> 01:06:13,030
- That again?
- Haven’t you worn that before?

887
01:06:13,031 --> 01:06:14,365
- Right.
- But it looks nice.

888
01:06:14,366 --> 01:06:15,242
It could work.

889
01:06:15,243 --> 01:06:16,784
- Really?
- It’s nice.

890
01:06:16,785 --> 01:06:18,202
- Okay...
- No!

891
01:06:18,203 --> 01:06:19,495
No?

892
01:06:19,496 --> 01:06:20,998
Not that? Let me see the...

893
01:06:21,748 --> 01:06:22,749
Okay…

894
01:06:24,543 --> 01:06:26,211
- How about this?
- That’s good.

895
01:06:26,586 --> 01:06:28,212
A dark color makes
you look slimmer.

896
01:06:28,213 --> 01:06:29,213
It’s nice.

897
01:06:29,214 --> 01:06:30,215
- That’s nice.
- Really?

898
01:06:31,758 --> 01:06:32,968
It’s really nice.

899
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:35,845
Why are you putting it back?

900
01:06:35,846 --> 01:06:37,596
The fabric is too thick.

901
01:06:37,597 --> 01:06:39,265
It’ll feel hot.
How about this one?

902
01:06:39,266 --> 01:06:40,266
- I like this.
- Sev, come on.

903
01:06:40,267 --> 01:06:42,107
They’re all the same.
It’s just for graduation.

904
01:06:42,936 --> 01:06:44,395
Why are you being so picky?

905
01:06:44,396 --> 01:06:45,563
You weren’t like this before.

906
01:06:45,564 --> 01:06:46,564
Exactly.

907
01:06:47,733 --> 01:06:50,652
Elyse is finally
introducing me to her dad.

908
01:06:51,153 --> 01:06:54,990
Oh my god! They're official now.

909
01:06:55,157 --> 01:06:58,201
From best boy to lover boy.

910
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:00,119
Sev!

911
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,956
Shit, I'm really
excited for you two.

912
01:07:05,333 --> 01:07:06,334
But

913
01:07:06,752 --> 01:07:08,420
I'm really nervous.

914
01:07:08,879 --> 01:07:11,130
Are you nervous that

915
01:07:11,131 --> 01:07:13,299
Elyse's dad won't like you?

916
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:16,428
Come on!
You’re Engineer Camero now.

917
01:07:18,972 --> 01:07:22,433
But her dad does
seem scary, doesn’t he?

918
01:07:22,434 --> 01:07:24,478
But you never know,
it might work out.

919
01:07:26,104 --> 01:07:27,105
I hope so.

920
01:07:27,481 --> 01:07:28,732
You got this, Sev.

921
01:08:03,475 --> 01:08:04,934
I’m going to miss this room.

922
01:08:04,935 --> 01:08:06,186
And of course you, Jewel.

923
01:08:08,355 --> 01:08:09,523
Isn’t it cute?

924
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:12,526
How sweet!
You added sugar, didn’t you?

925
01:08:13,235 --> 01:08:15,903
Ma, please.
You know my salary

926
01:08:15,904 --> 01:08:17,029
won't be enough
if I’m the only one

927
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:18,615
supporting Sofia
and Steven's education.

928
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:21,826
Hi, Luna. Have you seen Sevi?

929
01:08:21,827 --> 01:08:23,452
He hasn’t been
answering his phone.

930
01:08:23,453 --> 01:08:24,954
Where the hell have you been?

931
01:08:24,955 --> 01:08:26,163
What happened?

932
01:08:26,164 --> 01:08:28,667
My mom really
surprised me with her gift.

933
01:08:28,792 --> 01:08:29,835
A baby.

934
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,210
She’s fucking pregnant.

935
01:08:31,211 --> 01:08:32,211
Sev...
