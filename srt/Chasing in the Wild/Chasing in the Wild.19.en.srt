1
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,927
Based on our initial findings...

2
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:14,930
The collapse was due to
substandard materials.

3
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:16,474
How did this happen?

4
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,350
Maybe our...

5
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,019
head engineer here can explain.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,438
I was careless with
what happened in Batangas.

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,814
That’s my fault.

8
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,984
Stop putting the
blame on yourself.

9
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,526
These are information sheets

10
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,695
of the seven workers
who were on-site

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,072
at the guest villas on
the day of the accident.

12
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,741
Why did you do that?

13
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,451
I love you, I swear I do.

14
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,493
But why him?

15
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,537
I love him

16
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:41,082
despite all of the pain

17
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,917
that we shared in the past.

18
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,171
The soon-to-be-married
couple is here.

19
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,964
You’ve grown so much.

20
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,674
This is goodbye.

21
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,093
Just please be happy, Elyse.

22
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:53,594
I am.

23
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,054
Roel,

24
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,932
Thank you for
your service, Roel.

25
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:01,436
It’s an honor to serve you.

26
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,900
Can you believe
how far we’ve come?

27
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:10,069
I really want
a new life with you, Sevi.

28
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,362
Me too, Ely...

29
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,115
I want this life.

30
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,060
Elyse...

31
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,811
You should be resting now.

32
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,522
You have a big day tomorrow.

33
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,859
You’ll finally kick those
monsters out of your company.

34
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,781
I feel nervous, though.

35
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,326
Don't be.

36
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:44,289
I'm sure the board will
vote for what's right.

37
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,543
Right. Right.

38
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,296
But...

39
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,553
I know that smile.

40
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,724
Maybe...

41
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,352
I can do something

42
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,855
to ease your nerves.

43
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,025
Like what?

44
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,416
I thought

45
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,127
we were going to rest now?

46
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,891
We’ll be quick for tonight.

47
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,477
We need to be early tomorrow.

48
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,553
Today, one of the
Philippines' top conglomerates,

49
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,595
the Ledezma Group of Companies,

50
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,514
has voted to
remove Anthony Guerrero

51
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,057
as Chairman of the Board.

52
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,393
The decision comes
after an investigation

53
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,813
has revealed that he
and his son, Austin Guerrero,

54
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,441
were found to have been
involved in the recent collapse

55
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,651
of a villa in the
ongoing construction

56
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:23,238
of their latest resort project,
Aruga Resort.

57
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,949
Anthony Guerrero had been
with the Ledezma Group

58
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,827
for more than two decades.

59
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,508
Ely!

60
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,639
You have a visitor.

61
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,057
Ely!

62
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:51,893
Shan!

63
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,714
I heard about the meeting.

64
00:05:53,903 --> 00:05:55,363
Congrats on the vote.

65
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,148
Thank you.

66
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,348
Is that what brought you here?

67
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,027
I just want to see how
both of you are doing.

68
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,529
Sit.

69
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,951
I heard you went to see Alfred.

70
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,536
Are you okay?

71
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,917
Yes, I did.

72
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,252
Sevi came with me.

73
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:29,389
It was a tough conversation.
I will say that.

74
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,141
But I needed that closure.

75
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,436
Now I feel like
there’s a silver lining,

76
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,021
you know? And,

77
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,983
that a weight has
been lifted off of my chest.

78
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,319
I’m proud of you.

79
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,864
- You did well.
- Thank you, Shan.

80
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,200
And…

81
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,952
Thank you, Sevi,
for coming with Elyse.

82
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,871
I know it was hard for you, too.

83
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,542
It’s nothing.
What’s important is

84
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,044
that Elyse and I got through it.

85
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,422
That’s right, Shan.

86
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,673
And now,

87
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,300
we are busy preparing
for our wedding.

88
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,343
Yeah…

89
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,720
Actually, I came here because

90
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:13,141
I have something
important to tell you.

91
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,183
Really?

92
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,601
I’ll leave you two for now.

93
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,271
I’ll just buy some
snacks downstairs.

94
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:19,856
Okay.

95
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,273
Okay, love.

96
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,241
A few months before
Auntie Erin passed away,

97
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,119
she asked me to visit her.

98
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,205
Mom did?

99
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,456
Why?

100
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,961
She wanted to do something
special for your wedding.

101
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,595
Auntie Erin made an arrangement

102
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,389
with your designer
for your wedding gown.

103
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,641
The contract is there, too.

104
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,020
She arranged everything
before she passed away.

105
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,698
My Amore...

106
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:14,744
I’m so happy you're getting
married to the love of your life

107
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,246
This is a very special
moment for you

108
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,917
and I want to be
there even in spirit.

109
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,169
Choosing the bridal gown
is one of the most

110
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,923
beautiful moments a mother
and daughter can share...

111
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,718
and I don't want you
to experience it alone.

112
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,846
This is why
I prepared a gift for you.

113
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,890
I’ve talked to
our favorite designer

114
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,768
about making your wedding dress.

115
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:41,478
I made a rough sketch
of the wedding dress

116
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,022
I envisioned for you...

117
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:47,652
a princess cut ball gown
fit for a princess like you.

118
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,238
I hope you love it, my dear.

119
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,822
But feel free
to make any changes

120
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,450
that speaks to your heart.

121
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:58,037
This dress is all about you.

122
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,333
You’re my one and
only princess, dearest Ely.

123
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,295
You made my dream of
becoming a mother come true.

124
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,800
I hope you will feel
my love on your wedding day.

125
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,887
I know you will be
the most beautiful bride.

126
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:19,267
And as you begin this
new chapter in your life,

127
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:24,230
remember that love is about
partnership and trust.

128
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:29,610
Take care of each other and
cherish every moment together.

129
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,780
I love you forever,
my dearest Ely.

130
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,575
Love, Mommy.

131
00:09:58,844 --> 00:09:59,845
Wow!

132
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,354
It’s...

133
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,106
It’s so beautiful.

134
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,737
Mommy really knew me so well.

135
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,616
Thank you, Shan.

136
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,494
Thank you for doing this for me.

137
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,254
What happened?

138
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,553
My mom wrote me a letter, Sev.

139
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,518
She even chose
my wedding gown for me.

140
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,356
Wow, Ely.

141
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,402
Aunt Erin really
is your guardian angel.

142
00:10:53,427 --> 00:10:54,761
She’s never left your side.

143
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,366
Yes, I miss her so much.

144
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,621
I really wish
I could hug her right now.

145
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,011
Shan...

146
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,178
Yes?

147
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,892
Can you do me a favor?

148
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,190
Can you walk me down the aisle?

149
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,031
Of course.

150
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:40,824
Yeah?

151
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,868
Anything for you.

152
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,748
Thank you, Shan.

153
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,187
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

154
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,440
Oh my god!

155
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,066
You guys are here!

156
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,485
- Yes!
- Yes!

157
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,779
Wow!

158
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,406
What is this?

159
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,365
Bride-to-be!

160
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,200
This is for you.

161
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,119
You guys planned this for me?

162
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,288
It's Ida’s idea!

163
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:29,914
Thank you, Ida.

164
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,167
- You’re welcome.
- Thank you, girls.

165
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,044
I’m so grateful.

166
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,882
Oh, let’s stop the drama now!

167
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,551
Let’s make a toast...

168
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:45,805
to say goodbye to
Elyse’s single life!

169
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:46,599
This is for you.

170
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
- Yes!
- Yes!

171
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,810
Cheers!

172
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,480
For those who
haven’t noticed yet...

173
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,442
I can’t have champagne,
so I’ll just have juice.

174
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,234
We already know that.

175
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,235
That’s right.

176
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,946
You’re not allowed.

177
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,533
Elyse,

178
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:05,825
why aren’t you drinking?

179
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,411
You don’t want to
get drunk, huh?

180
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:08,788
No.

181
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,456
It’s...

182
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,458
I just want to be careful.

183
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,294
Careful? Why?

184
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,172
Are you pregnant too?

185
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,468
OMG! Ely!

186
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,262
No, I’m not sure yet.

187
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,931
I’m just a bit delayed and I...

188
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,225
I want to be careful.

189
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:33,061
Wait, more babies are
joining our group, huh?

190
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,313
Hold on!

191
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,273
I’m not even sure yet.

192
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,441
You’re not sure?

193
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,026
Well, it’s heading
that way anyway!

194
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,653
Come here, quick!

195
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,655
We have gifts for you,
come on, Ely!

196
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,490
Come on!

197
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:45,491
Come here.

198
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:46,784
I’ll go first...

199
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,580
Yes!

200
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,374
I’ll go first, okay?

201
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,251
- Okay.
- Okay.

202
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:55,918
Okay.
Sure.

203
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,878
Here!
This is my gift for you.

204
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,755
What is this?

205
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,803
Hopefully, it will be
helpful for both of you.

206
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,934
A Marital Bliss.

207
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:13,977
Thank you, Via.

208
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,312
Thank you.

209
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,731
I prepared something too.

210
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:19,733
Is this cash?

211
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,485
Hold on! I'm jealous!

212
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,530
Like, why weren't there any
cash gifts at my wedding?

213
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,073
I needed some too, you know!

214
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,700
Silly, it’s not cash!

215
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,244
It’s a villa holiday
package in Boracay.

216
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,662
You can use it
after your wedding

217
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,665
so you and Sevi can relax.

218
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,334
- Wow!
- That’s awesome!

219
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,128
Thank you, Sam.

220
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,547
Sevi’s going to love this.

221
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,803
Here. This one’s from me.

222
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,430
I made it myself.

223
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,495
Wow! What’s this?

224
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,769
Drum roll!

225
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,815
- Wow!
- Wow!

226
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:01,941
It’s so beautiful!

227
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,693
- Oh my god!
- It’s beautiful.

228
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:07,280
Wow! This is so beautiful, Ke.
Thank you.

229
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,240
- You’re welcome.
- Okay, wait!

230
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,618
- Your gifts are so wholesome!
- She’s right!

231
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,286
- Right!
- Let me spice things up.

232
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,039
Hurry and open it!

233
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,415
I wonder what it is?

234
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,207
I’m so excited,

235
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,501
Sevi will be so happy.

236
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,379
- Sevi will be happy?
- Yes!

237
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,507
Well?

238
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,093
Show it to us!

239
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,764
So pretty!

240
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,599
This is too revealing!

241
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,642
Come on!

242
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,935
You’ll take it off anyway.

243
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,020
Right!

244
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,771
No need to be shy.

245
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,023
That’s still pretty
wholesome, you know.

246
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,274
Hold on, here...

247
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,152
A little something to
spice up your sexy time.

248
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,696
Huh? What?

249
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,989
- Hurry!
- What’s that?

250
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,783
- What is it?
- What’s this?

251
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,286
- Oh my god!
- Yanna!

252
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,663
Yanna, what’s this?

253
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,830
What? It’s a vibrator!

254
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:58,873
Yanna!

255
00:15:58,874 --> 00:15:59,333
What?

256
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:02,460
Of course, it’s to make
your sex life spicier.

257
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,836
Do you want me
to demonstrate how?

258
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,005
No! Stop!

259
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,049
No, and there’s
a link there for...

260
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,427
- a tutorial. Show it to Sevi.
- No, I’m good.

261
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,179
Come on!

262
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,973
No, it’s okay,
thank you very much.

263
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,140
Don’t act coy all of a sudden!

264
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,935
You’re totally into him, anyway.

265
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,105
I’m curious...

266
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,564
What do you like about Sevi?

267
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,899
OMG, yes!

268
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,776
What made you
think this is the guy

269
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,737
that you’d want
to marry in the future?

270
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,037
I don’t know how to explain it.

271
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,540
Sevi is just...

272
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,750
Sevi, you know?

273
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,585
He is everything to me.

274
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,671
He treats me well,

275
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,506
he knows what I want

276
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,882
and what I don’t want.

277
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,219
We treat each other
with respect and...

278
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,598
and he makes me
laugh all of the time.

279
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,851
And the list goes on.

280
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,103
But most importantly...

281
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,439
aside from our
love for each other,

282
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,025
he plans for our future.

283
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,444
And there was never a moment

284
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,989
where I felt like
we were going nowhere.

285
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,158
I feel really secure with him.

286
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,038
Wow. I didn’t know
Sevi was like that.

287
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,998
You two are so sweet.

288
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,793
Seriously, even when
we tease that guy...

289
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,379
he really loves you so much!

290
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,297
Yes.

291
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:31,340
Yes, if you only knew how
much he cried for you back then!

292
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,800
Right? Unbelievable!

293
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:33,844
Seriously!

294
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,847
Because of that— let’s toast!

295
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,557
A toast again?

296
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,559
- We’re drinking again?
- Let’s toast again!

297
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,269
- Just join us!
- You’re just jealous.

298
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,021
- Cheers!
- Let’s cheers...

299
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,982
- Cheers!
- To a healthy marriage!

300
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,068
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

301
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,906
I’m not.

302
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,993
I have a question.

303
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:01,747
If you guys didn’t end up
with your current partner,

304
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,876
do you think you’d
end up with another man?

305
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,127
No!

306
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,419
If it’s not going to be Hiro,

307
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,671
then I’d be happy
with just me and Avi.

308
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,048
My priority is my child,

309
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,883
I’m not going to
look for someone else.

310
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,637
Believe me, I tried
to find someone else...

311
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,305
But nothing really worked out.

312
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,349
We know.

313
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,601
Good thing Kalix came back.

314
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,978
So, boom, this happened.

315
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,688
- Boom!
- Boom!

316
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,397
Bam!

317
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:30,943
How about you, Ely?

318
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,112
It’s really hard to match

319
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,573
the five-year relationship
Sevi and I had.

320
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,951
But even after all these years,

321
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,912
I’m still in love with him.

322
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:43,996
So,

323
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:48,877
I don’t think I could ever be
with another man other than him.

324
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,461
You know?

325
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,589
It’s only Sevi in this lifetime.

326
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,801
And if there’s another lifetime,

327
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,262
I’d still choose him.

328
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,391
Sevi’s so lucky to have you.

329
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,726
The feeling is mutual.

330
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,898
All right, enough of that!
Let’s toast!

331
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,275
- Toast again!
- Yes!

332
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:12,901
Cheers!

333
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,486
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

334
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,795
So,

335
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,547
how was your stag party?

336
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:34,798
Did you have fun?

337
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,465
Yes!

338
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,468
A lot of people got drunk.

339
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,511
How about you?

340
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,681
How was your bridal shower?

341
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,766
We had a lot of fun.

342
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,436
We had a lot of fun.

343
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,818
By... by the way...

344
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,029
There is something that

345
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,532
I’ve been meaning to tell you…

346
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,921
My period has been
delayed for 8 days now…

347
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,050
and I’m never delayed.

348
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,430
Oh my god, Ely!

349
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,557
Are you pregnant?

350
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:30,062
I’m not sure yet. I could be?

351
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:45,244
We can go to the doctor
today for a check-up.

352
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,662
No matter what the results are,

353
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:51,291
I’ll be so happy and excited
to start a family with you.

354
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,377
Okay.

355
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,962
Let’s go to the doctor.

356
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,215
I’m really happy
and excited as well

357
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,842
but I’m also really nervous.

358
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,469
Why?

359
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,931
I guess

360
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,851
because I don’t have
my mom here to guide me.

361
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,563
I don’t even think
that I’m ready yet.

362
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,485
Ely...

363
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:22,239
I believe you’ll be a great mom.

364
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,286
I’ve seen how you care
for the people you love.

365
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,499
Thank you.

366
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,922
But before
we go to the doctor...

367
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:44,344
can we at least stop by
somewhere before we go?

368
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,097
I really need to be there.

369
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,349
Of course.

370
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,371
Hi, Mommy!

371
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,748
I came back.

372
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,792
And guess what?

373
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,961
I’m getting married!

374
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:20,629
Don’t worry,

375
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,089
you’ve already met him.

376
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,090
And

377
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:27,011
you told me that you
liked his personality and...

378
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,680
that you know that this man
will take good care of me

379
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,932
and treat me well.

380
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,979
Mommy, I’m marrying the person
that I love the most.

381
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,357
I’m marrying Sevi.

382
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,779
And I know
that you are happy for me.

383
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,785
She knows.

384
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,829
Huh? What?

385
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,039
What do you mean?

386
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,627
I always visit Auntie.

387
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,089
I always bring her
white flowers.

388
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,346
Those white flowers?

389
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,768
It was all from you?

390
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,732
I want your mom to know that

391
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,777
I will never forget her.

392
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,282
She really meant a lot
for the both of us, huh?

393
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,662
I came here before
I proposed, too.

394
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,375
I know that she really
loved that you did that.

395
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,294
And I know

396
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:45,257
Auntie is happy now because
she’s in a better place.

397
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,681
Auntie,

398
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,100
I want you to know that

399
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:58,019
I’m marrying your daughter.

400
00:23:58,478 --> 00:23:59,646
This is it,

401
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,440
it’s happening soon!

402
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:05,235
We’ve overcome
a lot of challenges.

403
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,738
And I know...

404
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,532
you were one of those

405
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,243
who helped us.

406
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:26,256
Thank you for always
remembering my mom, Sevi.

407
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,551
That means so much to me.

408
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:35,223
I know that she’s
watching over us and

409
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:39,019
she is very happy
to see us happy.

410
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,775
Mommy…

411
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,238
thank you for thinking of me,

412
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,282
always.

413
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,784
Even in the afterlife.

414
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,247
Your surprise wedding dress

415
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:03,126
for me means everything.

416
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,420
I really love it!

417
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,341
And

418
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,220
you may not be
with us physically

419
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,473
but I know that your spirit

420
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:21,269
and your love and your guidance
is always surrounding me.

421
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:27,484
And now that
I might be starting a family...

422
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,531
I know that your
strength and courage

423
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,033
will always push me through.

424
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,215
I want you to hear
my wedding vows.

425
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,677
Now, it’s just a first draft

426
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,846
but it's from the heart.

427
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,106
Sevi,

428
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,984
my best captain,

429
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,737
my King Panther,

430
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,782
my engineer…

431
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,079
I love you so much.

432
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:35,218
I promise to be with you
in every win and every loss.

433
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:39,556
I promise to be with you
during the worst times

434
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,933
and the best of times.

435
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:48,064
I promise to give the
best version of myself to you.

436
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,372
Wow, I can’t believe
you’re getting married, bro.

437
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,123
It’s funny.

438
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:35,374
All of this started only

439
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,753
because I had to use
the bathroom at Ely’s debut.

440
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,089
I can’t believe it either.

441
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,466
Fate really works
in mysterious ways.

442
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,343
You’re lucky,

443
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,555
you’re marrying
the love of your life.

444
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,557
Enjoy the moment, bro.

445
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,559
Thanks, bro.

446
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,553
Take care of my sister, okay?

447
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,282
I’ve got it covered,
my brother-in-law.

448
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,055
You look beautiful.

449
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,183
Thank you.

450
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:24,270
You look so handsome.

451
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:27,231
She really looks
like a princess.

452
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:30,859
Elyse is the beauty, and Baste

453
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,944
is the Beast.

454
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,363
Beauty and the Baste.

455
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,407
Damn it, Yanna!

456
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,700
The heck, guys, stop laughing.

457
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,243
You’re making me laugh too!

458
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,497
Stop it. I’ll start
pinching you, guys.

459
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,341
We are gathered here today

460
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,259
to witness

461
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,805
the union of Sevi and Elyse.

462
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,026
Sevi…

463
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:59,072
Today, I give myself to you

464
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,366
in marriage.

465
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:06,413
Now, I’m about to
promise a lot of things

466
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:09,417
so listen carefully
so you don’t get lost.

467
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,962
I can’t believe we met

468
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,465
because of Arkin’s bad stomach.

469
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,760
And I can’t believe

470
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:24,765
that I hated you the first
moment that I saw you.

471
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:29,187
You just had this vibe
that I did not like.

472
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,564
But...

473
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:36,026
I ended up falling so hard

474
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,278
because of it.

475
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,074
Remember when
I wore a Panthers shirt

476
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,577
for the first time?

477
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:48,038
An Arrows cheerleader,

478
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:51,918
wearing a Panthers shirt
in a basketball game.

479
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,422
That was the most embarrassing
thing that I’ve ever done.

480
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:03,095
It took me a lot of games...

481
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,057
and trainings...

482
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,809
exchanges of shirts...

483
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,771
and other things...

484
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:16,150
to realize
my real feelings for you.

485
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,531
We just couldn’t
get enough of each other.

486
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,118
Sevi…

487
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,623
My best captain.

488
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,085
My King Panther.

489
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,754
My engineer.

490
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,301
I love you so much.

491
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,474
I promise

492
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,893
to be with you

493
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,313
in every win and every loss.

494
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,818
I promise to be with you during

495
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,279
the worst of times

496
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,657
and the best of times.

497
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:10,454
And I promise to give the
best version of myself to you.

498
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,205
And to help you grow

499
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,959
so that we can be
the best for each other.

500
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,923
I promise to trust you,

501
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,509
to respect you

502
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:27,221
and to love you
more and more everyday.

503
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,476
I promise to continue
cheering for you.

504
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,563
And I will encourage you,

505
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:39,483
and inspire you whatever
the circumstances are.

506
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,194
And I promise to cherish

507
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:46,574
and spend every moment with you.

508
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,369
Even the good ones
and the bad ones.

509
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,248
I promise

510
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,709
to share my sorrow

511
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,754
and my joy with you.

512
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:04,508
I promise that I will love you

513
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,595
and I will choose you.

514
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,807
Even when life gets hard.

515
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:18,439
Even when everything
becomes so tiring.

516
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,652
And nothing feels like
it’s going right anymore.

517
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:28,574
I promise that
I would be your strength,

518
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,243
motivation,

519
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:35,039
and inspiration to
keep pushing forward.

520
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,546
I love you, my Sevi.

521
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,304
And I will love you
for the rest of my life.

522
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,484
Elyse…

523
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:08,239
I don’t need to tell
the story of how we met...

524
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,617
because almost everyone

525
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,161
already knows.

526
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,040
What I’ll say is

527
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,961
how I felt when I first met you.

528
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,048
I didn’t like you then.

529
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,633
I told myself

530
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,553
I didn’t like people like you.

531
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,681
Even before we got
to know each other,

532
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,642
I knew you weren’t my type.

533
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,061
Arkin knew that too.

534
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,487
But when I saw

535
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,907
how good your heart is...

536
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,411
and how ready you were

537
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,456
to sacrifice everything

538
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:02,668
for my happiness and yours...

539
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:07,715
Elyse…

540
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,676
That’s five years.

541
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:12,678
Five years.

542
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:19,935
We’ve been through almost
every hardship together.

543
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,856
From basketball,

544
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,159
to the cheer dance competition,

545
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,748
to studying,

546
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,791
graduating,

547
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,669
taking the board exam,

548
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,964
looking for a job,

549
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,926
working,

550
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,304
getting our first condo,

551
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,932
and choosing the furniture.

552
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,936
We grew together,

553
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,772
then we grew apart.

554
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,445
But during those times

555
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,073
when we were apart...

556
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,159
those were the moments
that made us stronger.

557
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:19,745
Elyse…

558
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,958
Thank you for being with me.

559
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,794
Thank you for

560
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,589
putting up with my corny jokes.

561
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,469
And thank you for

562
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:39,139
accepting me completely.

563
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,186
Today, Elyse...

564
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,065
I accept you completely.

565
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:52,528
I accept you for who you are.

566
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,574
I take you with all your faults,

567
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:59,076
insecurities,

568
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,287
attitude,

569
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,123
weakness, and strength.

570
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:07,960
I promise,

571
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:11,130
I will choose you,

572
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,384
and love you
with every passing day.

573
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,390
In every waking moment,

574
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:24,677
and every time I fall asleep,

575
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,604
it will always be you

576
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,148
that I choose and love.

577
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,153
I promise to be with you...

578
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:37,656
even when you think that
everything is falling apart.

579
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,409
I promise

580
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,120
that I will try every day

581
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,372
to present my best to you.

582
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,252
I promise

583
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,047
to share everything with you,

584
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,716
even my food.

585
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,471
I promise

586
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:03,057
that I will never
make you feel alone,

587
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,268
facing all of your battles.

588
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,024
I will share

589
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,361
in all your sadness.

590
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:20,948
We will share

591
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,701
all of our happiness

592
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:26,121
with each other.

593
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,674
I promise...

594
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:40,803
I will never leave your side.

595
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,223
No matter how hard

596
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,558
or exhausting it gets.

597
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:49,937
Because I love you.

598
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,735
And I can handle anything

599
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,279
as long as you’re with me.

600
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,409
I promise

601
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,911
to make you proud.

602
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,081
Elyse…

603
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,627
I love you so much.

604
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,590
And I love you.

605
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,516
Do you Elyse take Sevi

606
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:30,643
to be your lawfully
wedded husband,

607
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,228
to have and to hold,

608
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,355
in sickness and in health,

609
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:36,650
in good times and in bad,

610
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,986
for richer or poorer,

611
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:42,029
keeping yourself solely unto him

612
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,450
for as long
as you both shall live?

613
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:46,827
I do.

614
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,788
Do you Sevi take Elyse

615
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:53,124
to be your lawfully wedded wife,

616
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:56,503
to have and to hold,
in sickness and in health,

617
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,672
in good times and in bad,

618
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:02,133
for richer or poorer,
keeping yourself

619
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:05,471
solely unto her for
as long as you both shall live?

620
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:06,680
I do.

621
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,224
By the power vested in me,

622
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,853
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

623
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,980
You may now kiss the bride.

624
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:28,178
I love you so much.

625
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:30,722
I love you...

626
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:35,727
and I will love you every
single day that passes, Elyse.

627
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,912
We’re married!

628
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:07,360
She’s the only person I’d like
to see after every game, workday,

629
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,281
and at the end of every day.
She’s my safe haven.

630
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,407
What do you mean
you don’t want to?

631
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:55,909
I’m sorry, that scared me!

632
00:49:57,202 --> 00:50:00,037
Future CEO of the
Lede—lede... lede

633
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,038
Ledezma Group.

634
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,087
Why are you laughing?

635
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,090
I’m just making you laugh!

636
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:12,925
It doesn’t fit?

637
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:14,052
Hi, Hya!

638
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:17,096
Who’s she?

639
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,140
Elyse!

640
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:21,058
Hey! Olyse still needs
to graduate first!

641
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:21,977
Who?

642
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:23,561
Who’s Olyse?

643
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,438
Elyse needs to graduate first,

644
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,649
and I need to work first.

645
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:31,152
Dog!

646
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,491
Is everyone in a bad mood?

647
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:38,534
Bye!

648
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:47,210
Thank you, but you
don’t need to woe-ry.

649
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:48,795
Woe-ry?

650
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:49,795
Worry.

651
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:51,923
I’m conservative, okay?

652
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,758
What about my repusasio...

653
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:54,301
Sorry.

654
00:50:54,302 --> 00:50:55,427
Recap, I’m conservative...

655
00:50:58,972 --> 00:50:59,890
Cut.

656
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:01,141
What’s with the face?

657
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:04,644
It’s so hard to match...

658
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:08,356
Let me know where...,
I’ll get it for you.

659
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:10,442
One more!

660
00:51:10,443 --> 00:51:11,651
One more time!

661
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:14,780
Hold on!

662
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:15,946
- Last line.
- Wait a minute.

663
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,615
- Let’s go home.
- There’s still a line.

664
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:18,450
There’s still a line
before you kiss!

665
00:51:18,451 --> 00:51:19,700
- Sorry.
- Chill, guys.

666
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:21,786
- Can we relax, friend?
- Let’s go home.

667
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:22,537
There’s still a line.

668
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:23,537
Okay.

669
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:34,216
Come here!
