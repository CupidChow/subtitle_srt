You said to let my mother go

138
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,300

that my family did to

157
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,866

158
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,333
even coming back
here after leaving

159
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:51,200
you heartbroken
it must have been

160
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:52,966
hard for you
to deal with me

161
00:12:53,766 --> 00:12:55,833
I brought a cake on
our fifth anniversary

162
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,800
and then broke up with
you on the same day

163
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,533
you said before that you

164
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:02,300
don't want to
see me ever

165
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:03,966
again and i
understand why

166
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:08,266
I don't want to cause
you any more pain

167
00:13:09,566 --> 00:13:11,000
maybe living again

168
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:12,333
is the best thing

169
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,533

losing you forever

00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:10,466

00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:46,900
i know how much i love sevi

192
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,466
but maybe i'm just
not good for him

193
00:16:51,966 --> 00:16:52,766
you know

194
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,033
I understand

195
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,300
but just leave without

196
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,233
saying anything

197
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,300
The last time
I saw you, you

198
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,166
looked like a
teenager in love

199
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,233
now you look like
an old man with

200
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:21,733
heaven and earth
mixed together

201
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,300
oh

202
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,900
what happened

203
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:29,933
yes

204
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:31,666
nothing happened

205
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,600
I thought you and
Elise were okay

206
00:17:37,366 --> 00:17:38,566
me too

207
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,933
but suddenly left

208
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:42,866
haha

209
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,766
why did you talk to me?

210
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:48,333
no

211
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,100
suddenly left a note

212
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,000
even I was in the
condo earlier to change

213
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:58,200
didn't even talk
to me face to face

214
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:00,533
we had fun and

215
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:02,800
then it was the same

216
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:04,966
i don't understand

217
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:07,900
what is the reason?

218
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,600
i don't know

219
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:13,333
but he is revisiting

220
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,566
the issue before

221
00:18:16,866 --> 00:18:17,800
this is me

222
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,466
I'm fixing it

223
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,533
did you try to talk

224
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:25,733
how can I talk to
him if he leaves?

225
00:18:29,266 --> 00:18:30,066
you're right

226
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,633
when I think about it

227
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,033
but for now

228
00:18:40,766 --> 00:18:41,900
I left the condo and

229
00:18:42,266 --> 00:18:43,633
I'm staying at the hotel

230
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,700
stay with me first

231
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:48,533
you don't have to
go through this alone

232
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:50,833
don't be sad i have

233
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:53,000
a surprise for you

234
00:18:56,266 --> 00:18:58,833
thank you ellie

235
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:00,966

236
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:04,900
happy birthday ellie
happy birthday ellie

237
00:19:14,933 --> 00:19:17,200
of course oh a gift

238
00:19:18,233 --> 00:19:19,366
from yannay nay

239
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,300
oh wow thank

240
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,766
you so much

241
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,500
oh sure oh wait

242
00:19:30,266 --> 00:19:31,200
I'll call her

243
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,133
in a minute

244
00:19:32,633 --> 00:19:33,433
okay

245
00:19:34,566 --> 00:19:38,966
wow he seems really happy
and content right now he is

246
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,866
I finally found this
eternal love and happiness

247
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,500
because you fought for it

248
00:19:46,766 --> 00:19:48,066
love is not for cowards

249
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:52,900
You know it's just
straightforward

250
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,433
this is not the right
time for you to show

251
00:19:54,433 --> 00:19:57,400
your pride okay yes
I get that you were

252
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,166
hurt by what you did
before but you two

253
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,200
are really lacking in
proper conversation

254
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,800
I know you want to focus

255
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,433
on what you have now

256
00:20:08,966 --> 00:20:10,133
but i think

257
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:14,333
You still have a
lot to address about

258
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,866
what happened
to you in the past

259
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:17,566
especially what you

260
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,433
talked about is wrong

261
00:20:23,966 --> 00:20:25,633
i know you move backwards
i've been in your condo

262
00:20:29,066 --> 00:20:31,900
actually i just moved back out

263
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:33,566
what

264
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:35,333
why

265
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:39,733
I don't know

266
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,400
i just think that

267
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:41,900
it's so foolish of me

268
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,366
to think that i can

269
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:45,800
just go back there

270
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,866
and things will
be how the way

271
00:20:48,866 --> 00:20:53,800
was after everything
that's happened

272
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,566
but none of that
was your fault Ellie

273
00:20:58,766 --> 00:21:02,233
i don't know it's just a
lot to think about grim

274
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:07,533
god especially
after everything

275
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:08,333
that happened
with dad elise

276
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,700
please listen to me

277
00:21:12,466 --> 00:21:14,033
you can't keep
carrying that burden

278
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,833
it's weighing you down

279
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,700
you need to let it go

280
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:21,033
it's time

281
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:23,633
elise

282
00:21:24,466 --> 00:21:26,366
you should set yourself
free from that guilt

283
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:45,600
and that's all for

284
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,533
today thank you

285
00:21:46,533 --> 00:21:47,333

286
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:53,833

open for any questions

00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,366

288
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:01,166

was as clear as it is

00:22:04,133 --> 00:22:05,733
are you sure miss ledesma

290
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:09,000
you don't want
to clarify anything

291
00:22:12,033 --> 00:22:12,833
no just continue on with

292
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:15,466

00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:17,700

00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,800
needed to finish it

305
00:23:31,266 --> 00:23:33,700
we will lack that material

00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:37,133

314
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:10,766
why are you here

315
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,800
I just want to talk

316
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,766
what else are we talking about?

317
00:24:21,933 --> 00:24:22,733
i'm sorry

318
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:27,366
you know

319
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,766
your desire to leave

320
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:33,400
then come back

321
00:24:34,633 --> 00:24:35,966
then leave again

322
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:38,900
will be back again

323
00:24:39,533 --> 00:24:41,366
Mother, what do you
really want, Elise?

324
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:45,133
boy you didn't want me
there in the first place

325
00:24:46,133 --> 00:24:46,933
huh

326
00:24:47,466 --> 00:24:49,066
the unit is all yours now

327
00:24:50,233 --> 00:24:52,300
I did you a favor right

328
00:24:54,133 --> 00:24:56,500
I left to give you space

329
00:24:57,533 --> 00:24:58,433
still now

330
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,333
after you train me to be there

331
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:07,700
you leave again

332
00:25:12,533 --> 00:25:13,300
oh what what do

333
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,100
you want me to do

334
00:25:16,866 --> 00:25:18,866
doesn't it hurt that I'm there?

335
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,966
more painful

336
00:25:22,766 --> 00:25:24,833
it hurts more when you leave me

337
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,000
rather than you staying Elise

338
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:31,166
it won't hurt anymore

339
00:25:37,466 --> 00:25:38,600
when you left

340
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,666
I looked for you again

341
00:25:42,866 --> 00:25:44,333
I was blessed to
follow you even though I

342
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:47,166
told you that I don't
want to see you anymore

343
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:51,466
but the mother

344
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,433
those days

345
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,833
I'm happy just to
catch a glimpse of you

346
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,166
but it seems like
I'm just fooling myself

347
00:26:04,233 --> 00:26:05,700
five years elise

348
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,933
what what

349
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:14,733
i don't know sir

350
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,933
I'm to be shy

351
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:22,633
indeed

352
00:26:26,033 --> 00:26:27,800
but why is it easy for you?

353
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,900
when I saw you, you just

354
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,933
smiled as if
nothing happened

355
00:26:35,766 --> 00:26:37,333
then leave me

356
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,933
do you want to play with me?

357
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:47,600
it was never easy for me he said

358
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:53,033
I needed to
leave because

359
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,066
I needed time for myself

360
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:03,733
and i need to save myself to

361
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:12,133
sorry

362
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,600
I lost everyone

363
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,000
I lost my family

364
00:27:21,866 --> 00:27:24,200
I lost my support system

365
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:30,200
I felt like I didn't love
anyone at the time

366
00:27:31,466 --> 00:27:33,600
I understand that Elisse

367
00:27:35,433 --> 00:27:37,266
but i don't understand

368
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,666
after you come
back you leave again

369
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,766
I really like what you say

370
00:27:51,766 --> 00:27:52,566
said no

371
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,566
i'm so sorry

372
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,466
said I'm really sorry

373
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,500
I realized a lot of things

374
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:15,733
i felt really guilty
and selfish for

375
00:28:16,066 --> 00:28:19,500
wanting us to
get back together

376
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:25,800
I was a coward

377
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,366
and i was scared

378
00:28:32,366 --> 00:28:34,133
but aren't you scared for us

379
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:37,633
what if we get hurt again

380
00:28:40,466 --> 00:28:42,400
I can bear
the pain better

381
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,100
when you are there Elise

382
00:29:15,433 --> 00:29:17,000
I'm really sorry

383
00:29:20,966 --> 00:29:23,833
I'm really really
sorry for everything

384
00:29:26,666 --> 00:29:28,100
sorry elise

385
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,200
I'm sorry for all the
things I said to you before

386
00:29:37,966 --> 00:29:40,366
there is not a day
that I don't regret

387
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,133
Oh, I won't cook anymore

388
00:30:05,133 --> 00:30:06,300
drink it first

389
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,100
thank you

390
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,000
you know

391
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,266
I haven't seen

392
00:30:30,533 --> 00:30:31,333
my dad for years

393
00:30:31,766 --> 00:30:32,733
since I left

394
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:39,166
I don't think I'll ever be
able to face him again

395
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,700
especially after
knowing what he did

396
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,733
don't you see your daddy

397
00:30:48,133 --> 00:30:50,166
again it's
too triggering

398
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,566
for me to see him

399
00:30:53,566 --> 00:30:56,133
you know after
that tragic incident

400
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,900
happened i had
to go to therapy

401
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:03,133
the impact of
everything was just

402
00:31:04,033 --> 00:31:05,633
too much for me to handle

403
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,066
sorry ins don't

404
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:11,566
say sorry it's

405
00:31:11,866 --> 00:31:13,366
not your fault

406
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,800
you know

407
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:16,800
if anything

408
00:31:17,533 --> 00:31:20,300
the only person to
blame right now is my dad

409
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:26,466
I saw that he was

410
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,300
in the hospital today

411
00:31:29,066 --> 00:31:29,866
yeah

412
00:31:30,366 --> 00:31:32,733
that's the last news
i heard about them

413
00:31:35,966 --> 00:31:36,900
aren't you him?

414
00:31:37,533 --> 00:31:38,500
will visit

415
00:31:39,466 --> 00:31:40,966
what if he suddenly disappears

416
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,200
said

417
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,000
please don't

418
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,933
I don't want to deal
with that matter right now

419
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,033
you know you should hate him

420
00:31:51,933 --> 00:31:53,633
he ruined everything

421
00:31:54,933 --> 00:31:56,133

422
00:31:58,266 --> 00:31:59,300

424
00:32:05,766 --> 00:32:08,166
I'm tired of harboring
anger Elisse

425
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:14,000
you're so selfless
and kind hearted

426
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:17,366
savy until now i
still can't believe

427
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,133

428
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,933

429
00:32:30,433 --> 00:32:31,933
you're staying here right

430
00:32:32,966 --> 00:32:35,300

433
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,000
I think I have a fever

434
00:32:50,566 --> 00:32:52,766
I feel like I need someone
to take care of me

435
00:32:53,433 --> 00:32:56,866
I wish I could feel

436
00:32:56,866 --> 00:32:57,766
what I always take

437
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,900
care of when I have a

438
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,100
fever and I'm drunk

439
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,566
ah fine fine

440
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:12,533
you don't need to
hear it, feel it too

441
00:33:15,266 --> 00:33:16,800
I'm coming home to you

442
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:37,966

444
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,133
unfairness

445
00:34:21,866 --> 00:34:23,066
I really can't
mess it up,

446
00:34:23,466 --> 00:34:25,166
you didn't tidy
up the room

447
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:27,533
when you left
and then you

448
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:29,333
left the food
you ate behind

449
00:34:30,766 --> 00:34:35,066
I'm fine washing
dishes all week long

450
00:34:35,766 --> 00:34:37,366

451
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,400

our past and

misunderstandings
that we had

490
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:17,033
