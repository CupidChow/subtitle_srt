1
00:00:10,489 --> 00:00:11,906
I’m going to miss this room.

2
00:00:11,907 --> 00:00:13,242
And of course you, Jewel.

3
00:00:15,411 --> 00:00:16,579
Isn’t it cute?

4
00:00:17,163 --> 00:00:19,248
So sweet. You put
sugar in it, didn’t you?

5
00:00:20,374 --> 00:00:21,374
Come on, Ma!

6
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,752
I can’t handle that
with my salary.

7
00:00:23,753 --> 00:00:24,920
Welcome home!

8
00:00:26,464 --> 00:00:27,630
Hi, Luna.

9
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:29,132
Have you seen Sevi?

10
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:30,633
He hasn’t been
answering his phone.

11
00:00:30,634 --> 00:00:32,218
Where the hell have you been?

12
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:33,220
What happened?

13
00:00:33,512 --> 00:00:36,056
My mom really
surprised me with her gift.

14
00:00:36,057 --> 00:00:37,057
A baby.

15
00:00:37,141 --> 00:00:38,392
She’s fucking pregnant.

16
00:00:38,434 --> 00:00:39,435
Sev…

17
00:00:40,478 --> 00:00:42,062
Good morning, babe.

18
00:00:42,063 --> 00:00:43,522
I made your favorite.

19
00:00:43,814 --> 00:00:45,482
Bacon and waffle.

20
00:00:45,483 --> 00:00:46,901
I miss this.

21
00:00:47,276 --> 00:00:48,443
I missed you too.

22
00:00:48,444 --> 00:00:51,404
I told the office not to
bother me this weekend.

23
00:00:51,405 --> 00:00:53,031
Let’s go! To Baguio?

24
00:00:53,032 --> 00:00:54,200
I would love that.

25
00:00:54,408 --> 00:00:55,034
Huh?

26
00:00:55,035 --> 00:00:57,035
Am I the only engineer
that can go there?

27
00:00:57,036 --> 00:00:59,746
I guess we’re not pushing
through with our plans again.

28
00:00:59,747 --> 00:01:01,456
I need to go to the site first.

29
00:01:01,457 --> 00:01:02,458
Leave already.

30
00:01:03,334 --> 00:01:04,376
Just go.

31
00:01:04,585 --> 00:01:06,295
I’m tired, Sev.

32
00:01:06,796 --> 00:01:08,422
We need to take a break.

33
00:02:15,573 --> 00:02:17,199
Let’s take a break.

34
00:02:20,327 --> 00:02:22,079
We need to take a break.

35
00:02:23,622 --> 00:02:24,789
But Elyse…

36
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,458
We need time.

37
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:29,753
You need time.

38
00:02:36,427 --> 00:02:37,928
Elyse, come on…

39
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:40,972
We can talk about this, right?

40
00:02:40,973 --> 00:02:42,808
Talk about this?

41
00:02:45,227 --> 00:02:47,521
Sev, we’re so tired!

42
00:02:50,024 --> 00:02:52,150
I’m tired.

43
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:55,779
I am so tired and
I know you’re tired, too.

44
00:02:57,656 --> 00:03:00,492
But we can just rest together…

45
00:03:01,076 --> 00:03:02,995
Please…Please…

46
00:03:03,537 --> 00:03:04,705
Sev…

47
00:03:06,123 --> 00:03:08,292
I just need this break.

48
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,047
I think we should just

49
00:03:15,216 --> 00:03:17,009
take this time apart.

50
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,305
And we can talk
about it again later.

51
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,975
Ely, I don't understand...

52
00:03:26,602 --> 00:03:28,938
Are you breaking up with me?

53
00:03:34,985 --> 00:03:36,320
Ely...

54
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,866
Answer me.

55
00:03:44,912 --> 00:03:46,705
You're coming back, right?

56
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:51,669
Of course.

57
00:03:54,672 --> 00:03:55,714
We just need

58
00:03:56,257 --> 00:03:59,176
this time off, separately.

59
00:04:01,428 --> 00:04:03,847
You should take this
time with your family.

60
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:06,183
They need you.

61
00:04:12,356 --> 00:04:13,356
Okay.

62
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:16,735
That's all I wanted
to hear from you.

63
00:04:17,278 --> 00:04:19,280
I'll wait for you to come back.

64
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,076
I'm just here if you ever
want to come home, okay?

65
00:05:30,934 --> 00:05:33,729
This is where
we had our first kiss.

66
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,774
So? Can I kiss you?

67
00:06:02,925 --> 00:06:04,676
@sevirous:
I love you so much.

68
00:06:14,812 --> 00:06:16,896
@sevirous:
The house will always be open

69
00:06:16,897 --> 00:06:21,235
when you’re ready to come home.

70
00:07:06,697 --> 00:07:09,450
@elydezma: I’ll be taking
some time offline.

71
00:07:15,247 --> 00:07:18,459
I need to disconnect
and take a break.

72
00:07:20,627 --> 00:07:24,006
@elydezma:
I love you so much too.

73
00:07:45,277 --> 00:07:49,490
@sevirous: Okay. Just let me
know if you need anything.

74
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:15,552
Welcome home!

75
00:10:59,471 --> 00:11:00,471
Sev!

76
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:03,517
Use a cup, we need
to conserve water.

77
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:33,963
I told you
I can get Avi to sleep.

78
00:11:33,964 --> 00:11:35,424
I’m really good at this.

79
00:11:35,841 --> 00:11:36,717
Please!

80
00:11:36,718 --> 00:11:39,301
You tired her out,
you two kept running around.

81
00:11:39,302 --> 00:11:41,263
You guys were a mess!

82
00:11:41,722 --> 00:11:44,349
What are you talking about?
Avi just missed me.

83
00:11:45,517 --> 00:11:48,270
But thanks.

84
00:11:49,104 --> 00:11:51,022
For letting me come here.

85
00:11:51,815 --> 00:11:53,175
Well, you were
already at the door.

86
00:11:55,652 --> 00:11:58,739
Thanks for helping me
take care of Avi.

87
00:11:59,656 --> 00:12:00,656
Of course!

88
00:12:00,907 --> 00:12:04,161
I’m going to be
Avi’s favorite uncle.

89
00:12:04,536 --> 00:12:05,912
Does she even have a choice?

90
00:12:09,332 --> 00:12:11,793
But why are you here anyway?

91
00:12:13,795 --> 00:12:15,212
You and Elyse
broke up, didn’t you?

92
00:12:15,213 --> 00:12:16,548
You’re funny.

93
00:12:17,174 --> 00:12:18,175
No!

94
00:12:20,761 --> 00:12:22,321
She just said she
wants to take a break.

95
00:12:22,387 --> 00:12:23,387
A break?

96
00:12:23,513 --> 00:12:25,181
So you guys did break up

97
00:12:25,182 --> 00:12:27,141
- Hey!
- Oh, sorry.

98
00:12:27,142 --> 00:12:28,518
It might actually come true.

99
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:30,937
I’m sorry.

100
00:12:31,354 --> 00:12:34,357
What should I do?

101
00:12:37,068 --> 00:12:38,569
Well,

102
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,780
just let her take a break.

103
00:12:40,447 --> 00:12:41,823
That’s normal.

104
00:12:43,074 --> 00:12:46,243
It’s better than being together
but always fighting

105
00:12:46,244 --> 00:12:47,579
or not talking at all.

106
00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:50,957
It would help if you both
take a break for a while.

107
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:55,754
It’s only been a few days
since we last talked,

108
00:12:56,463 --> 00:12:59,341
but I can really feel the
emptiness when she’s not around.

109
00:13:01,802 --> 00:13:03,929
You really love her, don’t you?

110
00:13:09,518 --> 00:13:10,685
If you love someone,

111
00:13:11,478 --> 00:13:13,396
never ever let them go.

112
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,110
Coming from experience, huh?

113
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,821
Jerk!

114
00:13:23,573 --> 00:13:25,075
But you have a point.

115
00:13:26,243 --> 00:13:28,537
Don’t make the same
mistake I did, okay?

116
00:13:29,663 --> 00:13:32,082
Don’t let the person
you love slip away.

117
00:13:42,551 --> 00:13:43,802
I wish

118
00:13:44,553 --> 00:13:46,929
I could go back to the past

119
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,223
and fix everything.

120
00:13:48,765 --> 00:13:50,266
I wish

121
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:52,727
I had given her more time.

122
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:56,857
But you can’t go back anymore.

123
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:01,068
All you can do now
is be a better partner.

124
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:03,321
From now until forever.

125
00:14:05,448 --> 00:14:06,992
I miss her so much.

126
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,327
Then show her how much you love

127
00:14:10,328 --> 00:14:12,121
and miss her.

128
00:14:12,122 --> 00:14:13,455
Keep her updated.

129
00:14:13,456 --> 00:14:15,249
It's okay even if
you’re not talking.

130
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,711
I’m sure she’ll appreciate it.

131
00:14:18,753 --> 00:14:20,755
- You think so?
- Go!

132
00:14:22,048 --> 00:14:23,675
You've got nothing to lose.

133
00:14:24,342 --> 00:14:26,636
Quick, let’s show her
what we’re doing.

134
00:14:27,804 --> 00:14:29,514
Show this. Hurry up!

135
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:36,897
There you go!

136
00:14:42,193 --> 00:14:44,904
Babe, I’m with Yanna.

137
00:14:44,905 --> 00:14:47,323
She’s teasing me.

138
00:14:47,324 --> 00:14:48,782
So annoying.

139
00:14:48,783 --> 00:14:50,993
They think we broke up,

140
00:14:50,994 --> 00:14:53,245
but that’s not going to happen.

141
00:14:53,246 --> 00:14:56,165
Next time, I’ll bring you here.

142
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,667
I know you love kids.

143
00:14:58,668 --> 00:15:02,088
I’m sure Avi will
be happy to meet you.

144
00:15:08,261 --> 00:15:09,262
Thanks a lot.

145
00:15:09,554 --> 00:15:10,889
You got this.

146
00:15:37,123 --> 00:15:39,167
What am I going to do with this?

147
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:41,794
So that I’ve got a
reason to see you again.

148
00:15:41,795 --> 00:15:43,588
Good night, crush.

149
00:16:01,147 --> 00:16:03,941
I wish I had left a
handkerchief with you

150
00:16:03,942 --> 00:16:07,946
so you could return it to me,
and we could meet again.

151
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:12,242
I can't wait for
that day to come.

152
00:16:28,466 --> 00:16:29,466
Engineer!

153
00:16:29,843 --> 00:16:32,095
Let’s eat. There's a newly
opened restaurant.

154
00:16:33,013 --> 00:16:35,139
- I’ll pass for now.
- Are you sure?

155
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,359
Their food looks delicious.

156
00:16:36,516 --> 00:16:38,560
We should try something new.

157
00:16:41,146 --> 00:16:43,356
I prefer my packed lunch.

158
00:16:44,232 --> 00:16:46,026
Aren't you getting
tired of that?

159
00:16:47,068 --> 00:16:48,068
No.

160
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,031
But you guys go ahead.

161
00:16:52,157 --> 00:16:53,908
Okay, bye.

162
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,668
Hi, babe.

163
00:17:04,794 --> 00:17:06,463
It’s our monthsary today.

164
00:17:06,796 --> 00:17:09,674
Even though we’re
not together right now,

165
00:17:09,966 --> 00:17:13,219
I still want to celebrate
this special day.

166
00:17:15,764 --> 00:17:16,973
Look!

167
00:17:17,974 --> 00:17:21,019
I prepared your favorites.

168
00:17:23,229 --> 00:17:24,564
Just in case

169
00:17:25,273 --> 00:17:26,608
you suddenly come home.

170
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:30,153
It's better to be ready.

171
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,204
I miss you so much, babe.

172
00:17:40,705 --> 00:17:41,873
I hope

173
00:17:43,124 --> 00:17:44,459
you're doing okay there.

174
00:17:46,753 --> 00:17:49,672
I hope you’ve had
some time to rest.

175
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,801
Happy monthsary to us, babe.

176
00:17:54,886 --> 00:17:58,389
I love you so, so, so much.

177
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:02,936
Don’t worry.

178
00:18:03,436 --> 00:18:04,896
I’m okay here.

179
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,671
I really miss you, Elyse.

180
00:18:32,006 --> 00:18:33,842
I hope you come home soon.

181
00:18:35,885 --> 00:18:37,595
I miss you so much.

182
00:19:15,842 --> 00:19:17,302
She’ll reply soon.

183
00:19:20,847 --> 00:19:22,014
You think so?

184
00:19:22,015 --> 00:19:23,391
Of course.

185
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:26,394
We believe that Elyse loves you.

186
00:19:26,686 --> 00:19:29,605
She just really needs
some time to rest.

187
00:19:29,606 --> 00:19:31,900
For now, just enjoy
the party, Sev.

188
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:35,319
Not to forget her,
but just to enjoy a little.

189
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,528
Exactly!

190
00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:40,617
And because of that, it looks
like the next round is on Sevi?

191
00:19:41,117 --> 00:19:42,493
Yes!

192
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,580
It’s almost empty.

193
00:19:46,581 --> 00:19:48,541
Can I do it next time instead?

194
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:51,002
Budget’s a bit tight.

195
00:19:53,213 --> 00:19:55,631
Don’t worry.
It’s my treat tonight.

196
00:19:55,632 --> 00:19:56,925
Order what you want.

197
00:19:57,342 --> 00:19:59,593
- Let’s party! Cheers!
- Awesome. Let’s finish this.

198
00:19:59,594 --> 00:20:01,845
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

199
00:20:01,846 --> 00:20:03,348
Go, Sev!

200
00:20:08,311 --> 00:20:09,604
This isn't enough.

201
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:12,105
Come on! Let’s get some more.

202
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:13,315
We’ll just grab more drinks.

203
00:20:13,316 --> 00:20:14,900
- Sure.
- How about you guys?

204
00:20:14,901 --> 00:20:15,901
We’ll see you there.

205
00:20:19,739 --> 00:20:21,616
Thanks for covering for me, Sam.

206
00:20:22,116 --> 00:20:24,327
Don’t worry about it. I got you.

207
00:20:27,497 --> 00:20:30,333
If you need anything,
you can tell me, Sev.

208
00:20:33,461 --> 00:20:34,836
It’s okay, really.

209
00:20:34,837 --> 00:20:36,047
I want to help.

210
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,678
I’m having financial problems.

211
00:20:42,303 --> 00:20:44,764
There have been
extra expenses at home.

212
00:20:47,642 --> 00:20:49,978
I’m sorry you’re
going through this.

213
00:20:50,353 --> 00:20:51,813
But I can lend you money.

214
00:20:52,981 --> 00:20:55,023
- Really?
- Of course.

215
00:20:55,024 --> 00:20:57,401
You can pay me
in the future. No rush.

216
00:20:57,402 --> 00:21:00,196
Take your time.
Prioritize your family.

217
00:21:02,991 --> 00:21:04,325
Thanks, Sam.

218
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:06,536
I’ll pay you back, I promise.

219
00:21:07,412 --> 00:21:09,496
It’s nothing compared
to all the times

220
00:21:09,497 --> 00:21:11,332
your mom fed us before.

221
00:21:11,624 --> 00:21:12,624
Jeez.

222
00:21:15,044 --> 00:21:16,086
I’ll just follow them.

223
00:21:16,087 --> 00:21:17,087
Okay.

224
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,183
Sam is having a party here.

225
00:21:30,184 --> 00:21:32,102
If you want to come,

226
00:21:32,103 --> 00:21:33,521
here’s the location.

227
00:21:35,273 --> 00:21:37,275
I miss you.

228
00:22:58,481 --> 00:23:00,149
OMG! Ely?

229
00:23:00,525 --> 00:23:01,733
- Huh?
- Sam!

230
00:23:01,734 --> 00:23:03,277
- Hi!
- Hi!

231
00:23:04,946 --> 00:23:07,365
Oh no, I’m so sorry.
Are you okay?

232
00:23:08,074 --> 00:23:09,075
What?

233
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,701
Wait…

234
00:23:11,285 --> 00:23:13,704
I thought you guys
had broken up?

235
00:23:14,205 --> 00:23:17,040
No, we just had a fight.

236
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,168
Really? That’s good to know.

237
00:23:20,753 --> 00:23:23,046
Have you seen Sevi by the way?

238
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:24,799
Yeah, he’s with Arkin.

239
00:23:25,508 --> 00:23:26,717
He’s right there.

240
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,261
But you know what, Bro?

241
00:23:29,262 --> 00:23:30,596
Want me to come with you?

242
00:23:31,556 --> 00:23:33,474
No, it’s okay. I got it.

243
00:23:34,142 --> 00:23:35,476
Okay, sure.

244
00:23:35,768 --> 00:23:37,310
I’ll just go to the bathroom.

245
00:23:37,311 --> 00:23:38,979
- Okay.
- It’s so nice to see you here.

246
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,148
Nice seeing you.

247
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,901
- No, bro—
- That’s what I’m talking about.

248
00:23:48,823 --> 00:23:49,824
Ely?

249
00:23:50,867 --> 00:23:51,867
Ely!

250
00:23:51,868 --> 00:23:53,035
Ericka…

251
00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:56,080
- Hi!
- Hi!

252
00:23:57,331 --> 00:23:58,415
She’s here.

253
00:23:58,416 --> 00:23:59,792
- Hello.
- Hi.

254
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,212
I didn’t know
you guys were here.

255
00:24:03,588 --> 00:24:05,590
- Of course.
- Why are you here?

256
00:24:06,007 --> 00:24:08,009
I’m here to see my boyfriend.

257
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:10,385
What? Your boyfriend’s here?

258
00:24:10,386 --> 00:24:13,264
Yes, I only came
here to see him.

259
00:24:13,806 --> 00:24:15,600
Who’s your boyfriend?

260
00:24:17,351 --> 00:24:18,352
He’s right there.

261
00:24:18,811 --> 00:24:20,395
Where? There are a lot of guys.

262
00:24:20,396 --> 00:24:22,190
They’re right. So...

263
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,191
That guy?

264
00:24:24,192 --> 00:24:27,194
Yes, the one with
the checkered long sleeves.

265
00:24:27,195 --> 00:24:31,157
So, the engineer
is her boyfriend.

266
00:24:33,326 --> 00:24:35,952
What? Do you guys
know something?

267
00:24:35,953 --> 00:24:37,037
Yes!

268
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:38,581
Especially Hiro.

269
00:24:38,873 --> 00:24:40,416
Wait, where is he?

270
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:42,376
Wait...

271
00:24:42,877 --> 00:24:44,637
Is he the one you
were talking about, Ericka?

272
00:24:46,672 --> 00:24:48,798
What the fuck,
you were talking about Sevi?

273
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,887
The one Hiro's jealous
of is Elyse’s boyfriend?

274
00:24:54,013 --> 00:24:54,347
Huh?

275
00:24:54,348 --> 00:24:56,557
We thought he
was Yanna’s husband.

276
00:24:57,183 --> 00:24:59,476
But then she said that
she didn’t have a husband.

277
00:24:59,477 --> 00:25:01,854
Turns out,
he’s your boyfriend, Ely.

278
00:25:03,272 --> 00:25:04,649
What is happening?

279
00:25:06,984 --> 00:25:08,610
Well, whatever.

280
00:25:08,611 --> 00:25:11,364
Excuse me,
I’ll go see my boyfriend.

281
00:25:11,781 --> 00:25:13,115
Okay, bye.

282
00:25:15,034 --> 00:25:17,453
- Come on…
- Let’s continue drinking.

283
00:25:17,995 --> 00:25:19,330
What are you talking about, bro?

284
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,207
You’re not helping.

285
00:25:21,624 --> 00:25:27,088
I think you should try...

286
00:25:31,592 --> 00:25:32,969
Hey! I have a girlfriend...

287
00:25:34,428 --> 00:25:35,429
Elyse.

288
00:25:39,225 --> 00:25:41,352
Wait, I’ll go first because...

289
00:25:41,686 --> 00:25:42,687
Bye-bye.

290
00:25:45,189 --> 00:25:46,189
Hi!

291
00:25:47,567 --> 00:25:48,901
You’re taken?

292
00:25:49,193 --> 00:25:51,528
Too bad ‘cause
I was going to ask you

293
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:53,239
to come home to my condo.

294
00:25:54,407 --> 00:25:55,575
I’m actually single.

295
00:25:56,075 --> 00:25:57,075
Let’s go?

296
00:25:57,493 --> 00:25:59,078
So you’re single.

297
00:25:59,412 --> 00:26:01,581
So we broke up? Did we?

298
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,291
I’m taken.

299
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:05,209
You just heard it wrong.

300
00:26:07,587 --> 00:26:08,921
I missed you.

301
00:26:12,466 --> 00:26:14,302
I missed you so much, Ely.

302
00:26:15,761 --> 00:26:17,722
I’m so sorry.

303
00:26:19,682 --> 00:26:21,058
I’m sorry too.

304
00:26:22,643 --> 00:26:25,730
And thank you for
letting me take a break.

305
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,525
You needed it.

306
00:26:31,277 --> 00:26:32,945
Only one thing is important,

307
00:26:33,613 --> 00:26:35,239
we won’t break up.

308
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,284
I won’t leave you again, Sev.

309
00:26:41,203 --> 00:26:42,538
Let’s go home?

310
00:26:43,748 --> 00:26:45,124
Come home to me?

311
00:26:53,215 --> 00:26:54,425
I miss this.

312
00:26:58,012 --> 00:26:59,597
I missed you so much.

313
00:27:11,108 --> 00:27:14,153
It’s so good to be back home.

314
00:27:14,737 --> 00:27:15,945
You missed it?

315
00:27:15,946 --> 00:27:17,114
Of course.

316
00:27:17,448 --> 00:27:19,408
This is my happy place.

317
00:27:20,618 --> 00:27:22,535
What did you do
while I was gone?

318
00:27:22,536 --> 00:27:24,163
Did you take a break too?

319
00:27:25,122 --> 00:27:27,124
I let go of a project.

320
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:28,958
You’re right, babe.

321
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:30,419
I needed to breathe.

322
00:27:31,379 --> 00:27:34,507
But Luna and I are working
on something now.

323
00:27:35,466 --> 00:27:37,009
That’s good.

324
00:27:42,223 --> 00:27:44,891
Sevi, the electric bill
has arrived.

325
00:27:44,892 --> 00:27:45,892
Why?

326
00:27:49,772 --> 00:27:51,481
Mama texted.

327
00:27:51,482 --> 00:27:53,275
She said there’s something
needed at home.

328
00:27:56,487 --> 00:27:57,488
Come here.

329
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,989
But…

330
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:02,534
Mama is trying to call Papa

331
00:28:02,535 --> 00:28:04,286
to ask for financial assistance.

332
00:28:06,414 --> 00:28:07,873
She doesn’t want to,

333
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:09,834
but it’s necessary.

334
00:28:11,711 --> 00:28:13,044
You know,

335
00:28:13,045 --> 00:28:17,298
your dad should be the one
taking on these responsibilities

336
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:18,759
Not you.

337
00:28:20,845 --> 00:28:21,846
Exactly.

338
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:25,515
So, I hope he can help out,

339
00:28:25,516 --> 00:28:27,351
even just a little.

340
00:28:27,893 --> 00:28:28,602
Yes.

341
00:28:28,603 --> 00:28:30,103
But if not,

342
00:28:30,104 --> 00:28:32,690
I’ll find a way to earn money.

343
00:28:33,232 --> 00:28:36,277
Even if it’s hard,
I’ll figure it out

344
00:28:36,694 --> 00:28:39,279
so I don’t have to
work every Sunday.

345
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,199
So we can have
time for each other.

346
00:28:44,452 --> 00:28:45,994
It’s tough,

347
00:28:45,995 --> 00:28:48,497
but it’s easier
when I’m with you.

348
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:52,626
And

349
00:28:53,043 --> 00:28:55,295
for the things
you paid for, babe,

350
00:28:55,296 --> 00:28:57,465
don’t worry,
I’ll pay you back too.

351
00:28:58,841 --> 00:29:00,468
There’s no need, Sevi.

352
00:29:01,302 --> 00:29:05,096
You know, I really
appreciate you letting go

353
00:29:05,097 --> 00:29:08,142
of a project just to spend
more time together.

354
00:29:08,893 --> 00:29:10,936
But what about your family?

355
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,525
Sam lent me some
money so I could breathe

356
00:29:17,526 --> 00:29:19,653
for a bit while
I look for ways to earn.

357
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:23,281
But only Sam knows.

358
00:29:23,282 --> 00:29:25,075
The rest of the group doesn’t.

359
00:29:25,576 --> 00:29:27,660
They might start
chipping in if they knew.

360
00:29:27,661 --> 00:29:30,706
This isn’t a drinking session
where everyone has to pitch in.

361
00:29:38,923 --> 00:29:40,424
What’s on your mind?

362
00:29:42,635 --> 00:29:43,716
I think

363
00:29:44,553 --> 00:29:48,224
I should just let down
my pride and just

364
00:29:48,891 --> 00:29:50,476
ask my parents for help.

365
00:29:51,435 --> 00:29:52,770
Don’t you think?

366
00:29:56,732 --> 00:29:57,733
Up to you…

367
00:29:58,734 --> 00:30:00,294
Take your time and
think about it, babe.

368
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:04,240
Yes, okay.

369
00:30:04,865 --> 00:30:06,242
I’ll think about it.

370
00:30:07,785 --> 00:30:08,953
But right now,

371
00:30:09,703 --> 00:30:12,832
I’m just happy we’re together
again here at the condo.

372
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:17,586
- I missed you.
- I missed you, babe.

373
00:30:23,425 --> 00:30:25,218
I missed you, babe.

374
00:30:25,219 --> 00:30:27,555
- I missed you.
- I missed you so much.

375
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:34,102
The grand opening for
our new hotel is all set.

376
00:30:34,127 --> 00:30:37,689
Celebrities, VIPs, and
the press will all be there.

377
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:41,902
So, we are expecting the next
six months to be fully booked.

378
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:43,570
Good!

379
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:45,321
Good!

380
00:30:47,992 --> 00:30:49,492
Good job, Elyse.

381
00:30:49,493 --> 00:30:52,830
I never doubted that you can
handle this project excellently.

382
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:56,165
Just make sure that
everything runs smoothly.

383
00:30:56,166 --> 00:31:00,170
Yes and do you guys
have any more questions?

384
00:31:01,213 --> 00:31:01,964
Questions?

385
00:31:01,965 --> 00:31:03,298
If none, meeting adjourned.

386
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:04,424
- None!
- Great!

387
00:31:04,425 --> 00:31:05,885
We’re all good, thank you.

388
00:31:06,176 --> 00:31:07,927
Thank you. See you guys.

389
00:31:07,928 --> 00:31:09,263
Thank you.

390
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:11,640
Thank you.

391
00:31:15,102 --> 00:31:16,770
Congratulations.

392
00:31:17,187 --> 00:31:18,564
You’re born for this.

393
00:31:18,981 --> 00:31:20,565
I’m so proud of you.

394
00:31:20,566 --> 00:31:21,901
Thank you, Daddy.

395
00:31:23,986 --> 00:31:26,739
I have to go out.
I’ll see you in a while.

396
00:31:33,162 --> 00:31:34,203
Mommy…

397
00:31:34,204 --> 00:31:35,039
Yes?

398
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,832
Can I talk to you for a bit?

399
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:39,126
Yes, sure.

400
00:31:39,543 --> 00:31:40,794
What is it about?

401
00:31:41,587 --> 00:31:42,587
Okay.

402
00:31:43,422 --> 00:31:46,550
Well, I was wondering if
I could ask for some help?

403
00:31:47,384 --> 00:31:49,386
Sure, anything.

404
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:52,139
Okay, well...

405
00:31:52,681 --> 00:31:54,099
It’s about our condo.

406
00:31:54,892 --> 00:31:58,854
As you know, we are
still paying it off and...

407
00:32:00,022 --> 00:32:02,066
but money is tight right now.

408
00:32:02,942 --> 00:32:04,902
Can I ask for some help?

409
00:32:07,321 --> 00:32:09,073
Took you so long, huh?

410
00:32:10,574 --> 00:32:12,785
Don’t worry.
I’ll take care of it.

411
00:32:13,035 --> 00:32:15,913
You don’t have to worry
about anything and...

412
00:32:16,956 --> 00:32:19,248
it’s okay if you
can’t pay me back.

413
00:32:19,249 --> 00:32:21,251
Just do it when you can.

414
00:32:21,627 --> 00:32:24,379
And I'll send some money
to your bank account

415
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,465
for groceries and
bills for the month,

416
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,551
so you and Sevi can have
a bit of a breather, okay?

417
00:32:30,552 --> 00:32:33,638
Thank you.
Just a few months' worth.

418
00:32:33,639 --> 00:32:34,181
Yeah.

419
00:32:34,182 --> 00:32:36,767
And I will get back to you
when things get better.

420
00:32:37,101 --> 00:32:38,977
You’re the best, Mommy.
I love you.

421
00:32:38,978 --> 00:32:40,771
I love you too, honey.

422
00:32:41,897 --> 00:32:46,275
And I promise, I will work
hard for our company.

423
00:32:46,276 --> 00:32:48,278
And for you, Mommy.

424
00:32:50,656 --> 00:32:52,282
Do it for yourself.

425
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,993
Don’t do it for me.

426
00:32:54,535 --> 00:32:57,579
So you won’t lose your
purpose when I’m gone.

427
00:32:58,706 --> 00:33:00,541
Don’t say that.

428
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:04,753
And Mom, Sevi and I are okay.

429
00:33:05,295 --> 00:33:07,714
I followed your advice and

430
00:33:07,715 --> 00:33:10,634
we talked things out
and we are fixing our problems.

431
00:33:11,385 --> 00:33:12,385
Good!

432
00:33:15,431 --> 00:33:16,432
What?

433
00:33:17,141 --> 00:33:18,684
Is that it?

434
00:33:20,644 --> 00:33:22,813
Because I know,

435
00:33:23,313 --> 00:33:26,483
you and Sevi will
always work things out.

436
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,235
I know that
your love for each other

437
00:33:29,236 --> 00:33:32,364
will always be greater
than your misunderstanding.

438
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:35,242
That's why, please,
say hi to Sevi for me

439
00:33:35,576 --> 00:33:38,536
and tell him to visit
so we can see each other.

440
00:33:38,537 --> 00:33:39,537
And...

441
00:33:40,372 --> 00:33:43,291
Better yet, why don’t
you invite him

442
00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:45,210
to the opening of the hotel?

443
00:33:46,712 --> 00:33:48,504
Yes, I will tell him.

444
00:33:48,505 --> 00:33:51,090
I'm sure he'll be excited to go.

445
00:33:51,091 --> 00:33:52,091
There you go.

446
00:33:54,053 --> 00:33:55,053
Love you.

447
00:33:55,054 --> 00:33:56,680
- I love you.
- Good job.

448
00:34:00,017 --> 00:34:01,727
Hello, babe?
Hi!

449
00:34:02,352 --> 00:34:06,481
My mom told me to invite you
to the hotel opening.

450
00:34:06,482 --> 00:34:07,482
Can you go?

451
00:34:07,941 --> 00:34:09,109
When is that?

452
00:34:10,152 --> 00:34:11,153
Next weekend.

453
00:34:11,565 --> 00:34:13,378
Okay, sure. I’ll be there.

454
00:34:13,403 --> 00:34:15,406
By the way, I’m almost there.

455
00:34:15,407 --> 00:34:18,409
I got permission from
my boss to leave early.

456
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:21,120
I’m excited to taste
your delicious cooking.

457
00:34:21,121 --> 00:34:24,227
It’s delicious because
it’s made with love.

458
00:34:24,374 --> 00:34:27,336
Exactly, that’s why
I said I’m excited!

459
00:34:27,753 --> 00:34:29,879
Okay then.
I’ll see you later.

460
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,880
Bye, babe.

461
00:34:32,091 --> 00:34:33,091
Okay…

462
00:34:38,097 --> 00:34:39,097
Huh?

463
00:34:39,098 --> 00:34:40,432
He’s here already?

464
00:34:41,266 --> 00:34:42,935
Why is he ringing the doorbell?

465
00:34:51,193 --> 00:34:52,611
Elyse!

466
00:34:53,153 --> 00:34:54,154
Ida?

467
00:35:00,494 --> 00:35:02,454
Wait! The door!

468
00:35:09,298 --> 00:35:10,884
Hold on, I can't breathe.

469
00:35:12,005 --> 00:35:13,215
Are you okay?

470
00:35:13,715 --> 00:35:15,175
Oh my god.

471
00:35:17,261 --> 00:35:20,430
- I miss you!
- I miss you!

472
00:35:21,265 --> 00:35:22,682
- Bitch!
- What?

473
00:35:22,683 --> 00:35:25,935
Why didn’t you tell me that
you were coming home?

474
00:35:25,936 --> 00:35:27,854
I just came here for business.

475
00:35:27,855 --> 00:35:29,355
I’ll be leaving soon.

476
00:35:29,356 --> 00:35:32,526
But why not surprise you, right?

477
00:35:34,778 --> 00:35:37,822
This place is stunning!

478
00:35:37,823 --> 00:35:40,074
You came just in time
because I cooked.

479
00:35:40,075 --> 00:35:41,326
Come on, you should try it.

480
00:35:43,078 --> 00:35:44,288
You cooked all that?

481
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:48,041
Here…

482
00:35:50,252 --> 00:35:51,837
Am I not going to get poisoned?

483
00:35:53,046 --> 00:35:54,047
Just kidding!

484
00:35:54,381 --> 00:35:55,382
Try it…

485
00:36:00,012 --> 00:36:02,723
Wow, your cooking has improved.

486
00:36:03,515 --> 00:36:05,224
It doesn’t taste like
seawater anymore.

487
00:36:05,225 --> 00:36:08,896
Come on, can we just forget
about the carbonara?

488
00:36:12,441 --> 00:36:14,484
It’s nice seeing you happy.

489
00:36:15,444 --> 00:36:16,861
But are you okay?

490
00:36:16,862 --> 00:36:19,239
You were calling me last
week but I was asleep.

491
00:36:22,242 --> 00:36:25,578
Me and Sevi had a fight
but we’re okay now.

492
00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:27,664
Oh no, is he okay?

493
00:36:28,415 --> 00:36:30,568
You’re more worried about him?

494
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:33,378
You didn’t slap him
or anything, right?

495
00:36:33,795 --> 00:36:34,795
No.

496
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,506
No! No, I didn’t.

497
00:36:37,507 --> 00:36:40,427
But, I did realize something.

498
00:36:42,721 --> 00:36:44,472
That I

499
00:36:44,473 --> 00:36:48,184
really love him and
I don’t want to lose him.

500
00:36:48,185 --> 00:36:50,354
I'm glad you two made up.

501
00:36:50,854 --> 00:36:54,315
Because, I’ll be the first
to break down

502
00:36:54,316 --> 00:36:56,485
if my one true pair broke up.

503
00:36:57,277 --> 00:36:58,487
One true pair?

504
00:36:59,905 --> 00:37:01,573
But I realized that

505
00:37:02,532 --> 00:37:04,909
if you really love someone,

506
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:08,204
you really have to fight
to save the relationship.

507
00:37:08,205 --> 00:37:10,289
It’s cowardly

508
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:13,478
to just walk away without
putting up a fight.

509
00:37:13,669 --> 00:37:15,503
Another thing, girl!

510
00:37:15,504 --> 00:37:18,464
Communication really is the key.

511
00:37:18,465 --> 00:37:21,550
Like, you have
to be really brave enough

512
00:37:21,551 --> 00:37:23,845
to have the hard conversations.

513
00:37:24,972 --> 00:37:26,640
You’ve really matured, huh?

514
00:37:27,057 --> 00:37:28,517
I’m so proud of you.

515
00:37:30,018 --> 00:37:33,187
If I were still childish,

516
00:37:33,188 --> 00:37:35,856
Sevi would have
left me for sure.

517
00:37:35,857 --> 00:37:37,942
It won’t happen.

518
00:37:37,943 --> 00:37:39,527
Because both of you
always choose

519
00:37:39,528 --> 00:37:41,697
to be better for each other.

520
00:37:42,155 --> 00:37:44,407
I hope you won’t break up.

521
00:37:44,408 --> 00:37:46,659
I hope you two are forever.

522
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,203
Because it would be
a waste of all the cheering

523
00:37:49,204 --> 00:37:51,998
I did at his basketball
games back then. I’ll go crazy

524
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:53,375
if both of you break up.

525
00:37:55,752 --> 00:37:57,044
We won’t.

526
00:37:57,045 --> 00:37:59,297
- It smells so nice.
- Right?

527
00:37:59,298 --> 00:38:00,464
- Yes!
- Thank you.

528
00:38:00,465 --> 00:38:02,758
Don’t you smell the
difference in the air?

529
00:38:02,759 --> 00:38:05,094
- Yes, oh my god.
- Right?

530
00:38:05,095 --> 00:38:07,179
Like, apparently,
this place is beautiful.

531
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,180
Hey!

532
00:38:08,265 --> 00:38:09,641
- Ida!
- Sev!

533
00:38:09,891 --> 00:38:11,809
Oh, it’s you.
I didn’t recognize you.

534
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,102
What are you doing here?

535
00:38:13,103 --> 00:38:14,770
Hello, I didn’t
recognize you either.

536
00:38:14,771 --> 00:38:16,690
You’re not wearing a jersey.

537
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:22,154
- Hi, babe.
- Hi, babe.

538
00:38:22,612 --> 00:38:24,156
That was quick!

539
00:38:25,032 --> 00:38:27,033
You came just
in time, let’s eat.

540
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:29,660
Come on, let’s eat.
I’m ready to get poisoned.

541
00:38:29,661 --> 00:38:30,871
I’m so excited.

542
00:38:32,122 --> 00:38:34,790
Ely's cooking
is delicious, right?

543
00:38:34,791 --> 00:38:36,960
That’s her specialty.
It’s my favorite.

544
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:41,673
Maybe you got used to the taste
and just don’t notice it anymore

545
00:38:42,966 --> 00:38:44,216
She’s right, babe.

546
00:38:44,217 --> 00:38:46,845
I still remember the
taste of your carbonara.

547
00:38:47,554 --> 00:38:51,058
I can still taste it on
my tongue until now.

548
00:38:53,226 --> 00:38:55,019
You guys are so dramatic.

549
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,688
Can we just eat?

550
00:38:57,356 --> 00:38:58,356
Hey…

551
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,232
Both of you…

552
00:39:00,233 --> 00:39:02,526
A lot of things
will change in this world.

553
00:39:02,527 --> 00:39:05,364
I just hope your love
for each other doesn’t.

554
00:39:05,906 --> 00:39:06,907
Be strong.

555
00:39:07,282 --> 00:39:09,910
You have a long time
together ahead of you.

556
00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:11,578
So much drama...

557
00:39:12,287 --> 00:39:14,080
Just break up then.

558
00:39:14,081 --> 00:39:16,124
Hey! Knock on wood.

559
00:39:18,752 --> 00:39:20,337
But no joke,

560
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:23,130
I hope that,
every time I visit here,

561
00:39:23,131 --> 00:39:26,218
I see you guys this happy.

562
00:39:27,427 --> 00:39:31,305
And if anyone knows
about your love story

563
00:39:31,306 --> 00:39:32,848
from the very beginning,

564
00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:33,849
it’s me!

565
00:39:34,851 --> 00:39:36,143
- It’s you.
- Yes.

566
00:39:36,144 --> 00:39:37,270
Right.

567
00:39:37,687 --> 00:39:38,938
But, Sev…

568
00:39:38,939 --> 00:39:41,900
promise me you’re going to
take care of my best friend.

569
00:39:46,321 --> 00:39:47,614
I promise, Ida.

570
00:39:49,116 --> 00:39:51,326
I’ll take care of
your best friend.

571
00:39:51,535 --> 00:39:53,954
I will love and care for her

572
00:39:54,329 --> 00:39:55,705
as much as I can.

573
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:02,337
I’ll hold you to that,
Sev, okay?

574
00:40:02,838 --> 00:40:05,172
Just like how the
taste of the carbonara

575
00:40:05,173 --> 00:40:06,550
held onto my tongue back then.

576
00:40:08,301 --> 00:40:13,140
Oh my god, get over it already!
Can we just eat?

577
00:40:16,268 --> 00:40:17,477
My god…

578
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:20,188
It’s really delicious.

579
00:40:22,441 --> 00:40:24,150
Thanks for having me over.

580
00:40:24,151 --> 00:40:26,319
I’ll see you in
the U.S. soon, okay?

581
00:40:26,903 --> 00:40:28,196
- Okay.
- Sev…

582
00:40:31,366 --> 00:40:34,536
- I love you.
- I love you.

583
00:40:37,747 --> 00:40:39,540
Sev, bye.

584
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:41,292
Take care.
Have a safe flight.

585
00:40:41,293 --> 00:40:42,543
Thank you.

586
00:40:42,544 --> 00:40:44,421
- I’ll walk you out.
- Okay.

587
00:40:46,047 --> 00:40:47,799
- Bye-bye, Ida.
- Bye-bye.

588
00:40:57,642 --> 00:40:59,102
What's this?

589
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,607
Can I have this dance, Ely?

590
00:41:23,835 --> 00:41:27,005
Do you remember our first dance?

591
00:41:32,093 --> 00:41:33,260
Of course.

592
00:41:33,261 --> 00:41:35,514
You gatecrashed my
18th birthday party.

593
00:42:08,797 --> 00:42:10,464
You got so mad back then.

594
00:42:10,465 --> 00:42:12,091
You even said...

595
00:42:12,092 --> 00:42:13,843
You’re so full of yourself,
you know that?

596
00:42:14,886 --> 00:42:16,513
I don’t even know you.

597
00:42:33,822 --> 00:42:36,324
But, look at us now.

598
00:42:38,118 --> 00:42:40,829
We’ve come so far
from our first meeting.

599
00:42:42,872 --> 00:42:43,873
And

600
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:47,377
you love me so much now.

601
00:42:48,962 --> 00:42:50,130
Of course.

602
00:42:50,672 --> 00:42:52,048
And you?

603
00:42:52,424 --> 00:42:54,050
Do you love me too?

604
00:43:00,807 --> 00:43:02,601
So much, Elyse.

605
00:43:15,614 --> 00:43:17,657
That’s why
I want to give you this.

606
00:43:18,491 --> 00:43:19,951
A promise ring.

607
00:43:22,996 --> 00:43:25,497
I promise I’ll do everything

608
00:43:25,498 --> 00:43:27,208
to be successful

609
00:43:28,084 --> 00:43:30,836
because I want
to marry you, Elyse.

610
00:43:30,837 --> 00:43:33,340
And to give you
a comfortable life.

611
00:43:35,884 --> 00:43:38,010
I don’t want the day to come

612
00:43:38,011 --> 00:43:40,764
when you’d regret choosing me.

613
00:43:43,767 --> 00:43:45,643
And I also

614
00:43:45,644 --> 00:43:47,729
don’t want us to break up again.

615
00:44:03,328 --> 00:44:06,373
No matter what happens?

616
00:44:07,123 --> 00:44:08,750
No matter what.

617
00:44:09,876 --> 00:44:11,670
No matter who it is.

618
00:44:12,379 --> 00:44:14,172
It won't matter to me.

619
00:44:17,425 --> 00:44:19,135
I love you, Elyse.

620
00:44:21,346 --> 00:44:24,015
I love you at all times.

621
00:44:28,812 --> 00:44:30,313
I love you.

622
00:44:32,357 --> 00:44:33,983
And Sevi,

623
00:44:34,984 --> 00:44:38,655
I will never regret
choosing you.

624
00:44:42,826 --> 00:44:44,535
I chose you

625
00:44:44,536 --> 00:44:46,413
because I love you.

626
00:44:47,205 --> 00:44:49,874
And I love you for who you are.

627
00:44:53,753 --> 00:44:55,754
And loving you

628
00:44:55,755 --> 00:44:58,508
has made my life so beautiful.

629
00:45:01,845 --> 00:45:04,514
I will never let
that happen again.

630
00:45:20,155 --> 00:45:21,489
I love you.

631
00:45:22,282 --> 00:45:23,658
I love you.

632
00:45:52,854 --> 00:45:54,647
Good morning, babe!

633
00:45:58,234 --> 00:46:00,194
I miss you!

634
00:46:00,195 --> 00:46:01,821
I’ve missed this.

635
00:46:02,363 --> 00:46:03,698
Good morning.

636
00:46:08,745 --> 00:46:11,456
Sevi, let’s eat?

637
00:46:15,877 --> 00:46:17,085
It smells good!

638
00:46:17,086 --> 00:46:19,171
Smells as good as my baby.

639
00:46:19,172 --> 00:46:20,172
Wow!

640
00:46:21,508 --> 00:46:24,260
- Thanks for cooking breakfast.
- You’re in good spirits.

641
00:46:24,922 --> 00:46:26,054
I’ve really missed this.

642
00:46:41,069 --> 00:46:43,821
Thank you for
ironing this, babe.

643
00:46:43,822 --> 00:46:45,365
Anything for you.

644
00:46:47,951 --> 00:46:49,077
Wait…

645
00:46:51,037 --> 00:46:52,205
There you go…

646
00:46:52,997 --> 00:46:55,333
Did you…
see your lunch?

647
00:46:56,709 --> 00:46:58,503
Hey, this is heavy!

648
00:46:59,003 --> 00:47:00,921
You must have
packed a lot for me.

649
00:47:00,922 --> 00:47:03,466
- Thanks, babe.
- Anything for you.

650
00:47:04,509 --> 00:47:05,509
Let’s go?

651
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:07,428
Okay, let’s go.

652
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:17,480
Babe!

653
00:47:18,106 --> 00:47:20,482
- Hi!
- I have something for you.

654
00:47:20,483 --> 00:47:21,901
I got my salary today.

655
00:47:23,862 --> 00:47:25,530
I know it’s your favorite.

656
00:47:26,865 --> 00:47:28,074
Thank you!

657
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:30,201
Dinner!

658
00:47:31,077 --> 00:47:33,204
Wait, no dessert?

659
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:34,831
There is.

660
00:47:36,165 --> 00:47:37,165
You already know.

661
00:48:08,907 --> 00:48:11,326
I feel so happy
right now, Mommy.

662
00:48:12,118 --> 00:48:15,371
My relationship with Sevi,

663
00:48:16,581 --> 00:48:18,625
it’s so simple…

664
00:48:20,501 --> 00:48:22,795
but it feels so perfect.

665
00:48:23,922 --> 00:48:26,090
I’m so happy
to hear that, honey.

666
00:48:26,758 --> 00:48:28,453
Continue to love

667
00:48:28,885 --> 00:48:31,763
and care for each other, okay?

668
00:48:34,724 --> 00:48:36,059
Why, Mom?

669
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:47,070
Can you already live
without me, Elyse?

670
00:48:50,406 --> 00:48:52,533
Why are you talking like that?

671
00:48:54,953 --> 00:48:56,412
I’m just saying.

672
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,831
It’s inevitable.

673
00:49:00,208 --> 00:49:03,336
But not anytime soon, right?

674
00:49:04,212 --> 00:49:07,465
The doctor said that
you’re feeling better now.

675
00:49:10,385 --> 00:49:13,846
You’re still a big baby, Elyse.

676
00:49:15,306 --> 00:49:19,101
You know, I remember when
you were a little baby,

677
00:49:19,102 --> 00:49:23,690
you were such a crybaby
and you cried all the time.

678
00:49:26,401 --> 00:49:28,026
There was this one time,

679
00:49:28,027 --> 00:49:29,027
There was this one time,

680
00:49:29,112 --> 00:49:31,864
you kept on shouting,
“Mommy, Mommy!”

681
00:49:32,073 --> 00:49:33,366
So loud!

682
00:49:34,158 --> 00:49:37,704
I was running down the
stairs and I almost fell.

683
00:49:38,454 --> 00:49:40,164
Only to see you

684
00:49:41,165 --> 00:49:45,378
that you were crying because there
was a butterfly on your shoulder.

685
00:49:50,008 --> 00:49:53,177
But you grew up
to be a strong lady now.

686
00:49:54,554 --> 00:49:57,598
And not that crybaby anymore.

687
00:49:59,809 --> 00:50:02,020
I just cried last week.

688
00:50:06,649 --> 00:50:08,026
But, Mom,

689
00:50:08,651 --> 00:50:10,861
I’m still a crybaby.

690
00:50:10,862 --> 00:50:13,489
So you can’t leave
this crybaby behind.

691
00:50:15,174 --> 00:50:17,201
Then it’s okay to cry.

692
00:50:18,339 --> 00:50:19,954
You’ll get over it.

693
00:50:22,498 --> 00:50:24,375
Remember the time...

694
00:50:25,543 --> 00:50:28,378
Remember when
you fell on the ground

695
00:50:28,379 --> 00:50:30,673
and I was nowhere to be found?

696
00:50:33,301 --> 00:50:36,345
And you tried to cure
your wound on your own?

697
00:50:42,185 --> 00:50:44,520
It’s just like this.

698
00:50:45,063 --> 00:50:46,355
Stop.

699
00:50:48,066 --> 00:50:51,402
Mom, I don’t want to hear that.

700
00:50:51,986 --> 00:50:53,488
We will be together

701
00:50:54,113 --> 00:50:56,032
for a very long time.

702
00:51:03,081 --> 00:51:04,082
What?

703
00:51:07,794 --> 00:51:11,631
It’s better to be prepared for
what might happen, honey.

704
00:51:34,904 --> 00:51:38,407
How was your bonding
time with your mom?

705
00:51:40,493 --> 00:51:41,786
It was okay.

706
00:51:41,994 --> 00:51:43,996
We had a good conversation.

707
00:51:44,914 --> 00:51:45,915
But...

708
00:51:46,999 --> 00:51:50,086
I think she’s
getting sick again.

709
00:51:52,713 --> 00:51:53,714
Really?

710
00:51:54,632 --> 00:51:56,133
What makes you say so?

711
00:51:56,134 --> 00:51:58,093
She looked so frail earlier

712
00:51:58,094 --> 00:52:00,388
and she was being
weirdly sentimental.

713
00:52:01,264 --> 00:52:02,556
But

714
00:52:02,557 --> 00:52:07,019
she’s going to the hotel’s
grand opening tomorrow so…

715
00:52:08,104 --> 00:52:10,565
Maybe I’m just overthinking.

716
00:52:13,234 --> 00:52:15,736
You probably need
to talk to your dad.

717
00:52:16,487 --> 00:52:19,991
Or, you all should have
a family discussion.

718
00:52:20,783 --> 00:52:24,203
Right. Yes, okay.
I’ll do that.

719
00:52:27,999 --> 00:52:30,126
Are you going with me tomorrow?

720
00:52:32,879 --> 00:52:34,213
I’ll just answer this.

721
00:52:34,338 --> 00:52:35,338
Work?

722
00:52:36,465 --> 00:52:38,092
It’s Steven.

723
00:52:39,802 --> 00:52:40,803
Okay.

724
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,600
What?

725
00:52:47,852 --> 00:52:50,563
Speak properly,
I can’t understand you.

726
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:53,941
Blood?

727
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:55,985
What blood?

728
00:52:57,236 --> 00:52:59,697
Damn it, Steven, speak properly!

729
00:53:00,781 --> 00:53:01,782
What?

730
00:53:02,408 --> 00:53:04,075
Okay, I’m on my way there.

731
00:53:04,076 --> 00:53:05,785
Ask for help, okay?

732
00:53:05,786 --> 00:53:07,371
Don’t leave Sofia.

733
00:53:09,373 --> 00:53:10,582
Babe, something
happened at home.

734
00:53:10,583 --> 00:53:12,167
I need to go see Mama.

735
00:53:12,168 --> 00:53:14,169
Okay—
Do you want me to go with you?

736
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:15,170
No need.

737
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,048
I’ll keep you updated.
Just get some rest, okay?

738
00:53:18,049 --> 00:53:20,384
Okay, please update me.
Be careful.

739
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:47,869
Good afternoon, Auntie.

740
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:49,247
Hi, Sevi.

741
00:53:49,622 --> 00:53:52,707
You just missed Elyse.

742
00:53:52,708 --> 00:53:54,418
She went out to go shopping.

743
00:53:55,127 --> 00:53:59,006
Yes, Auntie. I saw her
car leave just now.

744
00:54:00,132 --> 00:54:02,218
I actually came here to see you.

745
00:54:02,927 --> 00:54:06,388
Elyse and I are
on a break right now.

746
00:54:06,389 --> 00:54:08,474
So I can't tell her.

747
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,353
Is that so?

748
00:54:13,604 --> 00:54:15,106
Have a seat.

749
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:18,901
Thank you.

750
00:54:21,237 --> 00:54:23,239
What do you want
to talk to me about?

751
00:54:26,158 --> 00:54:29,328
I just want to personally
apologize to you.

752
00:54:30,204 --> 00:54:34,375
I know I promised that
I would take care of Elyse.

753
00:54:35,042 --> 00:54:36,043
But...

754
00:54:37,378 --> 00:54:40,213
The past few weeks,

755
00:54:40,214 --> 00:54:41,924
I haven't been
able to fulfill that.

756
00:54:43,884 --> 00:54:47,847
I've been going through
a lot with my family.

757
00:54:48,472 --> 00:54:50,099
But I know

758
00:54:50,474 --> 00:54:53,436
that's not an excuse
for neglecting her.

759
00:54:54,687 --> 00:54:56,689
So I'm sorry, Auntie.

760
00:54:58,482 --> 00:54:59,775
Thank you for

761
00:55:00,318 --> 00:55:02,320
telling me personally.

762
00:55:03,362 --> 00:55:06,032
I understand what
you’re going through, Sevi.

763
00:55:07,283 --> 00:55:09,201
It’s not easy.

764
00:55:10,077 --> 00:55:13,621
You’re starting
to build your careers,

765
00:55:13,622 --> 00:55:15,750
your lives together…

766
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:19,837
And there will
always be challenges.

767
00:55:20,755 --> 00:55:22,798
But one thing I ask…

768
00:55:23,883 --> 00:55:26,634
Sevi, please don’t give up
on each other.

769
00:55:26,635 --> 00:55:27,635
Okay?

770
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,686
How is Ely doing?

771
00:55:36,645 --> 00:55:38,647
I really miss her.

772
00:55:40,399 --> 00:55:43,235
I shouldn’t be the
one telling you this, Sevi.

773
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:47,281
She’s also very, very sad without you.

774
00:55:48,908 --> 00:55:51,577
And she misses you so much.

775
00:55:58,793 --> 00:56:00,169
Sevi…

776
00:56:00,711 --> 00:56:02,671
I know she loves you deeply.

777
00:56:03,798 --> 00:56:06,509
She will eventually
come home to you.

778
00:56:07,635 --> 00:56:09,553
Don’t worry about that.

779
00:56:11,889 --> 00:56:13,474
Thank you, Auntie.

780
00:56:15,059 --> 00:56:16,726
I promise,

781
00:56:16,727 --> 00:56:19,397
I won’t let this
break up happen again.

782
00:56:22,024 --> 00:56:24,026
Thank you, Sevi.

783
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:27,822
You know, I’m at
peace knowing that

784
00:56:28,823 --> 00:56:30,491
Elyse has you.

785
00:57:13,534 --> 00:57:15,202
Don't leave, please.

786
00:57:15,654 --> 00:57:17,412
Let's talk about this.

787
00:57:17,413 --> 00:57:19,622
But I will start a new life!

788
00:57:19,623 --> 00:57:21,166
Without me?

789
00:57:21,167 --> 00:57:22,877
I'm not part of your
plans anymore?

790
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:27,088
I’m actually thinking of
moving to the U.S. for a while.

791
00:57:27,089 --> 00:57:30,675
Can we drop by unit 1432
before we leave?

792
00:57:30,676 --> 00:57:31,676
Of course.

793
00:57:31,886 --> 00:57:34,137
What are you doing here?
What’s that for?

794
00:57:34,138 --> 00:57:37,349
- It’s just—
- Fifth anniversary.
