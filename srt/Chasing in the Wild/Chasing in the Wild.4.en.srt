1
00:00:10,326 --> 00:00:11,535
Order’s complete.

2
00:00:11,615 --> 00:00:13,491
Doesn’t this taste like grass?

3
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:14,784
If you want to order
something else,

4
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:15,785
we can just do that.

5
00:00:15,786 --> 00:00:17,537
No, it’s okay.
Delicious.

6
00:00:17,771 --> 00:00:19,789
I thought
you didn’t like matcha?

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,166
When I tasted it,
it was actually good.

8
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:21,917
You got yourself a girlfriend?

9
00:00:21,918 --> 00:00:23,293
- No.
- You’re seeing someone?

10
00:00:23,294 --> 00:00:24,294
No.

11
00:00:24,831 --> 00:00:26,154
Where’s your ID, Camero?

12
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:29,466
Damn it, I need to get
my ID from Elyse.

13
00:00:29,467 --> 00:00:30,467
Elyse?

14
00:00:31,385 --> 00:00:33,595
Are you intentionally
leaving stuff with me?

15
00:00:33,596 --> 00:00:36,014
I’ll start thinking that this
is just your excuse to see me.

16
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:37,348
But you still come to see me.

17
00:00:37,349 --> 00:00:39,642
You might not be able to enter
your school tomorrow.

18
00:00:39,643 --> 00:00:40,769
So, you’re concerned?

19
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,145
- Have you eaten?
- Not yet.

20
00:00:42,146 --> 00:00:43,022
Come on then, I’ll treat you.

21
00:00:43,023 --> 00:00:44,522
I love you, Camero.

22
00:00:44,523 --> 00:00:45,399
It’s right there.

23
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,317
I thought you were
confessing to me.

24
00:00:47,318 --> 00:00:49,277
- As if!
- I still don’t have a girlfriend.

25
00:00:49,278 --> 00:00:51,488
You probably want
an engineering girlfriend.

26
00:00:51,515 --> 00:00:52,849
I can go for a cheerleader.

27
00:00:53,407 --> 00:00:54,783
Girl! One of our classmates

28
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,284
saw you and Sevi together
at the mall!

29
00:00:56,285 --> 00:00:58,495
And everyone thinks
you’re dating already!

30
00:00:58,496 --> 00:00:59,704
What if my Dad finds out?

31
00:00:59,705 --> 00:01:01,706
He will definitely ground me.

32
00:01:01,707 --> 00:01:02,625
Are you mad at me?

33
00:01:02,626 --> 00:01:04,459
I told you, I’m not mad at you.

34
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,419
I think I need to apologize.

35
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,297
Hey, Sevi.
Breakfast?

36
00:01:08,839 --> 00:01:09,839
No, thanks.

37
00:02:18,063 --> 00:02:19,481
Hey, Sevi.

38
00:02:24,664 --> 00:02:25,707
Breakfast?

39
00:02:27,668 --> 00:02:28,668
No, thanks.

40
00:02:44,226 --> 00:02:48,314
Did he just reject me?
In front of everyone?

41
00:02:54,278 --> 00:02:55,529
What did you say?

42
00:02:56,697 --> 00:02:58,032
You don’t want to?

43
00:02:58,908 --> 00:03:00,159
Yes, I don’t.

44
00:03:08,403 --> 00:03:09,779
What the hell?

45
00:03:10,377 --> 00:03:11,837
Is he for real?

46
00:03:14,632 --> 00:03:16,341
I can’t believe it.

47
00:03:16,342 --> 00:03:18,052
He rejected me.

48
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:21,304
It was my first time asking
a guy to eat with me.

49
00:03:21,305 --> 00:03:24,307
And he's just going
to reject me like that?

50
00:03:24,308 --> 00:03:28,561
My gosh, he has no idea
how much he's missing out.

51
00:03:28,562 --> 00:03:31,523
It’s his loss, not mine.

52
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:34,694
I’m sure he’s just
playing hard to get.

53
00:03:35,236 --> 00:03:37,111
I’ll try for the second time and

54
00:03:37,112 --> 00:03:40,241
if it’s still a no,
then so be it!

55
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:46,871
He rejected my offer?

56
00:03:46,872 --> 00:03:49,082
We can’t do anything

57
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,793
if he really doesn’t want to.

58
00:03:50,918 --> 00:03:53,379
I feel like he’s just
playing hard to get.

59
00:03:55,256 --> 00:03:58,133
So, you want him to go with you?

60
00:03:58,801 --> 00:04:01,971
It’s not that
I want to go out with him…

61
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:03,221
It’s just...

62
00:04:03,681 --> 00:04:06,517
Why did he reject my kind offer?

63
00:04:07,977 --> 00:04:09,270
So, you do want to?

64
00:04:12,773 --> 00:04:13,774
Why?

65
00:04:14,483 --> 00:04:15,901
Do you have a plan?

66
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,494
He’s coming.
Just go along, okay?

67
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:32,191
Hey! Where are you going, bro?
Got plans?

68
00:04:32,216 --> 00:04:35,052
I’ll just go out
and eat with Elyse.

69
00:04:39,049 --> 00:04:43,636
- Now you see what you've lost.
- I feel like eating beef today with runny eggs

70
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:46,789
and the best fried rice.

71
00:04:51,645 --> 00:04:52,848
What the hell?

72
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,632
Now he really
doesn’t want to go.

73
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:57,360
Just wait. I know
how he thinks, just watch.

74
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:01,864
And doesn't hot chocolate
sound great?

75
00:05:03,324 --> 00:05:04,950
Didn’t you ask me
to go with you?

76
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:08,120
- But you said no.
- Now you invited someone else?

77
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:10,872
Well, just because you don’t
want to eat with me,

78
00:05:10,873 --> 00:05:12,874
doesn’t mean that I can’t eat.

79
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:14,442
That’s not my point!

80
00:05:15,911 --> 00:05:17,270
Let’s go, Ely.

81
00:05:20,674 --> 00:05:21,925
I’m coming, too.

82
00:05:22,843 --> 00:05:24,677
What’s that, bro? Huh?

83
00:05:24,678 --> 00:05:26,304
I said, I’m coming, too.

84
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:28,556
But you still need
to fix your stuff.

85
00:05:28,557 --> 00:05:30,601
- You’ll take too long.
- Then wait for me.

86
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:32,310
Nevermind,
I’ll just go with Ely.

87
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:35,313
Besides I don’t have any shoot
today so we can watch a movie.

88
00:05:35,314 --> 00:05:35,939
Have you seen the...

89
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,483
Why? Don’t you want me
to come along?

90
00:05:39,485 --> 00:05:42,070
Chill, bro. It’s just a prank.

91
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:43,696
We're just messing around, man.

92
00:05:43,697 --> 00:05:45,908
You look like
you’re about to beat me up.

93
00:05:47,117 --> 00:05:48,952
All right then.
I have a shoot to go to.

94
00:05:49,453 --> 00:05:52,247
You guys go eat already.
Stop acting like kids.

95
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:57,960
How about lunch? It’s already late.

96
00:05:57,961 --> 00:06:00,172
Well? Are you coming or not?

97
00:06:01,382 --> 00:06:02,382
I’m coming.

98
00:06:02,383 --> 00:06:04,510
I’ll just take a shower.

99
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,776
Thank you.

100
00:06:24,905 --> 00:06:27,157
You’ve been quiet since earlier.

101
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:30,536
You haven’t even said
anything on the way here.

102
00:06:31,245 --> 00:06:33,455
What the hell is your problem?

103
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:36,417
Just say something.

104
00:06:38,043 --> 00:06:39,753
I think you’re the one
with the problem.

105
00:06:40,295 --> 00:06:42,214
I have a problem?

106
00:06:42,714 --> 00:06:44,842
You snapped at me first.

107
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:47,386
Right.

108
00:06:55,102 --> 00:06:56,437
It’s just that…

109
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,983
There’s an issue
going around about us.

110
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Huh?

111
00:07:02,568 --> 00:07:03,776
What issue?

112
00:07:03,777 --> 00:07:05,446
That we’re a thing.

113
00:07:06,113 --> 00:07:07,679
That we’re dating.

114
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,728
My friends have been teasing me.

115
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:12,243
You too, right?

116
00:07:12,277 --> 00:07:13,403
So?

117
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:15,330
You’re not bothered by it?

118
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:17,541
Why would I be?

119
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,501
It's not a big deal.

120
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:20,759
Besides...

121
00:07:21,211 --> 00:07:23,338
I don't care
what other people think.

122
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,011
Listen.

123
00:07:25,674 --> 00:07:28,154
Does it really not bother you

124
00:07:28,343 --> 00:07:30,971
that people think we're...

125
00:07:32,097 --> 00:07:33,239
together?

126
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:37,436
I don't care about
what they think, Elyse.

127
00:07:37,895 --> 00:07:39,104
Okay, then.

128
00:07:39,605 --> 00:07:42,524
Maybe you don’t care,
but I care.

129
00:07:47,488 --> 00:07:48,489
Why?

130
00:07:49,907 --> 00:07:51,867
Are you ashamed of me?

131
00:07:54,997 --> 00:07:56,287
No, it’s not...

132
00:07:56,288 --> 00:07:58,456
You know what, nevermind.

133
00:07:58,457 --> 00:07:59,666
I’ll just go.

134
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,250
I don't want you to feel
embarrassed

135
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:02,543
being seen with me here.

136
00:08:02,544 --> 00:08:04,338
Sevi, let me explain.

137
00:08:05,632 --> 00:08:07,298
Sevi, it’s not like that!

138
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:08,926
Roel, I’ll go ahead.

139
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:18,532
Ma'am.

140
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:22,314
I hope you two
can patch things up soon.

141
00:08:24,274 --> 00:08:26,943
Roel, please don’t tell
Daddy about this.

142
00:08:26,944 --> 00:08:29,071
He’s going to get
really mad at me.

143
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:32,199
Okay, ma’am.
You can count on me.

144
00:08:33,274 --> 00:08:34,274
Thank you.

145
00:08:51,218 --> 00:08:53,679
Still no messages?

146
00:09:00,644 --> 00:09:04,021
@elydezma:
Sorry. Can we talk?

147
00:09:04,022 --> 00:09:07,276
@elydezma:
I’ll explain everything.

148
00:09:13,657 --> 00:09:21,657
@lunavaleria:
Street BBQ with this stinker @sevirous.

149
00:09:25,685 --> 00:09:29,715
Maybe it's better
if we don't talk for now.

150
00:09:46,857 --> 00:09:48,900
- Hi!
- Hi, Ida!

151
00:09:49,526 --> 00:09:54,031
It's so hard to balance
my studies and cheer training.

152
00:09:54,323 --> 00:09:57,200
At least I love it
so I'll manage.

153
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,295
Road to dean’s lister.

154
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,540
Got any plans today?

155
00:10:04,356 --> 00:10:07,878
Will you be seeing
the King Panther?

156
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,133
What’s the deal
with you guys now?

157
00:10:14,978 --> 00:10:16,427
Have you congratulated him yet

158
00:10:16,428 --> 00:10:18,680
for making it to the top 4?

159
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:21,778
No. We’re not even
talking anymore.

160
00:10:21,975 --> 00:10:22,975
Huh?

161
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,811
Why?

162
00:10:25,437 --> 00:10:28,171
He thinks I don’t want to be
seen with him because

163
00:10:28,196 --> 00:10:30,031
I’m embarrassed by him.

164
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,527
And I can’t even tell him

165
00:10:31,552 --> 00:10:33,971
it’s because of my
super strict dad.

166
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:37,783
Plus, his mom works for him.

167
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:41,869
What if she loses her job
because my dad finds out?

168
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,039
It’s so complicated, Ida.

169
00:10:44,998 --> 00:10:47,625
You should just message him.

170
00:10:47,626 --> 00:10:48,835
Just tell him.

171
00:10:49,127 --> 00:10:50,795
No, I don’t want to do that.

172
00:10:50,796 --> 00:10:52,798
He’s the one
who walked out on me.

173
00:10:53,632 --> 00:10:57,094
And it’s better that
we’re not talking.

174
00:10:57,636 --> 00:11:00,931
At least the dating issues
will die down.

175
00:11:01,598 --> 00:11:02,766
Finally.

176
00:11:03,684 --> 00:11:05,852
I know you’re not okay.

177
00:11:06,395 --> 00:11:08,605
I know that face.

178
00:11:11,095 --> 00:11:13,121
[phone ringing]

179
00:11:13,694 --> 00:11:15,861
Hi, Shan! You’re outside?

180
00:11:15,862 --> 00:11:17,822
Okay, I’ll be right there.

181
00:11:17,823 --> 00:11:19,574
Okay, bye-bye!

182
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,535
- I have to go, Ida.
- Okay.

183
00:11:22,536 --> 00:11:24,495
- Sorry.
- Take care, babe.

184
00:11:24,496 --> 00:11:25,496
You too, babe!

185
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,003
- Hi, Shan!
- Hey, Ely.

186
00:11:34,381 --> 00:11:35,382
Are you ready?

187
00:11:36,174 --> 00:11:38,176
Ready for what?
Where are we going?

188
00:11:38,802 --> 00:11:39,803
You’ll see.

189
00:11:40,095 --> 00:11:42,889
But all I can say is that
it’s going to make you happy.

190
00:11:44,516 --> 00:11:45,516
Let’s go?

191
00:11:46,226 --> 00:11:47,978
Are we going on a trip abroad?

192
00:11:48,437 --> 00:11:49,438
For you,

193
00:11:49,813 --> 00:11:51,773
it’s better than
going out of the country.

194
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,151
Let’s go?

195
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:11,417
Oh, hi!

196
00:12:11,877 --> 00:12:14,212
Hi!

197
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:15,963
What’s going on?

198
00:12:15,964 --> 00:12:16,965
Hello.

199
00:12:19,843 --> 00:12:21,489
OMG, Hiro!

200
00:12:24,681 --> 00:12:26,307
We missed you!

201
00:12:26,308 --> 00:12:29,185
I cried a lot
at your farewell party.

202
00:12:29,186 --> 00:12:30,854
I thought you weren’t going
to come back.

203
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:32,713
Miss you guys.

204
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,941
How are you?

205
00:12:36,526 --> 00:12:38,736
I’m fine, I guess.

206
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:40,237
Jeez, oh my god.

207
00:12:40,238 --> 00:12:42,490
It’s barely been
a couple of months.

208
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:45,367
And you’re already back.
The farewell party was a waste.

209
00:12:45,368 --> 00:12:47,203
That wasn’t even a lot for Hiro.

210
00:12:47,204 --> 00:12:48,496
- I’m sure it’s not a big deal.
- Yes.

211
00:12:48,497 --> 00:12:50,457
Hey guys,
I enjoyed the farewell party.

212
00:12:50,707 --> 00:12:51,707
Let’s do another one.

213
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,710
- Okay, next week?
- We can make time.

214
00:12:55,045 --> 00:12:56,254
I miss you too, bro.

215
00:12:57,756 --> 00:13:00,217
But they still can’t find her.
Sorry.

216
00:13:02,552 --> 00:13:05,055
It’s fine. We’ll find her
at the right time.

217
00:13:07,307 --> 00:13:09,225
Wait, you came back
for someone, didn’t you?

218
00:13:09,226 --> 00:13:10,497
Aside from us?

219
00:13:11,686 --> 00:13:14,815
It’s just
a very special someone.

220
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:17,901
And I missed you guys.

221
00:13:19,444 --> 00:13:20,723
- Okay.
- Okay.

222
00:13:20,748 --> 00:13:21,641
[phone notification]

223
00:13:21,696 --> 00:13:23,405
I came back for everyone.
I missed you guys.

224
00:13:23,406 --> 00:13:24,407
Good.

225
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:30,037
Huh? Did Sevi just sent me a message?

226
00:13:30,038 --> 00:13:32,123
Was I just daydreaming?

227
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,918
Or am I just thinking
of him too much?

228
00:13:37,254 --> 00:13:38,255
Ely?

229
00:13:39,798 --> 00:13:42,926
You’re busy with your phone.
I thought you missed me?

230
00:13:44,219 --> 00:13:45,970
You’re texting your boyfriend
aren’t you?

231
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:47,138
What? No!

232
00:13:50,058 --> 00:13:51,184
I wish…

233
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:54,874
Just kidding.

234
00:13:58,846 --> 00:14:00,652
Daddy’s birthday is tomorrow.

235
00:14:01,444 --> 00:14:02,536
You should go.

236
00:14:04,765 --> 00:14:05,881
I’ll go if...

237
00:14:06,992 --> 00:14:08,243
Shan will go.

238
00:15:14,392 --> 00:15:17,394
Even if they’re not here,

239
00:15:17,395 --> 00:15:18,939
you should just enjoy the party.

240
00:15:19,648 --> 00:15:22,609
Free-flowing champagne
all night.

241
00:15:23,234 --> 00:15:25,362
Ida, I have training tomorrow.

242
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:29,532
- I can’t get drunk.
- Live a little, let’s drink.

243
00:15:30,492 --> 00:15:33,160
- Ely.
- Shan! Hiro!

244
00:15:33,161 --> 00:15:35,080
- I’m glad you guys came.
- Careful.

245
00:15:35,538 --> 00:15:36,538
Hi!

246
00:15:37,082 --> 00:15:38,874
Well, I just came here
to see you.

247
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,419
Same here. I just came here
to see the both of you.

248
00:15:42,545 --> 00:15:44,881
But Ely, I don’t plan
to stay long, okay?

249
00:15:45,382 --> 00:15:46,967
I just really came here
to see you.

250
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:50,011
You really love
your little sister, huh?

251
00:15:51,012 --> 00:15:52,596
You’re not even little anymore.

252
00:15:52,597 --> 00:15:54,641
You can even stand
on your own feet already.

253
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:58,144
Your brother
really trusts you so much, Ely.

254
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:01,147
But if you need help
with anything,

255
00:16:01,523 --> 00:16:02,773
you can call us.

256
00:16:02,774 --> 00:16:03,941
You know, Hiro,

257
00:16:03,942 --> 00:16:06,403
my sister
is really a strong woman.

258
00:16:07,404 --> 00:16:08,570
She can be a bit fussy, though.

259
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:11,074
You almost got me giddy.

260
00:16:12,867 --> 00:16:15,495
Hi, Elyse. Hi, Shan.
How are you?

261
00:16:15,912 --> 00:16:17,789
- Hello.
- You’re looking good.

262
00:16:17,872 --> 00:16:19,124
Please excuse me.

263
00:16:19,374 --> 00:16:20,374
Sure.

264
00:16:23,503 --> 00:16:25,138
Is he here?

265
00:16:33,805 --> 00:16:35,598
Wait, are you okay?

266
00:16:41,771 --> 00:16:42,771
Ely?

267
00:16:45,859 --> 00:16:46,609
Woah!

268
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,528
May we call on Sir Alfred
and his family—

269
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:52,574
Ms. Erin, Elyse,
and Shan in front.

270
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:58,992
Shan, let’s go.

271
00:16:59,372 --> 00:17:00,373
No, Ely.

272
00:17:00,915 --> 00:17:02,333
I don’t want to take a picture.

273
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:04,210
Come on, please.

274
00:17:04,586 --> 00:17:05,586
For me?

275
00:17:09,174 --> 00:17:10,175
Fine.

276
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,639
Thank you.

277
00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:20,143
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

278
00:17:29,778 --> 00:17:36,533
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you!

279
00:17:36,534 --> 00:17:44,334
Happy birthday, happy birthday-
Happy birthday to you!

280
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,669
Thank you!

281
00:17:58,681 --> 00:18:00,427
Good evening, everyone.

282
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:03,786
Thank you so much
for being here.

283
00:18:04,646 --> 00:18:06,481
Most especially my family.

284
00:18:08,358 --> 00:18:10,275
To all my friends and partners,

285
00:18:10,276 --> 00:18:12,320
your presence means a lot to me.

286
00:18:13,196 --> 00:18:16,031
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

287
00:18:16,032 --> 00:18:18,826
To continued success
and achievements together.

288
00:18:18,827 --> 00:18:20,870
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

289
00:18:39,514 --> 00:18:40,682
Shan...

290
00:18:41,724 --> 00:18:43,685
You haven’t greeted me yet.

291
00:18:47,313 --> 00:18:48,523
Happy birthday.

292
00:18:52,302 --> 00:18:54,012
But I hope
it won’t be your last.

293
00:18:55,822 --> 00:18:57,720
- You son of a bitch.
- Daddy!

294
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,162
Calm down.

295
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,070
It’s your party.

296
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,083
It’s your party.

297
00:19:16,843 --> 00:19:18,802
That’s the reason
why I’m giving you

298
00:19:18,803 --> 00:19:20,638
all my fucking shares.

299
00:19:25,894 --> 00:19:27,868
Thank you.

300
00:19:49,626 --> 00:19:50,626
Hi!

301
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:52,961
Hello!

302
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,806
Are you a princess?
You look like a princess.

303
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:59,301
No, but I wish.

304
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,002
You look like a princess, too.

305
00:20:01,262 --> 00:20:04,598
Thank you. I’m the princess
of my older brothers.

306
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:06,808
- What’s your name?
- Sofia!

307
00:20:06,936 --> 00:20:07,937
Sevi!

308
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:10,230
Where have you been?

309
00:20:10,813 --> 00:20:14,691
Where did you go?
You’re all sweaty.

310
00:20:14,692 --> 00:20:18,738
- Come on, let’s go back inside.
- Can I play some more, please?

311
00:20:19,197 --> 00:20:20,197
Okay.

312
00:20:20,365 --> 00:20:22,408
Play on my phone first.

313
00:20:22,825 --> 00:20:25,802
So you won't sweat even more.

314
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,120
Stinky!

315
00:20:28,998 --> 00:20:30,394
Okay, go play now.

316
00:20:47,983 --> 00:20:50,812
I didn’t know you had a sister.

317
00:20:53,022 --> 00:20:55,149
Yes, and a brother.

318
00:20:56,484 --> 00:20:58,085
You guys seem close.

319
00:20:59,028 --> 00:21:00,113
Are you the eldest?

320
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,824
Yes.

321
00:21:09,245 --> 00:21:10,456
Congratulations!

322
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,293
Final four.

323
00:21:14,002 --> 00:21:15,128
Thanks.

324
00:21:17,213 --> 00:21:18,479
You look nice.

325
00:21:20,808 --> 00:21:23,154
Thanks, I guess.

326
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,100
- I’m—
- I’m not...

327
00:21:38,568 --> 00:21:39,777
What were you saying?

328
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,784
I’m not used to us
being like this.

329
00:21:48,036 --> 00:21:49,037
Like what?

330
00:21:50,163 --> 00:21:51,622
Talking like this.

331
00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:53,374
Awkward.

332
00:21:55,168 --> 00:21:57,462
Let’s just put this
behind us, please?

333
00:21:59,047 --> 00:22:00,048
Okay.

334
00:22:01,466 --> 00:22:03,468
I was going to say
the same thing.

335
00:22:04,469 --> 00:22:07,138
I’m also sorry about
what happened last week.

336
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:13,062
The truth is
my dad is really strict.

337
00:22:13,644 --> 00:22:16,980
And he doesn’t want me
dating before I graduate.

338
00:22:16,981 --> 00:22:18,649
And if he ever finds out,

339
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:22,445
he’ll ground me and
make me quit cheering.

340
00:22:24,001 --> 00:22:26,503
And that’s also why
I was really worried about

341
00:22:26,528 --> 00:22:28,626
the issues going on between us.

342
00:22:29,744 --> 00:22:30,812
It’s okay.

343
00:22:32,205 --> 00:22:33,331
Forget about it.

344
00:22:33,998 --> 00:22:35,458
I understand.

345
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:38,920
Okay.

346
00:22:43,674 --> 00:22:45,967
Glad you could come today.

347
00:22:45,968 --> 00:22:48,845
You don’t have plans with...

348
00:22:48,846 --> 00:22:49,847
Luna?

349
00:22:53,601 --> 00:22:54,602
Huh?

350
00:22:55,311 --> 00:22:56,854
Why would we go out?

351
00:22:57,623 --> 00:23:00,422
And even if she invited me,

352
00:23:01,692 --> 00:23:04,028
I'd still prefer to come here.

353
00:23:06,197 --> 00:23:07,198
Why?

354
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,785
Because...

355
00:23:11,744 --> 00:23:13,663
there’s someone I wanted to see.

356
00:23:20,586 --> 00:23:23,505
Who was that guy
you were with earlier?

357
00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:24,832
Your boyfriend?

358
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:26,300
Who?

359
00:23:26,426 --> 00:23:29,053
The guy with your brother.

360
00:23:32,432 --> 00:23:34,267
No! Hiro?

361
00:23:34,976 --> 00:23:37,270
That’s my brother’s best friend.

362
00:23:38,729 --> 00:23:40,940
He’s the guy you liked before?

363
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:42,400
Yes.

364
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:45,778
But he’s not my boyfriend.

365
00:23:47,488 --> 00:23:50,074
Good, you two
don’t look good together.

366
00:23:51,033 --> 00:23:53,786
Okay. I don’t remember asking.

367
00:23:53,911 --> 00:23:56,789
It’s true,
you’re not the one for him.

368
00:23:58,416 --> 00:23:59,583
Wow,

369
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,339
I don’t remember
you being this rude.

370
00:24:04,964 --> 00:24:07,091
- I feel like—
- You feel what?

371
00:24:07,925 --> 00:24:09,802
I feel like
we’re a better match.

372
00:24:10,928 --> 00:24:12,430
That’s just how I feel though.

373
00:24:15,183 --> 00:24:18,186
Well then,
I think you’re not feeling well.

374
00:24:21,147 --> 00:24:22,981
Sevi, I need to go
to the bathroom.

375
00:24:22,982 --> 00:24:23,983
Okay.

376
00:24:25,067 --> 00:24:26,234
Give me a minute.

377
00:24:26,235 --> 00:24:27,527
I’ll just take her
to the bathroom.

378
00:24:27,528 --> 00:24:29,691
- Okay.
- Bye, princess.

379
00:24:29,716 --> 00:24:31,433
Bye, little princess.

380
00:24:45,046 --> 00:24:46,046
Anyways...

381
00:24:46,047 --> 00:24:47,590
- Ida!
- Yes?

382
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:48,987
Why Elyse?

383
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,593
- Excuse us, please.
- Okay.

384
00:24:51,594 --> 00:24:53,221
Have you seen Shan?

385
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,473
I think...

386
00:24:56,641 --> 00:24:59,143
- They already left.
- Huh?

387
00:25:05,233 --> 00:25:06,650
Oh my gosh!

388
00:25:06,651 --> 00:25:08,068
What are they talking about?

389
00:25:08,069 --> 00:25:09,487
Is Dad angry at him?

390
00:25:09,695 --> 00:25:11,948
Does he know that
we’ve been hanging out?

391
00:25:12,657 --> 00:25:14,742
Oh no! What should I do?

392
00:25:16,107 --> 00:25:18,109
Ouch! What’s happening?

393
00:25:18,704 --> 00:25:20,873
Shh! Just pretend that we’re talking.

394
00:25:20,998 --> 00:25:22,416
We are talking.

395
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,709
Are you okay?

396
00:25:26,577 --> 00:25:28,052
Oh my!

397
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,115
They’re talking.

398
00:25:34,512 --> 00:25:34,971
Hi!

399
00:25:34,972 --> 00:25:37,557
Won't your basketball career
go to waste, Sevi?

400
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,310
Not at all, sir.

401
00:25:41,894 --> 00:25:44,021
Engineering is what
I really want to do.

402
00:25:45,273 --> 00:25:47,274
But you could be the face of
Philippine basketball

403
00:25:47,275 --> 00:25:48,275
in the future.

404
00:25:48,776 --> 00:25:51,779
My heart is really set
on engineering.

405
00:25:52,405 --> 00:25:55,032
And if I need to choose
between the two,

406
00:25:56,033 --> 00:25:58,369
I'll follow my heart
and stick with it.

407
00:25:59,787 --> 00:26:01,372
I’ve heard that
countless times before.

408
00:26:01,664 --> 00:26:03,707
But passion won’t feed you.

409
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:06,585
Playing in the pro league
is guaranteed to give you

410
00:26:06,586 --> 00:26:08,004
a huge paycheck.

411
00:26:08,754 --> 00:26:09,796
If you go into engineering,

412
00:26:09,797 --> 00:26:11,507
you'll really have
to start from scratch.

413
00:26:12,091 --> 00:26:13,926
I understand that, sir.

414
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,761
But...

415
00:26:16,095 --> 00:26:18,723
I know I can go far
as an engineer.

416
00:26:19,515 --> 00:26:21,808
And my passion for basketball

417
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:24,478
is nowhere near
my passion for engineering.

418
00:26:25,688 --> 00:26:27,272
I’m willing

419
00:26:27,273 --> 00:26:28,315
to go through the hardships

420
00:26:28,316 --> 00:26:30,401
to become a successful engineer.

421
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,360
Wow.

422
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:35,114
You have got a great future
ahead of you.

423
00:26:35,781 --> 00:26:37,283
Maybe even brighter if

424
00:26:37,908 --> 00:26:40,536
you come work
for the Ledezma Group.

425
00:26:42,182 --> 00:26:44,539
Thank you so much
for that offer, sir.

426
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,752
But Valeria Construction
is already waiting for me.

427
00:26:48,461 --> 00:26:50,337
But I’ll keep that in mind.

428
00:26:50,338 --> 00:26:52,130
Maybe I can pull some strings

429
00:26:52,131 --> 00:26:54,674
to hire the most
promising engineer

430
00:26:54,675 --> 00:26:55,968
to work for my company.

431
00:26:57,219 --> 00:26:58,219
Yeah.

432
00:26:59,305 --> 00:27:01,390
Thank you, I’ll think about it.

433
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:06,269
Elyse.

434
00:27:06,646 --> 00:27:07,646
Come here.

435
00:27:10,816 --> 00:27:11,816
Join us.

436
00:27:20,534 --> 00:27:21,903
Elyse, this is Sevi.

437
00:27:22,495 --> 00:27:24,537
Sevi, this is Elyse,
my daughter,

438
00:27:24,538 --> 00:27:25,706
and her friend, Ida.

439
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,876
I’ll go ahead, Uncle.

440
00:27:29,877 --> 00:27:31,836
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

441
00:27:41,681 --> 00:27:43,182
Sebastian Vincent Camero.

442
00:27:47,978 --> 00:27:49,461
Amora Elyse Ledezma.

443
00:27:56,112 --> 00:27:57,446
You remember Sevi?

444
00:27:57,905 --> 00:28:00,282
He’s the son of my secretary.

445
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,890
I actually offered him
a scholarship.

446
00:28:04,704 --> 00:28:06,410
But he’s already a full scholar.

447
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:07,703
Wow!

448
00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:11,376
He’s really that good huh, Dad?

449
00:28:11,377 --> 00:28:12,377
Yes.

450
00:28:12,402 --> 00:28:14,446
And he’s actually graduating

451
00:28:15,005 --> 00:28:16,257
without a girlfriend.

452
00:28:19,695 --> 00:28:21,113
Why don’t you be like him?

453
00:28:29,663 --> 00:28:31,783
Roel? I’m here in the lobby.

454
00:28:32,982 --> 00:28:34,692
Okay, thank you.

455
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,699
They’ve been trying to go
home for a while now,

456
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,742
and it’s already late.

457
00:28:43,743 --> 00:28:46,202
Sevi, are there really
no taxis passing by here?

458
00:28:46,203 --> 00:28:48,581
Booking a ride
would be too expensive.

459
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:51,207
No taxis, Ma.

460
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:54,086
They said you can only get one
at the corner outside.

461
00:28:54,795 --> 00:28:57,131
How about we just walk there?

462
00:28:57,465 --> 00:28:59,257
Ma, you’re wearing heels, right?

463
00:28:59,258 --> 00:29:01,510
You said your feet
were already hurting earlier.

464
00:29:03,846 --> 00:29:05,181
Excuse me.

465
00:29:05,629 --> 00:29:08,715
Where are you headed?
We can drop you off.

466
00:29:09,578 --> 00:29:11,036
There’s no need, Elyse.

467
00:29:11,061 --> 00:29:13,898
No, it’s okay.
Roel can drop you guys off.

468
00:29:14,373 --> 00:29:16,108
It’s a hassle, Elyse.

469
00:29:16,776 --> 00:29:18,068
You might have things to do.

470
00:29:18,194 --> 00:29:20,863
It’s fine. I insist.

471
00:29:21,572 --> 00:29:23,984
Come on, just accept it.

472
00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:27,012
Sir Ledezma’s daughter
is offering, after all.

473
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:29,455
And we get
to save some money too.

474
00:29:29,955 --> 00:29:31,415
Thank you, Ma’am Elyse.

475
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,002
Thank you, princess.

476
00:29:36,754 --> 00:29:38,464
Sevi, can I play some games?

477
00:29:42,676 --> 00:29:43,969
Oh no, Sof.

478
00:29:44,512 --> 00:29:45,929
My phone is low on battery.

479
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:48,909
It’s from all that
playing earlier. Later, okay?

480
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,555
Just play when we
get home, okay?

481
00:29:51,644 --> 00:29:54,172
Sofia, here.
You can play here.

482
00:29:54,522 --> 00:29:57,899
Wow, thank you, princess.

483
00:29:57,986 --> 00:30:01,531
Sweetie, be careful, okay?
We can’t afford that.

484
00:30:01,987 --> 00:30:03,614
Don’t worry, Auntie. It’s okay.

485
00:30:04,955 --> 00:30:06,599
Sweetie, be careful, okay?

486
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,751
Let’s go?

487
00:30:43,404 --> 00:30:46,866
Give the phone back now, Sof.
We’re home.

488
00:30:47,241 --> 00:30:48,783
Thank you.

489
00:30:49,034 --> 00:30:51,494
I hope to see you again.

490
00:30:51,495 --> 00:30:52,997
I hope so, too.

491
00:30:53,372 --> 00:30:55,645
Come on, let’s not bother
Ma’am Elyse anymore.

492
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,500
Ma’am, thank you so much.

493
00:30:57,501 --> 00:30:58,894
No worries, Auntie.

494
00:30:59,169 --> 00:31:01,297
Roel, Thank you. Take care.

495
00:31:01,922 --> 00:31:03,715
We’ll go ahead.
We’ll head inside now.

496
00:31:03,716 --> 00:31:05,300
- All right.
- Take care. Thank you.

497
00:31:05,301 --> 00:31:06,301
Good night!

498
00:31:12,725 --> 00:31:13,726
Thanks.

499
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,353
I’ll make it up to you,
I promise.

500
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:19,654
Come on, it’s not a big deal.

501
00:31:36,123 --> 00:31:38,125
What am I going to do with this?

502
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,338
So that I’ve got a reason
to see you again.

503
00:31:45,132 --> 00:31:46,300
Good night, crush.

504
00:32:15,621 --> 00:32:18,123
Ma’am— Should we leave now?

505
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:21,585
Yes. Yes, Roel.

506
00:32:22,962 --> 00:32:26,256
You don’t need to mention
to my Dad about him.

507
00:32:27,257 --> 00:32:28,467
He’s not my boyfriend.

508
00:32:29,969 --> 00:32:31,887
I didn’t say anything.

509
00:32:32,471 --> 00:32:33,471
Okay, then.

510
00:32:34,556 --> 00:32:36,766
You can report to them
my whereabouts

511
00:32:36,767 --> 00:32:38,832
and the people that I’m with.
Just...

512
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,004
don’t mention names, please.

513
00:32:42,439 --> 00:32:46,192
Sir doesn’t really ask
for the names

514
00:32:46,193 --> 00:32:47,945
of the people you’re with.

515
00:32:49,071 --> 00:32:50,948
Okay. Thank you, Roel.

516
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,201
Let’s go now.

517
00:33:34,116 --> 00:33:35,825
@sevirous:
Wow! Thanks, my idol.

518
00:33:35,826 --> 00:33:37,661
@sevirous:
Finally got a follow back.

519
00:33:40,164 --> 00:33:43,042
@elydezma:
Be grateful. I’m picky with friends.

520
00:33:45,711 --> 00:33:47,171
@sevirous:
Just friends?

521
00:34:07,588 --> 00:34:08,756
Who texted me?

522
00:34:09,693 --> 00:34:12,613
@sevirous:
You’re not going to the gym today?

523
00:34:16,116 --> 00:34:18,202
@elydezma:
I’m playing with my dog.

524
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,372
@sevirous:
You like dogs?

525
00:34:23,832 --> 00:34:26,627
@elydezma:
Well, yes. Why?

526
00:34:30,297 --> 00:34:33,092
@sevirous:
Woof woof

527
00:34:47,231 --> 00:34:49,108
@sevirous:
Hey, Amora Elyse.

528
00:34:51,568 --> 00:34:53,320
@elydezma:
What?

529
00:34:55,906 --> 00:34:57,490
@sevirous:
Isn’t there someone you miss?

530
00:34:57,491 --> 00:35:00,869
@sevirous:
Boom, what a rhyme.

531
00:35:02,621 --> 00:35:05,541
@elydezma:
I’ll think about it.

532
00:35:10,671 --> 00:35:15,676
@sevirous:
Hey, give me back my handkerchief.

533
00:35:16,635 --> 00:35:19,721
@elydezma:
You just want to see me.

534
00:35:22,558 --> 00:35:24,852
@sevirous:
Can I? We’re on our holiday break anyway.

535
00:35:26,311 --> 00:35:30,649
@elydezma:
Okay! I want a manicure.

536
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:39,533
@sevirous:
See you. I’ll get a manicure, too.

537
00:35:52,671 --> 00:35:53,711
Let’s see your nails.

538
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,009
You’ve got clean nails now.

539
00:35:57,634 --> 00:35:59,595
Yes, after 20 years.

540
00:36:00,304 --> 00:36:01,679
You’re disgusting!

541
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,223
That place was good, huh?

542
00:36:05,976 --> 00:36:07,811
This movie looks interesting.

543
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,522
- Right?
- Huh?

544
00:36:11,106 --> 00:36:13,065
How can you tell?
It’s not showing yet.

545
00:36:13,066 --> 00:36:16,862
Well, based off of the trailer,
it looks intriguing.

546
00:36:20,657 --> 00:36:21,657
What?

547
00:36:22,743 --> 00:36:24,786
You should’ve just been
direct with me, Elyse.

548
00:36:25,245 --> 00:36:26,788
Sevi, let’s watch a movie.

549
00:36:27,164 --> 00:36:29,498
Sevi, let’s go on a movie date.

550
00:36:29,499 --> 00:36:30,959
I would’ve said yes anyway.

551
00:36:34,463 --> 00:36:36,548
You’re so full of it.

552
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:39,551
But all right, I accept.

553
00:36:40,135 --> 00:36:42,763
I just need a little more push.

554
00:36:43,555 --> 00:36:44,765
Wow.

555
00:36:45,682 --> 00:36:46,682
Okay.

556
00:36:47,768 --> 00:36:49,186
Well? Is it a date?

557
00:36:54,942 --> 00:36:56,068
Whatever you call it.

558
00:36:57,611 --> 00:36:58,862
Is that a yes?

559
00:37:03,992 --> 00:37:06,411
If you guys
make it to the finals,

560
00:37:06,995 --> 00:37:07,995
sure.

561
00:37:08,372 --> 00:37:09,373
Deal!

562
00:37:10,874 --> 00:37:11,874
Hold on.

563
00:37:12,626 --> 00:37:14,252
What are you looking for?

564
00:37:14,253 --> 00:37:15,587
Before I forget.

565
00:37:18,131 --> 00:37:19,258
What’s this?

566
00:37:22,261 --> 00:37:23,679
Wear it, okay?

567
00:37:24,304 --> 00:37:26,932
To motivate me.

568
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,560
Wow, as if I have a choice.

569
00:37:32,771 --> 00:37:34,231
Do your best at the game.

570
00:37:34,773 --> 00:37:36,732
Of course, I’ll do my best.

571
00:37:36,733 --> 00:37:41,488
So you can finally get
that movie date with me.

572
00:37:53,417 --> 00:37:55,627
Yellow Panthers!

573
00:38:08,765 --> 00:38:11,471
Go, Panthers!

574
00:38:11,496 --> 00:38:13,664
We can do this!

575
00:38:13,812 --> 00:38:15,272
You traitor!

576
00:38:16,126 --> 00:38:18,024
What? It’s okay.

577
00:38:18,025 --> 00:38:20,652
The Arrows
aren’t in the semifinals.

578
00:38:21,069 --> 00:38:23,946
So, I’ll support
the Panthers for now.

579
00:38:23,947 --> 00:38:26,726
And you?
Are you just supporting Camero?

580
00:38:26,751 --> 00:38:28,294
Shut up!

581
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,870
What? Just support him.

582
00:38:30,871 --> 00:38:33,331
He really gave us
the best seats, see.

583
00:38:33,332 --> 00:38:34,832
We’re so close!

584
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:37,461
I can see the crowns
of the players.

585
00:38:38,128 --> 00:38:40,963
What the hell?
What crown?

586
00:38:40,964 --> 00:38:42,257
The top of the head.

587
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:48,262
The seats keep getting
closer as time goes by.

588
00:38:48,263 --> 00:38:50,639
Are you also
getting closer to...

589
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,060
- Shh!
- What?

590
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:56,087
I think she’s Camero’s girl.

591
00:38:58,398 --> 00:39:00,150
Looks like it.

592
00:39:06,531 --> 00:39:07,990
Sevi!

593
00:39:07,991 --> 00:39:10,327
- Ida, you’re so embarrassing.
- What?

594
00:39:18,543 --> 00:39:19,543
Elyse!

595
00:39:19,669 --> 00:39:22,130
- Can I leave this with you?
- Sure, babe.

596
00:39:22,798 --> 00:39:24,591
Take your time, babe.

597
00:39:30,305 --> 00:39:31,807
Thanks for coming.

598
00:39:32,307 --> 00:39:34,893
And thanks for
supporting our team.

599
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,873
Especially me.

600
00:39:37,053 --> 00:39:39,261
Wow, you’re so full of yourself.

601
00:39:40,153 --> 00:39:41,203
Am I wrong?

602
00:39:45,195 --> 00:39:46,613
Aren't you going
to wish me luck?

603
00:39:49,116 --> 00:39:50,116
Good luck.

604
00:39:52,452 --> 00:39:53,703
This game is for you.

605
00:39:56,581 --> 00:39:58,083
Okay, go now.

606
00:40:20,147 --> 00:40:23,024
You guys are so cute.

607
00:40:25,068 --> 00:40:26,069
Seriously.

608
00:40:26,695 --> 00:40:27,696
You look good together!

609
00:40:29,364 --> 00:40:31,366
Go, Panthers!

610
00:40:32,826 --> 00:40:35,745
- Go, Panthers!
- Go, Panthers!

611
00:40:46,006 --> 00:40:47,007
Sevi!

612
00:40:49,217 --> 00:40:50,844
Go, Camero!

613
00:40:56,266 --> 00:40:58,059
Let’s go, Captain!

614
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:25,629
- Defense!
- Defense!

615
00:41:55,659 --> 00:41:56,868
Let’s go Sevi!

616
00:42:05,544 --> 00:42:06,545
Let’s go!

617
00:43:04,894 --> 00:43:07,981
We’re going to the finals!

618
00:43:08,732 --> 00:43:09,733
Yes!

619
00:43:10,483 --> 00:43:11,483
We?

620
00:43:12,986 --> 00:43:15,447
I meant, they. I’m sorry.

621
00:43:18,867 --> 00:43:21,911
1, 2, 3. Panthers!

622
00:43:35,133 --> 00:43:36,676
Let’s go, Panthers!

623
00:43:37,927 --> 00:43:39,721
Let’s go, Panthers!

624
00:43:46,049 --> 00:43:47,134
It’s perfect.

625
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:54,402
Girl, we’ve been waiting here
for almost an hour now.

626
00:43:55,528 --> 00:43:57,072
Just call him.

627
00:44:01,076 --> 00:44:04,579
So, are you guys dating?

628
00:44:06,498 --> 00:44:08,583
Tell me, I’m your best friend.

629
00:44:09,834 --> 00:44:11,002
Come on.

630
00:44:12,003 --> 00:44:14,506
I don’t think we’re dating.

631
00:44:16,091 --> 00:44:18,843
And here I thought the Panthers
were the only winners.

632
00:44:19,052 --> 00:44:21,054
You’re a winner, too.

633
00:44:21,686 --> 00:44:22,728
Babe!

634
00:44:23,765 --> 00:44:25,517
No need to hide it from me.

635
00:44:26,292 --> 00:44:29,437
My driver’s here. I’ll go ahead.

636
00:44:29,771 --> 00:44:31,856
- Okay.
- Enjoy…

637
00:44:33,858 --> 00:44:35,318
lovebirds.

638
00:44:37,153 --> 00:44:38,863
You’re so crazy!

639
00:44:39,114 --> 00:44:41,613
- Go already, bye.
- Okay, bye!

640
00:44:41,741 --> 00:44:43,743
- Enjoy.
- Take care.

641
00:44:44,828 --> 00:44:45,829
Bye!

642
00:45:00,093 --> 00:45:01,344
Where are you?

643
00:45:02,262 --> 00:45:03,554
You know, just because you won

644
00:45:03,555 --> 00:45:05,682
doesn’t mean
you can keep me waiting.

645
00:45:06,766 --> 00:45:09,811
I’m here. In front of you.

646
00:45:11,563 --> 00:45:12,605
Where?

647
00:45:12,981 --> 00:45:15,817
Look, all I can see
is this car in front of me.

648
00:45:40,216 --> 00:45:42,719
Damn. He looks hot.

649
00:45:43,845 --> 00:45:45,180
I’m right here.

650
00:45:49,225 --> 00:45:50,727
Do you have a car?

651
00:45:51,352 --> 00:45:54,563
Coach lent me the car.

652
00:45:54,564 --> 00:45:57,108
Since we made it to the finals.

653
00:45:57,275 --> 00:45:59,068
I won our bet.

654
00:46:01,613 --> 00:46:03,198
Don’t worry.

655
00:46:04,073 --> 00:46:06,986
I’ve already talked to Roel.

656
00:46:07,577 --> 00:46:09,329
He’ll be right behind us.

657
00:46:20,757 --> 00:46:21,758
Elyse…

658
00:46:24,302 --> 00:46:26,982
Can I take you out on a date?

659
00:46:27,912 --> 00:46:28,913
Date?

660
00:46:30,975 --> 00:46:34,854
I couldn’t ask you
properly before.

661
00:46:39,192 --> 00:46:40,400
Are you joking?

662
00:46:40,401 --> 00:46:43,863
I feel like there’s a punchline
coming or something.

663
00:46:47,283 --> 00:46:49,077
I know I always joke around.

664
00:46:49,786 --> 00:46:50,787
But...

665
00:46:51,371 --> 00:46:52,789
I’m serious.

666
00:46:53,873 --> 00:46:55,416
I’m really serious.

667
00:46:56,417 --> 00:46:58,169
So Elyse…

668
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:03,716
Can I take you on a date?

669
00:47:18,523 --> 00:47:19,691
Okay, Sev.

670
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,070
I can be your date.

671
00:47:32,412 --> 00:47:33,413
Come on.

672
00:47:38,877 --> 00:47:40,044
Are you driving?

673
00:47:40,712 --> 00:47:42,797
Of course, I’m driving.

674
00:48:35,391 --> 00:48:36,601
Thank you.

675
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,373
What are you doing?

676
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:44,147
It’s cold.

677
00:50:28,796 --> 00:50:30,465
Thank you for today.

678
00:50:30,923 --> 00:50:31,924
You’re welcome!

679
00:50:32,675 --> 00:50:35,636
Thanks for coming.

680
00:50:37,305 --> 00:50:41,684
Yes, I honestly really liked
what we did today.

681
00:50:43,561 --> 00:50:44,562
Me too.

682
00:50:45,313 --> 00:50:48,231
I’m glad you had fun.

683
00:50:48,232 --> 00:50:49,776
I put a lot of effort into this.

684
00:50:50,526 --> 00:50:51,526
Really?

685
00:50:58,326 --> 00:50:59,994
I noticed your necklace.

686
00:51:01,579 --> 00:51:03,789
You wear it a lot,

687
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:06,751
but why do you hide it?

688
00:51:07,376 --> 00:51:08,376
No reason.

689
00:51:12,381 --> 00:51:13,925
Can I look at it?

690
00:51:14,801 --> 00:51:15,801
Sure.

691
00:51:21,307 --> 00:51:22,558
Who gave this to you?

692
00:51:24,644 --> 00:51:25,645
Luna?

693
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,480
No.

694
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:29,941
I got this for myself.

695
00:51:30,775 --> 00:51:32,110
I had it made.

696
00:51:32,568 --> 00:51:34,195
No special meaning.

697
00:51:39,131 --> 00:51:40,848
Why are you giving this to me?

698
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:48,000
So that
it has a special meaning.

699
00:51:49,836 --> 00:51:51,546
Am I special to you?

700
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,399
Do you like me?

701
00:52:00,263 --> 00:52:01,556
Isn't it obvious?

702
00:52:06,018 --> 00:52:07,018
Sevi.

703
00:52:07,937 --> 00:52:10,564
I don’t want any mixed signals

704
00:52:10,565 --> 00:52:12,650
or confusing feelings, okay?

705
00:52:13,442 --> 00:52:14,861
Yes or no?

706
00:52:15,862 --> 00:52:16,862
Sevi.

707
00:52:18,531 --> 00:52:20,283
Do you like me?

708
00:52:23,619 --> 00:52:25,371
I like you.

709
00:52:56,569 --> 00:52:58,571
Am I embarrassing to be with?

710
00:52:59,197 --> 00:53:00,823
Why would you say that?

711
00:53:01,866 --> 00:53:03,784
Elyse said something.

712
00:53:04,136 --> 00:53:07,972
Made me think that she's
embarrassed to be with me.

713
00:53:07,997 --> 00:53:09,999
What exactly did she say?

714
00:53:11,375 --> 00:53:13,294
She asked if

715
00:53:13,718 --> 00:53:16,012
I was bothered

716
00:53:17,215 --> 00:53:19,842
by other people
seeing us together.

717
00:53:20,259 --> 00:53:23,261
And then? What did you say?

718
00:53:23,262 --> 00:53:24,764
I said I didn’t care.

719
00:53:25,056 --> 00:53:26,057
But

720
00:53:27,141 --> 00:53:28,184
she said she does care.

721
00:53:28,643 --> 00:53:31,186
Here you go again, overthinking.

722
00:53:31,187 --> 00:53:34,689
Maybe you misunderstood.

723
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:36,400
Did you let her explain?

724
00:53:37,443 --> 00:53:39,654
No, I walked out.

725
00:53:40,571 --> 00:53:41,571
What a moron.

726
00:53:41,572 --> 00:53:43,524
You’re at fault here, Sev.

727
00:53:44,659 --> 00:53:48,245
And pride doesn’t really help.

728
00:53:48,246 --> 00:53:50,058
You shouldn’t
let it control you.

729
00:53:50,164 --> 00:53:52,123
You should have
listened to her first

730
00:53:52,124 --> 00:53:55,253
and tried to understand
how she felt.

731
00:53:56,963 --> 00:53:57,713
Really?

732
00:53:57,713 --> 00:53:58,713
Yes.

733
00:53:59,757 --> 00:54:00,967
I miss her.

734
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,853
@sevirous:
I like you, Elyse.

735
00:54:13,378 --> 00:54:14,754
@sevirous:
I miss you.

736
00:54:17,191 --> 00:54:18,401
@sevirous:
Let’s make up.

737
00:54:19,509 --> 00:54:20,562
[phone notification]

738
00:54:22,738 --> 00:54:23,989
Jeez, Sev.

739
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:25,657
- Give it back.
- You’ll regret this.

740
00:54:25,658 --> 00:54:27,910
Stop.
I’m deleting these.

741
00:54:31,247 --> 00:54:33,666
Didn't you say I shouldn’t
let my pride take over?

742
00:54:33,916 --> 00:54:36,252
Now I'm saying
how I really feel.

743
00:55:17,793 --> 00:55:20,003
I’m really nervous.
I'm sweating bullets.

744
00:55:20,004 --> 00:55:21,796
You wanna know why he's nervous?

745
00:55:21,797 --> 00:55:24,215
‘Cause his cheerleader
isn't here.

746
00:55:24,216 --> 00:55:25,675
You're really into
the basketball finals

747
00:55:25,676 --> 00:55:26,802
this season, huh?

748
00:55:26,969 --> 00:55:28,428
How's your training going?

749
00:55:28,429 --> 00:55:30,323
Are you ready for
the cheer dance competition?

750
00:55:30,348 --> 00:55:32,223
Ely? Are you okay?

751
00:55:32,224 --> 00:55:33,575
I’m really nervous about it.

752
00:55:34,054 --> 00:55:36,937
I’ll be watching.
I’ll be your cheerleader.
