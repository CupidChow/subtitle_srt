1
00:00:10,225 --> 00:00:13,613
You seem to have enjoyed
seeing my big bird.

2
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,640
FYI,

3
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,517
it’s a baby bird.

4
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:22,105
You know, big bird
doesn’t like liars.

5
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,749
He’s an angry bird now.

6
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:27,110
Surprise!

7
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,112
Happy birthday, Ely!

8
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,406
I’m sorry. Don’t you like it?

9
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:34,826
I didn’t expect you to
remember my birthday.

10
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,554
- Happy birthday!
- Ida?

11
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:39,164
The best surprise ever.

12
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,583
Maybe I’m just not good for him.

13
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,544
But you left without
saying anything.

14
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,505
Cheer up.
I have a surprise for you.

15
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,716
Shan! Hiro!

16
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,969
Maybe leaving again
is the best thing.

17
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:55,847
Even if it means losing you forever.

18
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,682
I thought you and
Elyse were okay?

19
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:58,975
I thought so too.

20
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,603
But then she suddenly left.

21
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,314
This is my advance
birthday gift for you.

22
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,274
I can’t accept this, Austin.

23
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,693
You are just a colleague to me.

24
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:11,404
- You can leave first, Miss Ledezma.
- Thanks.

25
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,406
That's what you're good at anyway.

26
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,311
I haven’t had sex in like four years.

27
00:01:24,136 --> 00:01:25,854
Am I dying?

28
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,571
You know—

29
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,699
I haven’t had sex in
like four years.

30
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,248
Am I dying?

31
00:03:08,392 --> 00:03:10,895
You know what,
Ely, just get dressed.

32
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,985
I’ll be outside.

33
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,073
Okay, daddy.

34
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:35,006
You know, my head
really fucking hurts.

35
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,051
That’s what you get for
drinking so much.

36
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,845
Just keep drinking until
your liver gives up.

37
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,563
You're so mean, you know?

38
00:03:44,588 --> 00:03:47,549
My head already hurts, and
you're making it worse.

39
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,189
Your head hurts?
Then just chop it off.

40
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,359
Just kidding! Come on!

41
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,778
Have some breakfast so
you can take your medicine.

42
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,231
I'll help you tidy that up.

43
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,157
That looks good.

44
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,669
Where should I put this?

45
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:19,651
Wait! Don't touch that?

46
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,731
Why?

47
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:25,139
It's embarrassing.

48
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,349
Now you’re shy?

49
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,643
When you almost stripped
in front of me last night?

50
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,315
I don’t remember.

51
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:39,320
You don’t remember, or are
you just pretending not to?

52
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,241
Shut up!

53
00:04:44,606 --> 00:04:46,619
Hey! Don't—

54
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,413
I will get that.

55
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,427
Who is this from?

56
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,388
That?

57
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,348
It's from Austin.

58
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,350
Austin?

59
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,728
He gave you a ring?

60
00:05:11,753 --> 00:05:13,296
It’s his birthday gift to me.

61
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,190
He insisted that I accept it.

62
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,693
But don't worry,
I'm going to return it.

63
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:22,905
Never mind.

64
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:25,042
Let’s just pawn it.

65
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,743
Let’s not waste it.

66
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,749
Wait.

67
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,752
Where's your birthday
gift for me?

68
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,128
I already threw it away.

69
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,673
What? Why did you do that?

70
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,133
How dare you throw it away!

71
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,968
What did you do with it?

72
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,303
I pawned it off already.

73
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,721
Pawned?

74
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,306
What did you buy?

75
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,102
Is this house clothes or
for going out?

76
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,398
Sevi! What is it?

77
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:02,820
A ring.

78
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,036
He bought you a what?

79
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,538
A ring! I mean—

80
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,958
He didn’t tell me what
kind of ring it was.

81
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,169
All he said was, it’s a ring.

82
00:06:19,514 --> 00:06:21,558
Oh my god!

83
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:24,592
Wait, should I start
dieting already?

84
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,762
I’m going to start preparing as
your maid of honor!

85
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:31,182
Ida, we don’t even have a
label yet, remember?

86
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,393
What? No label?

87
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,769
None.

88
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:39,315
But look at you, you’re all smiles.

89
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,097
See? I know you, Ely.

90
00:06:43,652 --> 00:06:44,904
I know you.

91
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:52,629
Elyse,

92
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,976
Dad and I are going to Aruga
resort for a site visit.

93
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:59,627
Our business partners are
also going to be there.

94
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,295
Are you coming with us?

95
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,505
Honestly, no.

96
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:06,717
But because I'm professional
I'll fulfill my CEO duties.

97
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,595
Well, yes, sure.

98
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,765
I would love to tour our
business partners around.

99
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,476
Okay then. Come with us.

100
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,646
No, we should take
the company car.

101
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,231
Okay.

102
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,900
Also, Austin—

103
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,865
I can't take this.

104
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,659
I don't want other people to
get the wrong idea.

105
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,327
You're single, right?

106
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,081
Yes. I'm single, but—

107
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:39,083
Then I can still court you.

108
00:07:41,137 --> 00:07:43,514
Austin, just take it.

109
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,014
Well?

110
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,091
I'll wait for you.

111
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,997
I don't trust that guy.

112
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,657
I know you’ve known each other
for a long time, Ely, but—

113
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,368
I just have a really bad
feeling about him.

114
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:17,079
Just be extra careful.

115
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,080
Yes.

116
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,105
- Well, that’s pretty good.
- I love that.

117
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,808
Finally, they’re here.

118
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,526
- Good morning!
- Finally!

119
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,944
- Hi!
- How’s it going?

120
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,904
- Good to see you here.
- You’ve arrived, Mr. Guerrero.

121
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,822
- Hi, good morning sir.
- Good morning.

122
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,074
Engineer.

123
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,325
Good morning, sir.

124
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,412
Good morning.

125
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,043
Okay, take it slow. There you go…

126
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,462
Come on.

127
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,298
It’s okay.

128
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,050
It’s fine. Come on!

129
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,976
We would like to see
the site today.

130
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,062
Sure, sir! Engineer Lavin,
the hard hats, please.

131
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,231
Sir.

132
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,232
Thank you.

133
00:09:26,477 --> 00:09:27,478
Thank you.

134
00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:29,011
Thank you.

135
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,032
Let me help you,
I'll put it on for you.

136
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,242
I can do it for myself.

137
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,702
No, let me.

138
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,288
There, gently, you might
hurt yourself.

139
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,083
Okay? There you go.

140
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,793
I guess you were
right, Anthony—

141
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:48,947
It looks like Miss Ledezma and
Austin are getting close.

142
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,424
No, it’s not. It’s not—

143
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,010
I'm still courting her, sir.

144
00:09:54,556 --> 00:09:57,059
Hopefully, she will say yes.

145
00:09:57,084 --> 00:09:58,752
Does Miss Ledezma not
have a boyfriend?

146
00:09:58,777 --> 00:10:01,196
No! She told me she was single.

147
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,830
Excuse me, everyone,
I just have to take this call.

148
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,458
Engineer Lavin,
you handle it first.

149
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,169
Come on!

150
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,795
Come on, guys! Let’s go.

151
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:30,840
Come on!

152
00:10:40,316 --> 00:10:41,317
Let’s go?

153
00:10:41,785 --> 00:10:43,225
Excuse me,

154
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,062
I’ll just get some water,
you can go ahead.

155
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,766
Single?

156
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:35,152
Well, we didn’t talk about
anything yet.

157
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,696
What should I say?

158
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,407
I didn’t want to assume.

159
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,582
Look…

160
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:49,333
There are rumors going around in
the company about me and Austin.

161
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,628
That's why I returned the ring,
to make it stop—

162
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,682
Do you like him?

163
00:12:05,628 --> 00:12:07,213
Of course not.

164
00:12:09,737 --> 00:12:11,572
You’re the man that I like.

165
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,009
You’re not single anymore, okay?

166
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,052
Do you understand?

167
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:46,056
Does it mean we're in a
relationship now?

168
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,256
Don't you want to?

169
00:12:52,461 --> 00:12:53,586
Of course, I do.

170
00:12:56,345 --> 00:12:57,596
Since day one—

171
00:13:00,099 --> 00:13:01,726
I’ve missed you so much.

172
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,854
As you can see everyone,

173
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:09,481
the progress of our resort
is already significant.

174
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,333
Nice! Impressive!

175
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,353
Yes.

176
00:13:13,378 --> 00:13:16,295
So, if you guys are ready,
allow me to guide you

177
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,922
to the gazebo so you can
chill and relax.

178
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,948
Hold on. We haven’t
seen the satellite office yet.

179
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,345
Good thing you mentioned it.

180
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,409
He’s right.

181
00:13:26,823 --> 00:13:29,725
Sir, maybe you'd like to
have a snack first.

182
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,478
Me? I'm fine, I'm still full.

183
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,858
Maybe you'd like to see
the pool?

184
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,194
Of course, the weather
is so nice today—

185
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,947
and of course, we all
need some vitamin D.

186
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,908
Maybe you’d like to
sunbathe first?

187
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,952
It's noon, Engineer Lavin,

188
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,829
do you want us to
get heatstroke?

189
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,874
Of course, I’m just joking, sir!

190
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,100
That was a test.

191
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,752
Don’t be silly, Engineer.

192
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:01,340
Excuse me sir, I have to
take this call.

193
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,716
- Okay.
- Please excuse me.

194
00:14:09,585 --> 00:14:10,807
Shall we, Engineer?

195
00:14:12,214 --> 00:14:14,854
Yes, follow me.

196
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,647
Okay.

197
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,962
Is it okay to do this here?

198
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,007
I don’t care.

199
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,562
Get down.

200
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,137
Engineer Camero?

201
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,098
Engineer Camero!

202
00:15:38,218 --> 00:15:39,970
Engineer Camero?

203
00:15:40,317 --> 00:15:43,067
I think Sir Anthony and the
others want to see the office!

204
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,985
Can we go in?

205
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,030
It looks like something fell.

206
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,699
I think they’re chasing after a rat.

207
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:53,472
Hold on, just fixing things.

208
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,497
Engineer Camero!

209
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,332
Can we come in?

210
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,453
Come in!

211
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,135
Please come in.

212
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,412
So, this is the satellite office?

213
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,833
You seem to be very hardworking,
Engineer Camero.

214
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,670
Your desk is a mess, and your
clothes are all wrinkled.

215
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,048
You must be very hands-on here.

216
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,342
Yes, very hands-on, sir!

217
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,888
Yes, sir! He’s actually working
on a lot of things,

218
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,181
especially in the office!

219
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,311
Elyse, are you okay?

220
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,940
Why are you sweating?

221
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,068
And what's that red mark
on your neck?

222
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,656
Sevi! He gave me love bites!

223
00:17:13,347 --> 00:17:16,099
Are those insect bites?

224
00:17:16,124 --> 00:17:17,960
Engineer Camero?

225
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,497
We might need to check
the surroundings.

226
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,583
There might be a lot of
insects here later!

227
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:27,296
And we might need to do
fumigation, Miss Ledezma?

228
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:29,673
That's right.

229
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,216
Noted on that, sir.

230
00:17:34,407 --> 00:17:38,390
- Shall we go outside?
- Yes sir!

231
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,641
If you guys will follow me,

232
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,727
I’ll take you guys to the
gazebo for some snacks.

233
00:17:41,752 --> 00:17:42,817
Come on.

234
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:45,064
Let’s go.

235
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:58,178
Stay for a while.
Let’s have lunch first.

236
00:18:58,668 --> 00:19:01,921
I really need to go back to
the office, I’m sorry.

237
00:19:01,946 --> 00:19:05,533
But don’t worry, I promise
I won’t skip any meals.

238
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,312
You promise, right?

239
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,064
Take pictures of your meals.

240
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:13,402
Then what? Are you gonna call
me a hamster again?

241
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:17,281
Wow! Seriously, master—

242
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:21,076
Why are you calling our
amazing boss a hamster?

243
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,953
That's right.

244
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,873
Engineer Camero!

245
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,544
Have you eaten lunch?
Did you eat what I brought?

246
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:34,214
This girl is still
preparing lunch for Sevi?

247
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,885
How persistent. Maybe she
wants to change careers.

248
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,345
She should just be a chef then.

249
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,766
No, I'm still full.

250
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,394
I gave it to Theo earlier.

251
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,272
It was good!
Looking forward to next time.

252
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,118
Elyse, let's go.

253
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,495
Daddy's waiting for us,
we need to leave now.

254
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,584
Okay.

255
00:20:14,308 --> 00:20:18,062
Engineer Lavin,
Engineer Camero—

256
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:21,929
Thank you for accommodating us
even with your busy schedules.

257
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,972
We’re going now.

258
00:20:25,945 --> 00:20:26,946
Ely—

259
00:20:53,955 --> 00:20:56,208
See you later tonight, babe.

260
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:14,801
See you later, babe.

261
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:35,896
Hey.

262
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,191
Did you sleep enough last night?

263
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,527
Of course, you wore me out.

264
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,995
Elyse, look.

265
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,735
What do you think?

266
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,502
Wow!

267
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,713
This is really beautiful.

268
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,735
Is this your project?

269
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:07,094
It’s Theo’s project,
Luna made the design.

270
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,138
This is the house I'm having built.

271
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:14,101
So, it’s your future house?

272
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,271
Our future house.

273
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:22,859
Really?

274
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:29,741
Sevi, you’re not joking
with me, are you?

275
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,328
I wouldn’t joke about
things like this.

276
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,504
Do you want to make
any changes?

277
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:49,421
Nothing. It’s perfect.

278
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,168
Where is this located?

279
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:02,023
My father left me some land.

280
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,317
It’s just nearby, close to our office.

281
00:24:06,449 --> 00:24:07,825
That’s great.

282
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,036
Oh, right, I haven’t told you—

283
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,247
Mama and Papa got back together.

284
00:24:18,087 --> 00:24:20,297
What? Really?

285
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,335
Oh my god!

286
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:25,715
Wait, that’s really great
to hear!

287
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:30,036
So, are you okay with
your dad now?

288
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,555
We’re okay.

289
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,726
As long as Mama’s happy,
I’m fine with it.

290
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:43,899
And I did see how sincere he
was when he talked to me.

291
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:48,320
I can also see that he’s really
trying to make it up to us.

292
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:53,658
I told you, I can forgive easily.

293
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:59,503
You really have a big heart, Sev.

294
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,584
I’m really happy to hear that

295
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,503
your family is back together again.

296
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:11,983
But it won’t be the same
with my family.

297
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,722
It sucks being a Ledezma.

298
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,278
Sev?

299
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,371
Do you want to change
your last name to mine?

300
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:23,623
Amora Elyse Ledezma—

301
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,713
Will you marry me?

302
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:44,728
Of course!

303
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:47,272
Yes! Yes, I will!

304
00:26:48,077 --> 00:26:49,328
I will!

305
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:54,566
I’m freaking engaged, Ida!

306
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,401
You’re engaged?

307
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,529
Oh my god!

308
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:05,493
Oh my god, I’m so happy
for you, Ely!  Congratulations!

309
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,661
Thank you.

310
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,246
You were right!

311
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:12,083
It was an engagement ring.

312
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,836
It was well worth assuming.

313
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,432
And it was also worth it to get
my nails done for this occasion!

314
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,765
You know— With Sevi,
everything feels so sure.

315
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,268
I always feel like I’m over
the moon, you know?

316
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,252
But I can’t tell anyone yet
about the engagement party.

317
00:29:33,277 --> 00:29:36,196
Because, his family doesn’t know yet.

318
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,819
You’re the only one
who knows, actually.

319
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,113
Wow, what an honor.

320
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,282
Of course, because—

321
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:47,452
You’re my maid of honor.

322
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,287
What?

323
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,040
- Really?
- Yes.

324
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,833
Thank you, Ely.

325
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:56,711
Of course, girl.
Who else would I choose?

326
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,213
You’re my bestie!

327
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,104
- Period.
- Duh!

328
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,844
I also need to talk to Shan.

329
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,347
I’m sure he’ll be thrilled to
hear about this.

330
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:11,226
So, do you and Sevi already
have plans

331
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,686
for the kind of wedding
you want?

332
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,564
We haven’t talked about it yet.

333
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:21,027
But I know for sure it’s going
to be a big celebration.

334
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,071
But unlike my debut,

335
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,532
I only want family and
close friends to be there—

336
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,077
You know, the people that
witnessed our love story.

337
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,954
That’s beautiful, Ely!

338
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:35,095
I’m so excited to do
wedding planning with you!

339
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,290
Future Mrs. Camero.

340
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,510
Let me see that again.

341
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,971
- It’s so pretty, right?
- Oh my god.

342
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,931
Let’s bill out, guys.
Should I use my card?

343
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:56,479
Guys, I got this. My treat.

344
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,982
- What?
- This is a miracle.

345
00:30:58,982 --> 00:30:59,983
Why are you treating us?

346
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,150
Really?

347
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,727
Sevi, this isn’t the Sevi I know.

348
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,949
This isn’t the friend I know.
Give our friend back!

349
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,367
You guys are crazy.

350
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,952
Something good must
have happened?

351
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,871
Your smile is different!

352
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,790
Sevirous?

353
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,667
You and Elyse got back together?

354
00:31:18,316 --> 00:31:21,194
Oh my god, they got
back together!

355
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,024
Elyse and I got back together!

356
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:28,303
Congratulations!

357
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,930
No wonder he's so happy at work.

358
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,517
He’s full of energy.
Love really does wonders.

359
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:37,270
Another broken heart has risen.

360
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:41,357
Thank you, guys!
I’m really so happy.

361
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,378
Oh my gosh,
what’s going on these days?

362
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,821
Is it the comeback of the exes?

363
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,531
Because first, it was
you and Kalix,

364
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,491
and now it’s Sevi and Elyse.

365
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,994
I think it’s just the season
for soft-heartedness.

366
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,246
Just kidding!

367
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:59,083
No, but you know what they say,
right? Life is full of surprises.

368
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:03,271
So, I think those foolish
decisions we made back then,

369
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,506
that’s what led to the better—

370
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,515
Better life?

371
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,967
Better life!

372
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,844
So, think about it, if I didn’t accept

373
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,096
that project with Kalix in Tagaytay—

374
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,057
we wouldn’t get back together.

375
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,100
If he didn’t play house
with his ex,

376
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,977
they wouldn’t have gotten
back together!

377
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,813
In short, does that mean we all
have to act foolish?

378
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,440
Yes.

379
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,068
Moral— lesson?

380
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,863
That’s right, Ke, because—

381
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:31,574
love is illogical.

382
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,619
He said, love is illogical.

383
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,454
Shit, he’s speaking English.

384
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,468
English.

385
00:32:37,493 --> 00:32:39,332
Is it because Elyse speaks English?

386
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,584
Wow, I’m not used to that.

387
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:42,585
English.

388
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:43,878
Can you handle him?

389
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:44,879
English.

390
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:47,715
You guys are nuts!

391
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,677
By the way—  I’ll speak English.

392
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:54,110
By the way, you bring Elyse to
Sam’s bar this weekend.

393
00:32:54,135 --> 00:32:55,156
‘Cause we’re there—

394
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,766
- and we wanna have fun.
- Yes.

395
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,935
You know? We can bond with her.

396
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,520
Spend time?

397
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,940
Yes. I’ll bring Kalix, too.

398
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,150
- So he’s happy.
- Yes, we’re all happy.

399
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,153
Okay. I’ll bring Elyse and—

400
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,406
Elyse and I will announce something.

401
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,824
- What?
- English.

402
00:33:12,849 --> 00:33:14,642
Shit! What is it?

403
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,830
Wait, let me think.

404
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,541
Is it— Is it what I think it is?

405
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,545
- I’ll tell you guys in the weekend.
- Wow!

406
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,963
One more!

407
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,891
I’ll tell you guys in
the weekend.

408
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,886
Oh my god, cheers!

409
00:33:32,068 --> 00:33:33,069
Cheers!

410
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,126
- It’s almost finished.
- I’m drunk.

411
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,975
As you can see,

412
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,185
we are going to reinforce
the foundation

413
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,229
of our sea-facing wing,

414
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:46,315
to combat wind load,
especially during storms.

415
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:49,277
How did you know that these
changes are necessary?

416
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,529
Didn't we have this assessed

417
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,406
even before the
construction started?

418
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,616
Because I’m an engineer, sir.

419
00:33:59,158 --> 00:34:01,243
Well, that’s my man!

420
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,708
So, where’s the proposal for this?

421
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,586
I’m sure it will incur
additional costs.

422
00:34:07,477 --> 00:34:10,855
Well, Austin, it was
emailed last week.

423
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,133
Maybe you forgot or your
EA forgot to print it for you.

424
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,263
Well, I would’ve appreciated it

425
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,974
if Engineer Camero
had told me that

426
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:23,770
the last time we were together
on site, a few days ago.

427
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,188
Right?

428
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:29,192
I’ll take note of that, sir.

429
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:33,237
Are there any further questions?

430
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,949
No, I’m good.

431
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,161
No, that is all.

432
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,038
Thank you, everyone.
Meeting is adjourned.

433
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,873
Thank you, Engineer Camero.

434
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,713
Congratulations on
your engagement,

435
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:53,110
Sir Austin and Miss Ledezma.

436
00:34:53,135 --> 00:34:54,179
What?

437
00:34:54,204 --> 00:34:56,511
Because you have an
engagement ring.

438
00:34:56,649 --> 00:34:57,712
Thank you.

439
00:34:58,888 --> 00:34:59,889
Thank you.

440
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,025
Okay, excuse me, everyone.

441
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:13,236
But I would like to clarify

442
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:16,823
that I am not engaged with
Mr. Austin Guerrero,

443
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:20,993
nor am I in a romantic
relationship with him.

444
00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:25,927
We are business partners and
that is all. Thank you.

445
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,165
That Austin is such an idiot,

446
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,791
such a moron!

447
00:36:09,087 --> 00:36:13,129
And his questions in the meeting
earlier were really dumb.

448
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,590
He’s also being way too
presumptuous with you.

449
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:19,802
Just ignore him, don’t mind him.

450
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:24,849
But also next time— you should
answer him with respect.

451
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,393
I know him, okay?

452
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:30,980
He can turn things around on
you if you’re rude to him.

453
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,775
Maybe I should corner him.

454
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,527
Theo and I can handle him.

455
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,821
Sevi.

456
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,533
Don’t worry. I’m kidding!

457
00:36:43,025 --> 00:36:47,507
If that were true, everyone mad at me
would’ve teamed up against me by now.

458
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,707
And they’re a lot!

459
00:36:50,349 --> 00:36:53,311
They should create a group chat

460
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,421
and add Austin.

461
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,715
Do you know what they
should name their group?

462
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:58,835
What?

463
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,720
“The men who were jealous of me”.

464
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,140
Kalix is the president, Hiro
will be the vice president—

465
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,976
and they should make
Austin the treasurer.

466
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:11,520
Wait. Even Hiro?

467
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,439
Yes, you have no idea.

468
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:18,694
About earlier,

469
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,571
I’m sorry.

470
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,407
Sorry for what?

471
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:29,080
Sorry for not announcing our
engagement to everyone.

472
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,375
I know that if we announce it,

473
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:36,671
the rumors between me
and Austin will stop.

474
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:40,424
But I do need to be careful
because some business partners

475
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,760
might think malicious
things about you.

476
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:45,096
You know? And—

477
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,223
I don’t want people to think

478
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:50,268
that you got the job just
because you’re dating me.

479
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,103
And another thing—

480
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:55,606
I don’t want our engagement
to outshine all of the great

481
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,734
things that you’ve done as
head engineer of the project.

482
00:37:59,899 --> 00:38:01,276
Come on,

483
00:38:01,518 --> 00:38:03,187
I understand that.

484
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:07,285
I’m actually lucky that
you're overprotective of me.

485
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:10,037
And that Austin—

486
00:38:10,892 --> 00:38:13,603
Let him spread rumors about me.

487
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:17,211
What matters is that
I’m the one you chose.

488
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,131
That’s just how it is when

489
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,216
you're more handsome and
better at what you do.

490
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,992
Wow!

491
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,593
But seriously—

492
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,016
no matter what lies he spreads,

493
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,976
he won’t find anything against me.

494
00:38:32,578 --> 00:38:35,663
You know me, Ely.
I’m honest with my work.

495
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,566
Of course.

496
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,485
And that is one of the most

497
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,822
attractive things about
you that I love.

498
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,290
See?

499
00:39:36,936 --> 00:39:38,043
So pretty!

500
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,170
Guys, drink as much as you want!

501
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,172
Just order any food and
drinks that you like.

502
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:46,082
Let’s make the most of it
because after this night—

503
00:39:46,758 --> 00:39:50,332
we’ll need to go back to dieting
for Kalix and Luna’s wedding.

504
00:39:50,357 --> 00:39:51,555
- Yes!
- Yes!

505
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,100
Except for Luna, okay? Pregnant
women aren’t allowed to drink!

506
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:55,518
Yes, she’s right.

507
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,478
You shouldn’t drink. Let me know
if you want anything else.

508
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,646
I’ll get it for you.

509
00:39:58,646 --> 00:39:59,778
Really now?

510
00:39:59,889 --> 00:40:02,262
All right, I want you to get
drunk so that tonight,

511
00:40:03,153 --> 00:40:04,488
we’ll go wild!

512
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,879
No, as long as I see you guys
drunk, I’ll be happy.

513
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,242
Wait! Where are Via and Arkin?

514
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,576
Via messaged me—

515
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,620
They’re going to be late

516
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,247
because they’re still
at the studio.

517
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:18,999
Such a singer!

518
00:40:20,204 --> 00:40:21,914
Before anything else, guys,

519
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,630
let’s cheers for the
newly engaged—

520
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,216
and to make the pregnant
one jealous.

521
00:40:29,737 --> 00:40:31,362
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

522
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,973
Cheers! Congratulations!

523
00:40:37,711 --> 00:40:39,462
There might be someone else
getting married soon,

524
00:40:39,487 --> 00:40:40,895
you better start talking.

525
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,583
Actually…

526
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:45,985
Oh my god!

527
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,069
Hey!

528
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,529
- Hey!
- Congrats!

529
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,781
Shit! Are you guys serious?

530
00:40:50,994 --> 00:40:52,412
I already said, yes.

531
00:40:58,818 --> 00:41:00,694
Hey! Ely…

532
00:41:01,171 --> 00:41:02,762
Congratulations!

533
00:41:04,565 --> 00:41:05,775
Thank you.

534
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:08,837
Engineer Camero, congratulations!

535
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:13,647
Thanks, Captain Juarez!

536
00:41:16,304 --> 00:41:19,840
You’re all invited, guys.
We’ll send the details soon.

537
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,980
There you go, I’m getting married!

538
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:27,985
I hope your boys won’t be
jealous of me anymore!

539
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:32,239
Not anymore?

540
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,034
What a waste that the other
guy isn’t here to hear it.

541
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,536
- Right, Sam?
- Don’t worry, Sev.

542
00:41:38,801 --> 00:41:41,629
By the way, I invited Shan.

543
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,751
Is that fine?

544
00:41:49,796 --> 00:41:51,923
I guess, it’s okay.

545
00:41:51,948 --> 00:41:52,957
Right, guys?

546
00:41:56,443 --> 00:41:57,444
No.

547
00:41:58,288 --> 00:41:59,289
Awkward.

548
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:03,938
He’s actually here already.
He’s just parking.

549
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,359
Wow!

550
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,612
Everyone is getting married!
Isn’t this crazy?

551
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:12,699
Yes!

552
00:42:14,311 --> 00:42:15,848
Let’s toast to that!

553
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,285
To true love!

554
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:22,456
- To true love!
- To true love!

555
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,141
Babe—

556
00:42:35,797 --> 00:42:38,300
Take it easy, you might get
drunk all of a sudden.

557
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:40,267
No, it’s okay.

558
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,894
Do you get drunk easily?

559
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,981
Good. Because I have some
questions prepared for you.

560
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,426
Is Sevi good at kissing?

561
00:42:58,307 --> 00:42:59,892
I’m not drunk yet.

562
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:01,974
Still, you have to answer.

563
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,873
Yanna, you jerk.

564
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:06,458
I know.

565
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:08,627
Are you?

566
00:43:09,109 --> 00:43:10,944
- Am I?
- Are you?

567
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,967
Yes, he is.

568
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,556
And pretty good in bed too.

569
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:25,394
That's info I didn’t want to know.

570
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,439
Good thing your brother isn’t here!

571
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,941
But does your brother know
you’re getting married?

572
00:43:33,751 --> 00:43:35,246
We’re just about to tell him.

573
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:37,906
So, if I suddenly disappear,

574
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,658
call the police right
away, okay?

575
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,120
Look at Sevi’s face.

576
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,331
You look like—
Looks like Elyse is drunk, guys?

577
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:55,005
Kalix looks drunk too, right?

578
00:45:56,410 --> 00:46:01,024
No, I’m not drunk. I’m just tipsy.

579
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,676
- Really?
- Yes.

580
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,011
Not drunk, huh?

581
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,082
Let’s see…

582
00:46:05,107 --> 00:46:07,294
Is Sevi your first kiss? Hey!

583
00:46:09,849 --> 00:46:11,310
- Yes, he is.
- Why?

584
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,936
But I know I’m not his.

585
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:13,937
But you know what? —

586
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,774
He wouldn’t tell me.
So, I don’t know.

587
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:19,860
Oh no! Yanna seems so quiet.

588
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,279
- Huh?
- Wait, why?

589
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,232
What? I think I’m drunk already.

590
00:46:33,661 --> 00:46:36,126
Come on. Let’s go home, babe.

591
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:39,036
OMG. Are we going to do babe time?

592
00:46:41,677 --> 00:46:42,841
Yes.

593
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,052
- We are going to do babe time.
- Babe time?

594
00:46:45,622 --> 00:46:48,347
Okay, wait. I’ll say bye to them.

595
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,390
Yes bro, you should
bring her home.

596
00:46:51,953 --> 00:46:54,169
- Bye-bye!
- Careful, Ely.

597
00:46:57,067 --> 00:46:59,107
- Hi!
- Hi!

598
00:46:59,829 --> 00:47:02,044
I just want to say—

599
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:05,989
that I had so much fun
with you guys.

600
00:47:06,552 --> 00:47:08,450
Really great time, you know?

601
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,369
And Luna, honestly—

602
00:47:11,215 --> 00:47:17,656
I am so sorry that I was
jealous of you.

603
00:47:18,505 --> 00:47:22,130
And Kierra…

604
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:28,053
Still a little awkward. But you
know what, I still love you!

605
00:47:31,802 --> 00:47:35,352
And Via, she’s in the bathroom—

606
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:38,856
And you know what?
She is an amazing

607
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:42,276
and patient person. Like what?

608
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:46,864
- And Sam, I love you, my friend
- I love you.

609
00:47:52,291 --> 00:47:53,793
And Yanna…

610
00:47:55,512 --> 00:47:58,747
I fucking hate you.

611
00:47:58,772 --> 00:48:01,920
But I still love you.

612
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,005
Same!

613
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:05,007
I love you guys.

614
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,884
- I love you.
- I love you

615
00:48:09,692 --> 00:48:10,929
Baby!

616
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:13,974
Come here, baby!

617
00:48:16,648 --> 00:48:19,150
Are we going to go?
We’re going to do babe time.

618
00:48:21,744 --> 00:48:22,745
Sevi—

619
00:48:23,983 --> 00:48:27,320
Your friends are wonderful.

620
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:33,577
Let’s go.

621
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,537
- Okay, babe time.
- I’ll take this one home now.

622
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:36,955
Boys!

623
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:56,391
The drunk girl is finally awake!

624
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:57,726
Sit down.

625
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:03,357
Eat first so you can take your
medicine for your headache.

626
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:11,949
What happened last night?

627
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,869
Huh? You don’t remember?

628
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:20,666
No!

629
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,627
All I remember is—

630
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:25,170
is dancing.

631
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:29,091
Yanna has a video,
she sent it to me last night.

632
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,300
Huh?

633
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:33,595
That bitch!

634
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:35,889
Bitch?

635
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,692
Do you know you said
'I love you' to her last night?

636
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:46,692
You know what? I’m—
I’m never drinking again!

637
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,532
But I did have a lot of fun, too.

638
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:57,452
You know—

639
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:01,915
I don’t think that I’ve been
this happy in a while.

640
00:50:02,455 --> 00:50:03,456
Don’t worry.

641
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:08,672
From now on, there will be
more happy days than sad ones.

642
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,239
Yes.

643
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:13,468
Eat now.

644
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,930
Wait. One second. Someone’s calling.

645
00:50:21,458 --> 00:50:23,103
It’s Austin.

646
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:26,356
Should I just decline his call?

647
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,505
Answer it, it might be important.

648
00:50:34,582 --> 00:50:35,583
Okay.

649
00:50:36,903 --> 00:50:38,645
I think this will just be quick.

650
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,124
Hello?

651
00:50:44,481 --> 00:50:48,443
Elyse, emergency meeting!
Something happened in Batangas.

652
00:50:48,475 --> 00:50:50,560
One of the guest villas collapsed!

653
00:50:50,585 --> 00:50:52,299
Five workers were rushed to the

654
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,134
hospital with serious injuries.

655
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:55,969
What?

656
00:50:57,726 --> 00:50:59,061
What happened?

657
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:00,724
I’ll explain further

658
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,643
but it looks like Engineer
Camero has been negligent.

659
00:51:03,964 --> 00:51:07,259
Fuck, this will lead to
a major lawsuit, Elyse.

660
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:06,748
Based on our initial findings—

661
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:09,793
the collapse was due to
substandard materials.

662
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,294
How did this happen?

663
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:14,673
Maybe our head engineer
here can explain.

664
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,885
These are information
sheets of the seven workers—

665
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,554
who were on site at the
guest villas

666
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,055
on the day of the accident.

667
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:25,772
The soon-to-be-married
couple is here.
