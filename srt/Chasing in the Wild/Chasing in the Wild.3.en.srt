1
00:00:10,156 --> 00:00:11,407
Give me your credit card.

2
00:00:11,907 --> 00:00:12,616
But, Dad...

3
00:00:12,617 --> 00:00:14,326
I said, give me
your credit card!

4
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:19,372
Sweetheart,

5
00:00:19,373 --> 00:00:21,332
I’m happy you’re
meeting new friends.

6
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,961
He’s strict because
he cares about you.

7
00:00:24,336 --> 00:00:26,463
It’s small, I remembered.

8
00:00:26,464 --> 00:00:27,922
And two tickets.

9
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:29,966
You’d look pitiful
if you’re alone.

10
00:00:29,967 --> 00:00:32,219
Our school’s not even playing.

11
00:00:33,262 --> 00:00:35,347
I lost a bet, okay?

12
00:00:49,904 --> 00:00:52,197
Elyse, this is Luna,
my best friend.

13
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:54,532
Luna, this is Elyse.
Come on, let’s eat.

14
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:55,785
Do you like me?

15
00:00:56,494 --> 00:00:57,494
Luna.

16
00:00:59,747 --> 00:01:01,457
Oh my gosh!

17
00:01:01,874 --> 00:01:02,875
Shit!

18
00:01:03,209 --> 00:01:05,086
Nice one, stalker!

19
00:02:15,614 --> 00:02:17,408
Nice one, stalker!

20
00:02:20,661 --> 00:02:22,163
<i>What the fuck!</i>

21
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,746
Hey!

22
00:02:23,747 --> 00:02:25,207
Are you okay?

23
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,294
First was a hug.

24
00:02:29,295 --> 00:02:33,424
And now
you’re stalking my socials?

25
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:35,593
Do you like me?

26
00:02:36,594 --> 00:02:39,012
Excuse me, don’t be
too full of yourself.

27
00:02:39,013 --> 00:02:40,597
I’m not stalking you.

28
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:42,224
Then why did you like my post?

29
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:47,062
<i>What should I tell him?
I can’t think of any excuse.</i>

30
00:02:50,065 --> 00:02:51,482
I think my phone got hacked.

31
00:02:51,483 --> 00:02:53,109
- Hack?
- Yes.

32
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,277
Hacked, my ass!

33
00:02:54,278 --> 00:02:56,487
Tell the stalker
to follow my account, then.

34
00:02:56,488 --> 00:02:57,864
I don’t even know who it is.

35
00:02:57,865 --> 00:02:59,617
You know, I think it was Ida.

36
00:03:00,534 --> 00:03:03,078
My account is open on her iPad.

37
00:03:04,872 --> 00:03:07,165
You are such...

38
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:10,835
A great liar.

39
00:03:10,836 --> 00:03:11,836
What the hell?

40
00:03:11,837 --> 00:03:14,798
Why would I even like
a picture of you with your girl?

41
00:03:17,676 --> 00:03:20,304
Then why do you know
which picture was liked?

42
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:25,851
Also, Luna’s not my girl.

43
00:03:31,941 --> 00:03:33,317
The hell I care!

44
00:03:44,745 --> 00:03:46,247
Ida!

45
00:03:53,837 --> 00:03:55,422
What is it this time?

46
00:03:55,756 --> 00:03:58,341
I am dying out of embarrassment.

47
00:03:58,342 --> 00:04:01,344
Like, I just want
the earth to swallow me.

48
00:04:01,345 --> 00:04:03,554
Did you hug Sevi again?

49
00:04:03,555 --> 00:04:05,848
No, much worse.

50
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:08,227
He saw me stalking his socials.

51
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,062
I can’t see him!

52
00:04:11,063 --> 00:04:13,440
I don’t want to go back
to this gym anymore.

53
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:16,192
I should just tell Dad
to open one for me,

54
00:04:16,193 --> 00:04:17,987
and then ban Sevi.

55
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,322
Why do you care so much?

56
00:04:20,823 --> 00:04:22,907
And why are you always
so affected

57
00:04:22,908 --> 00:04:25,077
by your interactions
with Camero?

58
00:04:26,578 --> 00:04:28,497
Right… Right!

59
00:04:29,915 --> 00:04:31,165
You’re right, Ida.

60
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:34,544
Why the hell do I care
about Sevi’s opinions of me?

61
00:04:34,545 --> 00:04:36,087
He’s so full of himself
for thinking

62
00:04:36,088 --> 00:04:37,880
that I have a crush on him.

63
00:04:37,881 --> 00:04:39,882
He could keep on being delusional.

64
00:04:39,883 --> 00:04:43,137
Or you can just stop
ranting about him?

65
00:04:43,846 --> 00:04:44,846
And...

66
00:04:44,847 --> 00:04:47,724
Just continue your workout,
don’t mind him.

67
00:04:47,725 --> 00:04:50,518
Okay. Thank you, Ida.
I love you.

68
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,021
- Bye.
- Okay.

69
00:05:01,113 --> 00:05:02,573
You’re weak today, bro.

70
00:05:03,073 --> 00:05:05,743
The time will come when
I'll be stronger than you.

71
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,288
Hey, Ely! Sevi wants
to have brunch with you.

72
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:13,958
Bro, just ask her.

73
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,501
Don't be shy, you idiot.

74
00:05:15,502 --> 00:05:17,504
Dumbass,
I thought we were going out.

75
00:05:17,671 --> 00:05:19,255
I have plans, sorry.

76
00:05:19,256 --> 00:05:20,883
You moron.

77
00:05:21,425 --> 00:05:23,384
Are you guys whispering?

78
00:05:23,385 --> 00:05:26,430
Because you guys know that
I can actually hear you, right?

79
00:05:27,806 --> 00:05:30,601
Ely, take my friend
with you to eat.

80
00:05:31,185 --> 00:05:33,978
He’s so pitiful when he’s alone.
He gets really lonely, you see.

81
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:35,689
He’s so sad.

82
00:05:36,523 --> 00:05:38,441
You’ve got this. I’ll go ahead.

83
00:05:38,442 --> 00:05:39,860
Enjoy!

84
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:46,909
Where are you heading?

85
00:05:47,993 --> 00:05:50,537
I’m just going to the mall.

86
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,165
<i>Is he asking me
to eat with him or not?</i>

87
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,668
<i>Why does this feel so awkward?</i>

88
00:05:57,461 --> 00:06:01,381
<i>What if I ask him
so I can make it not awkward?</i>

89
00:06:01,382 --> 00:06:04,218
<i>Brunch with a gym mate.
Nothing else.</i>

90
00:06:06,345 --> 00:06:08,806
Well?
You coming?

91
00:06:09,348 --> 00:06:12,518
Wait, let me check my schedule.

92
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:19,733
Okay, I’ll go with you.

93
00:06:25,322 --> 00:06:26,365
Camero...

94
00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:47,136
Roel, this is my friend, Sevi.

95
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:49,930
He’ll ride with us to the mall.

96
00:06:50,514 --> 00:06:51,514
Hi.

97
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:53,392
I’m Sevi.

98
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:11,952
You think Roel would shoot me?

99
00:07:14,788 --> 00:07:15,998
We can’t be too sure.

100
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:20,586
Then I won’t go.

101
00:07:23,172 --> 00:07:24,673
I’m just kidding.

102
00:07:55,245 --> 00:07:56,245
Sevi.

103
00:07:57,338 --> 00:07:58,624
I’ll order now.

104
00:07:58,757 --> 00:07:59,632
Sure.

105
00:08:00,221 --> 00:08:04,545
I'll have one sautéed
matsutake mushroom

106
00:08:04,546 --> 00:08:08,591
omelette and toast.
And then one iced matcha latte.

107
00:08:08,592 --> 00:08:09,593
Okay, ma’am.

108
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,261
What about you?

109
00:08:24,354 --> 00:08:25,981
I’m actually still full.

110
00:08:26,777 --> 00:08:28,570
Our food is delicious, sir.

111
00:08:39,498 --> 00:08:42,084
Okay.
He’ll have the same order.

112
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:43,502
Okay, ma’am.

113
00:08:51,635 --> 00:08:53,053
Do you like Harry Potter?

114
00:08:53,804 --> 00:08:59,351
Is that why your username
is Sevirous? Because of Snape?

115
00:09:01,061 --> 00:09:02,061
Yes.

116
00:09:02,145 --> 00:09:04,730
My friends started
calling me that because

117
00:09:04,731 --> 00:09:08,694
they say I get so serious when
I’m reading Harry Potter.

118
00:09:09,861 --> 00:09:12,113
- Corny, right?
- Really?

119
00:09:12,114 --> 00:09:14,865
Or is it just because
you’re like Snape?

120
00:09:14,866 --> 00:09:15,866
Huh?

121
00:09:15,993 --> 00:09:17,451
Do I look like him?

122
00:09:17,452 --> 00:09:19,537
No. I mean,

123
00:09:19,538 --> 00:09:22,039
you are also in love with a girl

124
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,875
who doesn’t love you back.

125
00:09:24,585 --> 00:09:25,586
Right?

126
00:09:27,212 --> 00:09:29,381
It’s okay, I feel you.

127
00:09:30,257 --> 00:09:33,885
I also liked someone
who didn’t love me back.

128
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:43,186
Why didn’t he like you?

129
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,189
Apparently, he only saw me
as a little sister.

130
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:50,651
And he’s also best friends
with my brother.

131
00:09:50,652 --> 00:09:52,778
And he is in love
with another girl.

132
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:53,905
But it’s fine.

133
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,952
Poor you.

134
00:10:02,164 --> 00:10:03,373
But...

135
00:10:03,915 --> 00:10:05,500
at least you’ve moved on now.

136
00:10:06,126 --> 00:10:07,460
Why?

137
00:10:07,461 --> 00:10:08,920
‘Cause it’s your turn now?

138
00:10:12,966 --> 00:10:14,801
<i>Why do I feel offended?</i>

139
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,056
You’re not my type anyway.

140
00:10:24,436 --> 00:10:25,729
Well…

141
00:10:26,523 --> 00:10:27,816
You are...

142
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:50,169
So,

143
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:52,167
where do you live, Sevi?

144
00:10:54,091 --> 00:10:55,466
Jeez, Elyse.

145
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:59,137
It’s still too early for us
to meet the family.

146
00:11:01,014 --> 00:11:02,765
You’re so full of it.

147
00:11:02,766 --> 00:11:05,852
I just wanted to know
if you live near the gym.

148
00:11:07,229 --> 00:11:09,063
You should have just said so.

149
00:11:09,064 --> 00:11:12,234
I’m starting to think
that you like me.

150
00:11:13,276 --> 00:11:15,194
So you know how to think.

151
00:11:15,195 --> 00:11:16,195
Jeez.

152
00:11:16,446 --> 00:11:17,864
I’m a bookworm.

153
00:11:18,573 --> 00:11:21,076
I know you’ll end up crying
over that book.

154
00:11:21,576 --> 00:11:22,911
You read the book?

155
00:11:23,745 --> 00:11:24,788
Just kidding.

156
00:11:25,414 --> 00:11:27,123
Luna told me about it.

157
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,729
<i>Luna again…</i>

158
00:11:31,712 --> 00:11:33,130
You guys look good together.

159
00:11:34,798 --> 00:11:36,508
You guys must be close.

160
00:11:37,843 --> 00:11:40,094
Yes, we’re really close.

161
00:11:40,095 --> 00:11:41,637
We’ve been friends

162
00:11:41,638 --> 00:11:43,724
since high school.

163
00:11:44,474 --> 00:11:46,059
<i>Good for you.</i>

164
00:11:54,985 --> 00:11:56,403
Orders complete.

165
00:11:56,862 --> 00:11:59,447
You know what, let’s just eat.
I have some shopping to do.

166
00:11:59,448 --> 00:12:01,158
You can leave right away after.

167
00:12:01,616 --> 00:12:02,616
It’s fine.

168
00:12:02,993 --> 00:12:03,869
I’ll go with you.

169
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,287
I don’t have
anything to do anyway.

170
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,665
Okay, if you insist.

171
00:12:12,627 --> 00:12:14,962
Doesn’t this taste like grass?

172
00:12:14,963 --> 00:12:16,547
Excuse me?

173
00:12:16,548 --> 00:12:18,048
Grass?

174
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:19,425
If you want to
order something else,

175
00:12:19,426 --> 00:12:20,469
we can just do that.

176
00:12:20,886 --> 00:12:22,012
No, it’s okay.

177
00:12:39,571 --> 00:12:40,571
Delicious.

178
00:12:49,565 --> 00:12:51,057
<i>He’s so funny.</i>

179
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,193
Sevi, look!

180
00:12:59,218 --> 00:13:01,801
The limited edition Nola bag
that I was eyeing

181
00:13:01,802 --> 00:13:04,387
is only for 315,000.

182
00:13:04,805 --> 00:13:07,766
And it’s on a 15% off discount.

183
00:13:08,058 --> 00:13:09,684
That’s a steal!

184
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,310
Huh?

185
00:13:12,354 --> 00:13:15,232
Are there diamonds in that bag?
Why is it so expensive?

186
00:13:15,524 --> 00:13:19,903
Actually, that’s pretty cheap
for a limited edition bag.

187
00:13:22,155 --> 00:13:22,989
Wait,

188
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:26,034
but I have a trip with Ida
coming up in Bali.

189
00:13:27,369 --> 00:13:28,827
This bag

190
00:13:29,204 --> 00:13:30,747
or the trip…

191
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:35,126
I hate being an adult.

192
00:13:38,713 --> 00:13:41,550
You can’t stay young forever.

193
00:13:41,758 --> 00:13:44,677
Plus, there’ll come a time
when your parents

194
00:13:44,678 --> 00:13:46,124
will no longer support you.

195
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,327
You need to learn
to stand on your own.

196
00:13:49,724 --> 00:13:53,018
Look, I don’t need
a lecture right now, okay?

197
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:56,356
I’m trying to make
an adult decision here.

198
00:13:58,483 --> 00:14:01,027
I wish my problems
were as simple as that.

199
00:14:01,343 --> 00:14:03,822
Are you trying to belittle
my struggles?

200
00:14:05,237 --> 00:14:06,447
Of course not.

201
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,369
Did you hear
about the storm in Samar?

202
00:14:11,202 --> 00:14:12,203
Really?

203
00:14:13,206 --> 00:14:14,374
There was one?

204
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:16,488
Yes.

205
00:14:18,378 --> 00:14:20,629
There was someone like you,
18 years old.

206
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,048
Their parents passed away

207
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:24,466
and

208
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:29,014
now she's incharge of taking
her two younger siblings.

209
00:14:29,973 --> 00:14:33,267
Just imagine the adult decisions

210
00:14:33,268 --> 00:14:35,478
she’ll have to make
from now on.

211
00:14:37,606 --> 00:14:40,734
Are you trying to guilt trip me
out of buying this bag?

212
00:14:41,474 --> 00:14:42,642
Not really.

213
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:47,364
I'm just saying you're lucky
with the privileges

214
00:14:47,365 --> 00:14:48,574
you have right now.

215
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,701
And

216
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:51,660
that’s a blessing too.

217
00:14:51,661 --> 00:14:54,539
You can help a lot of people
with that privilege.

218
00:14:55,415 --> 00:14:57,167
That’s a lot of money.

219
00:14:58,501 --> 00:15:00,754
But it's your money,

220
00:15:02,047 --> 00:15:05,300
so it's none of my business.
Sorry for rambling. My bad.

221
00:15:12,525 --> 00:15:14,944
But this bag is such a steal!

222
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,057
I’m still going to buy it.

223
00:15:38,415 --> 00:15:39,416
So?

224
00:15:39,793 --> 00:15:41,044
Did you buy it?

225
00:15:50,637 --> 00:15:52,172
I changed my mind.

226
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:54,078
I don’t like it anymore.

227
00:16:05,026 --> 00:16:06,039
<i>Fuck.</i>

228
00:16:06,064 --> 00:16:08,733
<i>I really need to check my privilege.</i>

229
00:16:44,345 --> 00:16:48,224
<i>I have so many
excess shoes and clothes</i>

230
00:16:48,582 --> 00:16:51,400
<i>when other people right now
are in need.</i>

231
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:01,427
Hey, what’s up?

232
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:04,000
- What’s bothering you?
- Uhm, Mom..

233
00:17:06,421 --> 00:17:08,423
Okay, I’m...

234
00:17:11,593 --> 00:17:13,844
I’m actually thinking of

235
00:17:13,845 --> 00:17:16,722
selling my old designer bags and

236
00:17:16,723 --> 00:17:20,726
donating
my old clothes and shoes.

237
00:17:20,727 --> 00:17:23,897
Do you possibly know anyone
who can help me?

238
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:27,107
Yes, of course, I know someone.

239
00:17:27,108 --> 00:17:30,278
Why, dear? Are you raising funds
for a new bag?

240
00:17:31,488 --> 00:17:32,975
No, actually,

241
00:17:33,198 --> 00:17:36,784
I’m donating the proceeds
to typhoon victims.

242
00:17:36,785 --> 00:17:40,037
It’s a waste since I have
a bunch of bags and shoes

243
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:43,624
I’m not using,
just collecting dust.

244
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,836
So, why not put them
to good use, right?

245
00:17:49,631 --> 00:17:51,049
Wow, Elyse.

246
00:17:51,758 --> 00:17:54,551
I’m so proud of you.
That’s a great idea.

247
00:17:54,552 --> 00:17:56,054
What made you decide to do that?

248
00:17:56,304 --> 00:17:57,597
Well…

249
00:17:58,973 --> 00:18:02,684
A friend made me realize that
I have a lot of blessings

250
00:18:02,685 --> 00:18:04,312
and it’s time
to pay them forward.

251
00:18:04,896 --> 00:18:06,898
Plus it feels
really good to help.

252
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,654
You’re growing up so fast.

253
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:14,989
I’m so proud of you.

254
00:18:18,451 --> 00:18:19,618
And by the way,

255
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:22,871
- your brother’s here.
- He is?

256
00:18:22,872 --> 00:18:24,873
Shan, you’re here.

257
00:18:24,874 --> 00:18:26,750
Yes he’s here
and he hasn’t eaten

258
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:29,254
- so I’ll prepare your food.
- Thank you, Auntie.

259
00:18:34,467 --> 00:18:36,426
I heard something about you.

260
00:18:36,427 --> 00:18:37,387
Huh?

261
00:18:37,388 --> 00:18:38,929
About what?

262
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,099
Roel picked you up
in España the other day.

263
00:18:43,518 --> 00:18:44,893
I was just

264
00:18:44,894 --> 00:18:46,354
buying school supplies.

265
00:18:48,731 --> 00:18:50,608
Come sit with me, let’s talk.

266
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:54,737
School supplies in España?

267
00:18:56,197 --> 00:18:58,199
Tell me where exactly?

268
00:18:58,992 --> 00:19:02,996
In… somewhere…
In...

269
00:19:04,581 --> 00:19:07,125
Oh whatever,
why are you being so nosy?

270
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:09,502
No reason, I was just asking.

271
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,296
Anyway,

272
00:19:12,297 --> 00:19:13,631
how’s your love life?

273
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:16,925
Huh? Love life?

274
00:19:16,926 --> 00:19:18,928
As if I have one.

275
00:19:19,637 --> 00:19:20,972
No one’s asking you out?

276
00:19:22,432 --> 00:19:25,392
Or maybe you’re already
interested in someone?

277
00:19:25,393 --> 00:19:27,477
I am not interested in anyone.

278
00:19:27,478 --> 00:19:30,272
Shan, why are you asking
so many questions?

279
00:19:30,273 --> 00:19:31,815
I'm just concerned.

280
00:19:31,816 --> 00:19:33,943
I don’t want you
falling for a jerk.

281
00:19:35,153 --> 00:19:37,572
I’m not interested in anyone.

282
00:19:41,326 --> 00:19:43,243
You have to introduce me
to that guy.

283
00:19:43,244 --> 00:19:44,703
There are too
many jerks in college

284
00:19:44,704 --> 00:19:46,163
that will try to lead you on.

285
00:19:46,164 --> 00:19:47,497
Once they get what they want,

286
00:19:47,498 --> 00:19:49,125
some guys just
vanish out of nowhere.

287
00:19:50,126 --> 00:19:53,170
Wow, Shan!
It’s like you’re an expert.

288
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:55,298
It’s like you’re speaking
from experience.

289
00:19:58,426 --> 00:20:01,638
Well, there is no one
that I am interested in.

290
00:20:02,055 --> 00:20:04,474
So, you have nothing
to worry about.

291
00:20:05,683 --> 00:20:08,186
Okay, if you say so.

292
00:20:08,394 --> 00:20:10,188
Just be careful, okay?

293
00:20:12,815 --> 00:20:13,858
Why are you...

294
00:20:17,278 --> 00:20:19,571
<i>Why is Shan asking me
these questions?</i>

295
00:20:19,572 --> 00:20:22,158
<i>Does he know that I’ve been
hanging out with Sevi?</i>

296
00:20:26,955 --> 00:20:29,831
It’s so nice to come
to school with you guys.

297
00:20:29,832 --> 00:20:31,667
I get to enjoy free stuff.

298
00:20:31,668 --> 00:20:34,212
- Thanks, Ke!
- Wait a minute.

299
00:20:34,712 --> 00:20:36,798
I thought
you didn’t like matcha?

300
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:39,801
You said it tasted like grass.

301
00:20:40,718 --> 00:20:43,679
When I tasted it,
it was actually good.

302
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,810
The question is, who taught him
to drink matcha?

303
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:52,980
You never liked it
when we gave you some.

304
00:20:52,981 --> 00:20:54,648
Right?

305
00:20:54,649 --> 00:20:56,525
Fuck, it’s because
of a girl, isn’t it?

306
00:20:56,526 --> 00:20:57,726
You got yourself a girlfriend?

307
00:20:58,069 --> 00:20:58,820
No.

308
00:20:58,821 --> 00:21:00,404
- A girlfriend—
- You have a girlfriend...

309
00:21:00,405 --> 00:21:03,115
- You’re seeing someone?
- No.

310
00:21:03,116 --> 00:21:05,409
Well, I’ll just keep
my mouth shut.

311
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,493
Wait, who is it?

312
00:21:06,494 --> 00:21:08,704
Is it that girl you spoke with
after your game?

313
00:21:08,705 --> 00:21:11,207
- Yes!
- That girl, after his game.

314
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,458
- Correct!
- He froze!

315
00:21:13,459 --> 00:21:15,211
He’s not answering,
so it’s true!

316
00:21:15,962 --> 00:21:17,963
How can I answer while drinking?

317
00:21:17,964 --> 00:21:19,589
Why are you stuttering now?

318
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,466
Just use your brain,
let’s go already!

319
00:21:21,467 --> 00:21:25,555
- You could have just—
- Just tell us already!

320
00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:27,390
Come on!

321
00:21:27,615 --> 00:21:29,517
Where’s your ID, Camero?

322
00:21:34,605 --> 00:21:36,231
Sorry, sir. I forgot it.

323
00:21:36,232 --> 00:21:37,984
No ID, no entry.

324
00:21:38,651 --> 00:21:40,610
Come on, sir. Just for today.

325
00:21:40,611 --> 00:21:43,238
I thought you always had
your ID inside your bag?

326
00:21:43,239 --> 00:21:44,907
Why don’t you have it today?

327
00:21:47,702 --> 00:21:52,957
We don’t have to like each other
to eat together.

328
00:21:54,917 --> 00:21:57,210
Please, sir.
We’re friends, aren’t we?

329
00:21:57,211 --> 00:21:59,881
Please let him in, sir.
He has an upcoming quiz today.

330
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,968
I promise to win
the championship for the school.

331
00:22:04,969 --> 00:22:07,221
Just let me in today, please.

332
00:22:08,139 --> 00:22:09,806
All right, come in.

333
00:22:09,807 --> 00:22:11,642
Just don’t forget it next time.

334
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,310
Thanks, sir.

335
00:22:14,228 --> 00:22:16,731
Damn it, I need to get my ID
from Elyse.

336
00:22:18,358 --> 00:22:19,358
Elyse?

337
00:22:22,236 --> 00:22:24,112
Yes, it’s Elyse…

338
00:22:24,113 --> 00:22:26,199
- Elyse…
- You know Elyse?

339
00:22:26,699 --> 00:22:28,599
- Elyse.
- Elyse.

340
00:22:28,624 --> 00:22:29,435
Who is she again?

341
00:22:31,913 --> 00:22:32,913
How about you?

342
00:22:32,914 --> 00:22:35,874
I’m gonna have —
Just going to wait for a cab.

343
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:40,302
- Take care.
- Yes, don’t worry.

344
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:43,038
<i>@sevirous:
I was late to class earlier.</i>

345
00:22:44,936 --> 00:22:46,341
<i>@elydezma:
And so?</i>

346
00:22:48,721 --> 00:22:50,932
<i>@sevirous:
Guess why.</i>

347
00:22:52,475 --> 00:22:55,186
<i>@elydezma:
Just say it.</i>

348
00:22:57,605 --> 00:23:00,983
<i>@sevirous: I wonder who has
my ID? They didn’t give it back.</i>

349
00:23:04,112 --> 00:23:06,197
Okay, bye.

350
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:20,710
Hey, Ely.

351
00:23:20,711 --> 00:23:23,506
- Why do you have Camero’s ID?
- Camero?

352
00:23:25,675 --> 00:23:27,134
I just found it.

353
00:23:27,135 --> 00:23:29,761
- She said she just found it.
- Elyse,

354
00:23:29,762 --> 00:23:32,347
we’re Arrows, not Panthers.

355
00:23:32,348 --> 00:23:34,391
In our next game,

356
00:23:34,392 --> 00:23:36,436
she’ll be sitting on the
other side of the court.

357
00:23:37,562 --> 00:23:40,814
Guys, stop.
I told you I just found it.

358
00:23:40,815 --> 00:23:42,899
So that’s why my friend said

359
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,570
that they saw you
in España last time.

360
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:48,655
Busted!

361
00:23:48,656 --> 00:23:51,199
I’m sure that was someone else.

362
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,162
No wonder you don’t eat with us

363
00:23:55,163 --> 00:23:58,666
after training anymore,
you’ve been seeing someone else.

364
00:24:00,585 --> 00:24:02,753
Please stop teasing me.

365
00:24:08,092 --> 00:24:10,011
She’s no longer a baby.

366
00:24:15,933 --> 00:24:17,642
I have to go now.

367
00:24:17,643 --> 00:24:19,562
- All right, then.
- Bye-bye!

368
00:24:19,729 --> 00:24:21,939
She walked out ‘cause
you guys kept teasing her.

369
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:29,029
<i>@elydezma: Sorry about your ID!
I’ll return it to you.</i>

370
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,490
<i>Can I go to your school?</i>

371
00:24:31,491 --> 00:24:36,078
<i>I’m done with
classes and training.</i>

372
00:24:42,001 --> 00:24:48,591
<i>@sevirous: Sure, we’re almost
done with practice too. See you!</i>

373
00:24:50,092 --> 00:24:51,552
<i>@sevirous:
Take care!</i>

374
00:24:59,018 --> 00:25:00,018
Ma’am...

375
00:25:00,019 --> 00:25:02,188
Roel, let’s go to
España again, please.

376
00:25:02,772 --> 00:25:04,148
España, Ma’am?

377
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:08,777
I just need to pick something up
from the hospital,

378
00:25:08,778 --> 00:25:11,905
Lab results. You can just wait
for me at the parking lot.

379
00:25:11,906 --> 00:25:13,699
It won’t take too long,
I promise.

380
00:25:21,415 --> 00:25:22,624
Okay guys.

381
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:24,209
Good practice today.

382
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:27,922
But we need to improve
on defense.

383
00:25:28,339 --> 00:25:30,382
And we need to work
on our hustle because

384
00:25:30,383 --> 00:25:33,636
the next team we’ll face is
really good at breaking defenses.

385
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,057
Also, I mean...

386
00:25:38,975 --> 00:25:41,810
We also...

387
00:25:41,811 --> 00:25:44,105
And for the offense,
I’ll need the help of...

388
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:46,064
Mike.

389
00:25:50,444 --> 00:25:51,444
Santos?

390
00:25:51,445 --> 00:25:52,446
Santos.

391
00:25:53,114 --> 00:25:55,032
I meant Santos.

392
00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:56,741
We get it, Captain.

393
00:25:56,742 --> 00:25:58,244
We’ll just do our best.

394
00:25:58,911 --> 00:26:00,788
So, just call the person
you’re waiting for.

395
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:06,543
Yes, who are you kidding anyway?

396
00:26:06,544 --> 00:26:08,296
Just go already, Captain.

397
00:26:08,671 --> 00:26:10,255
- You can go.
- No need to be shy.

398
00:26:10,256 --> 00:26:11,256
She’s waiting, right?

399
00:26:11,257 --> 00:26:12,841
This is it, Camero,
your life isn’t all about

400
00:26:12,842 --> 00:26:13,842
basketball anymore.

401
00:26:15,553 --> 00:26:18,097
He got himself a girl.
Lucky you.

402
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,975
Bastards!

403
00:26:21,892 --> 00:26:24,520
Go already.

404
00:26:25,938 --> 00:26:27,440
<i>@elydezma:
I’m here.</i>

405
00:26:28,691 --> 00:26:30,026
There it is.

406
00:26:43,331 --> 00:26:45,999
Are you intentionally
leaving stuff with me?

407
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,117
Because this is the second time
that I’m returning your things.

408
00:26:49,142 --> 00:26:51,812
I’ll start thinking that this is
just your excuse to see me.

409
00:26:53,132 --> 00:26:54,967
But you still come to see me.

410
00:26:56,719 --> 00:27:00,890
<i>Right, Ely. Why do you
always go to him?</i>

411
00:27:02,266 --> 00:27:03,893
Well, I just pity you.

412
00:27:06,437 --> 00:27:08,773
You might not be able to enter
your school tomorrow.

413
00:27:10,816 --> 00:27:13,527
So, you’re concerned?

414
00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:16,697
Hey, Camero!

415
00:27:17,323 --> 00:27:19,991
So that’s what’s going on.

416
00:27:19,992 --> 00:27:21,826
Let’s go, we don’t want
to bother them.

417
00:27:21,827 --> 00:27:23,996
Lucky you,
having someone to pick you up.

418
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,874
Bastards!
Just go home already.

419
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:31,545
<i>Oh no. I don’t want us to be
the talk of the town!</i>

420
00:27:33,422 --> 00:27:34,548
Have you eaten?

421
00:27:35,508 --> 00:27:38,094
- Not yet.
- Come on then, I’ll treat you.

422
00:27:38,928 --> 00:27:41,429
You don’t get to say no.

423
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,556
You came here to España
all the way from Taft

424
00:27:43,557 --> 00:27:44,934
just to give me my ID?

425
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:47,269
You can’t go home hungry.

426
00:27:47,812 --> 00:27:52,817
<i>Why can’t I say no to him?
What the fuck is wrong with me?</i>

427
00:27:55,653 --> 00:27:56,654
Let’s go?

428
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,241
Okay.

429
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,168
Thank you.

430
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,547
This is a nice cafe.

431
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:23,556
Yes, it’s my friends’
favorite spot.

432
00:28:30,422 --> 00:28:32,507
Is that a church?

433
00:28:34,235 --> 00:28:35,236
Yes.

434
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:37,008
Noval church.

435
00:28:37,366 --> 00:28:39,094
I really like its design.

436
00:28:43,951 --> 00:28:47,496
You probably told yourself that
you’ll be marrying Luna there.

437
00:28:49,956 --> 00:28:51,624
I’m just assuming.

438
00:28:51,781 --> 00:28:53,032
Assuming what?

439
00:28:53,711 --> 00:28:55,254
That you like her.

440
00:28:55,963 --> 00:28:58,340
Or that you love her?

441
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,654
What’s funny?

442
00:29:05,681 --> 00:29:06,891
Nothing.

443
00:29:09,894 --> 00:29:11,181
But

444
00:29:11,328 --> 00:29:13,121
I did like Luna before.

445
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,150
And now?

446
00:29:17,026 --> 00:29:19,904
I said before.
So, not anymore.

447
00:29:22,823 --> 00:29:24,366
I don’t believe you.

448
00:29:26,702 --> 00:29:29,245
Why do you keep asking
about Luna?

449
00:29:29,246 --> 00:29:31,123
You’re the one
with me right now.

450
00:29:32,082 --> 00:29:33,250
Do you have a crush on me?

451
00:29:34,668 --> 00:29:37,546
Hell, no. Excuse me.

452
00:29:41,342 --> 00:29:42,593
You’re so cute.

453
00:29:50,009 --> 00:29:51,886
You have a crush on me now, huh?

454
00:29:57,483 --> 00:29:58,651
Maybe.

455
00:30:08,256 --> 00:30:10,258
This is delicious.
It’s my favorite.

456
00:30:10,788 --> 00:30:12,350
My favorite dish in this cafe.

457
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:15,417
Here you go.

458
00:30:19,088 --> 00:30:20,256
It’s healthy.

459
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,683
<i>To be fair, he’s caring.</i>

460
00:30:37,314 --> 00:30:39,233
I love you, Camero.

461
00:30:44,738 --> 00:30:45,948
It’s right there.

462
00:30:52,673 --> 00:30:54,957
I thought you were
confessing to me.

463
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:56,667
As if!

464
00:31:00,963 --> 00:31:04,215
Sevi, you’re my MVP.

465
00:31:04,216 --> 00:31:07,595
Heart, heart, heart.
Marry me, Captain.

466
00:31:08,053 --> 00:31:10,138
Go ahead and keep reading.

467
00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:12,098
I’ll think that
it’s coming from you.

468
00:31:12,099 --> 00:31:15,435
Yuck! So, that’s why
you brought me here,

469
00:31:15,436 --> 00:31:18,146
just to flex that
you have a lot of admirers.

470
00:31:18,147 --> 00:31:19,856
I don’t have to bring you here

471
00:31:19,857 --> 00:31:21,733
to let you know
that I have a lot.

472
00:31:21,734 --> 00:31:24,403
So, what’s it like having
a lot of love confessions?

473
00:31:28,198 --> 00:31:29,908
They’re all just talk anyway.

474
00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:32,072
What, you want them
to confront you?

475
00:31:33,954 --> 00:31:34,955
Maybe.

476
00:31:35,956 --> 00:31:37,248
It’s a shame.

477
00:31:37,249 --> 00:31:39,626
It’s my last year
as an engineering student,

478
00:31:39,627 --> 00:31:42,504
and I still
don’t have a girlfriend.

479
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:48,135
You probably want an
engineering girlfriend, right?

480
00:31:50,931 --> 00:31:52,349
I can go for a cheerleader.

481
00:32:01,815 --> 00:32:02,815
Here,

482
00:32:03,142 --> 00:32:05,735
I know
you don’t like service water.

483
00:32:05,736 --> 00:32:07,655
Don’t worry,
I haven’t drunk from that yet.

484
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,011
Good.

485
00:32:10,036 --> 00:32:11,577
I’m a bit sensitive.

486
00:32:11,602 --> 00:32:12,603
Sensitive?

487
00:32:14,286 --> 00:32:15,996
Sensitive to
other people’s saliva.

488
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,289
You’re really something,
aren’t you?

489
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:20,249
Seriously, you could die

490
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,794
but you’d still be picky.

491
00:32:30,219 --> 00:32:32,179
Have you tried <i>sago’t gulaman?</i>

492
00:32:32,596 --> 00:32:35,224
I know a good place.
It’s close by.

493
00:32:36,225 --> 00:32:37,685
<i>Sago’t gulaman?</i>

494
00:32:38,227 --> 00:32:39,645
I haven’t tried that.

495
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:44,108
Wait, is <i>sago </i>like tapioca?
Right?

496
00:32:45,693 --> 00:32:49,113
Yes and <i>gulaman </i>is grass jelly.

497
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,995
Well?

498
00:32:56,662 --> 00:33:02,501
<i>Well, I’m cutting down desserts
for training but…</i>

499
00:33:03,711 --> 00:33:06,213
Okay, sure.

500
00:33:10,384 --> 00:33:12,720
<i>Today can be my cheat day.</i>

501
00:33:13,512 --> 00:33:14,721
Here.

502
00:33:14,722 --> 00:33:16,682
Try this, it’s good.

503
00:33:35,325 --> 00:33:38,661
AEL, you’re so out of my reach.

504
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:44,368
<i>Huh? Is that for me?
Those are my initials.</i>

505
00:33:45,061 --> 00:33:46,563
<i>I’m hard to reach?</i>

506
00:33:47,353 --> 00:33:49,146
Have you seen this?

507
00:33:51,341 --> 00:33:54,678
I don’t remember
seeing this earlier.

508
00:33:55,971 --> 00:33:58,265
Come on. Let’s go.

509
00:34:00,142 --> 00:34:01,351
Okay.

510
00:34:11,445 --> 00:34:12,570
Luna?

511
00:34:12,571 --> 00:34:14,113
<i>Luna again…</i>

512
00:34:14,114 --> 00:34:15,866
Yes, I have your folder.

513
00:34:17,451 --> 00:34:18,952
You need it now?

514
00:34:21,121 --> 00:34:22,623
Okay, I’ll be there.

515
00:34:27,795 --> 00:34:29,004
Elyse,

516
00:34:29,755 --> 00:34:31,799
is it okay if we go
see Luna first?

517
00:34:32,299 --> 00:34:34,259
I have her folder

518
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:36,242
and she needs it now.

519
00:34:36,267 --> 00:34:37,517
I promise, it won’t take long.

520
00:34:37,596 --> 00:34:40,557
We can go after.

521
00:34:42,017 --> 00:34:44,686
I think Roel’s waiting for me.

522
00:34:47,898 --> 00:34:49,358
Okay, how about this…

523
00:34:49,983 --> 00:34:51,317
Let’s just buy

524
00:34:51,318 --> 00:34:53,654
and then I’ll go bring
the folder to Luna.

525
00:34:54,571 --> 00:34:57,574
<i>So, he’s still going to see her?</i>

526
00:34:58,659 --> 00:35:01,995
<i>Elyse, stop being childish.</i>

527
00:35:05,373 --> 00:35:06,457
Okay.

528
00:35:07,042 --> 00:35:09,002
Let’s go see Luna.

529
00:35:10,379 --> 00:35:11,964
I promise, I’ll be quick.

530
00:35:12,756 --> 00:35:13,924
Let’s go.

531
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,560
Jeez.

532
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,313
Give me a minute.

533
00:35:33,152 --> 00:35:36,237
- Hi!
- Sev, where is it?

534
00:35:36,238 --> 00:35:37,238
Here.

535
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:39,074
Give it.
Thank you.

536
00:35:39,366 --> 00:35:40,700
I’m so glad you got it,

537
00:35:40,701 --> 00:35:43,287
or else I would have
forgotten it in the cafeteria.

538
00:35:44,288 --> 00:35:47,331
Maybe get some sleep
so you don't forget stuff.

539
00:35:47,332 --> 00:35:49,041
You’re already low
on brain cells,

540
00:35:49,042 --> 00:35:50,334
you wouldn’t want to lose more.

541
00:35:50,335 --> 00:35:52,963
My brain cells? Well, fuck you.

542
00:35:53,297 --> 00:35:55,090
- Ouch!
- One more.

543
00:35:55,716 --> 00:35:56,716
One more!

544
00:35:57,426 --> 00:35:58,926
- It’s no use.
- I still have one more.

545
00:35:58,927 --> 00:36:00,595
- You can try.
- It moves, see.

546
00:36:00,596 --> 00:36:01,847
This is pretty fast.

547
00:36:03,682 --> 00:36:05,433
Well, I still have another.

548
00:36:05,434 --> 00:36:08,978
<i>Wow, they’re even holding hands.</i>

549
00:36:08,979 --> 00:36:12,691
<i>And really?
Right in front of me?</i>

550
00:36:13,025 --> 00:36:14,443
Try and reach it! I have more!

551
00:36:16,862 --> 00:36:18,571
One more time.

552
00:36:18,572 --> 00:36:20,448
- So annoying.
- I told you.

553
00:36:20,449 --> 00:36:22,116
You can only do one that’s why
you need to work out more.

554
00:36:22,117 --> 00:36:23,202
Work out?

555
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,412
- Wait a minute.
- I’ll smack you...

556
00:36:25,662 --> 00:36:27,079
Say hi to Elyse first.

557
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,248
Huh?

558
00:36:29,249 --> 00:36:30,751
Elyse? Where?

559
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:35,214
Where is she?

560
00:36:37,674 --> 00:36:40,009
Oh no, she might have
gotten jealous.

561
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,011
Go after her.

562
00:36:41,345 --> 00:36:42,346
Huh?

563
00:36:42,846 --> 00:36:45,014
Why would she get jealous?

564
00:36:45,015 --> 00:36:46,433
She’s not into me.

565
00:36:48,477 --> 00:36:49,603
Really now?

566
00:36:52,606 --> 00:36:54,650
Fine, I’ll go ahead.

567
00:36:55,025 --> 00:36:56,735
Go get some sleep,
you look like a zombie.

568
00:36:57,903 --> 00:36:59,154
Fuck you!

569
00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:10,456
<i>I really can’t understand him.</i>

570
00:37:10,457 --> 00:37:12,459
<i>Does he like me?</i>

571
00:37:13,126 --> 00:37:15,629
<i>Or he hasn’t moved on yet
from Luna?</i>

572
00:37:17,464 --> 00:37:18,966
<i>Do I like him?</i>

573
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,679
<i>Of course, I don’t.
Duh! Who is he?</i>

574
00:37:26,598 --> 00:37:31,186
<i>But then again,
why do I feel hurt?</i>

575
00:37:38,151 --> 00:37:39,735
- Yes, Ida?
- Girl!

576
00:37:39,736 --> 00:37:41,737
<i>One of our classmates saw
you and Sevi</i>

577
00:37:41,738 --> 00:37:43,447
<i>together at the mall.
And everyone thinks</i>

578
00:37:43,448 --> 00:37:44,866
<i>you’re dating already!</i>

579
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:48,682
Oh no. Oh my god!

580
00:37:48,707 --> 00:37:52,961
Who saw us? What do you mean,
like our blockmates?

581
00:37:54,584 --> 00:37:55,585
Wait.

582
00:37:57,713 --> 00:37:59,171
What if my Dad finds out?

583
00:37:59,172 --> 00:38:00,673
He’s going to be really mad.

584
00:38:00,674 --> 00:38:03,134
He will definitely ground me.

585
00:38:03,135 --> 00:38:06,429
Or worse, he’s gonna make me
quit the cheer squad.

586
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:09,515
<i>Don’t worry. I told them
you two are just friends.</i>

587
00:38:09,516 --> 00:38:12,685
<i>And I made some lame excuses
for why you were together.</i>

588
00:38:12,686 --> 00:38:14,813
<i>They seemed to buy it.</i>

589
00:38:15,397 --> 00:38:19,234
Okay. Okay, thank you Ida.
You’re my savior!

590
00:38:19,568 --> 00:38:22,070
<i>But Elyse, tell me honestly...</i>

591
00:38:22,612 --> 00:38:25,448
<i>What’s the real deal
between the two of you?</i>

592
00:38:25,449 --> 00:38:27,491
<i>And if you really like Camero</i>

593
00:38:27,492 --> 00:38:31,163
<i>and you think he’s worth
the risk, I’ll support you.</i>

594
00:38:40,047 --> 00:38:41,882
Me and Sevi…

595
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,302
we’re just hanging out.

596
00:38:46,094 --> 00:38:48,138
There’s nothing going on
between us.

597
00:38:50,432 --> 00:38:53,893
Besides, I think I should
distance myself.

598
00:38:53,894 --> 00:38:56,605
I don’t want any gossip
flying around.

599
00:38:59,524 --> 00:39:01,068
Also,

600
00:39:02,611 --> 00:39:04,738
I think he’s into someone else.

601
00:39:06,198 --> 00:39:09,868
<i>Really? But how about you?
Do you like him?</i>

602
00:39:11,613 --> 00:39:13,541
<i>Do I like Sevi?</i>

603
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:15,540
Shan!

604
00:39:18,251 --> 00:39:21,045
Ida, I think
I’ll have to call you back.

605
00:39:21,046 --> 00:39:22,672
I’ll call you back, okay?

606
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:29,012
You good for nothing,
piece of shit!

607
00:39:33,308 --> 00:39:35,560
Shan, what happened?

608
00:39:37,854 --> 00:39:39,648
Did he do this to you?

609
00:39:42,525 --> 00:39:44,820
I’m okay.
Don’t worry about me.

610
00:39:47,389 --> 00:39:48,585
I better go.

611
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,033
Take care of yourself.

612
00:39:57,874 --> 00:39:59,333
Did you hurt him?

613
00:39:59,334 --> 00:40:00,918
Why would you do that?

614
00:40:00,919 --> 00:40:02,796
Stay out of this mess.

615
00:40:03,296 --> 00:40:04,673
It’s none of your business.

616
00:40:05,066 --> 00:40:06,650
Why are you still awake?

617
00:40:06,675 --> 00:40:08,634
You’ve got class tomorrow,
so go to sleep.

618
00:40:08,635 --> 00:40:10,595
You can’t get distracted
from your studies.

619
00:40:28,989 --> 00:40:31,116
You know, bro, if you don’t
step up your game,

620
00:40:31,141 --> 00:40:32,808
I’ll beat your PR.

621
00:40:33,008 --> 00:40:34,635
- You know bro—
- Just a little bit more.

622
00:40:35,912 --> 00:40:37,497
A little bit more.

623
00:40:39,374 --> 00:40:42,335
<i>Remember Elyse,
you have to avoid him.</i>

624
00:40:50,343 --> 00:40:53,721
Elyse, did you get to read
my message?

625
00:40:53,746 --> 00:40:55,306
When are we going to
try <i>Sago’t Gulaman</i>?

626
00:40:56,266 --> 00:40:58,226
You suddenly left last time.

627
00:40:59,936 --> 00:41:01,188
I’m busy.

628
00:41:04,274 --> 00:41:07,651
Are you going to have breakfast
after your workout?

629
00:41:07,652 --> 00:41:08,778
No.

630
00:41:11,612 --> 00:41:12,780
What the hell?

631
00:41:13,942 --> 00:41:15,026
Here.

632
00:41:16,424 --> 00:41:17,592
No, thanks.

633
00:41:31,092 --> 00:41:32,511
Are you mad at me?

634
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:34,551
Did I do something wrong?

635
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:35,691
Huh?

636
00:41:35,716 --> 00:41:36,716
No.

637
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:38,532
I’m not mad at you.

638
00:41:38,975 --> 00:41:40,685
Then, why are you avoiding me?

639
00:41:41,353 --> 00:41:43,104
You can’t even look at me.

640
00:41:46,274 --> 00:41:48,485
I told you, I’m not mad at you.

641
00:42:00,705 --> 00:42:01,957
All right, then.

642
00:42:03,542 --> 00:42:05,573
<i>Can he stop prying?</i>

643
00:42:06,086 --> 00:42:08,448
<i>He’s making it harder for me.</i>

644
00:42:24,187 --> 00:42:26,106
<i>What the hell was I thinking?</i>

645
00:42:26,398 --> 00:42:28,775
<i>Why did I act so cold earlier?</i>

646
00:42:29,442 --> 00:42:33,154
<i>If he did that to me,
I would feel awful, too.</i>

647
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,491
<i>I think I need to apologize.</i>

648
00:42:37,617 --> 00:42:39,326
<i>Look at that face.</i>

649
00:42:39,327 --> 00:42:41,830
<i>I think he’s really upset with me.</i>

650
00:42:42,872 --> 00:42:44,957
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

651
00:42:44,958 --> 00:42:47,002
<i>I’ll apologize.</i>

652
00:42:54,009 --> 00:42:55,468
Hey, Sevi.

653
00:43:00,765 --> 00:43:02,017
Breakfast?

654
00:43:03,977 --> 00:43:04,977
No, thanks.

655
00:43:20,151 --> 00:43:22,903
<i>Did he just reject me?</i>

656
00:43:22,928 --> 00:43:24,763
<i>In front of everyone?</i>

657
00:43:47,395 --> 00:43:48,855
I’ll go to the restroom.

658
00:43:49,564 --> 00:43:50,565
Okay.

659
00:44:01,993 --> 00:44:06,122
<i>I might look like a fool,
but I’m faithful.</i>

660
00:44:14,547 --> 00:44:16,423
<i>Cupid’s arrow hit me so hard.</i>

661
00:44:16,424 --> 00:44:19,386
<i>I’ve been thinking about you
all day, everyday in a row.</i>

662
00:44:41,783 --> 00:44:45,286
<i>AEL, you’re so out of my reach.</i>

663
00:45:05,807 --> 00:45:07,308
Have you seen this?

664
00:45:09,102 --> 00:45:12,605
I don’t remember
seeing this earlier.

665
00:45:46,765 --> 00:45:47,974
Shan!

666
00:45:48,536 --> 00:45:50,177
Well, I just came here
to see you.

667
00:45:50,202 --> 00:45:52,545
Shan, you haven’t
greeted me yet.

668
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:53,737
Happy birthday.

669
00:45:53,762 --> 00:45:55,420
But I hope
it won’t be your last.

670
00:45:55,445 --> 00:45:56,530
Daddy!

671
00:45:57,066 --> 00:45:58,650
- I’m—
- I’m not...

672
00:45:58,651 --> 00:46:00,778
I’m not used to us
being like this.

673
00:46:00,779 --> 00:46:01,404
Awkward.

674
00:46:01,405 --> 00:46:04,031
My dad is really strict.

675
00:46:04,032 --> 00:46:06,492
He doesn’t want me
dating before I graduate.

676
00:46:06,493 --> 00:46:07,494
Thanks.

677
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:11,223
What am I going to do with this?

678
00:46:11,248 --> 00:46:13,750
So there's a reason for me
to see you again.
