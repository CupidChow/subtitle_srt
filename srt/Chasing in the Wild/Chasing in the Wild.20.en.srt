1
00:00:10,898 --> 00:00:12,833
Wait, there are cameras!

2
00:00:12,967 --> 00:00:15,001
Hey, there are cameras.

3
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:16,002
Where's Gab and Hya?

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,347
Yeah, they’re taking too long.

5
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:19,440
Maybe they’re still preparing something.

6
00:00:20,608 --> 00:00:21,675
Maybe they’re-

7
00:00:21,842 --> 00:00:22,842
Hey, stop it!

8
00:00:23,077 --> 00:00:23,544
Hey!

9
00:00:23,545 --> 00:00:24,944
They’re already here–

10
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:27,548
they’re even holding hands.

11
00:00:29,316 --> 00:00:31,552
- Wow!
- So handsome!

12
00:00:33,287 --> 00:00:35,588
What were you guys thinking of?

13
00:00:35,589 --> 00:00:37,825
We just have many things to prepare.

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,029
I know. We’ve been working hard
to give you guys a good series.

15
00:00:42,586 --> 00:00:43,692
And now...

16
00:00:44,932 --> 00:00:51,571
we can show the never-before-seen
exclusive reels of our preparations for

17
00:00:51,572 --> 00:00:53,339
“Chasing in the Wild.”

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,143
So, what are we waiting for?

19
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,013
Let the chase begin!

20
00:01:57,438 --> 00:01:59,807
Wow, we’re in the third book already, guys.

21
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,675
I hope, this time,

22
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:06,279
Sevi would not be mistaken as the
Univerkada girls’ boyfriend anymore.

23
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,483
True. Even this one got jealous of Sevi.

24
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:14,121
Even Hiro thought Sevi was Yanna’s husband.

25
00:02:14,388 --> 00:02:18,859
Yanna too. Elyse mistook
Yanna for Sevi’s girlfriend.

26
00:02:19,693 --> 00:02:23,963
Exactly!
Even Elyse thought Sevi got Yanna pregnant.

27
00:02:23,964 --> 00:02:27,534
So many false assumptions!

28
00:02:27,535 --> 00:02:34,007
Yeah, it’s best to know the true
story first. So that everything’s clear.

29
00:02:34,008 --> 00:02:40,046
So, how were Sevi and Elyse at
the beginning of “Chasing in the Wild”?

30
00:02:40,047 --> 00:02:42,049
Were they broken-hearted?

31
00:02:43,217 --> 00:02:45,052
Ohhh…

32
00:02:45,553 --> 00:02:47,154
What’s the high five for?

33
00:02:48,522 --> 00:02:50,124
Well...

34
00:02:51,091 --> 00:02:56,530
That’s because Kalix and Yanna were chosen.

35
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:04,038
But, Luna and Kalix were separated
during “Chasing in the Wild” (CITW).

36
00:03:04,572 --> 00:03:08,041
But someone even retreated to Nueva Ecija

37
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:13,613
to give way for her
beloved to reach his dreams.

38
00:03:13,614 --> 00:03:14,715
I wonder who it was.

39
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:21,654
Fine, it seems we’re both
broken-hearted during CITW’s timeline.

40
00:03:21,655 --> 00:03:24,592
So, we should high five too!

41
00:03:26,026 --> 00:03:28,028
These two, why were they broken-hearted?

42
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,341
Camero!

43
00:03:40,474 --> 00:03:41,909
From the first two books,

44
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:45,813
we got to know Sevi as a
naughty yet kind and reliable friend.

45
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,850
Sevi, do I look presentable? Is
there dirt on my face? Am I pretty?

46
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:51,418
You look like a zombie.

47
00:03:51,552 --> 00:03:52,552
Huh?

48
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,867
Who’s your favorite uncle, Avi?

49
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:57,690
Uncle Sevi!

50
00:03:57,992 --> 00:03:59,793
He has always been there for them-

51
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,527
to the point that some
even got jealous of him.

52
00:04:01,528 --> 00:04:04,498
He has always been mistaken
as his friends’ boyfriend.

53
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:07,167
Hi Kalix! It’s nice to see you.

54
00:04:07,425 --> 00:04:09,637
This is Sevi, one of my best buddies.

55
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:12,451
Sevi, this is Kalix, my friend.

56
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,889
Hey, bro. Sevi.

57
00:04:19,847 --> 00:04:20,847
You’re Sevi.

58
00:04:30,991 --> 00:04:33,394
Oh, your wife’s mad at you.

59
00:04:34,427 --> 00:04:35,662
Poor Sevi.

60
00:04:36,057 --> 00:04:38,315
#LETSEVIBREATHE

61
00:04:38,705 --> 00:04:41,234
But, it is true that he
had feelings for Luna.

62
00:04:41,235 --> 00:04:43,404
What’s his full name, that Kalix guy?

63
00:04:43,704 --> 00:04:47,174
I don’t even know. We’ve only met twice.

64
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:51,912
But he makes me feel so giddy!

65
00:04:52,046 --> 00:04:53,046
I know.

66
00:04:55,249 --> 00:04:56,449
Unfortunately,

67
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,384
Luna likes someone else.

68
00:04:58,385 --> 00:05:00,387
And, they really look good together.

69
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:03,724
But, Sevi has already moved on.

70
00:05:04,484 --> 00:05:06,952
Luna, I’m happy for you.

71
00:05:07,094 --> 00:05:09,095
So, he is now ready to take a shot at

72
00:05:09,096 --> 00:05:11,965
the new love that will come his way.

73
00:05:16,537 --> 00:05:20,307
Well, let’s say hello to Elyse.

74
00:05:21,261 --> 00:05:23,997
We first met her in “Safe Skies, Archer.”

75
00:05:24,244 --> 00:05:25,778
She’s kind of fussy.

76
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:28,314
But, promise, once you get to know her,

77
00:05:28,315 --> 00:05:30,484
you’ll see how good of a person she is.

78
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:33,853
The younger sister of
Hiro’s best friend, Shan.

79
00:05:33,854 --> 00:05:34,854
How about me?

80
00:05:35,022 --> 00:05:36,302
Don’t worry. I got some for you.

81
00:05:37,281 --> 00:05:38,281
Here.

82
00:05:41,028 --> 00:05:42,148
You’re not allowed to drink.

83
00:05:43,055 --> 00:05:46,066
And, actually, she
had a little crush on Hiro

84
00:05:46,592 --> 00:05:49,228
which made Yanna jealous of Elyse.

85
00:05:50,102 --> 00:05:53,705
But, worry no more, Yanna.
‘Cause Hiro chose you.

86
00:05:54,798 --> 00:05:55,798
Girl,

87
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:58,859
stop it. You can’t hit
on your brother’s friend.

88
00:05:59,406 --> 00:06:01,715
Go find somebody else, someone your age.

89
00:06:02,302 --> 00:06:03,669
I want someone who’s an engineer too.

90
00:06:03,694 --> 00:06:07,930
And for Elyse, maybe there’s a
different engineer you can chase.

91
00:06:12,823 --> 00:06:16,293
I’m excited to know
who Sevi will chase this time. Right, Hya?

92
00:06:16,921 --> 00:06:20,024
Yeah. I am excited for them to meet.

93
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:21,769
And who should they thank for that?

94
00:06:27,674 --> 00:06:29,009
Exactly! Who?

95
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:32,211
Wow, so, is he really in?

96
00:06:32,212 --> 00:06:36,115
Wait, it's already settled, right?

97
00:06:36,116 --> 00:06:37,751
Am I really the one?

98
00:06:38,452 --> 00:06:39,786
We hope so.

99
00:06:39,787 --> 00:06:40,554
Don’t you want it?

100
00:06:40,555 --> 00:06:42,054
Congrats!

101
00:06:42,055 --> 00:06:44,491
Welcome!

102
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:49,797
I remembered last year
when I joined the series.

103
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:52,733
Right!

104
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:54,834
Are you crying?

105
00:06:54,935 --> 00:06:56,215
We don’t even have a Clyden yet.

106
00:06:58,338 --> 00:07:02,009
The question is, who will be
the new ones to make this season more fun?

107
00:07:07,781 --> 00:07:12,119
To play an important role
in the series, Wilbert Ross!

108
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,058
They have been asking
me who will play Arkin.

109
00:07:19,059 --> 00:07:23,429
And, it’s really nice to put a face

110
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,200
on a character we’ve
been anticipating for so long.

111
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:27,634
Let me introduce Kuya Roel.

112
00:07:30,604 --> 00:07:31,604
Ready to drive.

113
00:07:32,573 --> 00:07:34,675
Wait, I need to apologize to her.

114
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:36,509
Sorry.

115
00:07:37,377 --> 00:07:38,377
Told you so!

116
00:07:38,893 --> 00:07:40,481
Because I denied it to her.

117
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:42,282
I already told them.

118
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:42,783
That?

119
00:07:42,784 --> 00:07:44,484
That you said it’s not you.

120
00:07:44,485 --> 00:07:45,519
It’s really not you.

121
00:07:45,652 --> 00:07:46,320
You are Kuya Roel.

122
00:07:46,653 --> 00:07:48,789
I denied that I’m really Kuya Roel.

123
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,158
- We now have a front act for the mall shows.
- Who is he?

124
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,159
Arkin.

125
00:07:54,844 --> 00:07:55,844
Why do you look sad?

126
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,301
- Who is he?
- Arkin.

127
00:08:02,035 --> 00:08:04,004
Are you sure?

128
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:07,941
I can perform at the mall shows.

129
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,845
- So guys...
- Get ready for the pranks.

130
00:08:12,846 --> 00:08:14,915
I’m excited to work with you...

131
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:17,918
Too formal!

132
00:08:20,387 --> 00:08:22,789
Hello, I’m happy to be part of...

133
00:08:24,157 --> 00:08:25,158
What?

134
00:08:25,826 --> 00:08:28,928
- Where?
- There!

135
00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:31,764
Hello, I’m happy to be
part of the Univerkada.

136
00:08:31,765 --> 00:08:33,000
You’re playing me.

137
00:08:34,868 --> 00:08:38,272
I’m really excited to portray Arkin since

138
00:08:38,972 --> 00:08:42,976
I have known the name for a long time.

139
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:44,444
So, finally!

140
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:48,314
I’ll do my best, as much
as possible, to portray Arkin.

141
00:08:48,315 --> 00:08:50,383
When I entered, I saw Wilbert and I said:

142
00:08:50,384 --> 00:08:52,285
“He’s really like Arkin.

143
00:08:52,286 --> 00:08:55,054
It’s how I imagined him.”

144
00:08:55,055 --> 00:08:58,624
Even when he was auditioning
for other roles before,

145
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:02,829
I knew that he would fit Arkin’s role.

146
00:09:02,896 --> 00:09:06,866
I immediately told the production
that we have already found our Arkin,

147
00:09:06,867 --> 00:09:08,335
because he really is the character.

148
00:09:09,036 --> 00:09:14,575
Watch out for me. I’ll play the
best friend of Sevi or Gab Lagman.

149
00:09:15,075 --> 00:09:17,110
Gab and I are close
with each other in real-life.

150
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:22,849
I was so happy and grateful
when I heard he’ll play Arkin.

151
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:27,020
Wilbert is very talented
and easy to work with.

152
00:09:27,688 --> 00:09:32,092
I want to welcome him
officially in the series.

153
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:35,529
It is certain. I am the one.

154
00:09:38,265 --> 00:09:44,471
Hi, everyone! I am very excited to
introduce to you guys someone very special.

155
00:09:44,905 --> 00:09:46,740
My best friend, Ida,

156
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,709
played by Yumi Garcia!

157
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:51,144
Hi, guys!

158
00:09:51,145 --> 00:09:55,110
Yumi seems, to me, very sweet.

159
00:09:55,424 --> 00:09:57,259
And I already liked her energy.

160
00:09:57,284 --> 00:10:00,896
- I was very excited to work with Hya.
- Me too.

161
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:03,632
And when we’re getting
too know each other...

162
00:10:03,657 --> 00:10:06,368
I was like “I’m like that, too!”

163
00:10:06,393 --> 00:10:07,803
We’re similar.

164
00:10:07,828 --> 00:10:08,828
- Five!
- Five!

165
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,230
- Six!
- Six!

166
00:10:11,698 --> 00:10:13,775
One to five only!

167
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,900
Okay, one to five.

168
00:10:14,901 --> 00:10:15,901
Ready! Go!

169
00:10:16,637 --> 00:10:17,637
- Two!
- Two!

170
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,440
We clicked a lot.

171
00:10:26,469 --> 00:10:30,716
Known for his works in “Team A,”
“Hello Universe,” and “Ober Da Bakod,”

172
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:36,423
we have the one and only, Anjo Yllana!
He’s playing the role of Kuya Roel.

173
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:42,896
Many have been anticipating
who will play Kuya Roel.

174
00:10:43,964 --> 00:10:49,236
I hope that I’ll be able to
portray whoever Kuya Roel is.

175
00:10:55,126 --> 00:10:59,279
I am very happy and thankful that
I have become part of the series.

176
00:11:01,448 --> 00:11:02,448
We’re not.

177
00:11:03,183 --> 00:11:04,084
For real.

178
00:11:04,085 --> 00:11:05,318
Just kidding!

179
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,253
I thought…

180
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,055
Of course, we’re also happy!

181
00:11:09,956 --> 00:11:14,360
And, we’re always happy
whenever the Univerkada family gets bigger.

182
00:11:14,361 --> 00:11:14,961
- Right?
- Absolutely!

183
00:11:14,962 --> 00:11:18,532
And now, we’ll be happier
as we have a new director.

184
00:11:18,932 --> 00:11:20,167
Direk Thop, shout out!

185
00:11:26,934 --> 00:11:31,708
I spoke with Direk Ted when
I learned that I will adapt the third book.

186
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,613
I called him and we had a coffee.

187
00:11:34,614 --> 00:11:36,115
We talked about his learnings.

188
00:11:36,116 --> 00:11:39,486
We’re like father-and-son.
Just kidding, Direk!

189
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,790
I am looking forward to how
he’s going to interpret the story.

190
00:11:43,815 --> 00:11:44,858
I know he’s great.

191
00:11:44,859 --> 00:11:47,460
He’s a great filmmaker
so I am very excited about

192
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:48,861
how he will shoot it.

193
00:11:48,862 --> 00:11:50,496
The preparation was intense.

194
00:11:50,497 --> 00:11:53,834
First, I watched “The Rain in España”

195
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:59,981
and “Safe Skies, Archer”
for three straight days.

196
00:12:00,006 --> 00:12:02,575
Both were pleasant to watch
so I finished it immediately.

197
00:12:02,576 --> 00:12:05,090
Then I read the book.

198
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:09,982
I didn’t notice how long it was.
It was very entertaining to read.

199
00:12:09,983 --> 00:12:13,185
Actually, I became more
excited to do it because

200
00:12:13,186 --> 00:12:17,106
I entered the project without expectations.

201
00:12:17,257 --> 00:12:19,825
I was really excited.

202
00:12:19,826 --> 00:12:23,930
Direk and I met for the
first time during the look test.

203
00:12:24,012 --> 00:12:29,902
We talked about what
would fit the character.

204
00:12:29,903 --> 00:12:31,937
So, he always consults with me.

205
00:12:31,938 --> 00:12:35,642
For instance, should this
character wear shorts or leggings?

206
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:40,980
So, I would tell him how
Elyse would usually be.

207
00:12:40,981 --> 00:12:42,782
That’s what we talked about.

208
00:12:42,783 --> 00:12:47,120
Working with Direk has
been going great, so far.

209
00:12:47,598 --> 00:12:50,835
Super chill and supportive.

210
00:12:51,081 --> 00:12:55,184
I’m also grateful when
Gab and I had dinner with

211
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:59,224
Direk to discuss what
works for us as a team,

212
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:06,433
how we could help each other, and how
Direk can help us to work better, as well.

213
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:10,509
I am there to affirm that they are
doing well. I am just guiding them.

214
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:16,753
As much as possible, I give them
freedom to explore their characters.

215
00:13:16,778 --> 00:13:19,952
I love working with Direk Thop
because he’s just like a buddy to us.

216
00:13:19,953 --> 00:13:25,324
And, he’s so good with the shots
and he knows what he wants right away.

217
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:34,410
So, he gives us tips. He also gives us
leeway in adding layers to our characters.

218
00:13:35,368 --> 00:13:39,126
They’re like my buddies
because there are Univerkada

219
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,908
characters who are
similar to my real-life friends.

220
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:45,045
So, when I entered as a newcomer,

221
00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:51,636
I instantly resonated with them
even before meeting them personally.

222
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:56,422
Excited, because of how
good his previous works were.

223
00:13:56,423 --> 00:13:58,491
Of course, I want to learn from him.

224
00:13:58,516 --> 00:14:01,039
Since we’re starting the
shoot, I‘ve heard that he really

225
00:14:01,063 --> 00:14:03,705
is kind and nice, so I can’t
wait to get to know him.

226
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:08,368
I knew about Direk Thop
because of his past works.

227
00:14:08,706 --> 00:14:12,172
This is my first time working with
him. So, I’m nervous yet excited.

228
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:15,208
I’m curious about Direk Thop’s style.

229
00:14:15,508 --> 00:14:22,382
I do expect it to be light and
fun, just like the other times.

230
00:14:22,549 --> 00:14:30,423
If hard times do come, then
I hope he can manage it well.

231
00:14:30,924 --> 00:14:38,565
I’m delighted, and it is nice that
he is willing to let his artists explore.

232
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:43,637
I always cling to the core of the
characters, especially with this book.

233
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:48,174
I always say that this
book has a big heart.

234
00:14:50,076 --> 00:14:52,967
You know, we’re so
lucky that the “University

235
00:14:52,991 --> 00:14:55,882
Series” always gets
such amazing directors.

236
00:14:56,271 --> 00:15:00,453
That’s right! Amazing directors,
amazing mentors, and coaches.

237
00:15:01,421 --> 00:15:04,365
Right? Like the one who taught me
how to be like a flight attendant.

238
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,559
Oh yeah, show us! Do you still remember?

239
00:15:06,976 --> 00:15:07,976
Wait.

240
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:13,766
Ladies and gentlemen, the captain
has turned on the fasten seatbelt sign.

241
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:16,001
If you hadn’t already done so,

242
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:18,904
please stow your carry-on luggage
underneath the seat in front of you,

243
00:15:18,905 --> 00:15:20,674
or in an overhead bin.

244
00:15:24,077 --> 00:15:25,145
That’s my friend!

245
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,238
That’s my friend!

246
00:15:27,747 --> 00:15:28,515
Easy.

247
00:15:28,516 --> 00:15:29,516
What about you, Hya?

248
00:15:29,517 --> 00:15:32,519
Still remember what they
taught you about cheer dancing?

249
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:34,100
Is it like this?

250
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:40,791
Well…

251
00:15:41,978 --> 00:15:42,978
Teach us!

252
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:51,841
First off, we started with some warm-ups.

253
00:15:52,472 --> 00:15:55,008
I had a lot of fun! Then,
we learned three new things:

254
00:15:55,373 --> 00:15:59,711
the sponge, the elevator,
and the spring toss.

255
00:16:00,005 --> 00:16:04,049
It was a bit hard at first. I felt
like when I was put up in the air,

256
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,145
I had a little heart
attack but it was still

257
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:08,655
really fun ‘cause I can
say that I finally did it.

258
00:16:08,982 --> 00:16:14,594
Five, six, seven and one,
two, three, for five… seven

259
00:16:16,863 --> 00:16:22,735
It was a lot of like, flyer moves. It was a
lot of lifting us up, holding our balance…

260
00:16:22,736 --> 00:16:24,169
more body awareness.

261
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:28,107
It makes me so happy because
I feel so excited learning about it

262
00:16:28,108 --> 00:16:32,145
and knowing that I’m doing so good
for my first time learning cheer.

263
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:34,280
I really enjoy it.

264
00:16:35,148 --> 00:16:36,248
My name is Ashanti.

265
00:16:36,249 --> 00:16:40,652
I am one of Elyse’s teammates
from the Green Arrows.

266
00:16:40,653 --> 00:16:44,023
Hi, my name is Aaliyah. I’m
one of Elyse’s teammates.

267
00:16:44,024 --> 00:16:47,126
Hi, everyone! I am Angela
Muji and I am playing as one of

268
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:50,296
Hyacinth’s cheermates from Green Arrows.

269
00:16:50,864 --> 00:16:54,734
Our coaches have been so
supportive, so amazing, genuinely!

270
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:58,638
They’re so patient and understanding.
They really help you work through it.

271
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,175
Whatever works best
for you, they really know

272
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:05,078
it, and I’m really glad
that they’re our coaches.

273
00:17:05,103 --> 00:17:10,349
Hi everyone! My name is Coach Cir and I’m
from the National Cheerleading Championship

274
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,251
and this is the private cheer camp.

275
00:17:12,252 --> 00:17:15,021
So, what we’ll do right now is…

276
00:17:15,745 --> 00:17:20,360
from the elevator, we’ll be attempting
a dismount that’s called the front stall,

277
00:17:20,591 --> 00:17:21,926
okay? So, watch this!

278
00:17:22,346 --> 00:17:24,840
Last! Two three four five six
seven eight. One, three, and five,

279
00:17:24,864 --> 00:17:32,864
seven and high V… Three four
five, seven and one two three

280
00:17:37,946 --> 00:17:39,424
Good job! Nice one!

281
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:40,979
I still can’t believe that I did that!

282
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,217
It’s kind of like a roller coaster.
Like, it’s fun but it’s thrilling.

283
00:17:45,218 --> 00:17:49,456
A little scary at the same time but
you’ll feel so satisfied after doing it.

284
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:53,526
Right now, what we are gonna
do is a full down dismount, okay?

285
00:17:53,793 --> 00:17:59,499
We will start from an elevator and then
the dismount will be the full down, okay?

286
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:01,234
So, watch this.

287
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:02,801
Let’s go, Hya…

288
00:18:03,403 --> 00:18:06,772
Last, two three four five six seven eight.

289
00:18:06,773 --> 00:18:13,479
One, three and five, seven
and one two three, five, seven…

290
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:19,519
One two three, five six seven
and one two three… Alright!

291
00:18:20,126 --> 00:18:21,827
They were very, very supportive,

292
00:18:22,297 --> 00:18:25,758
and they were very helpful
with a lot of the stunts.

293
00:18:25,825 --> 00:18:26,993
They’ve been super patient.

294
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:30,396
Super resilient. They’re
very fit—super strong people.

295
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:31,697
They were just so nice.

296
00:18:31,698 --> 00:18:34,121
Like they’re one of
the reasons why I want

297
00:18:34,145 --> 00:18:36,568
to pursue cheering
because they made it fun.

298
00:18:36,569 --> 00:18:37,937
They didn’t make it stressful.

299
00:18:38,338 --> 00:18:39,571
I’m Coach Evan.

300
00:18:39,572 --> 00:18:42,241
I’m a lifter for the sport of cheerleading

301
00:18:42,242 --> 00:18:46,012
and I’m also a coach for the national
cheerleading championship or the NCC.

302
00:18:46,246 --> 00:18:48,606
For the two days of camps
that we’ve already accomplished,

303
00:18:49,082 --> 00:18:51,790
they’ve already done
so much and that’s really

304
00:18:51,814 --> 00:18:54,521
a good thing, and it’s
a success for everyone.

305
00:18:56,289 --> 00:18:57,289
Go, Hya!

306
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,790
YES!

307
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,980
For Hyacinth, she’s very careful.

308
00:19:01,005 --> 00:19:02,540
She will make sure it’s done right.

309
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:06,499
We can see that there’s this drive
from her to actually do it properly.

310
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:08,168
Five, six, seven, eight

311
00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:10,737
one, two, three, four, five

312
00:19:11,738 --> 00:19:12,738
Good.
And down.

313
00:19:13,106 --> 00:19:13,706
Okay.

314
00:19:13,706 --> 00:19:14,641
For Ashanti,

315
00:19:14,642 --> 00:19:16,152
she has a little bit more
background, so she’s

316
00:19:16,176 --> 00:19:17,653
a little bit more aware
about cheerleading.

317
00:19:17,677 --> 00:19:19,646
She also picks up the skills a lot faster.

318
00:19:19,979 --> 00:19:23,216
She already came with us with
a little background on some cartwheels.

319
00:19:23,516 --> 00:19:29,756
Five. Six. Seven. Eight. One.
Two. Three. Four. Space. NICE!

320
00:19:30,657 --> 00:19:33,058
Aaliyah is the energy of the group.

321
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:37,029
She always pushes to do
more even if it’s not her turn.

322
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:40,400
She’s very focused on her groupmates and
she’s always the one cheering them also.

323
00:19:43,203 --> 00:19:47,340
The whole journey of this
cheer workshop was fun!

324
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,478
It was exciting, it was a
little scary but in the best way.

325
00:19:53,947 --> 00:19:56,415
My whole journey has
been really, really fun.

326
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:59,218
It was one of the best experiences
that I’ve ever encountered,

327
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:01,587
and I’m very, very
thankful that I get to work

328
00:20:01,588 --> 00:20:05,825
with such competent and
very professional cheerleaders.

329
00:20:05,992 --> 00:20:07,859
Oh my god. It’s a roller coaster, honestly.

330
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,367
I mean, it started out
great, it’s ending great, and

331
00:20:10,391 --> 00:20:12,898
as well as the physical
side where I push my body’s–

332
00:20:12,899 --> 00:20:15,401
my body to limits that I
never thought I could reach.

333
00:20:15,535 --> 00:20:20,372
It’s been a ride ‘cause I only had two
sessions and I was catching up with them.

334
00:20:20,373 --> 00:20:21,740
It was really hard for me

335
00:20:21,741 --> 00:20:25,877
because they already knew how to do the
stunts and everything and I was a latecomer,

336
00:20:25,878 --> 00:20:28,581
but I had enjoyed so much!

337
00:20:29,082 --> 00:20:31,316
I feel stronger with myself.

338
00:20:31,317 --> 00:20:36,256
It’s even helped me feel
more like I could trust myself.

339
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:42,028
It’s helped me to realize how
much I’m really capable of also.

340
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:45,878
I learned a lot and I feel
like I’ve improved a lot also.

341
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,572
It’s really promising.
Honestly if we continue to train

342
00:20:53,573 --> 00:20:58,144
I’m pretty sure they’ll get to a
very good level of cheerleader.

343
00:20:58,778 --> 00:21:05,385
To Hyacinth, Aly, and Ash and
Angela, good luck in your scenes!

344
00:21:05,685 --> 00:21:09,822
I’m sure you guys will represent
the cheerleading community well

345
00:21:10,056 --> 00:21:13,251
and you will showcase the
skills that you’ve learned with us.

346
00:21:13,426 --> 00:21:17,485
Don’t worry, we’ll be there with
you all the way to support you guys.

347
00:21:17,964 --> 00:21:18,964
Good luck!

348
00:21:28,908 --> 00:21:35,481
Five, six, seven and
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven

349
00:21:35,682 --> 00:21:36,882
- Seven?
- Is this even right?

350
00:21:36,983 --> 00:21:38,143
I thought it was like that?!

351
00:21:38,317 --> 00:21:40,019
Yeah, I think it’s this.

352
00:21:40,997 --> 00:21:43,088
I don’t think so, though. It’s
not right. How do we do this?

353
00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:47,092
No, guys. Okay, okay. The
timing– The timing’s like this, okay?

354
00:21:47,093 --> 00:21:48,093
Ready?

355
00:21:48,495 --> 00:21:51,192
Okay. Five, six, seven, eight.

356
00:21:51,597 --> 00:21:56,135
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

357
00:21:56,278 --> 00:21:58,670
Oh, there’s a forward
move! There’s a forward.

358
00:21:58,671 --> 00:21:59,439
Yeah, there’s a forward.

359
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:00,373
How do you do the eight again?

360
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:00,840
Well...

361
00:22:01,274 --> 00:22:02,108
Okay, so…

362
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:04,410
Like, five, six, seven…

363
00:22:05,745 --> 00:22:06,579
Okay, okay, okay.

364
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,980
‘Cause when we’re, like, at
eight, you go to the other side.

365
00:22:09,449 --> 00:22:10,683
Gab says he’s gonna do it.

366
00:22:11,284 --> 00:22:12,952
Let’s see, let’s see.

367
00:22:13,286 --> 00:22:13,720
One –

368
00:22:14,153 --> 00:22:15,855
You ready? Okay.

369
00:22:16,589 --> 00:22:18,391
Five, six, seven, eight

370
00:22:18,658 --> 00:22:22,628
one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

371
00:22:23,363 --> 00:22:25,431
Again, again, again!

372
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,434
So it’s one.

373
00:22:29,001 --> 00:22:30,761
Straight, straight.
Make your arms straight.

374
00:22:30,903 --> 00:22:32,904
Three… Like this.

375
00:22:32,905 --> 00:22:33,905
Bro started to pray!

376
00:22:36,175 --> 00:22:36,476
Four.

377
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:37,143
Four.

378
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,210
Four, sorry…

379
00:22:38,478 --> 00:22:39,478
and then five

380
00:22:39,545 --> 00:22:40,545
Five

381
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:42,361
Round your back.

382
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,550
Round your back.

383
00:22:47,086 --> 00:22:48,086
He arched his back.

384
00:22:48,321 --> 00:22:53,259
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven –

385
00:22:55,094 --> 00:22:55,962
That’s easy.

386
00:22:55,987 --> 00:22:56,987
Camero!

387
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,866
Do we really have to
be perfect all the time?

388
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:01,134
How about you?

389
00:23:01,401 --> 00:23:03,336
Did you even train for basketball?

390
00:23:04,137 --> 00:23:08,975
He never stops training though. Right?
Ball is life for you, man.

391
00:23:10,343 --> 00:23:12,044
Show us some of your moves.

392
00:23:15,915 --> 00:23:16,915
Post me up.

393
00:23:25,525 --> 00:23:27,226
Yeah, I do train…

394
00:23:27,727 --> 00:23:30,862
almost everyday actually
‘cause I love playing basketball.

395
00:23:30,863 --> 00:23:33,471
If I have free time, I
always play basketball

396
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,401
with my friends, and our
condo also has a court.

397
00:23:36,402 --> 00:23:39,405
So, I usually do it after gym.

398
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,935
And then, I also play for leagues.

399
00:23:56,923 --> 00:23:58,124
It’s my first love actually.

400
00:24:02,328 --> 00:24:04,263
I’ve been playing since I was a kid.

401
00:24:04,397 --> 00:24:08,468
In high school, I played
until JV basketball in the US.

402
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,508
Basketball’s the thing I’m
most looking forward to doing.

403
00:24:16,509 --> 00:24:20,580
Super excited ‘cause we’re
shooting in a real arena.

404
00:24:26,385 --> 00:24:29,755
I’m really excited to do the
basketball scenes. I can’t wait!

405
00:24:35,595 --> 00:24:38,764
Wow! How to be Gab Lagman?!

406
00:24:39,298 --> 00:24:42,435
How to be Gab? How to be Hya? That’s easy!

407
00:24:51,244 --> 00:24:52,912
I love you.

408
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:55,547
Oh, Krissha I love you!

409
00:24:55,548 --> 00:24:57,984
We’re gonna sing.. JK

410
00:24:59,452 --> 00:25:01,854
I just want peace in this world.

411
00:25:02,355 --> 00:25:05,291
What? Wh– I’m– Sorry?

412
00:25:05,658 --> 00:25:06,658
Uhm.

413
00:25:07,093 --> 00:25:08,261
I didn’t… I’m so lost.

414
00:25:09,553 --> 00:25:11,388
Hey! What’s up?

415
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:13,137
How are you?

416
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:15,501
Hi, Kuya… You’re here

417
00:25:15,935 --> 00:25:17,970
Nice seeing you, Bea.

418
00:25:18,013 --> 00:25:19,013
Hey!

419
00:25:19,777 --> 00:25:20,812
How are you?

420
00:25:21,274 --> 00:25:22,475
It’s good to see you…

421
00:25:23,109 --> 00:25:24,610
Oh my god, my heart.

422
00:25:25,256 --> 00:25:26,891
Ah, I can’t breathe.

423
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,527
You!

424
00:25:29,081 --> 00:25:30,815
(inaudible)

425
00:25:30,816 --> 00:25:31,551
What?!

426
00:25:31,552 --> 00:25:34,754
Oh, really? Oh no…

427
00:25:39,525 --> 00:25:40,860
Yo, bro!

428
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,763
What’s up? How are you?! I missed you.

429
00:25:46,933 --> 00:25:49,653
He’s like that. His hands always–
a bit more and he’s gonna Hadouken!

430
00:25:49,802 --> 00:25:51,270
He’s always checking his hair…

431
00:25:52,271 --> 00:25:54,040
He just suddenly smirks like–

432
00:25:56,709 --> 00:25:57,176
Camero!

433
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:58,610
Camero!

434
00:26:02,615 --> 00:26:02,815
Bruh

435
00:26:02,949 --> 00:26:03,115
Bruh

436
00:26:03,449 --> 00:26:03,616
Bruh

437
00:26:03,883 --> 00:26:04,150
Bruh

438
00:26:04,684 --> 00:26:05,451
‘Sup, Bruh!?

439
00:26:05,451 --> 00:26:06,451
Like that.

440
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,120
I don’t know if I should
be laughing or what.

441
00:26:09,855 --> 00:26:11,223
But they were so good though!

442
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:13,626
You know it’s not easy to…

443
00:26:14,226 --> 00:26:15,962
you know, imitate the character.

444
00:26:16,195 --> 00:26:17,195
It really isn’t.

445
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,931
Right! You need so much preparation

446
00:26:19,932 --> 00:26:22,735
to get into character and
to have that chemistry.

447
00:26:23,436 --> 00:26:24,436
Right?

448
00:26:25,037 --> 00:26:26,037
It’s pretty easy.

449
00:26:26,238 --> 00:26:27,238
Easy?

450
00:26:27,373 --> 00:26:28,373
How easy?

451
00:26:28,874 --> 00:26:29,874
It was okay…

452
00:26:31,243 --> 00:26:32,111
like you.

453
00:26:32,112 --> 00:26:33,813
Agree, agree! Like this.

454
00:26:36,431 --> 00:26:37,932
Alright, alright. That’s enough!

455
00:26:38,551 --> 00:26:39,551
That’s enough!

456
00:26:47,593 --> 00:26:51,163
We did a look test for
Sevi, Elyse, and Arkin

457
00:26:51,831 --> 00:26:57,103
in their wardrobe for both past and present
to see what they would look like on camera,

458
00:26:57,503 --> 00:27:00,606
and to see if the style looks good too.

459
00:27:00,773 --> 00:27:04,810
Seeing the characters, Gab
and Hya as Sevi and Elyse,

460
00:27:05,311 --> 00:27:08,948
I can already feel that they
can portray the role well.

461
00:27:09,215 --> 00:27:14,186
It fills me with joy to see
them become the characters.

462
00:27:14,887 --> 00:27:19,825
This is one of our favorite things
to do when we make the series.

463
00:27:20,326 --> 00:27:24,430
Because we start to see how
the artists embody the characters.

464
00:27:24,797 --> 00:27:26,866
Their chemistry is really surprising.

465
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:30,002
Even without lines, we can
already feel their chemistry.

466
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:31,784
They’re very refreshing…

467
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:34,116
Very different from the first two books.

468
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,128
So, we’re looking forward
to how we translate the story

469
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,411
from very innocent
to mature characters.

470
00:27:43,549 --> 00:27:45,851
We can’t wait to start this thing!

471
00:27:46,185 --> 00:27:50,823
During the look test we–
I first tried the uniform.

472
00:27:51,057 --> 00:27:56,262
Then I tried Sevi’s past look.

473
00:27:57,496 --> 00:27:59,598
We also did the present…

474
00:28:00,266 --> 00:28:02,668
as an engineer.

475
00:28:03,293 --> 00:28:06,096
I felt more connected to Elyse,

476
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:13,112
and with Sevi as well seeing us
together in our character forms.

477
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:15,754
Gwy being there was also really nice.

478
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:18,450
I haven’t seen her in a while.

479
00:28:18,451 --> 00:28:20,920
I was very happy she was
able to make it that day.

480
00:28:21,107 --> 00:28:24,255
I remember she looked at us
and she was like “It’s perfect”

481
00:28:24,256 --> 00:28:28,761
and I just felt a rush of like… So happy!

482
00:28:29,061 --> 00:28:31,797
It was fun! It was really
fun trying different looks,

483
00:28:32,598 --> 00:28:34,633
different hairstyles, different outfits…

484
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:38,070
It was like Sevi and Elyse
jumped straight out of the books.

485
00:28:38,571 --> 00:28:42,408
The heart of this show is the
relationship between the two.

486
00:28:42,608 --> 00:28:45,745
It’s not gonna work if the
relationship isn’t genuine.

487
00:28:46,078 --> 00:28:47,813
That’s what the audience will relate to.

488
00:28:48,047 --> 00:28:50,215
I learned so much in today’s workshop.

489
00:28:50,216 --> 00:28:53,586
Thank you Ms. Ana… and of
course, I also learned a lot from Hya.

490
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:56,622
We started pretty light.

491
00:28:56,889 --> 00:29:00,658
Of course, we first got to know
each other – share about ourselves,

492
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:06,632
about our past relationships
– so we could be more open.

493
00:29:06,866 --> 00:29:11,604
I definitely learned a lot about
myself. Even about Gab, as well.

494
00:29:11,771 --> 00:29:15,174
Their relationship work was really great.

495
00:29:15,674 --> 00:29:20,679
It was really great, they both
bloomed from the workshop.

496
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:25,050
I know there’s a lot that we
can use to learn from each other.

497
00:29:25,351 --> 00:29:28,287
We processed things step-by-step.

498
00:29:28,454 --> 00:29:31,556
Gab being an athlete was pretty helpful.

499
00:29:31,557 --> 00:29:37,896
They’re used to feedbacks, they’re
used to falling, and getting back up…

500
00:29:37,897 --> 00:29:42,934
Hyacinth has a very soft heart
but there’s beauty in her vulnerability

501
00:29:42,935 --> 00:29:47,540
and I really do hope she keeps
on developing that kind of vulnerability.

502
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,840
Overall,

503
00:29:49,308 --> 00:29:50,308
it was really good.

504
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,310
Learned a lot.

505
00:29:52,945 --> 00:29:54,213
Exercised a lot…

506
00:29:54,847 --> 00:29:57,216
and I’m looking forward
to taking what I learned.

507
00:29:57,716 --> 00:30:00,052
I am super duper, duper, duper excited.

508
00:30:00,553 --> 00:30:01,753
We’ve been waiting for this...

509
00:30:02,121 --> 00:30:05,356
for a long time and I’m
excited to work with Hya.

510
00:30:05,357 --> 00:30:06,992
And I’m excited to work with everyone.

511
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,260
Very thankful to Ms. Ana.

512
00:30:09,261 --> 00:30:10,763
She’s such a great teacher.

513
00:30:11,263 --> 00:30:12,264
Very cool…

514
00:30:12,865 --> 00:30:14,200
she really knows her stuff.

515
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,925
They’re gonna keep working
on it all throughout this and

516
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:21,473
hopefully they’re gonna see
the result of their hard work.

517
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:23,008
We’re here together again.

518
00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:25,310
And we are having fun.

519
00:30:25,311 --> 00:30:28,914
Me and Hya work as a team
and I’m always there for her.

520
00:30:32,151 --> 00:30:36,322
I just want you to know that I
see you and I see your effort

521
00:30:36,422 --> 00:30:39,124
and I’m so proud of you,
and at the same time,

522
00:30:39,592 --> 00:30:43,696
you’ve been such a great
partner to me on this project.

523
00:30:44,763 --> 00:30:47,399
She told me this is overwhelming
for her but she’s been

524
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,901
doing really good

525
00:30:49,201 --> 00:30:50,201
and

526
00:30:50,236 --> 00:30:51,236
I’m proud of her.

527
00:30:54,807 --> 00:30:56,575
No matter what. No matter what happens,

528
00:30:56,709 --> 00:30:59,111
I am here. We will help
each other through this.

529
00:30:59,712 --> 00:31:01,080
What I’m gonna say to her is just,

530
00:31:01,313 --> 00:31:02,633
I’m always gonna be here for you.

531
00:31:04,383 --> 00:31:06,552
Truly, you always reassure me that

532
00:31:07,086 --> 00:31:10,154
we are a team and I feel
that from you and I thank you,

533
00:31:10,155 --> 00:31:12,491
and just know that I’m
also always here for you too.

534
00:31:18,898 --> 00:31:20,199
We’ve got this together.

535
00:31:20,566 --> 00:31:24,936
I feel very secure that I’m
working with you on this project.

536
00:31:24,937 --> 00:31:28,540
So I really don’t feel that I
have anything to worry about.

537
00:31:32,411 --> 00:31:34,079
Wow, my gosh! That was too cute!

538
00:31:35,281 --> 00:31:36,615
How lovely!

539
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:41,120
You know, I like the sound of that.
That’s why I like having you guys here.

540
00:31:42,087 --> 00:31:45,591
I wish it’s always like
this. All of us together.

541
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:47,426
But aren’t we always together?

542
00:31:50,796 --> 00:31:51,063
Gab,

543
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,365
Are you guys hiding something?

544
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,499
Yeah, that’s suspicious.

545
00:31:54,865 --> 00:31:57,801
Hya meant all of us, Gab.

546
00:31:58,197 --> 00:31:59,757
You guys are always in your own world.

547
00:32:00,444 --> 00:32:04,376
But isn’t that what the
fans are excited about?

548
00:32:04,401 --> 00:32:06,170
All of us in the Univerkada, together.

549
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,912
How would you know?

550
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:10,683
I was also a fan but I’m
a part of this now, right?

551
00:32:11,684 --> 00:32:13,319
You’re one of us now!

552
00:32:20,225 --> 00:32:21,225
For real!

553
00:32:21,493 --> 00:32:24,595
Hang out with the Univerkada

554
00:32:24,596 --> 00:32:27,333
so we can all have a greater time.

555
00:32:33,005 --> 00:32:33,639
Hello, everyone!

556
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,109
Today, we’re playing a game
that Sevi would surely kill at.

557
00:32:38,077 --> 00:32:40,579
Boo!

558
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,816
Boo!

559
00:32:44,183 --> 00:32:47,152
We will be shooting
these pencils in the jar.

560
00:32:47,353 --> 00:32:50,255
The person who scores
will be granted any request.

561
00:32:50,556 --> 00:32:51,523
What’s your request?

562
00:32:51,524 --> 00:32:53,559
Alright, what about…

563
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:55,361
we’ll all go on a hike.

564
00:32:55,995 --> 00:32:58,230
Don’t fail us. You can do it!

565
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,600
It’s too far, right?

566
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,740
It’s okay.

567
00:33:09,641 --> 00:33:10,842
We’ll have a reunion.

568
00:33:10,843 --> 00:33:14,279
The Univerkada cast will all
go out after this photoshoot.

569
00:33:18,217 --> 00:33:19,217
So close.

570
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,920
Bummer.

571
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:24,789
We’re all going home.

572
00:33:25,157 --> 00:33:27,592
My request is that all of us go on a hike.

573
00:33:27,593 --> 00:33:29,061
He really wants to do it.

574
00:33:30,562 --> 00:33:31,562
Almost!

575
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:37,301
My request is for all of them to treat me.

576
00:33:37,302 --> 00:33:39,571
You guys will all pay for my dinner!

577
00:33:47,146 --> 00:33:48,146
Fine then!

578
00:33:48,614 --> 00:33:49,774
Everyone will also treat me!

579
00:33:55,721 --> 00:33:58,090
Almost. We almost had to treat you.

580
00:33:59,024 --> 00:34:00,059
That’s so close though!

581
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,230
No one’s scored yet.

582
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:07,899
If I get this,

583
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:09,133
we’re all going later.

584
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:18,577
Throw it better!

585
00:34:28,587 --> 00:34:31,390
If I shoot this, I’ll work out tomorrow.

586
00:34:33,425 --> 00:34:34,626
Of course, I’ll miss it.

587
00:34:37,496 --> 00:34:38,576
You’re doing it on purpose.

588
00:34:42,968 --> 00:34:43,368
Bummer.

589
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:46,538
If I do this, their dinner will be on Gab.

590
00:34:55,047 --> 00:34:57,007
If this goes in, Book 6
will come out next year.

591
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,952
- A– sorry, sorry, sorry…
- Hey! We haven’t even–

592
00:35:00,886 --> 00:35:05,290
Okay fine, if I shoot this, Bea and Wilbert
are coming later and Gab’s paying.

593
00:35:05,958 --> 00:35:07,158
I have a good feeling about –

594
00:35:09,061 --> 00:35:10,061
Your turn!

595
00:35:10,629 --> 00:35:13,232
My wish is, to shoot this.

596
00:35:22,007 --> 00:35:25,777
If I do this, we’re all going later.

597
00:35:31,116 --> 00:35:32,116
It’s going in!

598
00:35:33,852 --> 00:35:34,920
Someone jinxed it!

599
00:35:35,521 --> 00:35:36,521
You just messed it up.

600
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:45,464
You better shoot it. It’s so
close. The pressure’s on you.

601
00:35:47,799 --> 00:35:49,535
Oh no! I want you guys to come!

602
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,588
Ah, there’s more!
This is a lost cause.

603
00:36:13,492 --> 00:36:14,893
Then we’re canceling tonight!

604
00:36:16,428 --> 00:36:18,964
If this goes in, everyone’s
watching Chasing in the Wild.

605
00:36:19,064 --> 00:36:20,098
Three, Two, One…

606
00:36:27,806 --> 00:36:30,209
Very excited, I’m getting impatient.

607
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:32,144
This family’s growing.

608
00:36:32,211 --> 00:36:36,023
It’s been a while since
we all got together like this.

609
00:36:36,048 --> 00:36:38,584
You get to see how other people grow.

610
00:36:38,609 --> 00:36:40,651
I’m so happy that we can
all be with each other again.

611
00:36:40,652 --> 00:36:42,386
We’ve been waiting for so long.

612
00:36:42,387 --> 00:36:45,156
Finally! It’s starting and I can’t wait.

613
00:36:45,157 --> 00:36:48,365
We’re together again, joking around.

614
00:36:48,531 --> 00:36:50,841
Everyone just connects to each other.

615
00:36:51,061 --> 00:36:53,831
No one’s going ahead
or getting left behind.

616
00:36:53,832 --> 00:36:54,800
Excited for them.

617
00:36:54,801 --> 00:36:58,336
Of course, I’m also excited for
the supporters of the university series

618
00:36:58,337 --> 00:37:01,706
that’s been here since The Rain in España.

619
00:37:01,707 --> 00:37:06,111
I’m really happy we started taping again
and hopefully we get to bond more.

620
00:37:06,217 --> 00:37:08,179
Now that we’re all working together again,

621
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,249
honestly, it makes me happy!

622
00:37:10,522 --> 00:37:13,024
I love everyone, they’re
like a family to me.

623
00:37:14,334 --> 00:37:15,621
Everyone’s excited!

624
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,928
Are you?

625
00:37:16,953 --> 00:37:18,129
How about another cheer?!

626
00:37:21,693 --> 00:37:26,364
Thank you to everyone who joined
us here in “Let the Chase Begin”

627
00:37:26,365 --> 00:37:33,338
And I hope you all enjoyed seeing all our
preparations to give you guys a good show.

628
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:39,711
Just a little more and
Chasing in the Wild will be out!

629
00:37:44,773 --> 00:37:46,344
One more cheer, one more cheer!
