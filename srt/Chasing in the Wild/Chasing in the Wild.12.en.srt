1
00:00:12,742 --> 00:00:14,118
Who the fuck are you?

2
00:00:14,285 --> 00:00:16,120
Elyse, this is Sevi,
my best friend.

3
00:00:16,287 --> 00:00:17,496
Yeah, I don’t care.

4
00:00:17,705 --> 00:00:19,915
Kids these days
have such an attitude.

5
00:00:20,082 --> 00:00:21,875
I’m not a kid anymore.

6
00:00:21,876 --> 00:00:23,335
Cured beef with
fried rice and egg?

7
00:00:23,711 --> 00:00:25,921
It’s good. Come on,
I’ll treat you.

8
00:00:27,965 --> 00:00:28,883
Is it good?

9
00:00:28,884 --> 00:00:30,509
Do you have an
extra Panthers shirt?

10
00:00:33,054 --> 00:00:34,138
How’s your love life?

11
00:00:34,472 --> 00:00:36,057
As if I have one.

12
00:00:36,182 --> 00:00:37,223
You got yourself a girlfriend?

13
00:00:37,224 --> 00:00:38,100
Breakfast?

14
00:00:38,225 --> 00:00:39,225
No.

15
00:00:39,393 --> 00:00:40,553
Let’s just put this behind us.

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,520
Good luck.

17
00:00:42,897 --> 00:00:44,065
Do you like me?

18
00:00:44,356 --> 00:00:45,357
I like you.

19
00:00:46,358 --> 00:00:47,358
Ely!

20
00:00:47,485 --> 00:00:48,778
How’s your foot?

21
00:00:50,571 --> 00:00:51,739
Can I court you?

22
00:00:52,073 --> 00:00:54,533
Let’s go, Captain!

23
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:58,036
I like you, Sevi.

24
00:00:58,037 --> 00:00:59,121
So, are we a couple now?

25
00:00:59,413 --> 00:01:01,540
You’re lucky with each other.

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,546
Have you ever tried kissing?

27
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:13,968
This is Elyse.
My girlfriend.

28
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:15,428
I’ll celebrate

29
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:17,347
every milestone with you.

30
00:01:17,348 --> 00:01:19,140
We’re homeowners now.

31
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:20,308
Are you an intern?

32
00:01:20,309 --> 00:01:21,893
I’m finally an engineer, love!

33
00:01:21,894 --> 00:01:24,855
It’s our third anniversary.

34
00:01:25,106 --> 00:01:27,399
My focus is on saving up

35
00:01:27,775 --> 00:01:28,942
for our condo.

36
00:01:28,943 --> 00:01:30,443
Whatever Mama’s problem is

37
00:01:30,444 --> 00:01:32,153
and whatever happened
that made her resign,

38
00:01:32,154 --> 00:01:33,196
let’s stay out of it.

39
00:01:33,197 --> 00:01:35,074
Everything will be okay.

40
00:01:37,868 --> 00:01:39,244
We need to take a break.

41
00:01:39,245 --> 00:01:41,037
And I also don’t want us

42
00:01:41,038 --> 00:01:42,581
to break up again.

43
00:01:45,543 --> 00:01:46,543
Blood?

44
00:01:47,336 --> 00:01:48,379
What blood?

45
00:01:49,088 --> 00:01:50,256
Alfred!

46
00:01:53,384 --> 00:01:55,177
Elyse!
Elyse, you’re mom!

47
00:01:55,636 --> 00:01:56,636
Mommy…

48
00:01:57,596 --> 00:01:59,639
No, she’s not!
She can’t be!

49
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,224
She’s not dead!

50
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:02,517
Don’t fucking touch her!

51
00:02:02,518 --> 00:02:04,037
- Shan, wait—
- Don’t you dare touch her!

52
00:02:04,061 --> 00:02:05,604
If you want to break up,

53
00:02:07,064 --> 00:02:08,773
you do it.

54
00:02:08,774 --> 00:02:11,152
Sebastian Vincent Camero…

55
00:02:14,697 --> 00:02:15,697
I am...

56
00:02:16,157 --> 00:02:18,242
I am breaking up with you.

57
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,288
Before I go...

58
00:02:24,582 --> 00:02:26,959
can we at least
greet each other,

59
00:02:27,334 --> 00:02:28,544
one last time?

60
00:02:33,966 --> 00:02:37,553
Happy fifth anniversary, Sevi.

61
00:03:56,382 --> 00:03:58,341
Did you know that
the Ledezma Group has over

62
00:03:58,342 --> 00:04:02,513
50 luxury resorts and hotels
across 12 destinations?

63
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,180
We’re actually about to open

64
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:06,849
our 10th high-end resort
here in the Philippines.

65
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,185
And of course,
this would not be possible

66
00:04:09,186 --> 00:04:11,563
without the hard work
of our executives.

67
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:14,432
And that is Miss Elyse Ledezma.

68
00:04:14,457 --> 00:04:16,651
The CEO of our company.

69
00:04:16,652 --> 00:04:20,176
She’s pretty young and has only
been CEO for four months.

70
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:23,032
But, she has achieved
so much already.

71
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:25,286
But then again,
let me just warn you...

72
00:04:25,494 --> 00:04:27,537
Don’t get on her nerves, because

73
00:04:27,538 --> 00:04:30,040
when she gets angry, you’ll
definitely taste her wrath.

74
00:04:30,207 --> 00:04:31,749
No, I’m serious.

75
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,835
Ma'am Elyse can be really
intense when she’s mad.

76
00:04:33,836 --> 00:04:36,671
But still, she’s the best boss
I’ve ever worked with.

77
00:04:36,672 --> 00:04:39,090
Since Ma'am Elyse became CEO,

78
00:04:39,091 --> 00:04:42,427
the work conditions here
have really improved.

79
00:04:42,428 --> 00:04:43,636
The toxic bosses are gone,

80
00:04:43,637 --> 00:04:45,930
and there’s way
less office politics.

81
00:04:45,931 --> 00:04:48,349
Before she stepped in,
they used to bug us

82
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,767
about work even on our days off,

83
00:04:49,768 --> 00:04:51,208
but now, that doesn’t
happen anymore.

84
00:04:52,146 --> 00:04:53,604
Yes, that’s right.

85
00:04:53,605 --> 00:04:56,858
Miss Elyse values her
employees’ personal time.

86
00:04:56,859 --> 00:04:58,359
As much as possible,

87
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,778
no one is allowed to bother
anyone on our days off.

88
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:02,489
That’s one of our top rules.

89
00:05:02,906 --> 00:05:05,492
And if you look her up,

90
00:05:05,743 --> 00:05:08,536
you’ll see that she’s
been through so much

91
00:05:08,537 --> 00:05:09,954
at such a young age,

92
00:05:09,955 --> 00:05:12,583
which is why
she’s such a fighter.

93
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:57,335
Miss Ledezma, good morning.

94
00:05:57,336 --> 00:05:59,505
Welcome back from your
business trip in the U.S.

95
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:01,005
Thank you.

96
00:06:02,007 --> 00:06:03,591
These are our new hires, ma’am.

97
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:04,301
Good morning.

98
00:06:04,302 --> 00:06:05,552
Hi, good morning.

99
00:06:06,178 --> 00:06:09,181
If you may excuse us, we’ll just
proceed with the tour.

100
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:10,432
Sure.

101
00:06:10,432 --> 00:06:11,432
Let’s go, guys.

102
00:06:15,896 --> 00:06:17,147
Good morning, Miss Ledezma.

103
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,982
Good morning, Meryl.

104
00:06:28,617 --> 00:06:30,244
It’s good to be back.

105
00:06:32,955 --> 00:06:33,955
By the way...

106
00:06:33,956 --> 00:06:36,625
What is my schedule
for today, Alice?

107
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,626
Miss Elyse,
you have a meeting later

108
00:06:38,627 --> 00:06:41,380
for the new luxury resort
in Batangas.

109
00:06:42,965 --> 00:06:44,966
Yes! Project Aruga.

110
00:06:44,967 --> 00:06:47,218
Well, since I am back in Manila,

111
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:49,429
I will be more hands-on
with this project.

112
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,264
It is a flagship project

113
00:06:51,265 --> 00:06:53,851
so it needs to be
opening by next summer.

114
00:06:55,144 --> 00:06:58,522
Can you please give me
a quick background

115
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:00,440
report of this project?

116
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:02,109
Of course, Miss Ledezma.

117
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:05,404
So, design and construction
is with VGC.

118
00:07:09,489 --> 00:07:11,490
VGC? As in,

119
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:12,641
Valeria Group?

120
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,750
Where are the files?

121
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:20,001
Here.

122
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:31,274
Engr. Sebastian Vincent Camero
Head Engineer

123
00:07:33,765 --> 00:07:35,058
The what?

124
00:07:41,356 --> 00:07:42,357
Oh my god!

125
00:07:48,071 --> 00:07:49,865
Am I going to see him later?

126
00:07:50,431 --> 00:07:52,034
Is he going to be
in the meeting?

127
00:07:53,076 --> 00:07:54,869
Wait, of course he will!

128
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,081
He’s the head engineer
of the project, right?

129
00:07:58,707 --> 00:07:59,958
He has to be there!

130
00:08:03,712 --> 00:08:05,379
He can’t see me like this.

131
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,590
What should I wear?

132
00:08:07,132 --> 00:08:08,383
I’m sorry, ma’am?

133
00:08:12,362 --> 00:08:13,530
Alice...

134
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:15,692
I need your help.

135
00:09:01,311 --> 00:09:03,062
Good morning, Miss Ledezma.

136
00:09:03,063 --> 00:09:04,647
Good morning, Miss Ledezma.

137
00:09:04,648 --> 00:09:06,149
- Thank you, Alice.
- You’re welcome.

138
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:08,380
Please take your seats.

139
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,506
You look different today.

140
00:09:15,117 --> 00:09:16,451
You look really good.

141
00:09:17,786 --> 00:09:18,786
I know.

142
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,125
Good morning.

143
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:25,126
Let’s start.

144
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:26,003
Hi, ma’am.

145
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:27,920
I’m Darling.

146
00:09:27,921 --> 00:09:30,215
- The project manager for—
- Wait.

147
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:32,049
He’s not here?

148
00:09:34,678 --> 00:09:36,263
Aren’t we missing someone?

149
00:09:37,264 --> 00:09:40,434
Ma’am, Engineer Camero
canceled two hours ago.

150
00:09:42,728 --> 00:09:43,728
Canceled?

151
00:09:44,354 --> 00:09:45,354
And

152
00:09:46,148 --> 00:09:47,441
for what reason?

153
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:49,943
He just needed to attend
an important meeting.

154
00:09:50,986 --> 00:09:53,446
He sent another engineer,
Engineer Lavin,

155
00:09:53,447 --> 00:09:55,282
to replace him just for today.

156
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,576
What the fuck?

157
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:01,580
I dressed up for this moment,
and he’s not here?

158
00:10:01,955 --> 00:10:03,832
Did he do this on purpose?

159
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:06,334
And...

160
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:10,212
this is an important
and scheduled

161
00:10:10,213 --> 00:10:12,173
meeting as well, is it not?

162
00:10:12,174 --> 00:10:14,009
Yes, Miss Ledezma.

163
00:10:15,385 --> 00:10:16,970
So, why then?

164
00:10:17,721 --> 00:10:19,350
Everyone is here,

165
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:22,128
but the head engineer isn’t?

166
00:10:30,106 --> 00:10:31,692
Tell him to attend,

167
00:10:31,693 --> 00:10:33,570
or else I will
cancel this project.

168
00:10:34,738 --> 00:10:35,738
Yes, ma’am.

169
00:10:35,739 --> 00:10:36,907
Please excuse me.

170
00:10:41,286 --> 00:10:43,871
And for those of you
who still don’t know...

171
00:10:43,872 --> 00:10:45,915
I will be taking
a more active role

172
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,085
in Project Aruga starting today.

173
00:10:49,878 --> 00:10:52,546
We have been experiencing
delays in construction

174
00:10:52,547 --> 00:10:54,758
and we need to
fast-track this project.

175
00:10:55,217 --> 00:10:57,511
Construction should have
started months ago.

176
00:10:58,011 --> 00:10:59,762
With regards to the matter,

177
00:10:59,763 --> 00:11:02,683
we have reasons for
the delays, Miss Ledezma.

178
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:05,559
We are still waiting
for permits and approvals

179
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,562
for some parts of the hotel.

180
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:10,232
You mean the casino?

181
00:11:12,025 --> 00:11:13,401
Well, we should
discuss that again

182
00:11:13,402 --> 00:11:15,654
because that wasn’t part
of the original plan.

183
00:11:16,446 --> 00:11:18,030
But like what you said,

184
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:20,325
we have to fast-track
the construction.

185
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:22,493
We have no more time

186
00:11:22,494 --> 00:11:23,828
to make a big change.

187
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:25,955
Well, if the casino

188
00:11:25,956 --> 00:11:28,125
is just a last-minute addition,

189
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:30,960
then I think that we can easily

190
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:32,838
return to the original plan.

191
00:11:33,755 --> 00:11:34,755
Right?

192
00:11:41,596 --> 00:11:43,598
Miss Ledezma,
I’m sorry to interrupt.

193
00:11:44,015 --> 00:11:46,517
Engineer Camero said
that he will be here

194
00:11:46,518 --> 00:11:48,436
but he’ll be late
for a few minutes.

195
00:11:48,437 --> 00:11:49,938
But he will be coming.

196
00:11:51,606 --> 00:11:54,025
He also said we can start
the meeting without him.

197
00:11:56,903 --> 00:11:57,903
Okay.

198
00:11:58,488 --> 00:11:59,488
Proceed.

199
00:12:07,904 --> 00:12:09,196
As you can see,

200
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:12,349
the casino is the
most significant addition

201
00:12:12,502 --> 00:12:14,629
to Aruga Resort’s amenities.

202
00:12:15,046 --> 00:12:17,965
Our engineers worked
closely with architects

203
00:12:17,966 --> 00:12:22,053
and contractors to streamline
the design and the timeline.

204
00:12:36,902 --> 00:12:38,278
Good morning, everyone.

205
00:12:38,528 --> 00:12:39,988
Sorry for being late.

206
00:12:50,248 --> 00:12:52,250
You’re late, Engineer Camero.

207
00:12:53,502 --> 00:12:55,253
My apologies, Miss Ledezma.

208
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,260
Okay...

209
00:13:03,804 --> 00:13:05,764
Can you take over
the presentation?

210
00:13:06,598 --> 00:13:08,557
I think it would be better

211
00:13:08,558 --> 00:13:11,561
if the report came
from you directly.

212
00:13:12,103 --> 00:13:13,479
Sure, Miss Ledezma.

213
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,023
- I’ll take over here.
- Okay.

214
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,220
As our project manager
was discussing,

215
00:13:23,245 --> 00:13:25,205
we added the casino last minute

216
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,316
at the request of the board,
headed by Mr. Anthony Guerrero.

217
00:13:29,538 --> 00:13:30,996
And of course, we made some

218
00:13:30,997 --> 00:13:33,041
adjustments to
the original floor plan

219
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,251
so the casino would be
on the ground floor,

220
00:13:35,252 --> 00:13:36,670
adjacent to the main lobby.

221
00:13:37,295 --> 00:13:39,463
It will house
several gaming areas,

222
00:13:39,464 --> 00:13:41,508
three bars, two restaurants...

223
00:13:41,883 --> 00:13:43,677
and of course a VIP lounge.

224
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:56,314
The table is now open
for any questions.

225
00:14:01,194 --> 00:14:03,404
Thank you for your
comprehensive report,

226
00:14:03,405 --> 00:14:04,698
Engineer Camero.

227
00:14:04,948 --> 00:14:07,491
Though, I do have some concerns

228
00:14:07,492 --> 00:14:09,578
regarding the
timeline and costs.

229
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,121
With the addition of the casino,

230
00:14:12,122 --> 00:14:13,832
how long will
the construction take?

231
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,751
Based on our projection,
it will take us around

232
00:14:17,752 --> 00:14:20,212
two and a half years
in the cost of...

233
00:14:20,213 --> 00:14:21,798
Two and a half years?

234
00:14:22,424 --> 00:14:24,174
That’s too long.

235
00:14:24,175 --> 00:14:26,469
We need to
expedite this project.

236
00:14:27,637 --> 00:14:29,805
With all due respect,
Miss Ledezma,

237
00:14:29,806 --> 00:14:31,515
rushing this project
will compromise

238
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:32,641
the quality of work of...

239
00:14:32,642 --> 00:14:35,019
Quality is important,

240
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,689
but so is efficiency, Engineer.

241
00:14:38,398 --> 00:14:40,066
We can’t afford to wait.

242
00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:42,568
We are losing money each day

243
00:14:42,569 --> 00:14:44,946
that this construction
has not started.

244
00:14:46,573 --> 00:14:49,492
And from what I am seeing...

245
00:14:52,662 --> 00:14:54,414
The budget has tripled

246
00:14:55,206 --> 00:14:56,875
with the addition
of this casino.

247
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,668
Well, you guys asked for
a world-class casino.

248
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:01,462
Of course,
it’s going to cost a lot.

249
00:15:01,463 --> 00:15:02,672
Miss Ledezma,

250
00:15:03,506 --> 00:15:05,550
we decided on the casino

251
00:15:06,176 --> 00:15:08,053
because we anticipated it

252
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,307
to generate additional
revenue for the hotel.

253
00:15:13,183 --> 00:15:14,935
And how much

254
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,604
is your projection,
Mr. Guerrero?

255
00:15:18,647 --> 00:15:21,107
We will present it to you
after this meeting.

256
00:15:26,237 --> 00:15:27,280
Engineer Camero,

257
00:15:27,864 --> 00:15:31,493
do you think we can
finish this in 18 months?

258
00:15:34,245 --> 00:15:36,080
No, that won’t
be possible, ma’am.

259
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:37,873
Again, with all due respect,

260
00:15:37,874 --> 00:15:39,334
like what I said earlier,

261
00:15:39,793 --> 00:15:41,836
we’ll need two and a half years.

262
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:45,548
We already discussed and agreed
upon the timeline last meeting.

263
00:15:46,883 --> 00:15:49,635
Well, excuse me,
Engineer Camero.

264
00:15:49,636 --> 00:15:51,303
But if you might
not have noticed,

265
00:15:51,304 --> 00:15:53,639
I was not here last meeting.

266
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,683
I wasn't present during
the last meeting either,

267
00:15:55,684 --> 00:15:57,477
but I am still aware,
Miss Ledezma.

268
00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:00,814
Well, I was in the U.S.
for an investors meeting

269
00:16:01,064 --> 00:16:05,025
which will fund this project
and everyone’s payroll.

270
00:16:05,026 --> 00:16:07,237
So, forgive me

271
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:11,157
for not being here
last meeting, Engineer Camero.

272
00:16:22,794 --> 00:16:23,794
Anyways...

273
00:16:25,338 --> 00:16:28,007
Thank you VGC team
for your presentation.

274
00:16:28,008 --> 00:16:29,592
I have no further questions.

275
00:16:35,181 --> 00:16:36,391
Thank you.

276
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:48,653
After careful consideration,

277
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:53,198
I’ve decided to scrap
the casino entirely.

278
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,200
Huh?

279
00:16:58,413 --> 00:17:00,039
It’s too expensive,

280
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,082
and it will delay

281
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,752
the project even further.

282
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:08,131
It does not align with the
original concept of this resort.

283
00:17:08,381 --> 00:17:10,591
Aruga Resort was
first conceptualized

284
00:17:10,592 --> 00:17:12,969
by my mom years ago.

285
00:17:13,678 --> 00:17:15,764
It is called “aruga”
for a reason.

286
00:17:16,473 --> 00:17:19,184
For guests to feel at home,

287
00:17:19,642 --> 00:17:21,811
nurtured and relaxed.

288
00:17:22,729 --> 00:17:26,191
It is a tranquil escape
from city life.

289
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:31,820
So we want to focus on creating
a family-friendly environment

290
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:33,239
for our guests.

291
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:35,908
This is about
fostering relationships

292
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:37,535
and creating memories.

293
00:17:38,369 --> 00:17:40,121
And so clearly,

294
00:17:41,748 --> 00:17:43,750
this casino

295
00:17:44,209 --> 00:17:45,627
is not on-brand.

296
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,253
It does not align
with the original vision

297
00:17:48,254 --> 00:17:49,422
that my mom had.

298
00:17:49,714 --> 00:17:51,590
But Miss Ledezma, the casino...

299
00:17:51,591 --> 00:17:53,468
My decision is final.

300
00:17:54,469 --> 00:17:56,762
We will stick
to the original plan

301
00:17:56,763 --> 00:17:58,807
and design of this resort.

302
00:18:04,604 --> 00:18:06,063
And Engineer Camero,

303
00:18:06,064 --> 00:18:07,940
please revisit the original plan

304
00:18:07,941 --> 00:18:08,858
and,

305
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:10,025
don’t worry,

306
00:18:10,026 --> 00:18:12,654
everyone will still be
properly compensated.

307
00:18:13,363 --> 00:18:14,655
And with this structural change,

308
00:18:14,656 --> 00:18:17,241
I do expect that we
schedule a groundbreaking

309
00:18:17,242 --> 00:18:18,827
in the next few weeks.

310
00:18:45,311 --> 00:18:46,311
Alice,

311
00:18:46,312 --> 00:18:50,191
please compile all
the files for Project Aruga.

312
00:18:51,484 --> 00:18:54,027
Budget reports,
construction timelines,

313
00:18:54,028 --> 00:18:55,405
design reports,

314
00:18:56,072 --> 00:18:57,781
past presentations… Everything.

315
00:18:57,782 --> 00:18:58,907
Yes, ma’am.

316
00:18:58,908 --> 00:19:00,534
And, if you have
any hard copies,

317
00:19:00,535 --> 00:19:01,828
please bring them to my office.

318
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,496
Yes, ma’am.

319
00:19:05,707 --> 00:19:06,708
By the way...

320
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:10,837
Do you like my hair?

321
00:19:11,629 --> 00:19:12,629
Ma’am?

322
00:19:12,922 --> 00:19:13,923
My hair,

323
00:19:14,257 --> 00:19:16,301
do you like it? Is it...

324
00:19:17,093 --> 00:19:18,136
weird?

325
00:19:19,554 --> 00:19:21,221
No, ma’am, it’s not weird.

326
00:19:21,222 --> 00:19:22,347
It really suits you.

327
00:19:22,348 --> 00:19:24,851
You look like
an international model.

328
00:19:29,272 --> 00:19:31,024
International model…

329
00:19:33,401 --> 00:19:35,111
Why did you ask, ma’am?

330
00:19:37,822 --> 00:19:38,865
Nothing.

331
00:20:20,365 --> 00:20:21,783
I just forgot something.

332
00:20:22,992 --> 00:20:24,661
So you’re forgetful now.

333
00:20:25,828 --> 00:20:27,830
Is that why you were
late to the meeting?

334
00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:30,166
Just because you forgot?

335
00:20:32,418 --> 00:20:35,254
Wait, no, I remember now.

336
00:20:35,255 --> 00:20:38,789
It’s because you
canceled on the meeting,

337
00:20:38,814 --> 00:20:40,316
Engineer Camero.

338
00:20:59,487 --> 00:21:01,781
Ma’am? Are you okay?

339
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:06,286
Yes.

340
00:21:13,835 --> 00:21:15,419
Just put that here, okay?

341
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,004
Okay.

342
00:21:16,005 --> 00:21:17,963
Then turn this over
to me tomorrow. Okay?

343
00:21:17,964 --> 00:21:18,965
All right, thanks.

344
00:21:28,141 --> 00:21:30,183
Are you upset by my decision?

345
00:21:30,184 --> 00:21:31,184
No.

346
00:21:31,436 --> 00:21:32,561
I understand.

347
00:21:32,562 --> 00:21:34,397
Well, I just didn’t know that…

348
00:21:35,231 --> 00:21:37,608
that project had a
personal connection with you.

349
00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:39,193
And I’m glad

350
00:21:40,028 --> 00:21:42,487
you’re the one
taking over this project

351
00:21:42,488 --> 00:21:44,949
since you know
what’s best for the resort.

352
00:21:47,076 --> 00:21:48,077
Thank you.

353
00:21:49,454 --> 00:21:52,164
Well, I didn’t know
that VGC would put

354
00:21:52,165 --> 00:21:54,292
Engineer Camero in charge.

355
00:21:56,336 --> 00:21:57,753
It’s fine.

356
00:21:57,754 --> 00:21:59,422
It’s not a big deal anymore.

357
00:22:00,715 --> 00:22:01,716
You know,

358
00:22:02,342 --> 00:22:05,886
just because he’s one
of the best engineers

359
00:22:05,887 --> 00:22:07,346
in the industry

360
00:22:07,347 --> 00:22:09,932
doesn’t mean he can talk
to you like that, right?

361
00:22:10,433 --> 00:22:11,434
That’s wrong.

362
00:22:12,226 --> 00:22:14,312
He’s your ex,

363
00:22:14,884 --> 00:22:16,427
but the way he treats you,

364
00:22:16,452 --> 00:22:18,287
it’s like you’re not his boss.

365
00:22:18,374 --> 00:22:20,334
But technically, you are.

366
00:22:21,778 --> 00:22:23,071
Come on, it’s fine.

367
00:22:26,616 --> 00:22:28,784
You know what, we can get

368
00:22:28,785 --> 00:22:30,328
a new head engineer

369
00:22:30,703 --> 00:22:33,956
if you feel awkward
or uncomfortable,

370
00:22:34,082 --> 00:22:35,291
let’s just replace him.

371
00:22:37,543 --> 00:22:39,670
I don’t think it’s awkward.

372
00:22:40,213 --> 00:22:42,464
It’s been four years.

373
00:22:42,465 --> 00:22:44,133
And you said it yourself,

374
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:47,803
he’s one of the best
engineers in the industry

375
00:22:47,804 --> 00:22:51,557
so I think it is best that
he is handling this project.

376
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:54,810
Okay.

377
00:22:55,603 --> 00:22:57,271
Let’s give him a chance.

378
00:23:02,402 --> 00:23:03,403
By the way...

379
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:06,989
Do you want to have dinner?

380
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:10,700
I’m sorry but I can’t.

381
00:23:10,701 --> 00:23:13,286
I still have to go home and
finish unpacking everything

382
00:23:13,287 --> 00:23:14,956
and just rest.

383
00:23:15,832 --> 00:23:17,208
All right, sure.

384
00:23:18,084 --> 00:23:19,377
Next time then.

385
00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:21,169
Thanks.

386
00:23:22,255 --> 00:23:23,005
Okay.

387
00:23:23,256 --> 00:23:26,676
Well, I need to go now.
Roel’s already waiting for me.

388
00:23:28,302 --> 00:23:29,302
Okay.

389
00:23:29,512 --> 00:23:30,596
- All right.
- Take care.

390
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,180
See you.

391
00:23:52,493 --> 00:23:55,580
It’s been so long.

392
00:24:03,504 --> 00:24:07,800
Nothing’s changed.
It’s like time stood still.

393
00:24:21,272 --> 00:24:22,440
Roel…

394
00:24:23,249 --> 00:24:24,250
Yes, ma’am?

395
00:24:25,334 --> 00:24:27,628
Thank you for keeping
the home clean.

396
00:24:29,462 --> 00:24:30,695
That’s okay, ma’am.

397
00:24:30,907 --> 00:24:33,618
You haven’t been home
in a while, huh?

398
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:36,120
Yes.

399
00:24:36,412 --> 00:24:38,998
Since I left.

400
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:42,668
Welcome home, ma’am.

401
00:24:45,421 --> 00:24:46,421
Ma’am,

402
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:50,008
would you like to rest now?
I’ll be on my way.

403
00:24:50,009 --> 00:24:50,760
All right.

404
00:24:50,761 --> 00:24:53,221
Thank you, Roel, and...

405
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,599
it’s really nice
to see you again.

406
00:24:57,141 --> 00:24:58,600
You too, ma’am.

407
00:24:58,601 --> 00:24:59,809
Thank you.

408
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:00,853
Thank you as well.

409
00:25:37,682 --> 00:25:38,599
You know,

410
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,603
I feel really lucky to have
you as my mom and best friend.

411
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,231
Best friend?

412
00:25:46,691 --> 00:25:50,736
My little baby is growing up
right in front of my eyes.

413
00:26:08,254 --> 00:26:09,963
Sweetheart, always remember…

414
00:26:09,964 --> 00:26:11,882
I’ll always be here for you.

415
00:26:12,425 --> 00:26:15,427
I’ll always have your
back no matter what.

416
00:26:15,428 --> 00:26:17,013
Thank you for everything, Mommy.

417
00:26:18,848 --> 00:26:20,349
I love you so much.

418
00:26:20,891 --> 00:26:22,977
I love you very much.

419
00:26:29,525 --> 00:26:31,485
Mom, I miss you.

420
00:26:32,028 --> 00:26:34,863
You’re the only reason
I want to stay here.

421
00:26:34,864 --> 00:26:37,825
See, you’re the sweetest.

422
00:26:38,576 --> 00:26:40,494
Now my headache is gone.

423
00:26:40,745 --> 00:26:42,955
- Love you.
- I love you.

424
00:26:45,786 --> 00:26:47,830
I love you, Mom.

425
00:27:04,894 --> 00:27:06,270
Hi, Shan.

426
00:27:07,146 --> 00:27:08,146
Ely?

427
00:27:09,649 --> 00:27:12,526
I’m home.
Can you visit tonight?

428
00:27:14,862 --> 00:27:18,783
I will but not tonight.
I have to finish some things.

429
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,327
When are you free?

430
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:25,330
I’m not sure, Ely.

431
00:27:25,331 --> 00:27:27,457
Why don’t you come over
here to my place instead?

432
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:28,918
At least, you’ll have
some company.

433
00:27:31,045 --> 00:27:33,839
No, that’s okay, Shan.
I want to stay here.

434
00:27:36,092 --> 00:27:38,511
Are you sure?
You’ll live there alone?

435
00:27:40,888 --> 00:27:44,809
Yes, I’ll check in
a couple days.

436
00:27:45,393 --> 00:27:47,228
But I don’t want
the house to go to waste.

437
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:50,939
It’s just sitting here,

438
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,441
so empty.

439
00:27:55,361 --> 00:27:58,446
Okay. You can come
over if you want

440
00:27:58,447 --> 00:28:01,325
and if you need anything,
I’m just one call away.

441
00:28:01,867 --> 00:28:03,160
Thank you, Shan.

442
00:29:22,087 --> 00:29:23,463
What did you say? Huh?

443
00:29:23,491 --> 00:29:24,950
You fucking asshole!

444
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:26,452
No!

445
00:29:26,453 --> 00:29:27,620
Don’t fucking touch her!

446
00:29:27,661 --> 00:29:29,120
- Shan, wait—
- Don’t you dare touch her!

447
00:29:29,121 --> 00:29:30,498
- Wait, Shan!
- You son of a bitch!

448
00:29:36,982 --> 00:29:37,983
Lani?

449
00:29:42,718 --> 00:29:44,345
Can you please put this away?

450
00:30:20,464 --> 00:30:21,465
Sevi?

451
00:30:22,383 --> 00:30:24,093
How was the meeting with
the Ledezma Group?

452
00:30:27,972 --> 00:30:28,973
It’s okay.

453
00:30:30,015 --> 00:30:33,936
The CEO had the casino scrapped.

454
00:30:34,603 --> 00:30:36,397
CEO…

455
00:30:37,189 --> 00:30:39,191
You mean Elyse?

456
00:30:41,068 --> 00:30:44,655
Yes. Miss Ledezma.

457
00:30:44,947 --> 00:30:46,740
Miss Ledezma?

458
00:30:47,074 --> 00:30:48,491
Wow, how formal.

459
00:30:48,492 --> 00:30:49,492
It’s like...

460
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,940
It’s like you were never lovers.

461
00:30:51,412 --> 00:30:52,413
You’re crazy.

462
00:30:55,124 --> 00:30:57,792
I still can’t believe you’re
living alone there, Ely.

463
00:30:57,793 --> 00:30:58,961
Are you a masochist?

464
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:03,299
I just want to see if
I can manage to live here.

465
00:31:03,915 --> 00:31:06,260
Mom’s memories are
all over this house.

466
00:31:06,677 --> 00:31:08,762
I just want to remember them.

467
00:31:10,055 --> 00:31:14,602
By the way, Sevi is the head
engineer of Project Aruga.

468
00:31:14,924 --> 00:31:15,924
What?

469
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,272
You’re working together again?

470
00:31:18,397 --> 00:31:20,608
- Yes.
- How was it?

471
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:24,294
Does it mean your relationship
will work out again?

472
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,656
What?

473
00:31:27,657 --> 00:31:29,616
That is far from happening.

474
00:31:29,617 --> 00:31:31,075
There are so many clients,

475
00:31:31,076 --> 00:31:34,078
and yet VGC came to you?

476
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:37,374
And they even put Sevi
as the head engineer?

477
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:41,211
Oh my god, it seems intentional.

478
00:31:41,754 --> 00:31:43,087
I don’t think so.

479
00:31:43,088 --> 00:31:45,381
I think it’s just
pure coincidence.

480
00:31:45,382 --> 00:31:49,428
There are 113 million people
in the Philippines,

481
00:31:50,054 --> 00:31:52,806
and the two of you
get to work together?

482
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:55,850
They probably just bid because

483
00:31:55,851 --> 00:31:57,143
this is a big project

484
00:31:57,144 --> 00:31:59,480
and not because Sevi
wants to work with me.

485
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:03,066
And this is just
a business transaction.

486
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:06,362
Our personal lives have
nothing to do with this deal.

487
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:08,906
I wonder what it feels
like to work with an ex?

488
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,240
And you even like that project.

489
00:32:11,241 --> 00:32:12,660
Me? Like the project?

490
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,620
What would you do
in my situation?

491
00:32:15,287 --> 00:32:17,456
Me? Work with an ex?

492
00:32:17,873 --> 00:32:19,124
My god, no.

493
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,960
Never.

494
00:32:21,627 --> 00:32:22,628
Seriously.

495
00:32:22,962 --> 00:32:25,421
But who knows,
maybe you’ll surprise us

496
00:32:25,422 --> 00:32:26,662
and get back together with her.

497
00:32:28,217 --> 00:32:29,843
Very unlikely.

498
00:32:31,595 --> 00:32:32,596
You know,

499
00:32:33,681 --> 00:32:34,890
because of the...

500
00:32:35,224 --> 00:32:36,504
Because of how
you guys broke up?

501
00:32:38,435 --> 00:32:41,480
Sevi, it’s obvious you
haven’t moved on.

502
00:32:43,691 --> 00:32:44,771
Why don’t you go on a date?

503
00:32:48,112 --> 00:32:49,113
Can’t.

504
00:32:49,488 --> 00:32:51,447
Too busy, plus

505
00:32:51,448 --> 00:32:53,158
there’s an event
in the coming weeks.

506
00:32:54,576 --> 00:32:57,454
So, if you weren’t busy,
you’d go on a date?

507
00:33:00,249 --> 00:33:02,376
Okay, noted.

508
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,839
All right now, just eat.

509
00:33:07,589 --> 00:33:09,633
Miss Ledezma, Ledezma…

510
00:33:16,015 --> 00:33:18,891
But here’s a serious question,

511
00:33:18,892 --> 00:33:20,769
if it were up to you...

512
00:33:21,395 --> 00:33:22,771
Would there be a chance?

513
00:33:25,024 --> 00:33:26,065
Chance?

514
00:33:26,066 --> 00:33:28,569
Chance for you two
to get back together.

515
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,164
Can’t we just work together?

516
00:33:41,165 --> 00:33:43,959
You’re not answering
my question.

517
00:33:46,503 --> 00:33:49,047
Why do you still
have the promise ring

518
00:33:49,048 --> 00:33:50,215
that Sevi gave you?

519
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:52,091
I just kept it here.

520
00:33:52,092 --> 00:33:54,011
It would be a waste to
throw them away, right?

521
00:33:54,678 --> 00:33:55,679
Come on.

522
00:34:00,267 --> 00:34:03,519
Can’t I just keep
and wear accessories

523
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,897
without meaning?

524
00:34:05,773 --> 00:34:08,942
If you’re done with them,
just throw them all away.

525
00:34:09,568 --> 00:34:11,820
They will just remind
you of the past.

526
00:34:12,154 --> 00:34:14,406
You have so many jewelry
pieces there, you know.

527
00:34:14,948 --> 00:34:15,949
I got to go.

528
00:34:16,658 --> 00:34:18,284
I’ll just call you later, okay?

529
00:34:18,285 --> 00:34:19,119
Okay, bye.

530
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,996
- Love you, Ely.
- Talk to you later.

531
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,413
Who gave this to you?

532
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:40,978
Luna?

533
00:34:42,961 --> 00:34:43,961
No.

534
00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:45,358
I got this for myself.

535
00:34:46,218 --> 00:34:47,469
I had it made.

536
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:49,805
No special meaning.

537
00:34:54,601 --> 00:34:56,395
Why are you giving this to me?

538
00:35:00,357 --> 00:35:01,817
So that it has
a special meaning.

539
00:35:03,026 --> 00:35:04,403
Do you like me?

540
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:09,157
I like you.

541
00:35:23,505 --> 00:35:25,257
I want to give you this.

542
00:35:26,008 --> 00:35:27,426
A promise ring.

543
00:35:28,677 --> 00:35:29,844
I promise

544
00:35:29,845 --> 00:35:32,848
I’ll do everything
to be successful

545
00:35:33,724 --> 00:35:35,851
because I want
to marry you, Elyse.

546
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,895
And to give you
a comfortable life.

547
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:43,567
And I also don’t want us
to break up again.

548
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:45,402
I love you, Elyse.

549
00:35:46,028 --> 00:35:48,613
I love you at all times.

550
00:35:48,905 --> 00:35:50,698
I love you.

551
00:35:50,699 --> 00:35:55,328
And loving you has
made my life so beautiful.

552
00:36:09,092 --> 00:36:11,802
But here’s a serious question,

553
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:13,764
if it were up to you...

554
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:15,848
Would there be a chance?

555
00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:18,351
Chance for you two
to get back together.

556
00:37:45,021 --> 00:37:47,356
The groundbreaking
ceremony for Project Aruga

557
00:37:47,357 --> 00:37:49,151
in Batangas will
be next weekend.

558
00:37:53,029 --> 00:37:54,029
You know what,

559
00:37:54,531 --> 00:37:56,031
you and Austin here

560
00:37:56,032 --> 00:37:57,741
should hang out more, Elyse.

561
00:37:57,742 --> 00:38:00,244
Austin has been
a really great friend

562
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:01,413
throughout the years.

563
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:05,792
I heard you’re working together.

564
00:38:06,168 --> 00:38:08,003
So that means you
see each other a lot.

565
00:38:08,628 --> 00:38:10,630
No wonder you’re
always at the gym.

566
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:13,091
- Sam!
- Ely, hi!

567
00:38:13,842 --> 00:38:15,259
I’m so happy you came.

568
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,512
Girls, I ordered
you drinks, okay?

569
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:19,514
Enjoy the night, girls.

570
00:38:19,848 --> 00:38:20,765
- Thank you, Sam.
- I’ll see you later.

571
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:23,726
Thank you so much for
inviting me here, madam.

572
00:38:23,727 --> 00:38:25,269
It’s so nice here.

573
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:28,064
You can call me Elyse.

574
00:38:28,231 --> 00:38:29,649
We’re outside of work anyway.

575
00:38:30,483 --> 00:38:31,483
Cheers!

576
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:33,278
Cheers.

577
00:38:41,036 --> 00:38:44,331
Thank you so much
for coming here with me.

578
00:38:45,832 --> 00:38:46,832
Hey!

579
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:48,125
Drink moderately.

580
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:51,087
I seldom celebrate my birthday,

581
00:38:51,713 --> 00:38:53,589
and we only get to enjoy
ourselves once in a while,

582
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,216
so just let me be, okay?

583
00:38:55,217 --> 00:38:56,342
You like me, right?

584
00:38:56,343 --> 00:38:59,053
Say yes. Answer me!
Answer me!

585
00:38:59,054 --> 00:39:00,179
- Come on!
- Austin, stop!

586
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,223
You’re drunk!
I’m begging you!

587
00:39:02,224 --> 00:39:03,308
- I’m begging you!
- Austin!
