1
00:00:10,281 --> 00:00:12,324
That is Miss Elyse Ledezma.

2
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,577
The CEO of our company.

3
00:00:15,286 --> 00:00:17,037
Yes! Project Aruga.

4
00:00:17,038 --> 00:00:19,832
So, design and construction
is with VGC.

5
00:00:20,082 --> 00:00:23,501
VGC? As in, Valeria Group?

6
00:00:23,502 --> 00:00:25,254
You’re late, Engineer Camero.

7
00:00:25,463 --> 00:00:27,006
My apologies, Miss Ledezma.

8
00:00:27,298 --> 00:00:28,715
Let’s just replace him.

9
00:00:28,716 --> 00:00:30,176
I don’t think it’s awkward.

10
00:00:30,718 --> 00:00:32,678
It’s been four years now.

11
00:00:35,723 --> 00:00:36,723
Roel…

12
00:00:37,349 --> 00:00:39,518
Thank you for
keeping the home clean.

13
00:00:43,272 --> 00:00:46,066
Sevi is the head engineer
of Project Aruga.

14
00:00:46,067 --> 00:00:47,484
How was the meeting
with the Ledezma Group?

15
00:00:47,485 --> 00:00:48,485
It’s okay.

16
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,949
The CEO had the casino scrapped.

17
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:57,495
CEO, you mean…

18
00:00:57,703 --> 00:00:58,746
Elyse?

19
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,330
Yes.

20
00:01:00,498 --> 00:01:02,999
Miss Ledezma.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,627
If it were up to you...

22
00:01:05,544 --> 00:01:06,754
Would there be a chance?

23
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:18,700
So, it is all set.

24
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:21,786
The groundbreaking ceremony for
Project Aruga in Batangas

25
00:02:21,787 --> 00:02:23,164
will be next weekend.

26
00:02:23,622 --> 00:02:24,456
Wow.

27
00:02:24,457 --> 00:02:25,791
Nice!

28
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:28,752
That’s good news.

29
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:32,839
That will be all for today.

30
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,840
Thank you.

31
00:02:34,175 --> 00:02:35,843
Thank you, Miss Ledezma.

32
00:02:38,304 --> 00:02:41,974
I really have high hopes
for this resort, Elyse.

33
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:44,226
It’s been a long time coming.

34
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:45,811
Thank you.

35
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,731
By the way,

36
00:02:49,106 --> 00:02:50,107
how’s your dad?

37
00:02:50,524 --> 00:02:52,818
He’s still on
hospital arrest, right?

38
00:02:57,031 --> 00:02:58,907
I still haven’t visited him

39
00:02:58,908 --> 00:03:00,951
and I’m not planning to.

40
00:03:02,578 --> 00:03:04,288
But it’s been years, Elyse.

41
00:03:05,998 --> 00:03:06,998
Julianne.

42
00:03:08,876 --> 00:03:09,877
I know.

43
00:03:13,756 --> 00:03:15,507
But the good thing here is

44
00:03:16,342 --> 00:03:19,261
your dad transferred
all his shares to you.

45
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,639
He trusts you so much.

46
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:23,682
For good reason.

47
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:26,143
You managed to
pull everything up.

48
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:28,604
You’re a special one.

49
00:03:29,605 --> 00:03:31,774
I’m not special.
I just work hard.

50
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:33,692
Yes, that’s true.

51
00:03:34,026 --> 00:03:37,238
But I’ve seen your dad prepare
you for this moment.

52
00:03:37,988 --> 00:03:39,989
That’s why it was
easy for you to

53
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,824
transition because

54
00:03:41,825 --> 00:03:45,578
you already know the job
and you already have

55
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:48,122
good working relationships

56
00:03:48,123 --> 00:03:49,999
with our business partners.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,919
And it was just
right for the board

58
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,131
to elect you as CEO.

59
00:03:58,008 --> 00:03:59,676
I campaigned for you.

60
00:03:59,677 --> 00:04:01,053
Did you know that?

61
00:04:07,017 --> 00:04:09,520
Thank you for your
kind words, Uncle Anthony.

62
00:04:13,274 --> 00:04:15,317
You are really
different from your dad.

63
00:04:16,568 --> 00:04:18,278
Of course, I am.

64
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,406
Yes, I’m really more
like my mom.

65
00:04:20,864 --> 00:04:22,031
That’s true.

66
00:04:22,032 --> 00:04:24,159
You always remind me
of Aunt Erin.

67
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,038
Hey, you know what?

68
00:04:28,622 --> 00:04:32,126
You and Austin here should
hang out more, Elyse.

69
00:04:33,294 --> 00:04:34,670
And I think

70
00:04:35,421 --> 00:04:38,506
you would make
a wonderful daughter-in-law.

71
00:04:38,507 --> 00:04:40,759
It would be good
for the business.

72
00:04:41,552 --> 00:04:45,139
You would be a powerful
couple here with Austin.

73
00:04:51,395 --> 00:04:54,982
Austin has been a really great
friend throughout the years.

74
00:04:57,651 --> 00:04:58,693
Well, anyways…

75
00:04:58,694 --> 00:05:01,446
I am looking forward to
the groundbreaking ceremony

76
00:05:01,447 --> 00:05:03,990
next weekend. I will see
you guys there, right?

77
00:05:03,991 --> 00:05:05,367
We will see you, Elyse.

78
00:05:05,743 --> 00:05:06,743
Okay.

79
00:05:06,744 --> 00:05:07,870
I need to go.

80
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:09,496
You take care.

81
00:05:11,623 --> 00:05:12,623
Take care.

82
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:39,860
Good morning.

83
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:42,028
Good morning,
how is everyone doing?

84
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:43,864
- Very good.
- Yes? That’s good.

85
00:05:44,114 --> 00:05:45,948
Thank you for coming.
Excuse me.

86
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:47,493
She’s here. Miss Ledezma’s here.

87
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,871
- Good morning, Miss Ledezma.
- Good morning.

88
00:05:51,372 --> 00:05:52,580
- How are you guys doing?
- How are you today?

89
00:05:52,581 --> 00:05:53,790
I am good. How are you?

90
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,874
- Good.
- Yes.

91
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,710
- Picture?
- Yes.

92
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:04,092
There you go. Thank you.

93
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:05,469
- Okay.
- Thank you.

94
00:06:06,095 --> 00:06:07,637
Thank you guys for coming.

95
00:06:07,638 --> 00:06:09,390
Of course, Miss Ledezma.

96
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:17,731
Excuse me.

97
00:06:17,732 --> 00:06:18,732
Yes, ma’am.

98
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,365
Miss Ledezma,
let me introduce my team.

99
00:06:27,366 --> 00:06:30,244
This is Engineer Lavin
and Engineer Castillo.

100
00:06:30,702 --> 00:06:33,746
- Hello.
- Good morning, Miss Ledezma.

101
00:06:33,747 --> 00:06:35,164
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

102
00:06:35,165 --> 00:06:36,166
Good morning.

103
00:06:37,042 --> 00:06:39,627
By the way, I wanted to
personally congratulate you

104
00:06:39,628 --> 00:06:41,712
on the groundbreaking and the...

105
00:06:41,713 --> 00:06:42,964
Madam, let’s go?

106
00:06:42,965 --> 00:06:45,676
The groundbreaking ceremony
will start in a few minutes.

107
00:06:46,051 --> 00:06:47,052
Okay.

108
00:06:49,596 --> 00:06:51,765
Please, excuse me.
I’ll see you guys.

109
00:07:09,992 --> 00:07:13,661
I would like to extend
my furthest gratitude

110
00:07:13,662 --> 00:07:16,622
to everyone working
on this project.

111
00:07:16,623 --> 00:07:18,541
From our dedicated team

112
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:20,836
of architects and engineers…

113
00:07:21,795 --> 00:07:24,006
to our esteemed partners.

114
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:27,593
Thank you all for
bringing this project to life.

115
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:32,514
Now, we’re not
only building a resort.

116
00:07:32,973 --> 00:07:34,891
But we’re creating a place

117
00:07:34,892 --> 00:07:37,643
where families can find joy,

118
00:07:37,644 --> 00:07:40,563
happiness, and relaxation

119
00:07:40,564 --> 00:07:42,274
for generations to come.

120
00:07:46,987 --> 00:07:48,572
And most importantly...

121
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:56,120
I would like to
dedicate this project

122
00:07:56,121 --> 00:07:59,333
to my late mother, Erin Ledezma,

123
00:08:00,042 --> 00:08:03,587
whose spirit still
continues to inspire us all.

124
00:08:04,713 --> 00:08:08,049
So may we all continue
to work passionately

125
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,384
to make this
resort a happy place

126
00:08:10,385 --> 00:08:13,138
where families can
create lasting memories.

127
00:08:14,348 --> 00:08:15,349
Thank you.

128
00:08:21,355 --> 00:08:22,064
And now,

129
00:08:22,065 --> 00:08:25,359
I would like to introduce you
all to our head engineer,

130
00:08:25,901 --> 00:08:28,403
Engineer Sebastian
Vincent Camero,

131
00:08:28,862 --> 00:08:30,906
who will also be
sharing a few words.

132
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,092
Thank you so much,
Miss Amora Elyse Ledezma.

133
00:08:53,303 --> 00:08:56,765
It’s an honor to be
part of this project.

134
00:08:57,766 --> 00:09:01,185
I and the whole
Valeria Group Construction

135
00:09:01,186 --> 00:09:04,105
are fully committed
in building this project

136
00:09:04,106 --> 00:09:07,401
with the highest care
and excellence.

137
00:09:09,987 --> 00:09:11,571
We will make Aruga Resort

138
00:09:11,572 --> 00:09:13,322
the world-class resort

139
00:09:13,323 --> 00:09:16,368
that every Filipino
family deserves.

140
00:09:19,413 --> 00:09:21,498
And to the late Mrs. Ledezma...

141
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,753
Thank you very much
for everything.

142
00:09:27,754 --> 00:09:31,508
I promise to make
your vision a reality.

143
00:09:36,888 --> 00:09:37,889
Thank you.

144
00:10:17,638 --> 00:10:21,433
Miss Ledezma, please stand next
to Engineer Camero.

145
00:10:48,418 --> 00:10:50,545
Why is he staring at me?

146
00:10:52,798 --> 00:10:55,467
Am I that pretty?

147
00:10:57,135 --> 00:10:58,178
It’s facing backwards.

148
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,681
Pardon?

149
00:11:01,932 --> 00:11:03,600
Your shovel is facing backward.

150
00:11:21,034 --> 00:11:22,034
Thanks.

151
00:11:30,794 --> 00:11:31,961
Closer, please.

152
00:11:31,962 --> 00:11:34,880
Move closer together.
You two are too far apart.

153
00:11:34,881 --> 00:11:35,966
Move closer, please.

154
00:11:47,102 --> 00:11:48,311
Look at the camera.

155
00:11:51,815 --> 00:11:52,815
One more.

156
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:11,793
Your turn.

157
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:46,286
This is it, Mom.

158
00:12:46,411 --> 00:12:50,207
Your dream resort
is coming to reality.

159
00:12:55,253 --> 00:12:56,755
I made it, Mom.

160
00:12:57,506 --> 00:13:00,217
I’m now the CEO
of our family company.

161
00:13:02,344 --> 00:13:05,555
I promise to continue
making you proud

162
00:13:05,597 --> 00:13:08,683
and to fulfill all
my promises to you.

163
00:13:10,435 --> 00:13:12,854
I miss you so much.

164
00:13:16,441 --> 00:13:18,568
We’ve seen your hard work
and dedication.

165
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:20,987
And you do deserve
that promotion.

166
00:13:22,697 --> 00:13:24,907
Thank you, Mommy.
Thank you, Daddy.

167
00:13:24,908 --> 00:13:27,159
I promise,
I will work hard for this.

168
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,454
Congratulations, dear.
You deserve it.

169
00:13:30,497 --> 00:13:31,873
Thank you, Mommy.

170
00:13:51,685 --> 00:13:52,978
Sevi’s ID?

171
00:14:07,742 --> 00:14:09,536
It’s late.
I need to go home.

172
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,617
In 100 meters, turn left.

173
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,286
Left?

174
00:14:52,245 --> 00:14:53,246
Where?

175
00:14:55,123 --> 00:14:56,917
There’s no left.

176
00:15:01,254 --> 00:15:03,298
Shit, it’s not updated.

177
00:15:05,842 --> 00:15:08,386
Fuck. Where the fuck am I?

178
00:15:10,138 --> 00:15:11,139
Huh?

179
00:15:11,556 --> 00:15:12,891
Why now?

180
00:15:14,392 --> 00:15:15,392
Fuck!

181
00:15:34,245 --> 00:15:39,501
Where’s my charger?
Or my power bank?

182
00:15:40,669 --> 00:15:41,961
Shit.

183
00:15:41,962 --> 00:15:45,548
Out of all of the days,
I left it at the office.

184
00:15:48,218 --> 00:15:50,887
God, where the fuck am I?

185
00:15:53,348 --> 00:15:56,309
Okay… Okay, Elyse.
You can do this.

186
00:15:59,104 --> 00:16:01,231
We just need to find a place.

187
00:16:02,232 --> 00:16:04,651
Maybe someone that
we can ask for help.

188
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,002
Shit, where am I?

189
00:16:28,466 --> 00:16:29,801
Oh my god.

190
00:16:31,261 --> 00:16:32,637
Mommy…

191
00:16:34,597 --> 00:16:37,225
Fuck! Am I in the middle of nowhere?

192
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:41,312
It doesn’t seem like there’s anyone around.

193
00:16:56,494 --> 00:16:57,494
Sevi!

194
00:16:58,621 --> 00:16:59,621
Elyse?

195
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,438
What are you doing here?

196
00:17:26,316 --> 00:17:29,986
I don’t know. I got lost and
then my phone died.

197
00:17:31,362 --> 00:17:35,741
I’m just… I’m so bad
with, with...

198
00:17:35,742 --> 00:17:37,118
Directions.

199
00:17:39,496 --> 00:17:40,496
Yes.

200
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:48,713
Do you have a power bank
or a charger, by any chance?

201
00:17:58,807 --> 00:18:01,017
- Here.
- Thank you.

202
00:18:04,312 --> 00:18:05,563
I just remembered.

203
00:18:06,981 --> 00:18:08,441
I found this earlier.

204
00:18:08,983 --> 00:18:10,527
I think you dropped it.

205
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:13,780
Thanks.

206
00:18:17,492 --> 00:18:20,495
Just follow me
so you can get home.

207
00:18:21,663 --> 00:18:22,872
Really?

208
00:18:23,665 --> 00:18:24,833
Thank you.

209
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:27,544
But don’t drive fast.

210
00:18:28,086 --> 00:18:29,087
Please.

211
00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:31,464
I’m the one who has to adjust?

212
00:18:32,215 --> 00:18:33,466
You should catch me.

213
00:18:45,228 --> 00:18:46,603
Fine.

214
00:18:46,604 --> 00:18:48,230
I’ll go after you.

215
00:18:48,231 --> 00:18:49,858
You’re going home now, right?

216
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:52,485
- Yes. To Makati.
- Wait for me.

217
00:19:21,264 --> 00:19:22,473
Thank you.

218
00:19:37,739 --> 00:19:38,323
Alice?

219
00:19:38,324 --> 00:19:39,824
Ma'am! Finally!

220
00:19:39,991 --> 00:19:41,993
How did you get home last night?

221
00:19:42,744 --> 00:19:45,162
I tried calling several times,
but you were out of reach.

222
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:46,915
I got lost.

223
00:19:47,373 --> 00:19:49,334
What happened, ma’am?

224
00:19:50,251 --> 00:19:51,793
My phone died,

225
00:19:51,794 --> 00:19:54,671
and I didn’t have a power bank
or charger with me.

226
00:19:54,672 --> 00:19:57,424
So I wasn’t able to use my GPS.

227
00:19:57,425 --> 00:19:59,718
So, starting today,

228
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:01,303
I will pack two power banks

229
00:20:01,304 --> 00:20:03,640
and two charger cords in my car.

230
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,811
Good thing you got
home safely, ma'am.

231
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,896
Yes.

232
00:20:11,314 --> 00:20:13,650
A good samaritan helped me.

233
00:20:24,577 --> 00:20:27,455
Alice, what’s my
schedule for today?

234
00:20:28,248 --> 00:20:30,040
None for today, ma’am.

235
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:33,378
Should I go back to Batangas
and bring it back to him?

236
00:20:34,379 --> 00:20:37,589
But why go all the way there
just for a power bank?

237
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,261
He might think I just wanted
to see him. Which I’m not.

238
00:20:54,899 --> 00:20:57,068
Alice, you can go home
early today.

239
00:20:57,318 --> 00:21:02,197
Wow, thank you, Ma'am!
Aren't you coming to the office?

240
00:21:02,198 --> 00:21:04,534
No, I’m heading to Batangas.

241
00:21:05,618 --> 00:21:08,621
But there’s nothing new
at the site, ma'am.

242
00:21:13,376 --> 00:21:15,794
I just want to check
on the site again since

243
00:21:15,795 --> 00:21:17,588
I don’t have any meetings today.

244
00:21:20,216 --> 00:21:21,592
Okay, ma’am.

245
00:21:22,969 --> 00:21:23,970
Okay.

246
00:21:33,062 --> 00:21:34,063
I get it.

247
00:21:35,857 --> 00:21:37,400
Let’s take a look at the others.

248
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:40,653
Okay.

249
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:49,119
Miss Ledezma.

250
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,412
How can I help you?

251
00:21:50,413 --> 00:21:51,456
Hi.

252
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,835
I’m just here to check
on construction.

253
00:21:56,085 --> 00:21:57,337
Do you guys need anything?

254
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,590
I think, so far, we’re good.

255
00:22:01,591 --> 00:22:03,092
We were just eating right now.

256
00:22:03,426 --> 00:22:04,469
Have you eaten, ma'am?

257
00:22:05,511 --> 00:22:06,637
Not yet.

258
00:22:06,888 --> 00:22:09,849
But I brought some food for you.

259
00:22:10,308 --> 00:22:11,642
It's just in the car.

260
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,811
And if you guys need
anything more,

261
00:22:14,812 --> 00:22:16,397
you guys can just message me.

262
00:22:17,732 --> 00:22:18,733
Speaking of...

263
00:22:19,108 --> 00:22:20,108
Here.

264
00:22:24,489 --> 00:22:25,489
Here.

265
00:22:26,491 --> 00:22:28,492
Email me if you need anything.

266
00:22:28,493 --> 00:22:31,329
But if there are emergencies,
you can just text or call.

267
00:22:31,996 --> 00:22:34,874
But introduce yourself first.

268
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:38,753
Engineer Theo Lavin,
Miss Ledezma.

269
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,172
We already met in college.

270
00:22:42,256 --> 00:22:43,256
What?

271
00:22:43,257 --> 00:22:46,177
Yes. We’re Master Sevi’s
blockmates.

272
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:48,721
Actually, we’ve already met
a few times.

273
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:52,975
So he knows about us?

274
00:22:53,976 --> 00:22:57,437
Actually, this baby boy too,
Engineer Castillo.

275
00:22:57,438 --> 00:23:00,024
The three of us were blockmates.
And now, we’re workmates.

276
00:23:01,734 --> 00:23:02,943
Well, that’s nice.

277
00:23:02,944 --> 00:23:04,737
You guys are successful now.

278
00:23:05,446 --> 00:23:06,446
Stop.

279
00:23:06,656 --> 00:23:08,366
So are you, ma’am.

280
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:10,368
You can just call me, Elyse.

281
00:23:10,701 --> 00:23:11,702
Okay.

282
00:23:12,703 --> 00:23:15,872
What are you going to check?
The site is somewhat ready, but

283
00:23:15,873 --> 00:23:16,541
Yes?

284
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:17,749
You can just look at it later.

285
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,419
We still have some
things to fix.

286
00:23:22,422 --> 00:23:23,798
Engineer Camero.

287
00:23:26,926 --> 00:23:28,302
She’s also here?

288
00:23:29,262 --> 00:23:31,514
Are they together?

289
00:23:34,308 --> 00:23:37,310
Right, we’ll go ahead, Engineer.

290
00:23:37,311 --> 00:23:38,395
We have something to do.

291
00:23:38,396 --> 00:23:40,476
Isn't there something that needs
to be taken care of?

292
00:23:47,697 --> 00:23:49,574
Hi, Miss Ledezma.

293
00:23:51,993 --> 00:23:52,993
Hi.

294
00:23:52,994 --> 00:23:55,121
You have a new engineer onboard.

295
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,665
Yes.
Engineer Ramos.

296
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:01,168
She’s one of the best
engineers in VGC,

297
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:03,336
which is why we included
her in this project.

298
00:24:03,337 --> 00:24:05,964
We’ve already met before.

299
00:24:05,965 --> 00:24:07,382
I don’t know if you remember...

300
00:24:07,383 --> 00:24:08,468
Of course.

301
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,180
Hi, it’s good to have you
on this project.

302
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,265
Thank you, Miss Ledezma.

303
00:24:14,348 --> 00:24:17,435
This is actually a huge
opportunity for me.

304
00:24:17,894 --> 00:24:20,646
Good thing Sevi included
me in the project.

305
00:24:22,773 --> 00:24:24,316
After all this time,

306
00:24:24,317 --> 00:24:26,319
they are still working with
each other?

307
00:24:27,111 --> 00:24:28,863
Are they dating or not?

308
00:24:29,906 --> 00:24:31,866
Why are you here, Miss Ledezma?

309
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:41,625
By the way, I’ll go ahead

310
00:24:41,626 --> 00:24:44,003
because I still have
something to finish.

311
00:24:45,129 --> 00:24:46,881
Excuse me, Miss Ledezma.

312
00:24:47,256 --> 00:24:48,257
Sure.

313
00:24:58,601 --> 00:24:59,602
Well...

314
00:25:01,479 --> 00:25:03,523
I just wanted to check

315
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,234
on the construction.

316
00:25:09,737 --> 00:25:11,531
We’re doing well here.

317
00:25:12,823 --> 00:25:15,326
Do you have any more questions?

318
00:25:17,745 --> 00:25:19,330
No, well...

319
00:25:23,668 --> 00:25:25,336
Here’s your power bank.

320
00:25:26,671 --> 00:25:27,672
Thank you.

321
00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:33,510
You drove all the way
to Batangas

322
00:25:33,511 --> 00:25:34,887
just to give this to me?

323
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:36,556
I knew he’d say that.

324
00:25:39,267 --> 00:25:42,103
No, I also just wanted to
see the site.

325
00:25:43,187 --> 00:25:45,021
I don’t think you’re aware,

326
00:25:45,022 --> 00:25:49,193
but I am very hands-on
with every project.

327
00:25:50,194 --> 00:25:51,195
Well,

328
00:25:52,321 --> 00:25:54,365
if you need updates on
the construction,

329
00:25:54,865 --> 00:25:56,367
you can just message me.

330
00:25:56,909 --> 00:25:59,286
I am in charge here and

331
00:25:59,287 --> 00:26:02,123
don’t worry, I am taking care
of the workers.

332
00:26:02,623 --> 00:26:05,418
If they need anything,
I’ll update you.

333
00:26:06,127 --> 00:26:08,629
Message you?
Where?

334
00:26:09,046 --> 00:26:11,257
Like, social media?

335
00:26:16,846 --> 00:26:18,556
All the details are there.

336
00:26:19,807 --> 00:26:22,101
My work phone, my work email…

337
00:26:22,727 --> 00:26:25,562
If you need to talk to me
about work,

338
00:26:25,563 --> 00:26:27,398
just contact me using
those details.

339
00:26:28,941 --> 00:26:29,942
Thanks.

340
00:26:31,152 --> 00:26:32,153
And...

341
00:26:33,654 --> 00:26:35,072
Here, here’s mine.

342
00:26:43,331 --> 00:26:45,249
Okay. I’ll go now.

343
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,509
By the way...

344
00:27:01,932 --> 00:27:03,476
Have you eaten?

345
00:27:06,354 --> 00:27:07,355
No.

346
00:27:07,605 --> 00:27:08,605
But...

347
00:27:09,607 --> 00:27:11,651
Engineer Ramos brought some food.

348
00:27:15,446 --> 00:27:16,864
Well, you should eat.

349
00:27:17,948 --> 00:27:19,867
I brought some food, too.

350
00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:22,203
All right. Thank you.

351
00:27:23,996 --> 00:27:26,082
He's so cold.

352
00:27:31,671 --> 00:27:33,798
Okay. I’ll go now.

353
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:53,149
Hey!

354
00:27:54,819 --> 00:27:56,404
What’s wrong?

355
00:27:56,821 --> 00:28:00,241
Is your yogurt that sour for
you to make that face?

356
00:28:01,325 --> 00:28:03,327
No, it tastes great.

357
00:28:03,911 --> 00:28:05,037
It’s just that...

358
00:28:07,373 --> 00:28:10,125
I’ve been thinking if Sevi is
still mad at me

359
00:28:10,126 --> 00:28:11,836
after all this time.

360
00:28:12,962 --> 00:28:14,255
He’s been so cold to me.

361
00:28:15,005 --> 00:28:16,339
Maybe he still hasn’t forgiven me

362
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,425
after what happened in the past.

363
00:28:18,426 --> 00:28:22,513
Ely, it’s not easy to forget the past.

364
00:28:23,764 --> 00:28:27,476
Maybe you’re just overthinking
things right now.

365
00:28:28,686 --> 00:28:30,146
What do you want to happen anyway?

366
00:28:30,646 --> 00:28:33,064
I don’t know. I just want to be
able to talk to him.

367
00:28:33,065 --> 00:28:35,526
Like a normal person.

368
00:28:36,485 --> 00:28:37,695
Is that all?

369
00:28:39,238 --> 00:28:40,239
Yes.

370
00:28:40,573 --> 00:28:43,366
Because we’ll be working
together for quite a while.

371
00:28:43,367 --> 00:28:45,618
And I don’t want any bad vibes

372
00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:47,705
or tension at work, you know?

373
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,956
Give him time.

374
00:28:49,957 --> 00:28:52,585
Maybe he’s still warming up to you.

375
00:28:56,589 --> 00:28:58,549
Maybe you’re right.

376
00:29:01,802 --> 00:29:03,094
You know what,

377
00:29:03,095 --> 00:29:04,555
I really miss you.

378
00:29:04,764 --> 00:29:08,392
Lately, I’ve just been
feeling so lonely.

379
00:29:08,851 --> 00:29:11,061
I just feel so alone,
you know? Like...

380
00:29:12,605 --> 00:29:15,398
I don’t have anyone else
but myself.

381
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:17,108
Ely, you have me.

382
00:29:17,109 --> 00:29:21,113
I’ll finish my work here,
and then after that...

383
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:26,619
I’ll go work at our Philippine branch.

384
00:29:26,911 --> 00:29:28,662
I can’t wait for that.

385
00:29:30,289 --> 00:29:34,168
Maybe it’s the mansion
making you feel lonely.

386
00:29:38,672 --> 00:29:42,675
I don’t know.
Should I find a smaller house?

387
00:29:42,676 --> 00:29:44,345
Should I move out?

388
00:29:45,012 --> 00:29:47,972
Maybe I feel this way
because of this house.

389
00:29:47,973 --> 00:29:51,018
It’s just so big, you know?

390
00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:55,105
I keep crying because
everywhere I look,

391
00:29:55,481 --> 00:29:58,108
I just remember memories of Mom.

392
00:29:58,526 --> 00:30:00,152
And where will you stay?

393
00:30:00,986 --> 00:30:03,279
If you buy a house,
you’ll still have to renovate

394
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,367
and furnish it. It’s going
to be such a hassle.

395
00:30:07,368 --> 00:30:10,788
I know, but I’m really serious
about moving out.

396
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,997
I can’t live here anymore.

397
00:30:12,998 --> 00:30:16,126
Maybe I’ll just look for a
furnished condo near the office?

398
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,460
Condo?

399
00:30:18,379 --> 00:30:20,798
You already have one.

400
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,091
What?

401
00:30:22,424 --> 00:30:23,551
Your condo.

402
00:30:23,801 --> 00:30:28,097
Technically, you paid for
that so it should be yours.

403
00:30:29,139 --> 00:30:30,057
What?

404
00:30:30,058 --> 00:30:32,392
Girl, are you kidding me?

405
00:30:32,393 --> 00:30:34,645
Why the hell would I live there?

406
00:30:35,646 --> 00:30:38,816
We did so much there.

407
00:30:39,441 --> 00:30:43,571
It's already interior
designed and furnished.

408
00:30:44,238 --> 00:30:46,490
I'm sure Sevi doesn’t live
there anymore.

409
00:30:50,744 --> 00:30:51,745
Right.

410
00:30:52,162 --> 00:30:56,165
I remember him saying
that he stays in Makati.

411
00:30:56,166 --> 00:30:58,543
Our condo isn’t in
Makati, though.

412
00:30:58,544 --> 00:31:03,173
Right? And he’s the
head engineer of VGC.

413
00:31:03,382 --> 00:31:06,385
He probably has his
own house now.

414
00:31:07,136 --> 00:31:08,511
Maybe he sold it.

415
00:31:08,512 --> 00:31:09,971
Well, he technically can’t

416
00:31:09,972 --> 00:31:13,517
because that was a
joint property, right?

417
00:31:13,642 --> 00:31:17,396
So you have every
right to live there.

418
00:31:17,855 --> 00:31:19,899
Yes. You’re right, Ida.

419
00:31:20,774 --> 00:31:23,903
And I like that place.
It’s the perfect location.

420
00:31:24,612 --> 00:31:25,737
I’ll think about it.

421
00:31:25,738 --> 00:31:28,198
Okay. Ely, bye for now.
I have to work.

422
00:31:28,616 --> 00:31:31,534
Okay. I’ll talk to you later.
I love and miss you.

423
00:31:31,535 --> 00:31:32,536
Bye.

424
00:31:38,918 --> 00:31:41,503
I haven’t been there
for a very long time.

425
00:31:42,421 --> 00:31:44,673
Is this the right time
to come back?

426
00:31:47,009 --> 00:31:50,386
Bro, you're so slow.
Why can't you keep up today?

427
00:31:50,387 --> 00:31:51,931
I can't keep up with
you anymore?

428
00:31:52,848 --> 00:31:54,224
You’re in good shape, huh?

429
00:31:54,391 --> 00:31:55,559
Of course.

430
00:32:04,485 --> 00:32:06,904
By the way, I have a question.

431
00:32:08,405 --> 00:32:09,447
I know that smile.

432
00:32:09,448 --> 00:32:10,990
I’m going to have to pass
if you'll borrow money.

433
00:32:10,991 --> 00:32:12,409
No, you moron.

434
00:32:12,993 --> 00:32:13,994
Well…

435
00:32:15,496 --> 00:32:17,413
I have a hypothetical question.

436
00:32:17,414 --> 00:32:18,415
Okay?

437
00:32:19,124 --> 00:32:21,417
If someone borrowed your
power bank

438
00:32:21,418 --> 00:32:24,755
and then drove all the way
from Manila to Batangas

439
00:32:25,381 --> 00:32:27,925
to return it to you,
what does that mean?

440
00:32:29,301 --> 00:32:31,178
Wow, hypothetical?

441
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:32,929
What is it?

442
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,264
Who is that about?

443
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:37,850
I told you, it’s a
hypothetical question.

444
00:32:37,851 --> 00:32:39,352
Of course, I need to know
who it’s about.

445
00:32:39,353 --> 00:32:40,436
What’s your relationship
with them?

446
00:32:40,437 --> 00:32:43,189
Is that person your friend,
your girlfriend, or your ex?

447
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,692
If it’s a friend, it means they
owe you something

448
00:32:45,693 --> 00:32:47,361
and want to make it up to you.

449
00:32:47,653 --> 00:32:50,446
If that person is your
girlfriend, then they love you

450
00:32:50,447 --> 00:32:53,283
so much that they drove that
far just to return a power bank.

451
00:32:53,575 --> 00:32:55,160
And if it’s an ex…

452
00:32:56,078 --> 00:32:57,495
It would mean that they
want to see you.

453
00:32:57,496 --> 00:32:59,665
That means she still has
feelings for you.

454
00:33:05,796 --> 00:33:08,966
Really?
You think so?

455
00:33:09,258 --> 00:33:12,010
Are you an idiot?
Isn’t this hypothetical?

456
00:33:12,011 --> 00:33:13,678
We’re talking about a
hypothetical situation,

457
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,222
which means, it’s not based
on real life.

458
00:33:16,223 --> 00:33:17,224
Am I right?

459
00:33:19,643 --> 00:33:20,894
Yes, you're right.

460
00:33:21,895 --> 00:33:24,188
So Elyse returned the
power bank you lent her.

461
00:33:24,189 --> 00:33:26,984
Hey! What do you mean?
It’s not about Elyse.

462
00:33:28,193 --> 00:33:30,237
Can’t fool me with that
hypothetical question.

463
00:33:30,738 --> 00:33:33,072
I heard you’re working together.

464
00:33:33,073 --> 00:33:35,075
So that means you see
each other a lot.

465
00:33:35,576 --> 00:33:37,493
No wonder you’re always
at the gym.

466
00:33:37,494 --> 00:33:38,578
Fuck, you talk too much.

467
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:39,996
- Jeez!
- Whatever, boy.

468
00:33:39,997 --> 00:33:42,416
Sevi really is in good shape!

469
00:33:45,085 --> 00:33:47,755
Should I just go back
to Unit 1432?

470
00:33:49,173 --> 00:33:53,843
Ida has a point. It’s more
convenient to stay there.

471
00:33:53,844 --> 00:33:56,597
Besides, I doubt
Sevi’s using it.

472
00:33:57,014 --> 00:34:00,017
The last memory we had
there was too painful.

473
00:34:06,869 --> 00:34:07,870
Elyse?

474
00:34:11,987 --> 00:34:14,114
Sam!
My god!

475
00:34:14,823 --> 00:34:16,074
- Hi!
- How are you?

476
00:34:16,075 --> 00:34:17,076
Have a seat.

477
00:34:17,826 --> 00:34:20,120
I heard you were out of the
country for years.

478
00:34:21,371 --> 00:34:23,707
Yes— I just...

479
00:34:23,874 --> 00:34:26,585
I really wanted to travel.

480
00:34:28,837 --> 00:34:30,631
How about you? How are you?

481
00:34:31,006 --> 00:34:34,384
I heard that your club is doing
really well. That’s great.

482
00:34:34,593 --> 00:34:36,594
Yes, you should stop by.

483
00:34:36,595 --> 00:34:40,056
Just message me if you want to
visit, I’ll reserve you a table.

484
00:34:40,057 --> 00:34:41,308
Bring your friends, too.

485
00:34:42,142 --> 00:34:44,436
Actually, if you want, you
can go there tonight.

486
00:34:45,604 --> 00:34:49,650
I really want to come but
I don’t have any friends.

487
00:34:49,942 --> 00:34:51,567
Anyway, I have to go, Ely.

488
00:34:51,568 --> 00:34:53,069
- Okay.
- See you soon at the club, okay?

489
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,070
Yes, sure.

490
00:34:54,279 --> 00:34:55,739
Just message me.

491
00:34:59,827 --> 00:35:01,662
I’ve got nothing to do anymore.

492
00:35:01,912 --> 00:35:03,956
But I don’t want to go home yet.

493
00:35:04,498 --> 00:35:06,500
The house just feels empty.

494
00:35:08,544 --> 00:35:11,129
Should I go to Sam’s club?

495
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,840
But I don’t want to go alone.

496
00:35:22,933 --> 00:35:26,937
Is it too absurd to go
clubbing with your boss?

497
00:35:39,783 --> 00:35:41,201
Alice, hi!

498
00:35:43,495 --> 00:35:46,290
I’m planning to go to my
friend’s club tonight.

499
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:49,253
By any chance, are you free?

500
00:35:49,626 --> 00:35:50,627
My treat.

501
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:56,065
Wow, a club! And it’s your
treat, ma’am? Of course, I’m in!

502
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,424
What time and where?

503
00:36:18,447 --> 00:36:19,406
So nice to meet you.

504
00:36:19,406 --> 00:36:20,199
Nice to meet you, too.

505
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,284
Thank you so much for having me.
I’m such a fan of your work.

506
00:36:23,285 --> 00:36:24,368
Really?
Are you having fun?

507
00:36:24,369 --> 00:36:27,872
Yes. Thank you so much. You’re
so beautiful in person.

508
00:36:27,873 --> 00:36:28,873
Thank you.

509
00:36:28,874 --> 00:36:30,333
Wow, I’m really starstruck...

510
00:36:30,334 --> 00:36:31,335
Sam!

511
00:36:31,543 --> 00:36:33,086
- Ely, hi!
- Hi!

512
00:36:34,046 --> 00:36:35,838
I’m so happy you came.

513
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,715
Thank you for inviting me. And…

514
00:36:37,716 --> 00:36:41,677
I see that you’ve already
met my sec— My friend,

515
00:36:41,678 --> 00:36:43,346
- Alice.
- Yes.

516
00:36:43,347 --> 00:36:47,016
Ma’am, I’ve already introduced
myself to Miss Samantha.

517
00:36:47,017 --> 00:36:49,102
I’m actually a fan of her work.

518
00:36:50,354 --> 00:36:52,731
Girls, I ordered you
drinks, okay?

519
00:36:53,148 --> 00:36:54,857
Ely, I’m just going to see
my other friends.

520
00:36:54,858 --> 00:36:55,359
Okay.

521
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,525
Enjoy the night, girls.

522
00:36:56,526 --> 00:36:56,985
Thank you, Sam.

523
00:36:56,986 --> 00:36:58,737
Thank you, Miss Samantha.

524
00:36:59,529 --> 00:37:03,908
Wow. Thank you so much for
inviting me here, ma’am.

525
00:37:03,909 --> 00:37:05,701
It’s so nice here.

526
00:37:05,702 --> 00:37:08,579
You can call me Elyse.

527
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,207
We’re outside of work anyway.

528
00:37:10,624 --> 00:37:11,541
Thank you, ma’am.

529
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:14,377
But I feel like I’m used to
calling you ma’am now.

530
00:37:14,378 --> 00:37:18,048
Plus, I can’t call my boss
by her first name.

531
00:37:21,176 --> 00:37:24,095
Excuse me, ma’am. Your drinks.

532
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:28,224
Ma’am, what is this?
A boxing ring with a laser show?

533
00:37:28,225 --> 00:37:31,311
Wow! This looks expensive!

534
00:37:32,562 --> 00:37:33,688
Shall we take a shot?

535
00:37:33,689 --> 00:37:36,732
Alice, what the hell is this?

536
00:37:36,733 --> 00:37:40,070
I don’t know, ma’am.
But it looks good.

537
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,740
Honestly, it looks—
It looks expensive.

538
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,201
Wait!

539
00:37:47,077 --> 00:37:48,453
Is this strong?

540
00:37:48,912 --> 00:37:52,332
This is just a warm-up,
ma’am. The night is young!

541
00:37:54,334 --> 00:37:55,335
Shot?

542
00:37:56,086 --> 00:37:57,421
Cheers!

543
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:59,131
Cheers.

544
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,511
Wow!

545
00:38:07,222 --> 00:38:09,308
It really tastes
expensive, ma’am.

546
00:38:09,683 --> 00:38:11,018
It burns!

547
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,103
Are you okay?

548
00:38:13,937 --> 00:38:18,107
I mean, it’s good, but I think
I’d prefer a cocktail instead.

549
00:38:18,108 --> 00:38:20,610
Of course, ma’am. Let’s order!

550
00:38:21,987 --> 00:38:22,987
Okay.

551
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,891
Let’s dance, ma’am.

552
00:38:51,892 --> 00:38:54,769
Okay, here. Shots of
confidence, ma’am.

553
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:58,481
I promise. You’re going to dance
like crazy with this.

554
00:38:58,482 --> 00:39:00,941
Take a shot, ma’am.

555
00:39:00,942 --> 00:39:04,571
The night is young, young is
the night. Let’s do this!

556
00:39:05,489 --> 00:39:07,073
Let’s go, cheers!

557
00:39:07,074 --> 00:39:08,116
Cheers.

558
00:39:09,493 --> 00:39:11,494
Bottoms up, ma’am.
Bottoms up.

559
00:39:11,495 --> 00:39:13,663
It’s good, I promise.

560
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:16,833
All right!

561
00:39:16,834 --> 00:39:18,627
Okay, one more for good
luck, ma’am.

562
00:39:19,836 --> 00:39:20,920
Maybe, maybe later?

563
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:22,630
It’s okay, it’s okay.

564
00:39:22,631 --> 00:39:24,632
I’m here. Ma’am, I’m here.

565
00:39:24,633 --> 00:39:26,759
Don’t worry. I got you.

566
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,843
Cheers!

567
00:39:27,844 --> 00:39:30,597
Cheers! Bottoms up.

568
00:39:36,561 --> 00:39:37,937
One last shot?

569
00:39:37,938 --> 00:39:39,147
The final shot?

570
00:39:39,439 --> 00:39:41,482
- Okay.
- You got this.

571
00:39:41,483 --> 00:39:43,109
You got this.

572
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,027
Let’s go. Is it hot?

573
00:39:45,028 --> 00:39:46,321
Cheers!

574
00:39:46,346 --> 00:39:48,026
There's a lot if people.

575
00:39:53,078 --> 00:39:55,830
Ready? Are you ready
to party, ma’am?

576
00:39:55,831 --> 00:39:58,875
Yes, let’s go. Come on!
Let’s dance, come on!

577
00:40:06,091 --> 00:40:08,552
One more?
One more, of course, ma’am.

578
00:40:08,927 --> 00:40:10,095
Wow, ma’am.

579
00:40:12,889 --> 00:40:13,890
Okay.

580
00:40:44,171 --> 00:40:45,172
Oh my god.

581
00:40:45,505 --> 00:40:46,089
We should drink more.

582
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,299
No.

583
00:40:48,425 --> 00:40:49,426
We’ve had enough.

584
00:40:49,843 --> 00:40:51,594
We finished, like, everything.

585
00:40:51,595 --> 00:40:53,472
No, there’s still more.

586
00:40:54,264 --> 00:40:55,265
One—
Hey…

587
00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:00,770
You two look nice.

588
00:41:02,189 --> 00:41:04,064
Well, I’m not nice.

589
00:41:04,065 --> 00:41:06,151
Not nice, she said.

590
00:41:07,152 --> 00:41:10,155
You girls want to share a
table with us?

591
00:41:11,615 --> 00:41:14,325
Wait…
Are you both single?

592
00:41:14,326 --> 00:41:16,994
I’m in a situationship.

593
00:41:16,995 --> 00:41:20,623
And she’s single, but she’s
not interested.

594
00:41:20,624 --> 00:41:22,249
- Bye!
- Are you serious?

595
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,084
Bye!

596
00:41:23,085 --> 00:41:24,418
You’re seriously turning
us down?

597
00:41:24,419 --> 00:41:26,045
We’re pretty hot, you know?

598
00:41:26,046 --> 00:41:27,546
Maybe we should just look
for boys instead.

599
00:41:27,547 --> 00:41:30,689
- Let’s go.
- As if.

600
00:41:37,015 --> 00:41:38,599
- Let’s have more shots!
- No!

601
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,769
- One more!
- Okay!

602
00:41:41,269 --> 00:41:45,940
We’re done, because—
We have a meeting...

603
00:41:45,941 --> 00:41:48,150
We have a meeting tomorrow!

604
00:41:48,151 --> 00:41:49,860
You might not be able to
get up early.

605
00:41:49,861 --> 00:41:52,404
No, I still want to drink.

606
00:41:52,405 --> 00:41:54,198
I want to keep drinking.

607
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:55,199
No.

608
00:41:55,492 --> 00:41:56,492
No.

609
00:41:57,744 --> 00:41:58,953
Okay, okay.

610
00:41:58,954 --> 00:42:01,872
Last one, okay?
Last one.

611
00:42:01,873 --> 00:42:03,708
- Promise me?
- Yes!

612
00:42:04,751 --> 00:42:05,752
One more!

613
00:42:18,598 --> 00:42:20,850
Ma’am?
Ma’am.

614
00:42:21,351 --> 00:42:24,853
Roel is already waiting outside.
Let’s go?

615
00:42:24,854 --> 00:42:26,648
- Huh?
- Let’s go.

616
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:29,233
Okay. Your bag’s here.

617
00:42:29,234 --> 00:42:31,318
- Okay, fine.
- Your bag?

618
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:33,071
Yes, we should go.
Okay.

619
00:43:03,393 --> 00:43:04,394
What the fuck?

620
00:43:04,978 --> 00:43:06,688
What are you doing here?
Oh my god!

621
00:43:07,272 --> 00:43:09,399
Fuck! You creep!
Mommy!

622
00:43:09,941 --> 00:43:11,276
Pervert!

623
00:43:17,449 --> 00:43:20,035
What the hell are you
doing here?

624
00:44:06,122 --> 00:44:09,458
You're not the only owner
of this unit.

625
00:44:09,459 --> 00:44:12,754
You're really good at popping
up out of nowhere.

626
00:44:16,758 --> 00:44:19,551
Are you staying here tonight?

627
00:44:19,552 --> 00:44:22,555
Finish that up.
So you can take your medicine.

628
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:25,625
But I’ve decided that I
want to stay here indefinitely.

629
00:44:31,189 --> 00:44:32,190
Okay.

630
00:44:32,649 --> 00:44:34,317
Let’s live together again.
