1
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,660
Bastard, bastard, bastard...

2
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,400
ba, ba, ba...

3
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:46,660
That coward... looks being the only thing that is better than me.

4
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,990
You bastard!

5
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:07,240
<i>Miss Change</i>

6
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,700
Did I not tell you to stop bringing women when I am around?

7
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,000
Hey...

8
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,930
I couldn't afford it to go to a motel!!

9
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,630
Hello?

10
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,590
You coward...

11
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,930
H, hello...

12
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,460
Oh, my! It's true.

13
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,230
I told you.

14
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,430
Can't you look in my eyes?

15
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,930
Jae Chil!

16
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,060
You should say your hello properly.

17
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,430
Look in her eyes.

18
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,530
In her eyes.

19
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,460
- Don't be late.<b>- Whatever.</b>

20
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,930
Lawyer Chil...

21
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,660
You're an idiot!

22
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,760
You know what?

23
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,200
Wherever you go; the first in the bar exam, the first in the training institute...

24
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,030
they are all filled with women.

25
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,760
Look at you.

26
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,130
Will you continue to be like this whenever

27
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,230
you meet women prosecutors and lawyers?

28
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,300
I'm sorry, sir. I have nothing to say.

29
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,360
Such a smooth talker only to men.

30
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,360
Get out of here.

31
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,930
I said get out.

32
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,230
Lawyer Chil!

33
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,560
Losing another case would be your 7th loss in a row.

34
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,960
Why would he not call him 'Lawyer Lee' but 'Lawyer Chil'?

35
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,730
'Cause he's clumsy and good-for-nothing.

36
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,460
Oppa...

37
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,160
Busy?

38
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,460
Soo Hyeon...

39
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,960
What are you doing?

40
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,360
Don't worry.

41
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,900
You'll win next time.

42
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,630
Cause I'll cheer you up.

43
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,560
What?

44
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,060
Stay still!

45
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,430
Look, our body never lies.

46
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,430
How's that? Do you like it?

47
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,400
Yeah, I love it...

48
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,160
Good...

49
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,390
Sunbae!

50
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,400
You must have dreamt a good dream.

51
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,360
You're here lawyer Kim?

52
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,830
How did your case go?

53
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,460
I won.

54
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,760
You're the best lawyer in this company.

55
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,530
You're on a winning streak.

56
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,800
Don't tease me.

57
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,390
Your advice was very helpful.

58
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,560
Thank you.

59
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,760
It's nothing.

60
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,400
Can you do me a favor?

61
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,600
What's that?

62
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,760
I have to go somewhere with the boss.

63
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,800
So, will you talk with my client?

64
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,760
She's in my office.

65
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,460
Sure, I will.

66
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,030
Thank you, sunbae.

67
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,560
Don't worry about tomorrow's case.<b>You've worked hard on that one.</b>

68
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,030
Fighting!

69
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,560
Fighting!

70
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,200
So, your husband...

71
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,130
He must be cheating on me.

72
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,800
But the thing is...

73
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,660
I can't find hard evidence.

74
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,130
I see.

75
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:21,300
He said he will never agree to a divorce.

76
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,860
To file a suit for divorce, I must catch them in action.

77
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,590
My goodness.

78
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,900
It's really annoying!

79
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,060
Mr. Lee!

80
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,460
The thing is...

81
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:41,330
it's not necessary to catch them in action.

82
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:47,060
Text messages he sent to his lover will have enough legal power.

83
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,900
Really?

84
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,200
You dirty pervert!

85
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,260
Why did you stare at her boobs?

86
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,760
I didn't see her boobs.

87
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,560
I saw her Adam's apple.

88
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,460
Anyway, another loss will make it my 7th loss in a row.

89
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,700
They tease me calling me 'Lawyer Chil'.

90
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,160
I don't wanna go to work.

91
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,030
What about seeing a shrink?

92
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,760
Prosecutor Jo is such a fastidious bitch.

93
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,130
Just shut your eyes when you plead.

94
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,030
That will work!

95
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,830
Do you really think it will work?

96
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,360
You wanker.

97
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,960
Your problem will be solved once you get laid.

98
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,500
Why does every conversation with you lead to sex...

99
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,060
For you, is everything about sex?

100
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,430
By the way...

101
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,460
Does sex feel good?

102
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,830
Of course.

103
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,130
I'll give a lesson.

104
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,360
For starters, stroke her head gently.

105
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,760
Then...

106
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,460
From her ear to her boobs,

107
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,930
fondle as much as you can.

108
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,430
Make her horny! Get it?

109
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,060
Then it's time...

110
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,130
to become one.

111
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,500
Become one?

112
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,800
Shut your eyes gently.

113
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,860
Lift her up in your arms

114
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,800
and put her on your thighs.

115
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,030
Then, get into the rhythm with her.

116
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:45,130
When it feels great...

117
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,800
What are you doing when I am giving you such a good lesson?

118
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,360
What kind of man could sleep with her?

119
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,960
Who could?

120
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,460
I'm the kind of guy.

121
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,060
See you at home.

122
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,900
A beautiful woman alone in a bar.

123
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,200
Who's the guy? I should scold him.

124
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,300
Who says you can sit, wanker?

125
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,200
You're very honest.

126
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,830
I like it.

127
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,160
That's a load of bullshit.

128
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,430
Have your corny pick up lines ever worked?

129
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,760
Just go and hit on something else.

130
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,960
Have a nice evening.

138
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,400
No, Mr. Lee.

139
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,860
How can it be possible?

140
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,600
I said I would win today.

141
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,160
One win and 6 losses. Eventually, you won!

142
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,460
But still you are nothing to Lawyer Kim.

143
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,800
Relax your leg.

144
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,300
But still, in the old days

145
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,700
they say "a good beginning is half the battle."

146
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,960
Yes, it has just begun.

147
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,200
By the way...

148
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,730
you closed your eyes during closing argument.

149
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,590
Why? Because Prosecutor Jo is a woman?

150
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,030
That's absurd.

151
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:28,530
I did it on purpose

152
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,560
to make the atmosphere more dramatic.

153
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,030
That's why...

154
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,490
I see.

155
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,030
Did you?

156
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,330
Here!

157
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,100
- You're here, sunbae.<b>- Hi, Soo Hyeon.</b>

158
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,630
Congratulations Lawyer Chil.

159
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,430
I heard you gave a blow to Prosecutor Jo at the court.

160
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,760
I heard she completely freaked out.

161
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,130
How do you feel?

162
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,800
I feel like flying.

163
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,400
Sunbae, congratulations on your win!

164
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,430
Thank you.

165
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,230
Right. You won your case, too.

166
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,300
Yes, I did.

167
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,200
Wow, how many wins is that?

168
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,230
A lawyer ought to win their cases.

169
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:38,890
That's right... If you're a lawyer, it's obvious<b>that you should win.</b>

170
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:46,430
Anyway, thanks to both of you.

171
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:49,930
Today, we won three cases.

172
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,230
We must celebrate today.

173
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,960
Let's toast.

174
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,130
Cheers!

175
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,100
- Cheers!<b>- Cheers!</b>

176
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,800
4th round!

177
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,030
Lawyer Kim! Let's go 4th round.

178
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,760
Let's chase a hangover.

179
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,490
- Sir.<b>- Yes?</b>

180
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,160
- I'm going home.<b>- No, you aren't.</b>

181
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,200
Sunbae, I should go.

182
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,060
Yeah, you must be tired.

183
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,630
- Taxi!<b>- Are you ignoring me?</b>

184
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,300
I'm your boss!

185
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,360
- Where are you going?<b>- See you tomorrow.</b>

186
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,660
Take care.

187
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,060
Hey! Stop there!

188
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,430
Don't go!

189
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:33,060
33 A...

190
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,800
33-A-7913...

191
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,760
You idiot.

192
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,860
Do I look drunk?

193
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,930
Don't you know why I did that?

194
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,260
Aigoo...

195
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:53,660
Why don't you scatter the road with flowers?

196
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,130
To celebrate her leaving.

197
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:58,330
And then lay down in her way so she can step on you.

198
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,460
Such a tactless guy.

199
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,960
What should I do with you?

200
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,200
Let's have another drink.

201
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,100
Thank you.

202
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,060
What's there?

203
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,700
Hey!

204
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,230
Hey, wake up!

205
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,260
Where's your house? It's raining!

206
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,130
Just a second!

207
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,530
The battery is dead.

208
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,030
Wait here.

209
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,060
Gosh, what have I done?

210
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,860
Excuse me, miss!

211
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,300
Wake up!

212
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,900
She's not breathing.

213
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,860
<i>A pervert lawyer kidnapped and murdered a woman.</i>

214
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,430
<i>He is crazy about women.</i>

215
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,160
<i>He's never got laid.</i>

216
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,300
<i>Such a clumsy pervert.</i>

217
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,260
<i>He kept staring my breasts while we were talking.</i>

218
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,960
<i>Just by looking at him, you can tell he's a pervert!</i>

219
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,260
<i>Pervert, trash like guy.</i>

220
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,360
Lady, you shouldn't be here...

221
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,860
Miss, wake up!

222
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,860
Wake up!

223
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,530
You should wake...

224
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,690
What's this?

225
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,000
My goodness!

226
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,860
Gosh...

227
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,260
Omo...

228
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,600
I'm screwed.

229
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,160
<i>Honey, answer the phone.</i>

230
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,900
Is mine ringing?

231
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,460
Who's calling at this hour?

232
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,890
<i>Hurry up.</i>

233
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,420
Aish. Seriously...

234
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,330
What? You wanker.

235
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:07,730
As you said, I got a room tonight.

236
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,960
What a waste of money...

237
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,060
What is this, say something!

238
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,960
<i>Well...</i>

239
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,490
<i>Hyeon Gu, listen.</i>

240
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,930
What's this?

241
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:21,160
Who is this?

242
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,660
<i>It's me.</i>

243
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,900
Who's this?

244
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,530
Why are you using Jae Chil's phone?

245
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,660
<i>Aish...</i>

246
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,300
<i>It's an emergency.</i>

247
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,130
<i>Jae Chil is dead.</i>

248
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,390
He sleeps like a dead person when he's drunk.

249
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:42,160
I'm sure it will be hard, but please, take care of him well.

250
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,820
- No, listen to me-<b>- At the moment I am very busy.</b>

251
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,530
<i>Hey! Wait a second.</i>

252
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,430
I have to get off.

253
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,960
<i>Jae Chil is really dead!</i>

254
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,760
<i>I'm talking about your friend, Lee Jae Chil!</i>

255
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,490
- What you said?<b>- He's dead!</b>

256
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,300
Where are you now?

257
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,760
<i>My home.</i>

258
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,930
<i>I'm at Jae Chil's home.</i>

259
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:02,460
Wait for me. Do not go anywhere!

260
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,030
Aish, what's happened...

261
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,500
<i>Oppa, what are you doing?</i>

262
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,030
Jae Chil, wake up!

263
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,500
Jae Chil!

264
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,100
Wanker, don't die! You're still a virgin!

265
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,800
Wake up!

266
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,900
Jae Chil!

267
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,360
My goodness!

268
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,430
YOU! I know you!

269
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,030
The girl at the bar!

270
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,100
What are you doing here?

271
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,360
Why did you kill him!?

272
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,430
I didn't kill him.

273
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,100
You...

274
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,860
Are you a gold digging killer?

275
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,100
You killed him 'cause he's a rich lawyer?

276
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,030
What's the slapping for?

277
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:01,660
Did you ever give me a time to answer your questions?

278
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,760
Okay, fine...

279
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,360
then, explain what happened!

280
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,560
Aish, it kills me.

281
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,200
The truth is...

282
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,760
I am Lee Jae Chil.

283
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,130
Of course, the body is not.

284
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,500
I mean the mind.

285
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,760
It's Jae Chil. Your bosom buddy.

286
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,830
Lee Jae Chil.

287
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,460
Right.

288
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,730
I shut my eyes during closing argument as you said.

289
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,900
So, I won the case. You know that?

290
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,230
I see.

291
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:50,000
That's why you killed him!

292
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,930
Prosecutor Jo sent you! I knew it!

293
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,060
Trying to frame your murder on me?

294
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:01,630
Listen. I've tried to take the bar exam 8 times!

295
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,590
How dare you!

296
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,300
You just wait here!

297
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,030
I'll kick your ass.

298
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,730
Jo Hyeon Gu!

299
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,100
The day after you had circumcision,

300
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,300
you watched porn and the stitches burst.

301
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,390
When you were 16, in winter,

302
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,930
I took you to the urologist instead of your mom.

303
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:27,700
You were pleased it got bigger after the surgery.

304
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,700
And one more,

305
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,760
Kim Soo Hyeon.

306
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,600
I had dibs on her first, but you seduced her.

307
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:40,200
I even wrote letters for you at the army!

308
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,930
I didn't seduce her, she approached me first...

309
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,800
Who the hell are you?

310
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,730
How did you know all those things?

311
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:53,230
I'm Lee Jae Chil. Who's been your friend for 25 years.

312
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,490
Aish! What is all this?

313
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,690
Alright.

314
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,560
Tell me how you became a woman.

315
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:10,000
While I was coming home back from drinking,

316
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I saw something red next to the rubbish bin.

317
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,660
So, I went to have a look.

318
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:20,660
It was this girl, so I was worried about her...

319
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,860
You got worried? It's possible.

320
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,100
So, I brought her into the house.

321
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,100
Then, I found out...

322
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,300
She wasn't breathing.

323
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,960
So, I tried to take her out where I found her, but then I fell.

324
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,460
When I came to my senses,

325
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,600
I was her, and she was me.

326
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,030
Our bodies got...

327
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,900
Combined? Or transformed?

328
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,460
Transformed?

329
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,000
Transform, yeah right...

330
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,360
Are you filming Transformers right now?

331
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:00,360
25 years is worth nothing!?

332
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,560
How can you not recognize me!?

333
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,060
I do but...

334
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,560
You don't look like Jae Chil,

335
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,930
but you talk just like him.

336
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,160
I told you that I am Jae Chil. Lee Jae Chil!

337
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,160
Okay.

338
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,530
I still don't understand what happened!

339
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,930
Are you saying

340
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,430
Jae Chil's soul has come

341
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,960
into this girl's body?

342
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,900
That's right.

343
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,830
Aish! This is absurd.

344
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,490
Alright!

345
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:43,860
Let's try to solve this problem.

346
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,530
Sounds good!

347
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,900
Hey, look at this.

348
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,260
I found it!

349
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,930
What is it?

350
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:01,060
A car accident could switch your souls.

351
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,230
What if I die?

352
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,730
It's possible.

353
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,800
'Cause you are not a stunt woman.

354
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,630
Or Yin Yang might work.

355
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,700
What do you mean?

356
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,130
Sleep together.

357
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,460
- Sleep together?<b>- Yup.</b>

358
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,030
What kind of animal are you?

359
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:32,860
You have a look! It's written here!<b>It's just one of the options!</b>

360
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,130
Want another beating?

361
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:38,000
Now that he's taller, he's acting violent...

362
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,460
This sounds reasonable.

363
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,700
They say getting struck by lightning works.

364
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,000
- Lightning?<b>- Yup.</b>

365
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:59,400
Oh my! What if I die?

366
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,960
Then, will you live as a woman?

367
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:10,060
Actually, I like your boobs, I mean... your mind.

368
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,660
Are you not going to shut up

369
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,060
I won't die, will I?

370
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,530
It's Ok.

371
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:26,100
After getting hit by lightning, there's more people<b> that didn't die.</b>

372
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,160
I'm scared, you bastard!

373
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,630
Did you get it?

374
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:35,490
If so, how am I talking to you?

375
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:38,930
Aish! What's so difficult?

376
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:41,560
I'm going crazy...

377
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,330
You bastard...

378
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,330
What lightning?

379
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,560
Does that make sense?

380
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,100
Hurry up and go.

381
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,930
I didn't know it would be that difficult.

382
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,100
I'm all wet.

383
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,700
Ah, scared me-

384
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,630
Crazy bitch, why are you taking it off?

385
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,130
How can I take this off?

386
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,300
Aigoo, such an idiot.

387
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,360
- Hey.<b>- Yeah?</b>

388
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,790
Use the hook. Got it?

389
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,960
Thanks.

390
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,260
Jo Hyeon Gu! You want beating?

391
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,230
Did you just get a boner by seeing me naked?

392
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:25,800
Are you crazy? You want to go to the urologist again?

393
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,230
Gosh! When did this thing...

394
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:31,160
Sorry. I'll calm it down.

395
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,830
Keep going.

396
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,260
You're not leaving?

397
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,160
This happens since I'm a healthy...

398
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,930
man...

399
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,500
Go away when I'm still being nice.

400
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:45,060
Are you not going away!?

401
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,430
Feels great.

402
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,900
Do you want some?

403
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,400
No, thank you.

404
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,590
Aigoo, look at you.

405
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,100
What's your problem?

406
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,860
Should I eat being naked?

407
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,060
To turn you on again?

408
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,600
I mean...

409
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,360
Anyway...

410
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,600
You need to go some place with me.

411
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:44,060
Maybe he knows the answer.

412
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:47,400
Answer?

413
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,900
Who's he?

414
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:53,900
The bastard who predicted that I'd fail the exam 8 times.

415
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,900
A bastard?

416
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,560
A real bastard.

417
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,200
A real bastard?

418
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,800
What are you doing? Come in.

419
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,360
Hey, recommend something for her.

420
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,760
Your girlfriend is gorgeous.

421
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,530
Is she a model?

422
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,730
Something that shows her cleavage.

423
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,060
Great.

424
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,060
Charge it please.

425
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,460
Is the man here?

426
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,560
In any situation eating comes first.

427
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:22,130
May I take your order?

428
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,030
One T-bone steak rare.

429
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,600
A steak?

430
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,960
Shall I eat sushi here?

431
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,960
One caesar salad, please.

432
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,300
Yes, sir. Just a moment.

433
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,700
What about my steak?

434
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,400
Just eat what is given.

435
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,130
Am I a dog?

436
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:41,730
To eat what the owner gives.

437
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,700
Anyway, who is he?

438
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,690
You're too noisy.

439
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,090
What?

440
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:56,000
Is this the right place?

441
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,900
Yes, it is.

442
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,230
It's right. It's right here, right here.

443
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,130
Come on in.

444
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:17,060
Where are we?

445
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,630
Let's go.

446
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:43,400
Hi, brother and sister. I am here!<b>Hong Chul is here!</b>

447
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,460
Take your seat. Sit, sit...

448
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,900
I should sit.

449
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:53,600
Not good, not good, not good...

450
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,360
Good, good, good...

451
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,930
Very good, very good...

452
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:58,860
Boobs!

453
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,200
What?

454
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,260
Blinded. You're blinded by love.

455
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,760
You two are such a well-made couple.

456
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,330
But you are overpowering!

457
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,100
She would just eat you up.

458
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,400
What are you talking about?

459
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,730
Let see~...

460
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:18,360
You almost drowned when you were young.

461
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,600
No, I didn't.

462
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,260
I mean her, not you!

463
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,390
I don't think so.

464
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,460
You might have.

465
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:34,360
Your dad will have an accident this year.

466
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,590
A big accident. Very very big!

467
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,260
My dad died.

468
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:44,160
I mean you mom! Yes, your mom~!

469
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,960
She died earlier than my dad did.

470
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,600
What's wrong?

471
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,400
Delicious.

472
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,700
Be careful with her.

473
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,300
There is a sword in her fate.

474
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,760
A man's life is on her palm.

475
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,130
If you want to get married, you must exorcise.

476
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:05,500
Which means Gut. In english "Good".

477
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,530
We're not a couple.

478
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:10,960
Let's go. He's a quack.

479
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,000
He was a good fortune teller when he went <b>with the Kang Ho Dong costume.</b>

480
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,800
Let's go.

481
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,700
A man is trapped in a woman's body.

482
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,230
That's why we're here. What should we do?

483
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,130
But it can be fixed.

484
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,130
An amulet.

485
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:30,900
The amulet I made will fix the problem.

486
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,930
How much is it?

487
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,560
5000 won.

488
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,530
What? He's crazy!

489
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:40,590
5000 won is too expensive. Let's go.

490
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:43,300
Then, live like that forever.

491
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,430
Do I really have to do this?

492
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:50,930
Do you trust that quack we met?

493
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:01,130
Sexual union solves the yin-yang disharmony.

494
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,530
He said it's the best.

495
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,860
I've been keeping my virginity for 32 years

496
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,300
and I'm about to lose it to you.

497
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,900
So... you wanna live like this forever?

498
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,260
Right.

499
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,960
Just once. That'll work.

500
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,100
Alright. Let's do it.

501
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,390
Jo Hyeon Gu.

502
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:34,030
It's a secret between only us.

503
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,160
Even so, let's not kiss.

504
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,960
Fair enough.

505
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,730
I can't do this.

506
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,990
I'm sorry.

507
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:14,030
Then just say so! You shouldn't have kicked!

508
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,030
Damn it!

509
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,400
I don't care anymore!

510
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,260
Jo Hyeon Gu...

511
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,300
Live like that forever!

512
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,300
Let's start all over again.

513
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,800
Tell me everything that happened that day.

514
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,900
On that day,

515
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,230
I get off a taxi at the alley.

516
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,230
I saw...

517
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:49,660
I saw this girl fell on a rubbish heap.

518
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,390
So, I brought her on my back.

519
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:54,260
I changed my clothes.

520
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:58,700
And dried her with a towel.

521
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,300
Why did you bring her in?

522
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,300
Ah, I don't know why!

523
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:09,300
She was unconscious.

524
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,660
I thought to report it to the police,

525
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:15,260
but I could get suspected.

526
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:20,830
So, I tried to take her out and fell down.

527
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:23,530
How deplorable...

528
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,530
And then?

529
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,160
Transformed?

530
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,660
Yep.

531
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,160
Since I fell down, I'm stuck in this body.

532
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,000
Fell down...

533
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:39,690
Something happened when they fell down?

534
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,000
Ah, right!

535
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,660
That's right~.

536
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,030
Now, I remember.

537
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:48,460
When we fell down,

538
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,900
her lips touched mine.

539
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,560
You idiot!

540
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,600
How can you forget that?

541
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:06,300
What are you doing? Just do it.

542
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:10,460
But this is me.

543
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:15,030
Will you kiss yourself? Or sleep with me?

544
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,400
You don't have another choice!

545
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,400
Just do it.

546
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,030
Oh, my! What just happened?

547
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:31,500
Hey!

548
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,300
Jae Chil!

549
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,000
Are you okay?

550
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,230
Open your eyes.

551
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:39,200
Jae Chil, wake up.

552
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,800
Aish, now what?

553
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,590
Jae Chil, wake up.

554
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,660
Hey!

555
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,600
What's happened?

556
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,700
Hyeon Gu.

557
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,200
Gosh, he's back!

558
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,930
I'm...

559
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:00,060
I'm back!

560
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:09,200
Thank you, Hyeon Gu. You're my hero!

561
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,560
I knew you could do anything but pass the exam.

562
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,260
You bastard.

563
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,760
Aish, you bastard, welcome back!

564
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,500
So happy to see you.

565
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,000
Am I really back?

566
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,930
I think so.

567
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:29,890
Yep, I'm back.

568
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,460
Now, what about her?

569
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,290
I don't know.

570
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,160
Who do you think she is?

571
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,300
I'll ask her background check tomorrow.

572
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,130
If she has criminal record, I can tell who she is.

573
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:54,030
But something ticks me.

574
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:56,960
You're talking bullshit again.

575
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:59,960
But it's okay for now.

576
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,900
What is it, Sir?

577
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,230
Well...

578
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,900
Check her background please.

579
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:20,160
Who is she?

580
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,030
I don't know, that's why I'm asking.

581
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,700
With only a picture?

582
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,500
There are fingerprints on the back.

583
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:29,330
Fingerprints?

584
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,030
She has criminal record?

585
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,930
I don't know.

586
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,400
Am I a detective?

587
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,430
With only a picture...

588
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:43,230
I'll try my best, sir.

589
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:47,600
Please. Th- thank you so much.

590
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,630
I said please!

591
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:58,360
Sunbae, what is it?

592
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,960
Nothing. Never mind.

593
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,430
Are you ready?

594
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:06,930
We are seeing the legal team of Jin Young.

595
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,830
Yeah, I'm ready. Let's go.

596
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,900
Are you alright?

597
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,060
I'm fine.

598
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,800
Give me that.

599
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:31,660
Are you okay?

600
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,960
Are you really okay?

601
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,560
Thanks, sunbae!

602
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,230
Don't mention it.

603
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:46,330
This reminds me of when we went to Mt. Yumyeong.

604
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:49,200
I passed out while hiking.

605
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,790
So, you and Hyeon Gu carried me on your back.

606
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:55,800
Right, we did.

607
00:43:57,030 --> 00:44:00,660
Three of us had a great time then.

608
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:04,330
I visited you and Hyeon Gu when you were in the army.

609
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:10,430
That was already 10 years ago.

610
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,990
I was fresh and young that time.

611
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,630
You're still pretty.

612
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:17,200
Sorry?

613
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,130
You still look okay.

614
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,460
What?

615
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,600
Can you walk?

616
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,130
Yeah, I'm ok.

617
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,160
Be careful.

618
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:47,700
Sunbae, you're not eating?

619
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,130
You don't eat dog meat soup?

620
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:52,930
What?

621
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:54,360
No.

622
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,330
I can eat.

623
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:00,700
Looks like you don't like it.

624
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,800
No.

625
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,830
I'm not picky about food.

626
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:07,400
I knew it.

627
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,130
Sunbae!

628
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:14,530
Here.

629
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:17,130
I heard this is really good for men.

630
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:19,500
Right.

631
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:23,030
Look, ace lady.

632
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:28,500
So the unmarried man is the only man here and the<b> boss who gives you pay check is not, is that it?</b>

633
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,660
My dear boss.

634
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,960
Long life to you.

635
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:40,260
I was fishing for compliments, but since a pretty <b>lady gave it to me, it does look good</b>

636
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:43,060
Feels great. Shall we toast?

637
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,060
Yeah!

638
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:45,960
- Fill your glass up.<b>- Good.</b>

639
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,300
To another win!

640
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,730
Cheers!

641
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,630
Enjoy your dinner. Bottoms up.

642
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:52,960
Sir.

643
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,460
I love you.

644
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:57,630
Shut up.

645
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:03,860
I'll leave you out here. Have a great time.

646
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:06,400
Sir, leaving so soon? It's just started.

647
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,830
It's sad to see you go.

648
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:10,000
- Mr. Jin.<b>- Yes, sir?</b>

649
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
How many times should I tell you?

650
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,600
When you tell a lie,

651
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,860
make it sound sincere at least.

652
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:22,260
Have a great time!

653
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:27,660
Don't pay with a company card.

654
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:30,430
Enjoy the next round!

655
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:31,560
See you tomorrow!

656
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,600
- Take care.<b>- Bye.</b>

657
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,590
- Bye.<b>- Bye.</b>

658
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:43,200
Alright, the old folk has gone now.

659
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,700
What about that club for the next round? Okay?

660
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,200
- Okay.<b>- I love it.</b>

661
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,700
Lawyer Lee, I'm guessing you don't like nightclubs.

662
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:53,960
Sorry?

663
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:57,030
You don't even make eye contact with women.

664
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:00,260
How can you dance in a crowd?

665
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,530
Well, it's possi-...

666
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:06,630
Eh? Eh? You're not feeling well?

667
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:09,330
He's sweating. How sad.

668
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:10,900
Then, let's go to a club.

669
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,700
Okay? Good.

670
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:17,160
Then, I should get going...

671
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,130
Bye.

672
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:20,400
Sunbae, it'll be nice with you, though.

673
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,760
We've never gone clubbing together.

674
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,200
I'll take a rain check.

675
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:30,930
Go before you miss the last bus.

676
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:35,300
This is better. Let's go.

677
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:58,030
I'm home.

678
00:47:58,030 --> 00:47:59,630
Oh, hello.

679
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:09,300
Why are you so depressed?

680
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,300
Can't you adapt yourself to your body?

681
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,500
Shall we go clubbing?

682
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,000
Clubbing?

683
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,660
With you? Impossible.

684
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:19,800
I know.

685
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,360
But what about her?

686
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,000
So what...? Wanna go back to her?

687
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,960
Hey you bastard.

688
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,960
You want to lose your virginity in her body?

689
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:41,460
How pathetic are you?

690
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:48,760
Jae Chil, is there something wrong?

691
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:54,960
Nothing. I was just joking.

692
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,260
Never mind.

693
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,130
Let's go! Club!

694
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,060
But stay away from me.

695
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:12,060
Girls might mistake you for my girlfriend.

696
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,800
It's been a long time since I made a visit to the buffet of women.

697
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,560
I love it.

698
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,930
I'll take shower first.

699
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:25,260
Dress naughtily!

700
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:45,560
You're a baby.

701
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,730
Ehh.

702
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:48,330
Ehh...

703
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:10,360
You came alone?

704
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,860
Hyeon Gu Oppa?

705
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,430
Soo Hyeon, long time no see.

706
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:35,360
Yeah... How have you been?

707
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,760
Well, not bad.

708
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,730
Do you know her?

709
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:47,300
Dongsaeng. She's my little sister.

710
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:53,030
By the way, is Jae Chil sunbae alright?

711
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:55,860
Ah, Jae Chil?

712
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:59,130
He's at home. He said he was tired so wanted to get some rest.

713
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:28,330
Let me think.

714
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:39,160
What happened?

715
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:43,400
I thought you finally got laid.

716
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:48,860
I thought you'd get laid with your ex-girlfriend.

717
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:51,960
Bastard with a grudge.

718
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,960
Did you see a bus running backwards?

719
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:58,330
There are lots of new girls, why would I do that?

720
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,760
That's right.

721
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,660
I almost forgot who you are.

722
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:09,060
I can believe that.

723
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,560
Why so depressed?

724
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,630
Are you jealous of me?

725
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:17,230
Soo Hyeon still likes you.

726
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,500
Really? I don't think so.

727
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,530
Hey Jo Hyeon Gu.

728
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,830
Do you want to be a lawyer?

729
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,760
No way!

730
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,300
This is ridiculous!

731
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,860
You said you can do well at the court?

732
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:45,060
You want to be a high win rate lawyer?

733
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:47,930
In your body? It means nothing.

734
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:50,460
Do you think you'll pass the bar exam?

735
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:54,360
Bastard, it's worse than cursing.

736
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,460
What about you?

737
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,530
Really that desperate to make love with Soo Hyeon?

738
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:00,530
Yeah, I am.

739
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:04,190
Cause' she would always see me as a good sunbae and you are her Hyeon Gu.

740
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:07,830
Idiot, she's just an ordinary girl.

741
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:09,530
Okay, let's do it.

742
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:13,200
As you said, I may never pass the exam.

743
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,960
Come here.

744
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,760
But this sucks...

745
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,930
Nothing happened!

746
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,200
<i>Aish! I shouldn't have done it.</i>

747
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:31,430
Let's see...

748
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:33,460
Maybe, it won't happen between us.

749
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:35,330
Such an idiot.

750
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,890
Please bear with me once again.

751
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:02,600
Hey~...

752
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:10,100
Come here.

753
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:14,700
Don't panic. It'll be short.

754
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,800
Look at him.

755
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,600
So boring...

756
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:29,700
Oh, my. Doesn't look chic at all.

757
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,530
Good morning.

758
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,930
Good morning!

759
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:47,160
Good! Morning... coffee please.

760
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,560
Sunbae, good morning!

761
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:55,730
Oh, my. What's wrong with him?

762
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:57,900
He's being weird.

763
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,130
I didn't expect your phone call.

764
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,030
We didn't even have conversation.

765
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,260
Lost your appetite?

766
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:15,860
It's your favorite dish.

767
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:18,160
Ah, is it?

768
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:22,060
You brought me here at first.

769
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:24,960
I started to eat this because of you.

770
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,090
Right, I did.

771
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:31,520
It's my favorite dish, too. Thanks to you.

772
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,500
You said you have something you wanted to talk about?

773
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:40,930
I just wanted to talk about when we were young.

774
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,160
Did you?

775
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:47,130
I also talked about it with Jae Chil a few days ago.

776
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:50,760
I think I'm getting old. I miss that times.

777
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,700
Do you? It was the good old days.

778
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:01,460
I found the letters you sent me while you were in the army.

779
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:04,800
I thought I threw them away when we broke up.

780
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:09,760
It was funny to read it again.

781
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,200
Was it?

782
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,560
Looking back, they're precious memories.

783
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:21,860
I was so touched then.

784
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:25,060
How did you send me a letter every single day?

785
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:29,660
I was really surprised at you.

786
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:33,860
I sometimes thought

787
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:36,360
it was Jae Chil who wrote those letters.

788
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:42,700
Kidding.

789
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:51,060
You look different today.

790
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,730
What?

791
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:55,360
Your style has changed.

792
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:59,530
Somehow, you look calm and mature.

793
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:03,330
But you looked the same as you were the other day.

794
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:08,430
Anyway, it's nice to see you again.

795
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:12,360
Your food is getting cold.

796
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:25,800
Don't live like me.

797
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:29,260
Is there a problem?

798
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:30,490
Nothing.

799
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:35,190
It seems that you have a problem.

800
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:45,030
You didn't stutter while delivering arguments.

801
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:46,160
So?

802
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,490
The judge and the prosecutor were both women, though.

803
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:50,360
So what?

804
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:55,800
You didn't even blink your eyes like the other time.

805
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,800
Is that a problem?

806
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:04,590
A clean win against a female prosecutor?

807
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:06,590
This is hard to believe.

808
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:08,060
This case was...

809
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:11,260
This case was enough to win.

810
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,730
Are you seeing a shrink?

811
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:20,300
Be careful about drug abuse.

812
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:23,130
You're already having side effects.

813
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:26,060
Stop talking nonsense.

814
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:27,990
Just go do your job.

815
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,160
Alright. Alright.

816
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,430
Go!

817
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:34,900
An old saying said that...

818
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:37,900
Blah blah blah...

819
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:46,760
Hey! Hello.

820
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,030
You're studying hard.

821
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:02,200
Should have done it for the bar exam.

822
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:06,300
Why bring up my sad story?

823
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:12,660
Nothing came out.

824
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:15,160
What?

825
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:17,560
I see...

826
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,600
How was the date?

827
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:26,630
It wasn't bad.

828
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:29,600
Well...

829
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,560
She seems to still like you.

830
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,630
Does she?

831
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:38,030
It's possible since I'm so handsome.

832
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:40,100
And he does that.

833
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,700
Sleep with Soo Hyeon and dump her.

834
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,860
So that she can hate me.

835
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:51,250
Then Lee Jae Chil watch for that chance.

836
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:56,530
What a flawless plan! I'm clever.

837
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:59,760
Aigoo... You bastard!

838
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,860
How can you say that to a girl you used to love?

839
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:06,100
Aigoo... Such a bastard.

840
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:10,200
Aish, you're such a picky bastard. I was just joking!

841
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:19,530
Lawyer Chil!

842
01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:21,600
My lucky seven.

843
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,960
Such a lovely man.

844
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:31,390
Are you taking a public speech course?

845
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:35,000
I heard you're not afraid of women anymore.

846
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,130
That's...

847
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:39,290
Recently, I started to practice meditation.

848
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:43,130
It is good with mind control.

849
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:45,730
Is it a kind of false religion?

850
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:50,190
You're so prim. Be careful about it.

851
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:52,260
Aigoo, don't say that.

852
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:56,430
I'm Jo... I mean. Lee Jae Chil. You know who I am.

853
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:58,460
I was joking.

854
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:02,660
'Cause you're doing so well.

855
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:04,860
Bottoms up.

856
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,660
Anyway,

857
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:12,360
I'm thinking of offering a huge case to you.

858
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,460
It was supposed to be given to Lawyer Kim.

859
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:18,200
But I'm telling you because we're men.

860
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,560
So, are you interested?

861
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,060
What case is it?

862
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:24,830
You know Ms. Hong, and the real estate man with the building next to us?

863
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:27,890
Her husband is a billionaire and a notorious libertine.

864
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:31,430
Plus, that guy is well known for cheating.

865
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:35,330
He's a huge womanizer.

866
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:39,390
But he is a very careful idiot.

867
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:42,060
When he meets girls he uses a disposable cell phone

868
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:44,260
and only pays in cash.

869
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,900
He is also good at ditching tails. <i>(when a clever player gets a lock on you it can be like being tracked)</i>

870
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:50,850
Ms. Hong longs for getting divorced.

871
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,330
But she has no hard evidence.

872
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,560
So?

873
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:01,260
If we get a hard evidence and win the case,

874
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:07,130
Ms. Hong will get a 30 billion won settlement.

875
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:09,730
Can you guess how much the legal fee would be?

876
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:11,500
Isn't it interesting?

877
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:15,150
Don't drool.

878
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:22,230
All we need is a hard evidence, though.

879
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,460
Yes. Come in.

880
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:33,600
Sunbae, it's me.

881
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:38,060
Oh, you're here.

882
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:40,800
Sunbae, I heard that you won cases straight.

883
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,100
Congratulations.

884
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:43,530
Thanks.

885
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:45,860
Do you have something to talk about?

886
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:51,000
Sunbae, I had dinner with Hyeon Gu a few days ago.

887
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,730
Just the two of us.

888
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:56,390
I heard that.

889
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:58,230
Is that okay with you, sunbae?

890
01:03:58,230 --> 01:03:59,860
Oh, it's fine.

891
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:01,830
Good luck.

892
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,560
Are you really okay with it?

893
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,160
With what?

894
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:19,700
I really don't understand you.

895
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:24,000
Anyway, thanks. I've been sorry for you.

896
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,930
Good luck with your work.

897
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:07,060
Hello?

898
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:09,800
Oh, Soo Hyeon, it's me.

899
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,360
Hyeon Gu?

900
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,930
What a surprise you calling me, oppa.

901
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:18,890
The other day did you get home well?

902
01:05:19,930 --> 01:05:21,730
Yeah, I did.

903
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:24,460
Right...

904
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:27,200
What are you doing tomorrow?

905
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,700
Tomorrow?

906
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:32,460
I don't have anything planned yet.

907
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:35,130
Really?

908
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:38,560
What about climbing Mt. Yumyeong tomorrow?

909
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:40,930
Mt. Yumyeong?

910
01:05:53,060 --> 01:06:03,300
<i>Subtitles brought to you by Cheinji Team@Viki</i>

911
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,860
Oh, this is the spot!

912
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:17,800
The overpass where I passed out!

913
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:21,030
Right, it was so nice back then.

914
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:23,160
We came here then.

915
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:32,560
This is so nice!

916
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:34,830
Thought I was gonna die that time.

917
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,190
But I heard you grabbed me when I was about to fall.

918
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,360
Thank you for that again.

919
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,700
To be honest...

920
01:06:48,490 --> 01:06:50,400
Slow down!

921
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:55,730
This way, this way!

922
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:57,560
Gee...

923
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:07,000
Ah, nothing...

924
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:13,500
There's a place that sells nice dotorimuk (acorn jelly).

925
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,530
I remember.

926
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:18,000
They also have tasty soft tofu stew.

927
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,860
How about a bowl of makgeolli? (rice wine)

928
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:21,230
Yes.

929
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,260
Ahh, I feel great here.

930
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:24,830
Me, too.

931
01:07:24,830 --> 01:07:26,700
- Shall we go?<b>- Yes.</b>

932
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,560
Lee Jae Chil, you can do it!

933
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,730
Go Jae Chil!

934
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:48,160
There are mosquitoes flying here.

935
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:01,230
Hyeon Gu...

936
01:11:24,830 --> 01:11:27,400
You woke up early.

937
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:31,300
Yeah. Let's get going before the traffic gets bad.

938
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,930
Okay then.

939
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:37,700
What do you want for breakfast?

940
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:40,360
I'm not hungry.

941
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:42,560
Are you under the weather?

942
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,500
No, I feel fine.

943
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:47,900
Tell me. What's wrong?

944
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:50,030
I said I'm fine.

945
01:11:57,130 --> 01:11:59,260
I knew it.

946
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:03,060
Jo Hyeon Gu!

947
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:05,400
You haven't changed a bit.

948
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:15,460
I was stupid for thinking that you might have changed.

949
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:18,730
Listen, Soo Gyeon.

950
01:12:18,730 --> 01:12:20,600
Forget it!

951
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:25,400
I had a great time last night.

952
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,830
Don't call me again.

953
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,800
Jae Chil...

954
01:12:55,530 --> 01:12:57,560
Jae Chil...

955
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:01,760
You're here?

956
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,760
What's up? What's all this?

957
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:07,530
Didn't you get laid with Soo Hyeon?

958
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:09,960
Yes, I did.

959
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:13,760
Then, why such a long face?

960
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,500
Didn't like it?

961
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:18,160
Must not have been bad.

962
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:24,630
You little bastard!

963
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:27,330
Did you cum too soon?

964
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:30,660
You've smeared my reputation.

965
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:35,600
What was that for?

966
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:36,760
For nothing.

967
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:38,030
What?

968
01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:41,440
Such a boring wanker.

969
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:45,260
Ayoo... let's not talk about it.

970
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:48,600
It seems that things are going well for you.

971
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,600
Heard you won a few cases straight.

972
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:51,960
Yup.

973
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,660
Jae Chil.

974
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:58,860
This tells us that Korean bar exam has a flaw.

975
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:02,760
How can they reject me 8 times?

976
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:08,600
Can't even tell all the loss the judiciary has encountered.

977
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,930
Idiot.

978
01:14:10,930 --> 01:14:13,190
Just shut up.

979
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:16,360
The trial tomorrow is going to be bit tricky,

980
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:18,960
but the 8 years I spent on studying wasn't waste

981
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:23,930
because the precedent seemed to fly through my brain.

982
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:25,730
A trial tomorrow?

983
01:14:25,730 --> 01:14:27,700
You wanna be like this?

984
01:14:29,060 --> 01:14:30,860
It's not that.

985
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:33,660
Let's just keep it up for one more week.

986
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:35,360
At the moment...

987
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,530
A really big..

988
01:14:38,860 --> 01:14:40,860
Never mind.

989
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:44,030
Anyway, let's give a go for one more week. Okay?

990
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,730
Whatever.

991
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:57,260
I'm just going to hibernate for a week.

992
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:59,130
Okay you bastard!

993
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:01,660
Come here. I'll give you a kiss.

994
01:15:02,430 --> 01:15:05,400
Son off...! Go to your room.

995
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:11,760
Why is she so heavy?

996
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,260
Oh, my.

997
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:25,360
Legs are heavy as well.

998
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,800
Blockhead.

999
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,730
Hello?

1000
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:10,760
Oh President Kim!

1001
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:13,230
Are you here already?

1002
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,000
Okay.

1003
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,430
I understanddd~

1004
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,560
President Kim!

1005
01:16:42,330 --> 01:16:44,860
Hey, honey. You finally came.

1006
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:49,130
Come in. Let's sizzle up the mood.

1007
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:52,460
Okay.

1008
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:54,460
Okay~.

1009
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:40,060
What the...?

1010
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:52,100
Excuse me. Did you see the guy in this car?

1011
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,600
Miss, do you know him?

1012
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:57,360
He's my bosom buddy. Did you see him or not?

1013
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:02,160
Bosom buddy? I don't know about that.

1014
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:03,760
Anyway, he's dead.

1015
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:07,200
I called 911 earliest and they said that he died.

1016
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:10,330
Ahjumma! Why did you call 911?

1017
01:18:10,330 --> 01:18:12,560
He's not dead!

1018
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:15,490
Are you crazy? Why are you screaming?

1019
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:19,030
If he was okay, why would they take him?

1020
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:21,460
Hey! You bitch!

1021
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:26,530
Give my ID back at least!

1022
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:29,130
Pervert!

1023
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:34,500
In a morgue? Am I?

1024
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,600
You...

1025
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:42,660
You bastard.

1026
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:44,430
What exactly happened?

1027
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:47,860
I needed her body for your job.

1028
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:49,730
What job?

1029
01:18:53,490 --> 01:18:57,290
So... what are you going to do?

1030
01:18:57,290 --> 01:18:58,830
We need to get your body out.

1031
01:18:58,830 --> 01:19:01,100
It's useless to say that.

1032
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:02,660
But how?

1033
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:04,700
Let's go there first.

1034
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:18,060
I'll draw their attention. You get your body.

1035
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:49,000
Aigoo... Poor Hyeon Gu...

1036
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:53,430
It's really cold in here.

1037
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:56,800
The temperature is low,

1038
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,860
but corpses make me feel colder.

1039
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:03,130
Well, you get used to it once you're here every single day.

1040
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,460
Really?

1041
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:09,960
I'm getting goosebumps since I'm so cold.

1042
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,360
Ah, are you?

1043
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:15,030
Can you give me a glass of hot water?

1044
01:20:15,030 --> 01:20:16,490
Ah, water?

1045
01:20:16,490 --> 01:20:18,560
Of course, this way.

1046
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:22,360
This way.

1047
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:26,060
Wow, but you are so brave...

1048
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:28,130
Spending all day with corpses.

1049
01:20:28,130 --> 01:20:31,730
You are the most masculine man amongst every men!

1050
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:36,500
I served in the Marines and have nerves of steel.

1051
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,260
I have the nerves of steel.

1052
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:41,130
So barely anything frightens me.

1053
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:43,300
- Is that so?<b>- Sure.</b>

1054
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:50,630
Hello.

1055
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:58,360
Nerves of steel?

1056
01:20:58,360 --> 01:20:59,600
Hey, hurry up!

1057
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,960
Sorry. Be careful.

1058
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:03,700
Wait. Too heavy. Let's just drag him.

1059
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:05,460
What?

1060
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:11,930
Oh, my. Be careful.

1061
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:20,230
You are crazy.

1062
01:21:20,230 --> 01:21:21,900
Aren't you?

1063
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:24,530
I'm sorry.

1064
01:21:24,530 --> 01:21:26,960
I have nothing to say.

1065
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,630
You should have.

1066
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:31,530
You almost froze your bosom buddy to death.

1067
01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:33,830
If you still have something to say...

1068
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:35,730
You can't be a human.

1069
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:37,760
But this case is the real jackpot!

1070
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:40,660
Think about the commission and the incentive.

1071
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:42,900
We can afford an apartment all at once.

1072
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:44,560
Hyeon Gu.

1073
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:48,460
Hyeon Gu, my friend you are...

1074
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:50,600
Are you in your right mind?

1075
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:52,360
What do you think you're doing?

1076
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:55,290
Let's make the exorcism happen today!

1077
01:21:55,830 --> 01:22:00,000
Alright, I'm sorry. Stop beating me, idiot.

1078
01:22:03,430 --> 01:22:05,330
Son of bitch!

1079
01:22:08,330 --> 01:22:10,200
Just turn on the heater.

1080
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:12,330
Turn it on now.

1081
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:14,760
What heater? It's hot today.

1082
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:16,330
Turn it on!

1083
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:19,760
I'm going crazy.

1084
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,660
I'm the crazy bastard...

1085
01:22:23,630 --> 01:22:25,830
Let's make her go.

1086
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:29,690
What are you saying?

1087
01:22:29,690 --> 01:22:31,360
What about a week later?

1088
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,200
You bastard!

1089
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:37,330
You had a date with Soo Hyeon

1090
01:22:37,330 --> 01:22:40,000
and had fun getting laid for the first time.

1091
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,230
Fun? Fun!?

1092
01:22:42,230 --> 01:22:46,230
What's so fun of it? She thought it was you.

1093
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:50,130
Did you really dump her?

1094
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:55,590
You've grown up so much! You're not a wanker anymore.

1095
01:22:55,590 --> 01:22:58,300
I've raised you well.

1096
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:02,860
Soo Hyeon said you're still the same with women.

1097
01:23:04,030 --> 01:23:05,800
Really?

1098
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:10,600
Doesn't that mean that she liked you in my body?

1099
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:12,030
Ah, right.

1100
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:13,860
When I was in your body,

1101
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:15,960
she came to me and asked

1102
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:20,700
if you're okay with her going out with me.

1103
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:24,360
What does that mean?

1104
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:29,790
You believe she wanted to hear "I'm fine thank you"?

1105
01:23:29,790 --> 01:23:33,530
It's obvious that means that she likes you...

1106
01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:36,360
You idiot!

1107
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,130
This stupid bastard.

1108
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:42,830
You scared me, bastard.

1109
01:23:42,830 --> 01:23:44,800
Why are you saying that now?

1110
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,100
You bastard.

1111
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:47,930
Where are you going?

1112
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,590
You bastard. You... Just study hard.

1113
01:23:52,590 --> 01:23:54,360
Don't you wanna pass?

1114
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:59,230
And if I catch you wondering around in her body.

1115
01:23:59,230 --> 01:24:00,900
I'll bury you.

1116
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:11,760
"I'll bury you" Ahh, bastard.

1117
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:24,360
<i>You look different today, oppa.</i>

1118
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,060
<i>What?</i>

1119
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:28,730
<i>Your style has changed.</i>

1120
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:31,120
<i>Somehow, you look</i>

1121
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,560
<i>calm and mature.</i>

1122
01:24:45,030 --> 01:24:47,730
<i>I thought I was gonna die that time.</i>

1123
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:51,830
<i>I heard you grabbed me when I was about to fall.</i>

1124
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:55,030
<i>Thank you for that again.</i>

1125
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,700
<i>You're still pretty.</i>

1126
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:06,460
<i>Sorry?</i>

1127
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:10,460
<i>You still look okay.</i>

1128
01:25:12,130 --> 01:25:13,860
<i>What?</i>

1129
01:25:21,660 --> 01:25:24,090
<i>I had a great time last night.</i>

1130
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:28,300
<i>Don't call me again.</i>

1132
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,960
Sunbae, is something wrong?

1133
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:36,730
Yeah, there's something I have to tell you...

1134
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:41,400
Is it important? It's kinda late.

1135
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:43,600
Yes, it is.

1136
01:26:43,630 --> 01:26:45,230
Soo Hyeon...

1137
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:49,790
I like you.

1138
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:53,860
I liked you since I saw you for the first time <b>10 years ago when you were a newbie at college.</b>

1139
01:26:53,860 --> 01:26:56,960
I was the one who saved you on Mt. Yumyeong.

1140
01:26:57,900 --> 01:27:02,130
It was me who wrote all letters that Hyeon Gu sent you.

1141
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:06,660
I also have chosen this company to be with you.

1142
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:09,960
You were always in my heart for the last 10 years.

1143
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:14,660
Did I shock you?

1144
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:20,600
Finally, you told me.

1145
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,260
It took you so long.

1146
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:27,160
You knew about it?

1147
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:29,660
What kind of girl wouldn't know?

1148
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:33,930
Not only about Mt. Yumyeong,

1149
01:27:33,930 --> 01:27:37,960
but also the letters, I guessed it was you.

1150
01:27:40,030 --> 01:27:43,960
So, you knew all about it.

1151
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:48,690
But you know what they say in movies...

1152
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:52,430
'A girl never acts just by her guess.'

1153
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,400
Right...

1154
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:00,300
Soo Hyeon.

1155
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:03,700
Would you be my girl?

1156
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:15,600
It takes you 10 years to say that.

1157
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,800
But your timing is off...

1158
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:22,900
Let's have dinner sometime.

1159
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:28,730
Okay, then...

1160
01:28:28,730 --> 01:28:31,260
What about meat soup?

1161
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:35,560
You really like meat soup, sunbae.

1162
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:38,000
Okay, that's fine.

1163
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,000
And there's one more thing I need to tell you...

1164
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,860
What is it?

1165
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:47,030
Tell me.

1166
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:48,860
Well... That is...

1167
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:53,160
The other night...

1168
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:57,230
You had sex in the hotel, with me- Hyeon Gu...

1169
01:28:57,230 --> 01:28:59,560
How do you know that?

1170
01:29:02,860 --> 01:29:05,330
You two really share everything.

1171
01:29:05,330 --> 01:29:06,060
What?

1172
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:08,760
What I mean is...

1173
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:14,060
So, did you just came here 'cause it'd be a good chance for it?

1174
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,590
Did Hyeon Gu tell you to do this?

1175
01:29:17,590 --> 01:29:19,230
Soo Hyeon, that's not what I mean-

1176
01:29:19,230 --> 01:29:22,800
It must've been so fun talking about me.

1177
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:26,060
Why?

1178
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:30,960
Were you disappointed because I slept<b> with Hyun Gu and not with you?</b>

1179
01:29:32,830 --> 01:29:34,430
Soo Hyeon...

1180
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:42,060
You'd better go, sunbae.

1181
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:43,930
Wait, Soo Hyeon, that's not-

1182
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:49,100
It's not what I was saying.

1183
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:52,830
I wanted to apologize, not hurt you.

1184
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:57,460
Having known me for 10 years, you still don't know me?

1185
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:02,960
You are the only girl I can look in the eyes.

1186
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:07,160
I know that I'm such an idiot not telling you this.

1187
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:09,130
So, I'm telling you now.

1188
01:30:09,130 --> 01:30:11,090
I love you.

1189
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:16,520
Aigoo.

1190
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:21,760
I should've said this sooner.

1191
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:25,760
What a coward...

1192
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:27,460
Such a coward...

Aigoo, when you get old you'd better die. Aigoo...

Seoul.

I'll get going first.

1217
01:34:57,490 --> 01:35:01,130
It's 11pm. Get some rest.

1218
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:03,800
Sunbae, you haven't left yet?

01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:26,160
Shall we?

1222
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:28,030
Just a second.

Remember we were going to have a meal together?

1229
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:55,660
What shall we eat? Dog meat soup?

1230
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:59,390
You always say dog meat soup.

1231
01:35:59,390 --> 01:36:04,360
Don't you like steak or spaghetti like other girls?

1232
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:06,960
It seems you like it.

1233
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:08,900
I mean you, oppa.

1234
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:13,560
I actually don't like dog meat soup that much.

1235
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:17,630
Because of you... I ate a lot.

1236
01:36:17,630 --> 01:36:20,700
Let's eat something else, this time.

1237
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:24,130

1239
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:33,200
