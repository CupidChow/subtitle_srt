1
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,144
How have you been doing lately?

2
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,813
Yeah, I've been doing well

3
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,983
You look it

4
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:26,693
I'm glad

5
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,612
And you?

6
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,323
Me?

7
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,534
I

8
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,703
Just been getting by

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,872
I've been busy

10
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,417
Has work been busy?

11
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:45,587
Yeah

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,005
Right

13
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,215
The company's been busy and all

14
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:50,884
This and that

15
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:57,515
Ah

16
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,893
You remember that jajangmyeon place we used to go to a lot?

17
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:01,561
The one in Jungsan-dong

18
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,480
The jajangmyeon place?

19
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,733
It's gone

20
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,652
I went there alone last week

21
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:10,945
And it was gone

22
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,199
We went there so often during the two years we were meeting

23
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,745
But then poof...

24
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,538
It's such a shame it's gone

25
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,957
It was delicious

26
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:25,543
Yeah

27
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,420
Oh, and

28
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,798
Junsu came back from his exchange program yesterday

29
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,716
He was asking about you

30
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,842
Have you contacted him?

31
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,428
Ah

32
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,222
No

33
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,893
The three of us should have a drink together

34
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,146
Junsu, that guy who could barely handle alcohol

35
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,440
I heard he's into highballs now

36
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,483
Acting like he knows everything about it

37
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,651
Jiwoon

38
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:53,363
Yeah?

39
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,284
I'm getting married

40
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,509
So you've been busy preparing for the wedding?

41
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,221
Yeah

42
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,889
Next month

43
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,477
Next month, that's

44
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,646
A nice time to get married

45
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,316
The late spring groom, something like that?

46
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,282
I can't ask you to come

47
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,660
But I felt I had to tell you

48
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,705
Why?

49
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,624
Well...

50
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,837
Because you were special to me

51
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,132
Ah

52
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,471
It might be selfish of me

53
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:04,058
But I really want your congratulations

54
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,566
Will you congratulate me?

55
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,779
Why should I?

56
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,407
Huh?

57
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,285
No, you dumped me

58
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,786
I wondered who you were living happily with

59
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,955
And now you're pretending to be normal?

60
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,166
Even saying you're going to start a family?

61
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,464
Seriously, you've got some nerve

62
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,132
How can you ask me

63
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,675
To congratulate you on your wedding?

64
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,222
No, Jiwoon, that's not what I meant

65
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,598
You contacted me

66
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,434
I came out smiling and happy

67
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,982
I'll definitely come to your wedding

68
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,736
I'll definitely come and show everyone

69
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,196
What kind of person you really are

70
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,283
Look forward to it

71
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:05,995
Jiwoon

72
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,288
Uh, what?

73
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,208
You should congratulate me on my wedding

74
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,589
Congratulations

75
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,138
I knew you'd congratulate me

76
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,025
Wait a second

77
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,248
I'm about to fall

78
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,092
I need to catch the subway at that station

79
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,053
Okay

80
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,558
It was good to see you today

81
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:11,894
Yeah

82
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:20,903
I'm going

83
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,077
Want to have another drink?

84
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,668
You can't handle alcohol well

85
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,544
Stop drinking

86
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,171
No, I can handle alcohol well

87
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,464
I'm fine

88
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,307
You were the one who first taught me how to drink

89
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,142
Remember?

90
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,394
Yeah, that's right

91
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,607
A guy who even went to the army can't drink, I said

92
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,484
How much I teased you

93
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,738
You're really an expert at teasing me

94
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,698
It was fun to tease you

95
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:07,950
What kind of fun?

96
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,204
A cute kind of fun

97
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,691
Ah, it's cold

98
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:41,984
Oh no

99
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,738
It's okay, you always spill something when you drink

100
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:46,656
It's fine

101
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,949
I'll wipe it off, wait

102
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,703
It's wet all the way to here?

103
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,831
Do you want to change your pants?

104
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,093
Not today

105
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,222
I'm getting married soon

106
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,434
Even I know it's embarrassing, but I can't help it

107
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,945
Why did you want to see me today?

108
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,660
How can you say something like that to me?

109
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,413
Do you even know how I feel?

110
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:36,998
Jiwoon

111
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,292
You always do whatever you want

112
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,878
Both meeting and breaking up

113
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,921
It was all according to your will

114
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,966
And now you come and say you're getting married?

115
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,051
Why did you bother to see me

116
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,178
To say something like that?

117
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,387
Because I wanted to see you

118
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,812
I wanted to see you one more time somehow

119
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,941
Because only you know my true self

120
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,736
I thought if it was you

121
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,032
Maybe you'd understand my true self a little

122
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,587
You said not today

123
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,299
You know, I'm always doing what I want

124
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,296
When did you wake up?

125
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,464
Earlier

126
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,426
Oh

127
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,053
It's already 10 o'clock

128
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:15,721
Are you hungry?

129
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,223
Should I cook ramen for you?

130
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,726
No

131
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,730
I need to leave right away

132
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,524
Right away?

133
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,778
Ramen doesn't take long to cook though?

134
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:31,988
Eat before you go

135
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,156
You like the ramen I make

136
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,784
No

137
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:37,785
I'm really okay

138
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,497
Where are you going?

139
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,338
I have to take my girlfriend home

140
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,925
Oh..

141
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,721
Jiwoon

142
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,435
This won't happen again

143
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,729
I'm sorry

144
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,441
What are you sorry for?

145
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,778
Are you sorry you slept with me?

146
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:14,447
No

147
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,324
You should be sorry to your girlfriend

148
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,326
No Jihoon, that's not what I mean

149
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,577
Oh

150
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,329
It was a mistake?

151
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,290
Like a lost puppy

152
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,291
Whimpering

153
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,584
Did you sleep with me out of pity?

154
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,628
Is that what you want to say?

155
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,296
Hey Seo Jiwoon

156
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,257
In this situation

157
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,676
Do you know how

158
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,261
Humiliating it is to hear 'I'm sorry'?

159
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,557
How long will you keep doing things your way?

160
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,436
Just leave quickly

161
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,401
And

162
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,572
Never contact me again

163
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,824
Hello

164
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,118
Jiwoon

165
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,830
I drank a lot

166
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,791
Can you come pick me up?

167
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,544
Call a taxi and go home

168
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,630
Or call your girlfriend

169
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,634
I want you to come pick me up

170
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,596
You know the intersection in Jungsan-dong?

171
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,850
What are you doing here?

172
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,830
Huh?

173
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:31,959
Oh, it's Seo Jiwoon

174
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,086
It's Seo Jiwoon

175
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,172
Oh, you smell like alcohol

176
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,966
How much did you drink?

177
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,470
Aren't you preparing for a wedding?

178
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,722
Why do you have so many drinking parties?

179
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,225
Ugh.. I feel like dying

180
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,146
Try doing this

181
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,191
Put some effort

182
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,527
Put in some effort, you're heavy

183
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,114
Aren't you going home?

184
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,119
Why do you look so cute?

185
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,249
I'm really going to hit you

186
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,627
I'm really going to hit you

187
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,342
No way

188
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,682
Hey

189
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:30,893
You really

190
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,648
Don't abandon me

191
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,153
Oh, come on

192
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,157
Who's abandoning who

193
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,669
I'm leaving

194
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,177
Sorry

195
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,560
I don't know why I'm doing this either

196
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,022
I know I shouldn't

197
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,693
But I keep coming to where you are

198
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,658
I want to live an ordinary life

199
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,703
But I can't

200
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,913
Because of you

201
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:37,918
Don't be ridiculous

202
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,546
What do you mean because of me

203
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,550
Bro is just like that

204
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,428
Don't blame me

205
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,433
I won't be fooled this time

206
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,436
No matter how sweet your words are

207
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,687
I won't be fooled

208
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,815
I have my pride too

209
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,402
The reason I didn't show my pride before

210
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,405
Is because I liked you

211
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,408
It's not because I'm easy, got it?

212
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,416
I get it

213
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,919
You're not easy

214
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,673
You're difficult

215
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,347
It's harder because I want you

216
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,934
I don't know your heart

217
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,395
And I don't know mine

218
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,902
Forget it

219
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:47,529
You're drunk

220
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,531
I'm leaving

221
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,201
Should I not get married?

222
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,707
Is that something to say?

223
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,508
Where else can I talk about this?

224
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,302
I have no one else to talk to but you

225
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,138
I keep thinking about you

226
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,687
Can you hold me for a bit?

227
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,151
I really hate this

228
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,980
Hello?

229
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,608
Yeah

230
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,402
I got it

231
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:52,946
Yeah

232
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,656
I love you too

233
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,076
Yeah...

234
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,527
Do you have to go?

235
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,195
Yeah

236
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,865
Sleep a little more

237
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,742
I'll wash up and go out first

238
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,244
Yeah

239
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,312
Hello?

240
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,480
Ah...

241
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,773
By any chance...

242
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,192
Are you Taeha oppa's friend?

243
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,777
Yes

244
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:14,403
But...

245
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,654
Ah, that's right

246
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,198
I'm Taeha oppa's girlfriend

247
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,576
You're Seo Jiwoon oppa, right?

248
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,661
I saw you in Taeha oppa's contacts

249
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,954
So I contacted you secretly

250
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:24,663
Why?

251
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,123
Ah...

252
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:31,795
I have some concerns about oppa

253
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,339
If you have time, let's have a cup of coffee

254
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,591
Ah...

255
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:55,652
Oppa introduced me to all his other friends

256
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:58,030
But he's been hiding just one best friend

257
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,948
And won't introduce me

258
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,077
Ah...

259
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,748
So I was curious

260
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,459
Who our oppa's best friend might be

261
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,671
With wedding preparations

262
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:18,091
He must have forgotten because he's been busy with this and that

263
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:21,220
No way, how could that be?

264
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,805
Our oppa is so meticulous and sensitive

265
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:30,687
It feels like he's hiding something, you know?

266
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,565
Hiding something?

267
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,736
Actually...

268
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,240
The reason I asked to meet secretly today without Taeha oppa knowing

269
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,868
Is because I have something I want to ask

270
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,372
What is it?

271
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,376
Um...

272
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,755
Do you think Taeha oppa

273
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,386
Might be having an affair?

274
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,137
What?

275
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:09,685
You know, they call it the marriage blues

276
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:13,689
Being depressed before the wedding, feeling unsettled

277
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:18,277
I'm not sure if it's because of that or if there's another woman

278
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,321
He's been a bit strange lately

279
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,742
Ah...

280
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,580
Do you...

281
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,375
Know anything?

282
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,963
If it's about that

283
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,717
You should ask Taeha hyung directly

284
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:46,638
Ah, is this about male loyalty or something?

285
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:50,058
I really won't tell oppa that I heard it from you

286
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:53,770
Can't you tell me as if you're saving a life?

287
00:21:55,731 --> 00:22:00,277
Does Taeha oppa really have another woman?

288
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,990
There's no woman

289
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,035
Are you sure?

290
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,413
Yes, I'm sure

291
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,457
There's no woman

292
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,295
That's a relief

293
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,424
Ah, I really feel like a weight has been lifted

294
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:27,429
Well, do you think marriage is easy?

295
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,223
I'm feeling unsettled too

296
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:33,435
So I end up having these strange thoughts

297
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,646
Ah...

298
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,033
What are you doing here?

299
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,952
Oppa, is it your lunch break?

300
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,039
Did you contact him?

301
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:55,540
Yeah

302
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,834
I asked you to introduce us, but you wouldn't

303
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,544
So I contacted him first

304
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:00,796
I did well, right?

305
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,224
This place is amazing, isn't it?

306
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,310
They say this is the ultimate destination for honeymoons

307
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,312
It's on the Mexican border, but

308
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,814
Just this Cancun area

309
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,982
The entire island is made up of hotels

310
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:23,110
So it's extremely private and safe, they say

311
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,738
Well... that's nice

312
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,906
Right?

313
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:33,245
We're planning to have a baby right after we get married

314
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,914
So we want to enjoy our honeymoon to the fullest

315
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,624
We'll travel the American West

316
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,419
Then cross over to Cancun for a proper rest

317
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,467
Why are you talking about such things?

318
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,636
What's wrong with that?

319
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,973
Oppa says he wants a daughter

320
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,892
Well, it's not like we can control it anyway

321
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,395
Men really don't understand, I tell you

322
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,233
Ah, please make sure to attend our wedding reception

323
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,735
My friends are really pretty

324
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,071
Well, not as pretty as me, but still

325
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,783
It would be so nice if you could meet a good woman too

326
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,369
Date and get married

327
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,205
We could go on couple trips together

328
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,584
Ah...

329
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:24,045
I don't have any thoughts of marriage yet

330
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,091
You're similar to oppa in that regard too

331
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,260
Oppa also said he had no thoughts of marriage

332
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,345
Until he met me

333
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,555
But as soon as he met me

334
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,307
He asked me to marry him

335
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:37,601
Is it fate?

336
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,027
Sohee, let's stop talking and go now

337
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,154
He's busy too

338
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,116
Why? I still have coffee left

339
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,370
Um...

340
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,747
I'll go first

341
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,457
Already?

342
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,083
Yes

343
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,711
I have some things left to do at home

344
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,047
Hyung

345
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,843
Congratulations on your marriage

346
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:13,887
Congratulations, Sohee-ssi

347
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,347
Thank you

348
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,106
Jiwoon!

349
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,244
I'll apologize

350
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,204
I'm not sure why she

351
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,830
Called you here, but

352
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,748
Hyung

353
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,128
I think I misunderstood

354
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:49,756
Huh?

355
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,051
You've already crossed a river that can't be turned back from, hyung...

356
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,762
I just realized that now

357
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,890
I'm sorry

358
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,060
I was too greedy for too many things alone

359
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,646
Not knowing my place

360
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,857
So don't feel sorry for me anymore

361
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,530
I meant what I said earlier

362
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,907
I sincerely congratulate you

363
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,119
For finding the life you want

364
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:25,208
I just need to disappear

365
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,586
You know that too

366
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,673
What are you saying now?

367
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,010
So you stop being greedy too, hyung

368
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,470
Before you lose everything

369
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:40,890
Oppa

370
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:41,933
Let's go together

371
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,311
Jiwoon

372
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,940
The rain is really pouring down, isn't it?

373
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:47,499
What is it?

374
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:49,417
Ah..

375
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,712
The password's still the same

376
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:58,677
Bro, you really do whatever you want

377
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,690
I said I'd do as I please

378
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,526
I'm really going to do whatever I want

379
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,863
Now it's really over

380
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:19,864
Go back

381
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:21,366
Where to?

382
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,369
To where you were before

383
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,163
I broke off my engagement

384
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,635
I really do whatever I want, don't I?

385
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,764
You find this situation funny?

386
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,684
Should I cry then?

387
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,151
Then will you hug me?

388
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,703
Are you okay?

389
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,248
No

390
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,087
I'll never be understood

391
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,590
I won't be able to be righteous either

392
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,510
I just need you

393
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,256
I'll go buy some coffee

394
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,090
You're sleeping

395
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:07,931
Don't go

396
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,016
Huh?

397
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,021
Don't leave even for a moment

398
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,068
Why have you suddenly become like a child?

399
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,238
I'll be right back

400
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,058
Are you having fun?

401
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,648
After ruining someone else's wedding

402
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,734
Seems like you're enjoying yourselves, huh?

403
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,699
I really, on that day

404
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,493
Almost threw up when I saw you two

405
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,453
Do you know how much I held back?

406
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,043
Say something

407
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:22,255
As shamelessly as that day

408
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,466
I'm sorry

409
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,430
It's really disgusting

410
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,642
You seem to be greatly misunderstanding something

411
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,061
I won't let this go

412
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,772
The time and money I invested

413
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,734
I'll get it all back from both of you

414
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,490
From now on, it'll be hell

415
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,620
Wherever you go, everyone in the world

416
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,663
Will point fingers at you two

417
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,388
I'll get everything back

418
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,808
I made a mistake

419
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,563
Even if they point fingers

420
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,690
I'll bear it all

421
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,652
What are you doing now?

422
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,073
Please let go of Taeha

423
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,243
I'm begging you

424
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,122
The pain I caused Sohee

425
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,959
I'll pay for it with my heart for the rest of my life

426
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,965
I'll live like a sinner

427
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,305
So..

428
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,225
Please let him go

429
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,563
I can't live without Taeha

430
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,819
Try to endure it

431
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,114
Whether it's a love

432
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,074
That can endure hell

433
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:32,885
Bro

434
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,183
Bro?

435
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,605
What?

436
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:45,773
You startled me

437
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,233
What took you so long?

438
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,402
I thought you had left me

439
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,117
There were many customers at the cafe

440
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,160
From early morning

441
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,786
I see

442
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,456
I thought I'd die from missing you..

443
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:08,629
Bro

444
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,594
You said you only needed me, right?

445
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,554
Yes

446
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,557
You really don't regret it?

447
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,354
When I saw your back as you left alone that day

448
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,900
I regretted it more than anything ever before

449
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:32,320
Me, who couldn't do anything..

450
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,197
I felt so pathetic

451
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,870
So I told Sohee..

452
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,623
That I was sorry and asked to break up

453
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,043
Otherwise, I'd regret it for the rest of my life

454
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:53,841
Are you scared?

455
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,135
Yes

456
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,513
But..

457
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,682
I only need you too
