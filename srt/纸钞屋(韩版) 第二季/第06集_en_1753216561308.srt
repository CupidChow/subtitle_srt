1
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,049
Coming?

2
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:54,471
Dad is going somewhere

3
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:57,432
I will probably stay there for one night and come back tomorrow.

4
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,642
Is it okay for you to sleep by yourself?

5
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,102
Leaving again?

6
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,521
Where are you going?

7
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,608
Where can I go? Of course, to make money.

8
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,987
Why do you make money all day?
But still need to continue to earn?

9
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,290
Don't you want to see your brother?

10
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,002
To bring Zhonghao to Korea, you need money.

11
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,253
And it requires a lot of money

12
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,717
Okay, go ahead.

13
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,601
But Dad

14
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,479
Where is money made?

15
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:52,070
The country has a place that makes money, similar to a factory

16
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,407
All the money we spend is made there

17
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:00,703
If this is the case
Just make a lot of money there.

18
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,164
Then there will be no poor people

19
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,334
You can also buy whatever you want to eat.

20
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,711
So stupid

21
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:13,800
That's what I mean

22
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:17,428
I'll be back soon

23
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,077
A bank robber

24
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,288
Shot dead by police

25
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,415
Song, a man in his 40s, died on the spot

26
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,626
A former high-ranking North Korean official

27
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,419
(North Korean official defector shot dead while robbing a bank)

28
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:34,505
Set foot on Korean soil two years ago
It is inferred that Song was unable to adapt to Korean society.

29
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,799
This crime was planned

30
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:42,490
Paper House: Korea

31
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,557
Almost done

32
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,643
-What happened?
-No

33
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,271
Dig now!

34
00:05:58,649 --> 00:05:59,901
- I'll come
-Yeah

35
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,589
- Did you hear the professor's voice?
-Go and have a look

36
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,176
The end? Huh?

37
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,594
-Is it the end?
-Here in Denver!

38
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,429
-I can hear you!
-Can you hear me?

39
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,556
-It's the end!
-Denver!

40
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,433
- Damn it!
-It's finally over!

41
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,353
A little bit better...

42
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,356
-Professor!
-Uh Denver!

43
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,842
-Denver!
-Professor

44
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,218
-Professor!
-Denver!

45
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,220
-Denver has worked hard
-How long has it been?

46
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,017
Thank you for your hard work!

47
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,572
This is…

48
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,157
- I am...
- That...

49
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,539
I am Stockholm

50
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:10,990
Thank you for your hard work

51
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,537
Your child is fine.

52
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,372
Thank you

53
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,336
Brother

54
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,213
Are you okay?

55
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,673
It's OK

56
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,805
The professor is here

57
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,986
When we are immersed in the joy of hope

58
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,363
Outside the Bureau of Printing and Engraving

59
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,032
The worst-case scenario that the professor feared was happening.

60
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,967
(2026 Korean Peninsula
South Korea-North Korea Economic Cooperation Summit)

61
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,558
The details of the agreement are consistent with the content previously reviewed

62
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,272
Now we just need to crush those robbers.

63
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,815
Get our money back

64
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,859
The commandos have been put on standby.

65
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,737
So I said that since the summit is over

66
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,906
It’s time to eliminate future risks

67
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,824
Of course

68
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,494
We must deal with them immediately. No one can escape.

69
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:17,802
Oh yeah

70
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:21,722
Got it

71
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,692
Are you okay?

72
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:33,818
Nothing

73
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:38,322
After you get out of here
I'm afraid I won't see you again.

74
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,490
What are you talking about?

75
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,369
Don't let this happen again.

76
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,872
Live a peaceful life with your family

77
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,502
I hope you can meet

78
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,131
With your son

79
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,051
After we go out

80
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,805
Forget what happened here
Let's start over again?

81
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,058
No

82
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,560
I won't go out with you

83
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,980
Hello Yoon Mi-sun
Do you really want to go out with that asshole?

84
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,150
With 3 billion, life will be comfortable

85
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,151
Why does it have to be like this?

86
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,778
When you decide to stay
You made a choice for yourself

87
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,782
I also made a choice for myself.

88
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:39,133
Now we enter the Banknote Printing Bureau to sweep away the robbers

89
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:40,968
-Action!
-Yes!

90
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,432
Give

91
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,522
The escape hatch is open
This means a beginning, not an end.

92
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,152
Through underground waterways

93
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,738
Transporting large amounts of money to the hideout
It took longer than expected

94
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,244
After the money is transported, in order to prevent the police from tracking

95
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,705
Even the escape routes were blocked.

96
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,178
Ready to enter

97
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,254
What are you going to do when you get out of here?

98
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,589
Living in hiding like a mouse

99
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,299
What next?

100
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,719
Do you really want to be a revolutionary?

101
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,388
This

102
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,684
Think about it after you survive.

103
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,271
As long as I can get out alive

104
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,897
I have no other wishes.

105
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,315
Then

106
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,194
If that wish comes true
Can you help me realize my wish?

107
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,112
What?

108
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,282
Are we going to talk about living together on the island again?

109
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:28,701
That

110
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,120
You also know

111
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,665
I am participating in this program
It's for very childish reasons.

112
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,795
I just want to screw up my life
Just revenge on my parents

113
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:46,176
But now it seems
This is not the time for childish behavior.

114
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,764
What kind of world do you want?

115
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:54,018
Even with my clever brain I can't understand

116
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,229
But I also want to see

117
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,899
It doesn't matter if it's not paradise on earth

118
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,443
Whether it is purgatory

119
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:04,612
Still Hell

120
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,865
I want to go with you

121
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,076
You have pondered this sentence for a long time, right?

122
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,622
It seems that this trick doesn't work.

123
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,001
You took the trouble

124
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,614
Tokyo!

125
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,750
Take Cover!

126
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,961
Try to spend as much time as possible here!

127
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,385
(Police Commando)

128
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,814
Attack!

129
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,955
The bastards are here

130
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,748
Hurry up, Tokyo and Rio are in danger!

131
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,875
First, you have to persist and go!

132
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,253
Everyone hide! Do you know where to go?

133
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,130
-Yes!
-Yes!

134
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,923
If you know, go there now!

135
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,008
Come on over here

136
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,051
Zexiu

137
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:55,055
If you go to the waterway, I will follow you there.

138
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,474
Don't worry, I know?

139
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:06,900
Take Cover!

140
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,869
Damn

141
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,293
Take Cover!

142
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,003
Hey Danger!

143
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,047
Damn it!

144
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,403
Tokyo!

145
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,090
Tokyo

146
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,050
Hey Tokyo, wake up!

147
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:56,844
Tokyo!

148
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,142
Tokyo!

149
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,741
Damn it!

150
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,161
Hey, wake up!

151
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,205
Fucking bastards!

152
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,292
Attack!

153
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,384
You crazy

154
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,763
You can't do this in Helsinki

155
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,098
Let it go!

156
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,850
Don't do this in Helsinki!

157
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,478
I'm gonna blow this bastard's head off!

158
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,896
Bastard!

159
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,022
- Damn it!
-Helsinki!

160
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,567
I understand that too...

161
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,074
Helsinki, go there and help stop the attack!

162
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,952
I'll take care of it here!

163
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,290
Wake up

164
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,086
Tokyo!

165
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,555
Tokyo

166
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,266
Let's get out of this damn place quickly

167
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,811
Why don’t you help me if I want to be romantic next time?

168
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,190
The hole should have been dug. Just hold on a little longer!

169
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,108
Let's get out!

170
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,946
Hey! You crazy people

171
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,736
What's going on?

172
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,579
Come in quickly!

173
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,085
Much earlier than expected

174
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,380
Come on, they can't last long.

175
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,142
Don't move

176
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,936
I'll aim for the vitals with my next bullet

177
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,884
Hold on!

178
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,719
Hey you crazy people!

179
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:14,518
Take Cover!

180
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,898
Hold on a little longer!

181
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:32,619
-Kim Sang-wan!
-Kim Sang-wan!

182
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,872
-Please look here
- Please say something

183
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,792
(The paper house is ours)

184
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,210
(Summit against false economic cooperation)

185
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:44,256
-Kim Sang-wan!
-Kim Sang-wan!

186
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:48,218
Kim Sang-wan steps down!

187
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,346
You come out here!

188
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,056
Hey you bastard!

189
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:08,029
Kill them all and you can kill them all

190
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,588
It's tear gas!

191
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:31,845
Hey, be careful!

192
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,935
Get out of the way!

193
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,437
We can’t hold on any longer, let’s go!

194
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,732
We have persisted enough, let’s go!

195
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,451
Enter

196
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,392
They should have gone to the basement.

197
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:21,728
Follow me!

198
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,311
Found the tunnel

199
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,854
I'm going in now

200
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,497
Don't move!

201
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,250
If you move, I'll fire!

202
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:26,835
Don't shoot!

203
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,253
We are hostages!

204
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,679
Take off your masks!

205
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,314
This tunnel is blocked

206
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:54,821
Be careful

207
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,072
Come down quickly!

208
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,700
Come to Rio

209
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:00,535
Okay!

210
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,453
OK

211
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,378
Hello!

212
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:15,216
Hey, get down there! We'll blow it up when we're done!

213
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,013
Come

214
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,188
Unlock this now!

215
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:43,912
-Who's left?
-Nairobi, Helsinki, Berlin

216
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,791
After activating the bomb in the escape hatch
They'll be here soon

217
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,834
Let's go.

218
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,795
I'll go get the truck ready.

219
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,384
Let's go

220
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:29,624
You are crazy!

221
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,335
I am on official business
Can I borrow your cell phone?

222
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,420
What is…

223
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:35,922
Hello?

224
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,175
What are you talking about? Why are you suddenly talking about a stronghold?

225
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,886
-How did you find it?
-It's not important

226
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,180
Robbers will flee here

227
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,433
- Send someone to...
-Which location?

228
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,601
-Not far from Peace Hotel
-What?

229
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:49,936
Near the summit venue?

230
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,815
No matter how brave they are...

231
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:54,816
Use this point

232
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,776
It's clear that he was planning to escape during the chaos.

233
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,780
I reported it directly because it was an emergency.

234
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,703
Officer Xuan Yuzhen is right

235
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:09,956
I am Cha Moo Hyuk

236
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,710
-Are you okay?
- I've sent someone over.

237
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,463
They should be here soon. Wait for them there.

238
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,839
No time to wait

239
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:35,834
What happened?

240
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,086
Why did it suddenly fail?

241
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,422
What's broken? Let me take a look.

242
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,678
Maybe something went wrong when transporting the money.

243
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:54,143
What are you doing?
Those bastards are about to rush in!

244
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,395
The bomb can't be detonated!

245
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,110
Can it be fixed?

246
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,445
Be quiet, dammit!

247
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,239
If it doesn't explode we're doomed!

248
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,448
They will be here soon!

249
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,076
If this continues we will all be caught!

250
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:11,870
I will try my best to stop them!

251
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,134
What are you doing? Why don't you leave?

252
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,304
Are you crazy?

253
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:30,972
I've been waiting for my father

254
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,559
Even in the shelter, I kept waiting

255
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,019
I always believed that my father would come to pick me up.

256
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,814
You must be alive and reunited with your son
Your son must be waiting for you too.

257
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,399
Don't talk nonsense, I won't abandon you and go away!

258
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,028
Everyone will die one day

259
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,697
It's just a matter of time.

260
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,158
You fuck

261
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,493
Just come with me, okay?

262
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,997
Hey Helsinki!
What are you doing? Helsinki!

263
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,665
Hey, come down quickly!

264
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,501
Hurry up! Come down!

265
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:02,587
Come down quickly!

266
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:03,963
Let go!

267
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:07,926
Come on!

268
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,935
- Come here
-Confirm the hostages

269
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,687
- Contact the embassy again
-Yes

270
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,313
-Where is the robbers' base?
- Already surrounded

271
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,276
Come in

272
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,664
No one

273
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,875
Found an underground passage, let's go in now

274
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,210
Come in

275
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,474
Hmm, where are we?

276
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:39,559
Coming Soon

277
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,355
Wait a minute

278
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,065
There are police everywhere in front of the base

279
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:47,859
Are you sure?

280
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,193
(Taedong River Beer)

281
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,278
Can't enter now

282
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,408
Got it

283
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,618
I'll contact you again

284
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,938
I'll call you right back

285
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:26,856
It's me

286
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,569
Berlin

287
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,404
Although I know that the police will hear the phone calls

288
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:36,324
But now that they have approached the door
There's nothing to hide anymore.

289
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,368
I think I should at least say goodbye to you.

290
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:41,996
Hmm?

291
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,583
The detonator is malfunctioning
I can only stay and stop it

292
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,709
No Berlin!

293
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:47,752
Don't do this

294
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,712
Is he going to die together with them?

295
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,422
It's all over

296
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,216
What do you mean it's all over?

297
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,842
The base was discovered

298
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:58,971
No Way Out

299
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,057
Now

300
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,017
Our Plan

301
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,270
It's meaningless.

302
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,106
Sorry

303
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,947
Hey, this is fun.

304
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,616
Berlin

305
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,747
What about Berlin?

306
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,167
The detonator malfunctioned so...

307
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,544
I'll be back in a bit.

308
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:30,586
Damn it!

309
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,546
Don’t go!

310
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,550
If you go to Berlin now, you will die in vain.

311
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,511
Don't talk nonsense! Who said he was killed?

312
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,228
The safety door will be opened immediately

313
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,438
It is said that the safety door is about to be opened

314
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,357
Do we need to wait for him to finish the call?

315
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,859
Tell them to come in immediately

316
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:53,818
Come in

317
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:04,871
Get out of the way!

318
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:08,541
Stop!

319
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,168
Stop it, it's over!

320
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:15,965
If you stop now
Isn't it pitiful that Oslo and Moscow died?

321
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,593
They trust you till they die.
Their lost lives

322
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,887
Don't forget!

323
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:21,804
Zhong Hao

324
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,557
When I'm alone
When the Yalu River was pitch black

325
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,644
And when I was bloody
Lying in the shelter

326
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,480
I've never been afraid of death

327
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,026
Who knows I'm starting to get scared now

328
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,736
Zhonghao!

329
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:40,573
Did you know
How much I want to be by your side and call your name?

330
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,116
Don't do that

331
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:46,412
Yes, even if you spend some time
Finally found me

332
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:49,165
You will find a way, too.

333
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,917
I'll go first

334
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,544
Waiting for you with my father

335
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,381
Take your time

336
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,592
Brother

337
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,177
Zhong Hao

338
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,764
No!

339
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,354
Zhonghao!

340
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:22,740
Take Cover!

341
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,273
Song Zhonghao!

342
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,800
Let’s go!

343
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:25,136
You are such a cruel woman.
Why are you here?

344
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:26,846
You ask me why I came?

345
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,391
When you were dying in the shelter
Who saved you?

346
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,519
You can't die without my permission

347
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,653
Look at me

348
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,198
It's not just the two of us.
Everyone else will die together

349
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,869
Go away and leave the gun behind!

350
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,662
Fast walking

351
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,874
If you insist on dying here, I won't stop you.

352
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:55,791
Then I

353
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,752
Stay too

354
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,007
I dragged you to this point

355
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,052
I'm sorry.

356
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,512
I have never regretted

357
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,316
It's a bomb!

358
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:13,661
Don't worry, just deal with it like this.

359
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:17,832
How is the situation?

360
00:40:57,329 --> 00:41:00,416
In this case, the escape exit should be here

361
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:04,503
Hello?

362
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,546
It's me, Song Sun-ho

363
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:10,551
Long time no see

364
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,679
I didn't expect you to be the professor.

365
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:17,433
Why did you do that?
Do you want to atone for your sins now that you have come this far?

366
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,519
Why call?

367
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:22,646
What is the purpose?

368
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,107
Do you want to turn yourself in?

369
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:27,651
That's right.

370
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,279
But there is a condition

371
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,573
Wait till you catch me

372
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,074
Kill me or silence me

373
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:37,620
As you wish

374
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,206
The money is yours.

375
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,584
But

376
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,630
Please spare the other robbers.

377
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,301
Hello?

378
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,264
Has the location been tracked?

379
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,435
Although we haven't tracked him down, he probably didn't get far away.

380
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,187
Let none of them escape

381
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,814
-Absolutely not
-Yes

382
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,400
What are you doing?

383
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:10,569
Berlin…

384
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:13,906
Dead

385
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:15,699
I know

386
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,409
I can't lose you too

387
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,746
I am the one who made this plan

388
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,167
If only I could end this...

389
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,502
Follow me

390
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:27,419
What are you doing!

391
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,964
-Cheer up!
-Tokyo

392
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,842
Did I say that before?

393
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,720
I don't want to see it again

394
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,599
Death of a loved one

395
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,061
What are you doing?

396
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:45,938
Go away!

397
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:14,758
What is this?

398
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:44,788
Berlin's self-explosion escape exit blocked

399
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,957
It seems that we can only follow other paths.

400
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,506
Professor

401
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,301
The base was discovered

402
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,095
They're about to break in.

403
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:01,847
So what do we do now?

404
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,558
The professor thought of a way

405
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,103
Now we can try

406
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,773
Only this

407
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,089
I am Sun Yuzhen from Gyeonggi Provincial Government.

408
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,467
I heard an explosion over there.

409
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,928
The robbers should be found soon if we trace them back...

410
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,014
-What are you doing?
-You are under arrest

411
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,018
She is suspected of colluding with the robbers

412
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:51,146
Bring her here and all other personnel will chase her

413
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,145
This is totally a spider web.

414
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,271
It doesn't matter

415
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,066
The city’s infrastructure is not connected to neighboring areas

416
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,151
Is independent

417
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,278
No matter how they escape

418
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:43,657
Just block this mouth
They are trapped in a jar.

419
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,828
Currently here and here

420
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,664
The police followed closely behind

421
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,375
As long as you get close to this place, you can capture it.

422
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,087
That's it

423
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,301
What are you doing!

424
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:06,513
I want to ask you

425
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:09,475
You are not suspected of leaking information or collusion
And was suspended?

426
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:11,935
I'm glad you didn't get interrogated.

427
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,730
Unreported
Just act arbitrarily in an area outside your jurisdiction?

428
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:16,690
You don't have any other purpose, do you?

429
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,400
Any other purpose?

430
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:19,401
Who knows?

431
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,862
You're in cahoots with him

432
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,448
Who knows if there is any consensus?

433
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:26,825
Only you two know this.

434
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:28,535
Shut up!

435
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,829
You insist on using force to suppress

436
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,541
You just want to kill people to silence them?

437
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,335
Is this the reason why you brought me here?

438
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:37,836
They are terrorists!

439
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:41,799
We must protect the economic cooperation zone that symbolizes peace
No harm from those guys

440
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,178
What do you and Jeon Yong-soo want to plan through this summit?

441
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:47,679
Who is behind the scenes?

442
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:50,432
Are you afraid that all this will be exposed?

443
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:57,105
I thought you were just a physical union.

444
00:46:57,189 --> 00:47:01,652
I didn’t expect that ideological education was also done very thoroughly.

445
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,404
There is a bomb

446
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,198
Found the bomb!

447
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:08,075
Captain, there seems to be a bomb here

448
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,953
Search Team 2 We found explosives

449
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:12,913
- Explosives found!
- Found the bomb!

450
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:15,999
Search team 4 found another bomb

451
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,460
Explosives found! We are on the south side of Peace Square

452
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,754
Found another

453
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:27,261
Underground near Peace Square
A large amount of explosives buried

454
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,387
What should we do?

455
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,848
If there are other situations, please stand by.

456
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,433
This is their purpose.

457
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:34,935
What?

458
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,354
The bomb exploded in the crowded Peace Square
What will be the result?

459
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:40,691
There will be a lot of casualties and there will be chaos there.

460
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:43,652
These bastards just want to take advantage of the opportunity to slip away!

461
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:45,153
No way…

462
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:46,780
No, this is impossible.

463
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,323
So far the professor and the robber

464
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,576
Always follow the principle of not killing

465
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,119
You still believe this

466
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,707
They just want to delay printing money
Just looking for an excuse

467
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:58,292
But…

468
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,002
If they are really thieves

469
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:01,962
How to plant a bomb?

470
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,338
Why should I let you live?

471
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,257
These are all interference strategies

472
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,801
You are being played around by them
Still don't understand?

473
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,031
Impossible

474
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,616
She's in the way.

475
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:32,951
Get her out of here.

476
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,459
Take her to the police station first.

477
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:41,376
Director

478
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:44,463
No Director...

479
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:58,060
Then we have to evacuate first
You are the ordinary people in Peace Square, right?

480
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:02,564
In this way
What if the robbers slip away in the crowd?

481
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,151
Ah?

482
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:11,949
-Kim Sang-wan!
-Step down!

483
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,992
-Cancel!
-Hurry Summit!

484
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,036
-Objection!
-False economic cooperation!

485
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,330
-Kim Sang-wan!
-Step down!

486
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,374
-Cancel!
-Hurry Summit!

487
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,836
Complete blockade of the area around Peace Square

488
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,755
Don't let a mouse escape

489
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:29,466
-Objection!
-Killing Economic Cooperation

490
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:31,760
-Kim Sang-wan!
-Step down!

491
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,887
-Cancel!
-Hurry Summit!

492
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:46,108
If the bomb explodes, there will be many casualties.

493
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,609
Just defuse the bomb!

494
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:54,866
But we must not let the robbers escape from the square

495
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,953
If the bomb cannot be prevented

496
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,999
That place became the grave of the robbers.

497
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,003
Compared to the lives of ordinary people and police officers

498
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,463
Is it more important to you to kill all the robbers?

499
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,507
Your security department's position

500
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:12,926
It should be about the same, right?

501
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,794
-What do you want to do?
- It will only take a moment

502
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:53,508
You are right

503
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:57,095
Member Kim only wants to pass
Kill the robbers to cover up the incident

504
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:58,764
He is not interested in other

505
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:02,559
Please help me

506
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,062
I should know where the robbers are going.

507
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,275
You think they won't use bombs?

508
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,819
No matter how hard you try, it's impossible to use bombs

509
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,196
What is your basis?

510
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:16,531
Is it out of personal feelings?

511
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,496
I don't know but...

512
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,123
It seems like there is no time to defuse the bomb!

513
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:29,044
The police have not given any explanation yet
They blocked off the square area

514
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,088
Bringing protesters and ordinary citizens together

515
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,380
All are locked in this range

516
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:35,801
As previously reported, in the Peace Square area

517
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,844
People held large-scale rallies

518
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,806
Condemned the hasty handling of the economic cooperation summit
More and more people want to participate…

519
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,099
I am the Director

520
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,851
Evacuate the citizens in the square now

521
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,770
What are you doing? What are you doing...

522
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,272
You don't want to do this anymore? Keep control!

523
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,779
I repeat, I am the Director!

524
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:58,657
From this moment on, I will take all the responsibility.

525
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:02,327
Evacuate all citizens from the square now!

526
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,998
Take action now!

527
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,500
-Yes, I know.
-Yes

528
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:21,888
Get out of the way!

529
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,138
-What?
-What is that?

530
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:05,348
-What is that?
-How did you get up there?

531
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:06,892
What's going on?

532
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:09,227
-What is that?
-What about the pig?

533
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,062
What is that?

534
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:14,900
What is that?

535
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,887
(The paper house is ours)

536
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,876
Bundles of money from unknown sources fell from the sky

537
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:53,581
It's a money bomb

538
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:02,841
The explosions that occurred in the Peace Square area just now

539
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:05,468
It has been confirmed that it was the work of the Banknote Printing Bureau robbery gang

540
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:09,180
Large balloons can be seen everywhere at the scene.

541
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:12,976
Huge amounts of new currency were scattered

542
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:16,146
The police seem to have given up on continuing to control

543
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:19,733
Our interview revealed
The robbers have escaped from the Banknote Printing Bureau

544
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,819
And has escaped from the police

545
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,283
(The robbers escaped from the Banknote Printing Bureau
Billions of dollars dropped in Peace Square

546
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:39,794
-Opportunists get out!
-Opportunists get out!

547
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:43,882
-The paper house is ours
-The paper house is ours

548
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:45,842
The paper house is ours!

549
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:31,054
(Taedong River Beer)

550
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,140
- Authentic?
-The professor said so

551
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:36,976
He said only his late father knew

552
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,313
When I was a spy, I investigated this kind of place.

553
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,732
But these places have been blocked
There is nothing left

554
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,317
Although the official view is like this

555
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,320
But he said there is still a place left

556
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:48,905
Even if there is such a place

557
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,241
Where can you go with all that money in North Korea?

558
00:56:58,665 --> 00:56:59,749
Train

559
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,419
In the tunnel entrance not far from the Economic Cooperation Zone

560
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:04,337
Is there any hotel close to the train station?

561
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:06,589
We have to go

562
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:10,427
Don't move!

563
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:13,221
I thought of a place

564
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:38,580
(Khabarovsk, Kaesong)

565
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:09,944
- Let's go
- Let's go

566
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,216
Captain!

567
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:38,306
Is that Zhonghao?

568
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,200
It's Berlin

569
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:12,734
You can't let go of Xuan Yuzhen?

570
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,403
Did you figure it out?

571
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:17,739
This time I learned a lesson

572
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,367
Robbery or Revolution

573
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:23,786
After all, it's all done by humans.

574
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:28,291
But maybe she's on her way.

575
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:31,586
Maybe

576
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:34,797
Because she is not an ordinary woman

577
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,008
Are you worried that she might come?

578
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:39,427
Still

579
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:41,679
Are you waiting for her to come?

580
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:44,682
I don't know either.

581
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:52,982
We should go

582
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:16,381
Don't move!

583
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:29,686
Stop the train!

584
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:34,732
What I said to you before

585
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,528
It's all true

586
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:41,698
Got it, stop the train!

587
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:43,866
You can kill me

588
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:46,411
But you can't arrest me

589
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:47,328
No

590
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:52,500
I will arrest you and your accomplices and hand them over to the court.

591
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:53,668
What is our crime?

592
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:56,170
In the printing office, you can print as much money as you want.

593
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:59,006
And I told the people who owned the money

594
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,593
It is not to regard unification as
The means of making money are not the tycoons and politicians but the people.

595
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:06,180
Is this the charge?

596
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:08,307
Still

597
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:10,435
The sin of deceiving you?

598
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:15,106
If you want to convict me

599
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:18,860
Then make your choice

600
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:39,440
Robber gangs made up of North Korean and South Korean criminals

601
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:42,860
Took away a huge amount of money and disappeared without a trace

602
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:46,322
The process
It's like the finale of a big magic show.

603
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:52,119
Because the summit square was packed with people

604
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:55,581
Robbers dropped $300 million in cash

605
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:58,501
Cause confusion

606
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:03,214
Escaped from the police

607
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,745
The paper house is ours!

608
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,582
What we do inside and outside the paper house

609
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:39,250
Through YouTube and social media

610
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:42,003
And foreign media spread all over the world

611
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:47,842
The robbers of the Bureau of Printing
How did they print the huge amount of 4 trillion?

612
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:51,304
There is a conspiracy theory that
The third summit between South and North Korea

613
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:55,349
It is said that it is under the pretext of economic cooperation
Actually it is for relief

614
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:58,603
Chaebol companies participating in the opening up to North Korea
And printed a large number of volunteer funds

615
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:00,187
(Embezzlement of economic cooperation funds and dereliction of duty)

616
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:03,232
Checked the Peace Square
After the serial numbers of the scattered banknotes

617
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:04,317
This fact has been proven

618
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,651
(Conspiracy theories are all false political tricks)

619
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:08,279
I, Kim Sang-man, for the success of the North Korea development project

620
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:10,489
Just doing my duty

621
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:12,325
About additional funding

622
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:15,995
Everything is in accordance with
Due Process of the Special Committee on Economic Cooperation

623

The decision made

624
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:21,375
Presidential election day is coming and it will be
A historic moment marking the turning point of peaceful reunification between North and South Korea…

625
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:23,210
Those in power always do this

626
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:26,756
Trying to use your power
Hide yourself in the dark

627
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:30,092
But the people came to the square to light up the darkness.

628
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:33,346
South Koreans and North Koreans together

629
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:35,431
Put on our masks

630
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:39,185
The paper house is ours!

631
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:42,772
(The whereabouts of former warden Quan Longxiu is unknown
Is what the shelter did true?

Please make a comment

635

It’s out!

636
01:05:57,578 --> 01:05:59,413
Are the suspicions about you and Councillor Kim Sang-wan true?

637

(South Korean and North Korean governments reconsider economic cooperation
To push in a constructive direction)

Therefore, "The Paper House is Ours"

639

This sentence is gradually becoming a reality

640
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:14,053
Just confess honestly.

641
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:16,806
It is understandable that people do this when they are greedy for money.

642
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:21,185
View all my deposit history
Even froze the account

643

644

Captain Xuan

645
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:27,608
We have been interrogating you for a year.

646
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:30,069

649

Are you still here?

650
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:02,893
Have you quit smoking?

651
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:04,854
Someone forced me to quit

652
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:06,397
Are you in a relationship?

653
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:08,149
Yes, that one...

654
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:17,491
Is this why you rushed here?

655
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:18,617
Yes

656
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:21,454
Hey, the bride is...

657
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:22,413
She is from North Korea

658

I encountered it when I was sent to North Korea

659

Yeah

660
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:29,670

Sorry, I think I have to tell you...

What are you sorry for?

666

Your divorce proceedings are finally over

667
01:07:50,107 --> 01:07:53,360
Internal investigation and state compensation lawsuit
It costs a lot, right?

668
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:58,115
Forget it, there will always be an end

The Banknote Printing Bureau Incident is world famous

673

We want to take charge of this case

Thanks but

I don't have the money to hire you for such an expensive...

Don't worry

Looking for an old postcard

682
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:03,722
Roll it up and put it in the drawer

Excuse me sir

685
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:11,332
Is there a coffee shop nearby?

686
01:10:12,499 --> 01:10:13,751
Coffee, do you know?

687
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:16,754
I don't speak English

Sorry

- Good

Huh? What is this? This is not mine

705

Big brother!

706
01:12:44,109 --> 01:12:46,570
Eh? Did you just take this down from the living room?

707
01:12:46,653 --> 01:12:48,155
I said this is not mine
