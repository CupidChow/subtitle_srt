1
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:09,926
NETFLIX series

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,594
(Economic Cooperation Zone)

3
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,100
You all

4
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,270
Sitting in class should be awkward

5
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:21,896
It's been hard these days.

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,399
-What?
-What?

7
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,609
Your tone is like the tone of a professor speaking at graduation.

8
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:28,778
Yes

9
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,073
The day for executing the plan has been set

10
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:33,616
Really?

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,494
Really? Wow we should have a party!

12
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,705
Today we will drink as much as we want and have a good rest

13
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,752
-Drink till you die!
-Are we finally done?

14
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,463
Cheers!

15
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,425
Come teach!

16
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,052
Wish you success!

17
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:09,611
Lifting the veil

18
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,114
Uncle, what song do you always sing?

19
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,826
Just humming a few old songs

20
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,746
My dad only sings the same song

21
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:20,872
Try singing it

22
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,250
-Hurry!
-I'm shy

23
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,795
Come, let's listen to Moscow sing

24
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,421
Sing a song

25
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,006
-You really want me to sing?
-Sing a song

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,634
-Sing a song
-Sing a song

27
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,677
Then I really sang it

28
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,720
Sing a song

29
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,556
Very quiet

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,017
Lifting the veil

31
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,187
With my narrow eyes

32
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:49,484
Open your eyes and look at the world

33
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,362
Open the windows

34
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:56,241
Let me feel it again

35
00:01:56,741 --> 00:02:01,704
Dancing breeze

36
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:07,210
Let me walk on the soft grass

37
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,506
I want to hear the spring and the birds singing

38
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,885
I want to cry and laugh

39
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,346
Please touch my heart

40
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,058
I'm going to the land of happiness

41
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,772
Let's go to the land of happiness hand in hand

42
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,194
Let's go to the land of happiness hand in hand

43
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,081
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

44
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:55,758
You're not drunk at all

45
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,680
Today is a day like this
It's okay to be a little drunk, right?

46
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,934
That's right.
But it's not a good idea for us to drink alone

47
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:06,811
Just one more drink

48
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,357
We have been trapped in a remote mountain valley for several months.

49
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,943
Both of us are lonely

50
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,658
When the plan is completed, drink as much as you want.

51
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,083
When was the last time you had sex with a woman?

52
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,920
Did you forget that we agreed not to talk about personal matters?

53
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,590
Actually, it doesn't matter whether you say it or not

54
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,300
The body is more honest than the mouth

55
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:42,972
Come

56
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:44,933
Good night

57
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,231
Let's have another drink

58
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,488
Hey Tokyo

59
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,284
Alas, I just...

60
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,167
Would the two rejected people like to have a drink?

61
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,213
I'm not in the mood

62
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,261
Hello!

63
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,637
Hey, play with me for a while!

64
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,306
Hey Berlin

65
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,308
Come out and have a drink together!

66
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,728
Feed Denver Moscow

67
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,315
Come out for another drink and play together!

68
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,442
Damn

69
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,489
Tomorrow when we go in you will follow me closely.

70
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,324
- Got it?
- Take care of yourself

71
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,910
Listen carefully to what the professor says and follow his instructions.

72
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,745
So all the drunkards gather here?

73
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,417
Is that enough wine?

74
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,461
What is this?

75
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,351
Hey you crazy man

76
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,895
Hey, this is not alcohol.

77
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,316
If you are used to drinking this
Drinking Korean alcohol again will taste like plain water

78
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,032
You are from the same orphanage.

79
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,744
Although they look different
But they are just like brothers.

80
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,662
We two didn't want to starve.

81
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,123
I've done anything to make money.

82
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,960
-After that, Mingtai...
- Hello!

83
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,505
Then Helsinki said

84
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:43,384
To make big money you have to join an organization
So we joined together

85
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,763
-Although the rebellion finally came out...
- Sorry for interrupting

86
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,806
Is your name Mingtai?

87
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,018
It’s Mingtai, right?

88
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:54,896
Cute

89
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,608
Feed you this pile of fat pig head

90
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,984
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,529
Why did you quit the organization?

92
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:11,079
That madman
She said she wanted to find her mother who abandoned her and went to Korea

93
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,247
Crying

94
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,751
So did you find it?

95
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,629
I found it.

96
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,006
Hey, why are you so useless?

97
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,424
Why are you crying?

98
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:27,095
I said I wanted to see my mother but she wouldn't let me go.

99
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,305
Who won't let?

100
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:31,933
Helsinki?

101
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,436
They said they wanted to quit the organization

102
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,814
Just leave your head behind

103
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,690
We'll chop off their brains.
Left there

104
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,568
In the end

105
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,738
His so-called mother is also missing.

106
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:47,949
Hello

107
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,201
What do you want with a woman like that?

108
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,794
Why are you crying?

109
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,171
I think of my son

110
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,341
You have a son?

111
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,135
How old is he?

112
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,140
About as old as you, right?

113
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,474
What?

114
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:27,905
I almost forgot you are a professional liar

115
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,699
You even lied to us?

116
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,576
You

117
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:37,707
I tell you
Not everyone can have a child like him.

118
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,376
How good do you think you are?

119
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,675
What's going on?

120
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:48,676
All police officers

121
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,637
Everyone should be prepared for unexpected situations

122
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:59,228
Actually so far
We never really negotiated with them.

123
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:03,065
From the beginning
The robbers are just trying to print money and are always buying time.

124
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,942
But they will soon find out

125
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,235
Real Negotiation

126
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,237
Start Now

127
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,994
Fast moving

128
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,978
Why is there a power outage?

129
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,064
Hello!

130
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,692
Is there no one upstairs?

131
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,871
Berlin

132
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,498
Did you do this too?

133
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,252
If I had the ability, I would have killed you long ago.

134
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,797
Everyone please stay together quietly

135
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,174
How could this happen? The power outage was not in the plan.

136
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,260
Not in the plan?

137
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,012
What does that mean?

138
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:57,972
We're leaving here

139
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,641
Don't just stand there

140
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,394
You have to think about your family.

141
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,062
We all act together

142
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,940
Don't let your imagination run wild and follow me, okay?

143
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,194
I said...

144
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,654
Now is not the time to fool around

145
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:14,822
Turn on the light first

146
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,992
Helsinki! You go to the hostages first

147
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:38,596
Was it successful?

148
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,389
Response teams appear to have shut off the power

149
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,642
This makes it easier to get out

150
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,061
-What about the others?
-Waiting at the entrance

151
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,146
I'll take care of the guards outside.

152
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,064
Everyone, please move first.

153
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,792
What are you doing now?

154
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,139
- Get out!
- Come with me

155
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,029
I'll turn on the emergency power.

156
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:38,823
Rio, you are guarding the director's office

157
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,032
You two go to the exhibition hall.

158
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,492
Quick!

159
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,129
Why are you here?

160
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,297
How did you do with Oslo?

161
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,927
If you don't want to die, just go to sleep.

162
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:04,432
Come on!

163
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,518
Don't fall behind, catch up!

164
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,186
Quick!

165
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,480
It's us

166
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,065
Continue walking in this direction

167
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,483
-Hurry up
-Keep going forward

168
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,654
What's going on?

169
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:19,739
Be careful

170
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,282
Are you okay?

171
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:22,825
Hello who's there?

172
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,577
-Who is it?
-Wait a minute!

173
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,703
Scared to death

174
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,748
Didn't anything happen underground?

175
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,875
It's too dark to see anything

176
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,092
It's okay!

177
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,927
-Keep going!
-Keep going forward

178
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,013
- Come over here
- Walk fast

179
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,890
Come on!

180
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:47,558
Let's go

181
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,894
-Goodness Run
-Go!

182
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,881
-Helsinki!
-Helsinki!

183
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,092
Helsinki!

184
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,136
- Be careful
-I can't see anything!

185
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,356
Go over there

186
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,445
Hurry up

187
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,033
-Okay
-Who is that?

188
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:48,661
He is here

189
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,955
Helsinki!

190
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:51,872
Hello!

191
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,084
-What's wrong with you Helsinki!
-Helsinki, wake up!

192
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,377
These bastards

193
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,003
Okay, how do you feel?

194
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,137
Hello, Professor

195
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,807
Damn, we seem to be doomed. What should we do?

196
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,975
Calm down first

197
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,981
I can probably guess where they went.

198
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,526
Cheer up

199
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:22,736
Try harder

200
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,655
What happened in Helsinki?

201
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,824
Try to stand up on your own

202
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:30,995
Have you recovered?

203
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:34,915
What's wrong?

204
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,711
Xiangyuan!

205
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,339
-Hey where are you going?
-Helsinki where are you going?

206
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,216
- Hello!
-It is the unloading area

207
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,594
The hostages are slipping out the back door!

208
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,429
Unloading area?

209
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,347
- Walk fast
-Dad is this way!

210
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:52,975
Damn

211
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,485
Hurry up

212
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,195
Hurry up

213
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:12,661
Go over there

214
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,455
Speed up

215
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,435
Why hesitate? Huh?

216
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,561
Check this out

217
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,980
What is that? Isn't that a bomb?

218
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,733
What the hell should I do?

219
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,029
Get out of the way!

220
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,714
Are you crazy? Don't want to live anymore?

221
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,884
If this explodes
Everyone here must die!

222
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,896
Before I blow your head off, you bastard

223
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,856
Put down your gun

224
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,150
Put your hands above your head!

225
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,986
Sit down!

226
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,779
Don't Shoot

227
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,991
If you put down your weapons now
Return to the original position

228
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,159
No one will get hurt

229
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,285
Put the gun down

230
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:41,458
Sit down!

231
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,592
Now I seem to be in control of the situation

232
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,095
-I'll call you back when I've sorted this out.
- Good

233
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,691
What's going on?

234
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,236
You better be smart

235
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,412
Call headquarters immediately!

236
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,920
You bastard

237
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,387
I am Park Cheol-woo from the Special Forces Team

238
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,599
Hostages are currently fleeing and need external support

239
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,561
When you use your police force to attract the attention of the robbers

240
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,605
I will take the opportunity to take the hostage to the rooftop.

241
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,734
Where are the hostages now?

242
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,499
(Police Commando)

243
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,427
Are you communicating with that Professor guy here?

244
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,266
Hey, where is the agent named Park Cheol-woo?

245
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,104
Park Cheol Woo!

246
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,072
What is that sound?

247
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,700
Damn

248
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,201
Get out of the way!

249
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,669
What's going on?

250
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:57,946
Get down, everybody!

251
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,490
If you don't want to get shot, get down!

252
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,128
I can't hold on any longer!

253
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,129
Hang in there!

254
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,839
They won’t do anything rash because they have hostages!

255
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:21,929
Moscow!

256
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,181
Give!

257
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,329
What the hell?

258
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,706
No more bullets!

259
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,194
Hey Berlin, come and help!

260
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,488
Push!

261
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,950
Dad, what are you doing? Come and push!

262
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,576
-I know, I'm coming!
-Come on!

263
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,347
Can't go any further

264
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,850
This is a great opportunity to rescue the hostages.

265
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,351
Buy some more time

266
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,360
Come on

267
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:01,820
Come on

268
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,714
Look at them running away

269
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,632
-Tokyo!
-Is Nairobi okay?

270
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,220
Hostages!

271
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,139
On the rooftop!

272
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,475
They were planning to escape from there from the beginning!

273
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,518
- Damn
-Denver, let's go!

274
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,062
Go quickly!

275
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,067
Run over here quickly!

276
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,862
-Run!
-Hurry!

277
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,406
Hurry up!

278
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,825
Pace up!

279
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,203
-Where are you going, you bastards!
-Hurry up

280
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,120
Hey, stop!

281
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:53,789
Get Down!

282
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,334
Don't move!

283
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,252
Hurry up!

284
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,838
Don't stop, come this way

285
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:02,923
-This way!
-Hurry up!

286
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,719
What are you doing?

287
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,888
Come on up! Come on!

288
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,183
Director, you bastard!

289
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,811
Come on up quickly!

290
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,229
Hurry up!

291
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,817
We are here!

292
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,027
-This way!
-This way!

293
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,029
-Save us!
-This way!

294
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,330
Come here quickly!

295
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,457
-Hurry up
-This way!

296
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,543
Hurry up!

297
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:40,961
Come on!

298
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,337
-Here
-Come over here!

299
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,755
We are here!

300
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,635
Come down!

301
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,886
Is everything ok up there?

302
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,304
Get down!

303
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,807
-Nairobi!
-Go down!

304
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,976
Catch them!

305
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,644
-Get out of the way!
- Damn

306
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,021
Damn

307
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,193
You go

308
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:07,946
You leave quickly!

309
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,032
Get out of here!

310
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,679
What? They ran away?

311
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,481
Save the children and women first

312
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,902
What are you doing? Get out of the way!

313
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,698
What are you doing? Why?

314
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:54,451
Why don’t you go down quickly? What are you standing there for?
We almost died!

315
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:17,682
Save us!

316
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,976
What's going on?

317
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,478
Hello!

318
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,272
Hey, pull me up!

319
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:30,654
What should I do?

320
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,489
There is no other way, just jump down!

321
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,074
Hurry up

322
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,408
Come on

323
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,953
-Save us!
-This way!

324
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,251
This way!

325
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,460
Hey, pull me up!

326
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:48,004
Pull it up!

327
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,172
Come!

328
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,257
This way!

329
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,178
Pull it up!

330
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,513
-Sister, you go down first
-Pull up!

331
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,265
No, I'll dance behind you.

332
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,516
You go quickly

333
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,102
Hey, don't you want to leave? Jump now.

334
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,187
No, I'm afraid of heights...

335
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,487
- It's out
-Open it quickly!

336
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,405
Open it quickly!

337
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:20,996
Go inside

338
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,503
Get out of the way!

339
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,274
A bunch of bastards!

340
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,826
Hey Berlin, put me down!

341
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,161
What are you doing, you bastard!

342
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,830
-Put me down!
- Pull it up!

343
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:06,916
Damn it, help me!

344
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,053
-Put me down!
-Stop it!

345
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:29,105
It is confirmed that 29 hostages have escaped

346
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,983
Nearly half of the hostages escaped.

347
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,903
Although there was a shooting during the escape

348
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:39,407
But it has been confirmed that there were no casualties among the police and hostages.

349
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,911
Police say all hostages who escaped are safe

350
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,664
After they undergo a simple medical examination

351
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:49,376
They will be interviewed to assist with the investigation.

352
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,671
How do you feel about being free again after six days?

353
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:53,797
Please say something!

354
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,971
I'm just worried about the safety of the remaining hostages.

355
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,890
Have you ever seen the robbers' faces?

356
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,308
Please leave your comments

357
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,976
Please leave a comment!

358
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,938
Not all hostages were able to escape.
This is a pity

359
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,733
But we will never give up and continue to negotiate

360
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,068
(All hostages will be rescued safely)

361
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,529
Make sure that no hostages are left behind

362
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:20,657
Able to all return home safely

363
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:24,869
Although no further details can be disclosed

364
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,414
But we police
We have a lot of information on the robbers.

365
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,124
Working on their weaknesses

366
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,751
End this in a safe way...

367
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,341
No, I will say it clearly.

368
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,177
The robbers better get the facts straight

369
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,638
Except surrender

370
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,766
No other way

371
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,456
This seems to be almost done

372
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,666
Dad

373
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,128
Why do you look so sad?

374
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,506
That...

375
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,688
How did this happen?

376
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,273
-Teletubbies
-Hey Oslo

377
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,568
Why did you stop?

378
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:39,819
-Hey Oslo
-Hmm?

379
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,113
-Oslo!
-Save him now.

380
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,907
Save him quickly!

381
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,993
Sorry he bled so much.

382
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,370
With my blood

383
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,582
It doesn't matter if you take them all out

384
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,709
Save him quickly!

385
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,879
Hurry up!

386
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,088
Save him!

387
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,925
Oh damn!

388
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,545
We must take him with us when we go out.

389
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,798
We buried him in the sun.

390
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:55,895
You crazy

391
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,814
You haven't seen your mother yet

392
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,900
How can I go ahead like this?

393
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,403
Didn't you say that you would wait until you made a lot of money?

394
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,324
Did you buy a house for your mother?

395
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,262
Why is the atmosphere so heavy?

396
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,017
Hey, is this even a question?

397
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,644
The robbers

398
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,104
Will he take revenge on the rest of us like crazy?

399
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,106
We're done

400
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,150
No, we succeeded.

401
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,862
Not only half of it went out
But half of the people went out

402
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,657
I know you want to use the spiritual victory method

403
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,743
But now we should not say anything
Be respectful to them

404
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,996
What good can it do to be respectful to them?

405
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,416
If they are determined to kill us

406
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,752
Even if we beg on our knees
Will they spare our lives?

407
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,713
Deputy Director Uncle, Police Uncle
And my classmates

408
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,925
Dozens of hostages who are familiar with our situation
All went out from here

409
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,385
They will tell the police one by one

410
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,388
We foiled the robbers' plan.

411
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,473
The robbers knew this.

412
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,767
They know we will drive them to destruction too.

413
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,728
We Didn’t Fail

414
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:02,689
We won

415
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,340
I'll keep it brief.

416
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,677
If an accident like today happens again

417
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,178
We cannot guarantee your safety

418
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,099
Got it?

419
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,610
Because of the reduction in staff

420
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,738
So the remaining personnel re-arranged the working group

421
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,906
According to the initial allocation

422
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:57,160
The printing team is over here, the cooking team is over here

423
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,370
The rest of the group follow me

424
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,343
What are you standing for?

425
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,471
Fast moving

426
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,347
Hey you bastards, move on!

427
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,144
Don't test my patience

428
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,937
It's all because of you that Oslo is dead!

429
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,774
He died because of you!

430
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:32,653
Get moving

431
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:55,885
Stop

432
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,513
Stop

433
00:34:58,596 --> 00:34:59,430
Stop it!

434
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:07,563
OK

435
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,003
Their eyes are firm.

436
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,006
Written that I will never obey again

437
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,635
If the hostages do not cooperate

438
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,470
It is impossible to continue printing money

439
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,764
This emergency power won't last long.

440
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:42,932
Two or three days at most?

441
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,977
The escaped hostage must have told the police everything.

442
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,938
Damn
What did the professor tell us to do in this situation?

443
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,023
He didn't talk about this situation.

444
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,692
So what should we do?

445
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,570
Even if something as serious as this happened, I couldn't contact the professor.

446
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,738
Damn it

447
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,365
Tokyo

448
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,033
What should we do?

449
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,703
-Tokyo
-Don't bother me

450
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:04,912
I don't know either.

451
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,623
But we can't continue like this

452
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,458
Let's try to do something

453
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,127
Denver, you help Moscow dig a hole

454
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:14,130
The rest follow Nairobi in printing money

455
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,174
- I will supervise the hostages
- Got it

456
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,217
Not before

457
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,137
We need to find the traitor first

458
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,764
That kid is here again

459
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,808
Stop pretending and stand up

460
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,396
If not you, who else?

461
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,190
Bastard, I told you to stop!

462
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,109
Is it you? Because of that girl?

463
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,445
What girl?

464
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,530
What a bastard!

465
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,115
Have you got shot in the head?

466
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,993
Do you really want to be shot?
Damn it!

467
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:44,911
Stop!

468
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:47,121
-You bastard!
-Hey, don't do that!

469
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,456
Stop!

470
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:53,419
As long as there is a traitor among us
It's all in vain to do anything!

471
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:54,420
Did I say something wrong?

472
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:57,548
If it weren't for that spy
Oslo will not die!

473
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,468
Because of a spy
Our attention is diverted

474
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,054
So we didn’t realize that the hostages were rebelling!

475
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:03,971
Is it?

476
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:07,350
I will kill that traitor with my own hands no matter what

477
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,060
Is that you?

478
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,561
Oh, is that you?

479
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,230
Or you?

480
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,606
-You?
- Hello!

481
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:14,982
You?

482
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,150
You?

483
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,237
Why on earth is this bastard like this?

484
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,239
What's going on?

485
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,531
Hey Berlin!

486
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,242
What happened to him?

487
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,952
What's going on? Are you going crazy?

488
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,495
-Berlin!
-What happened?

489
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,373
This bastard is totally out of his mind

490
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,878
If you can understand
The feelings of the families gathered here

491
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:37,838
Please take action

492
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,715
Courage

493
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,968
For the robbers who can cooperate to calm the situation

494
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:45,137
We guarantee full exemption

495
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:48,391
As a party representative, I will make suggestions to the president

496
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,811
The child doesn’t know anything, right?

497
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,396
Keep it a secret from him

498
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,315
Of course I can assure you of this.

499
00:37:56,899 --> 00:38:00,194
As a trade, you have to do one thing for us.

500
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,737
Where are the children?

501
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,032
Don't worry, we are taking good care of him.

502
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,243
If you dare to touch his hair

503
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,132
I won't give up

504
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,051
Got it?

505
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:28,097
Sorry, but I should be the one to say this.

506
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,225
If the mission is not completed or leaked
You can probably guess the result, right?

507
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,936
Because my life is a mess
You let someone else adopt your son

508
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,939
If you fail the mission you will never see him again.

509
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,763
What's wrong with you?

510
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:12,141
Nairobi was worried and guilty about his son.

511
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:14,268
Failed to tell the truth

512
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,856
The situation at the Banknote Printing Bureau deteriorated.

513
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,233
We don't have any plans

514
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,402
There is no way to let the professor know about this situation.

515
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:29,241
If it were me back then
We should expect the professor to help us solve it.

516
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,535
But now I don’t have that expectation anymore

517
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,746
Even the communication was cut off.

518
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,332
What can the professor do outside?

519
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,343
Something big happened

520
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,598
Hostages revolt

521
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,517
More than half have fled

522
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,603
I also lost contact with the Banknote Printing Bureau.

523
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,939
Should we move the schedule forward?

524
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,691
No, it should be according to the plan

525
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,444
Planning should be done on the day of the summit

526
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,196
This requires understanding the internal situation

527
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,614
How about using that policeman?

528
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,286
Keep an eye on Officer Xuan for me.

529
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:56,912
The rest…

530
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,633
At this time, the confrontation group

531
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,970
Slowly getting information from the escaped hostages

532
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:15,014
Almost all of our information

533
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,224
And Officer Xuan

534
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,686
Even got information that we didn't know.

535
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:21,645
(Helsinki Denver)

536
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,647
(Professor)

537
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:26,692
That...

538
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,111
I almost forgot

539
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,113
I don't know if it will help but I brought this

540
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:32,740
What is this?

541
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,867
Someone hid it in the director's office.

542
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,661
It must be one of the robbers.

543
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,548
What happened to him?

544
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,592
Could it be that he was ill from the beginning?

545
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,096
Are you sweating so much?

546
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,224
I have a terminal illness

547
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,892
On the bookshelf in the Director's Office

548
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,478
I hid a pill box

549
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,480
Can you bring it to me?

550
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,234
He said before that he had a terminal illness
He also said he brought medicine

551
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:09,818
Ah?

552
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,446
I thought he was playing tricks

553
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,953
Shit, it should be here somewhere.

554
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,167
Is this it?

555
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,051
What happened? What kind of medicine is it?

556
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:37,930
Damn

557
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,181
Huntington's disease?

558
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,976
is a
A rare genetic disease that damages the central nervous system

559
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,853
If it is a genetic disease, is it incurable?

560
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,272
There is no medicine to treat

561
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,608
Drugs can only relieve symptoms

562
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:53,445
Simply put, this disease kills brain cells.

563
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,367
Usually starts to develop after the age of 30

564
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:01,161
So when he was in the shelter
Symptoms should have already begun

565
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,415
They can't give the right medicine.

566
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,376
In that hellish environment
He must have suffered a lot.

567
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,547
I was wondering why he suddenly went crazy.

568
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,090
It turns out that he is really sick

569
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:18,304
Does this mean that it is possible to die suddenly?

570
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,223
This is a slow-killing disease

571
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:23,892
But the key is that there is no medicine

572
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,062
What to do?

573
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:30,274
Isolate him first and wait for him to wake up.

574
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:02,806
Tell me who the guys were who planned the prison break with you.

575
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,066
It seems that we need to change the way

576
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,142
You bastard, I heard that you have a terminal illness?

577
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:52,147
Without medicine, you are half disabled, right?

578
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:05,202
It seems we don't need to dirty our hands anymore.

579
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,413
I have tortured you hard.

580
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,708
I'll let you

581
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,001
Life is worse than death

582
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:36,650
So one of these people has a terminal illness.

583
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:38,527
That's right.

584
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,864
Even if you steal a lot of money, you can't spend it all.

585
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:45,993
Could there be other purposes?

586
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,454
For example?

587
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:49,913
Summit

588
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:53,667
The issue of printing 4 trillion banknotes because of the summit
We didn't know before

589
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:55,419
So

590
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:59,923
You mean hindering North-South economic cooperation?
Is this the real purpose of the robbers?

591
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,341
I mean it's possible.

592
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:04,094
I need you to come and take a look

593
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,262
(Jeon Yong Soo)

594
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:08,056
The director of the internment camp where Berlin was held was…

595
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,349
All dragon show?

596
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,811
-Is that the Jeon Yong Soo?
-Yes

597
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,980
He served as North Korea's representative at the Economic Cooperation Summit
Arrival today

598
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:16,899
What?

599
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,443
Is there really any connection?

600
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:26,700
Huntington's disease
You said it was a rare disease, right?

601
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,453
There are only a few patients in China

602
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,831
Investigate the distribution channels of the drug
Then report to me

603
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:33,749
Yes

604
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,002
-What is the purpose of investigating this?
-Including professors

605
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,171
The robbers were not just the few people in the Banknote Printing Bureau.

606
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,716
If they really have any political purpose

607
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,594
We just cut off the power supply to the Bank of Printing

608
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,554
Trapping them in won't stop them.

609
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,640
We need to understand the robbers' movement range

610
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:52,726
Find out their real purpose

611
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,813
For the 3rd Inter-Korean High-Level Economic Cooperation Summit

612
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,105
Northern Representative

613
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:59,858
Chairman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Motherland, Jeon Yong-soo, enters the country today

614
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,486
Thank you for your hospitality

615
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:05,030
For the sake of inter-Korean and inter-Korean
Peaceful reunification and economic prosperity

616
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:07,950
This time we must achieve

617
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:10,577
This national mission

618
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,465
After the business lunch, the president and I will have a drink alone.

619
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,301
Will this Banknote Printing Bureau incident be resolved?

620
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:31,473
They can't get out even with so much money.

621
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:34,893
We held the Economic Cooperation Summit as scheduled
Once the stamp is stamped, all the money is ours

622
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:38,438
I would like to thank them
It bought us time to print the money.

623
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,537
I'll go in and take a look

624
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,432
Are you okay?

625
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,309
I'm fine

626
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:18,020
I heard from Rio that you have a rare disease

627
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,275
Even if my hands start to shake
I don't have to hide it anymore

628
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,369
Why are you hiding?

629
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,373
Don't you have anything to hide?

630
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:41,877
Why did you join this program?

631
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,879
Does medical treatment require money?

632
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,548
If there was a cure, I would have stolen it.

633
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,218
If it's not for money then why?

634
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,848
You didn't come here for the money, did you?

635
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:01,104
You see, my hands were shaking at the beginning.

636
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:05,025
I thought it was just malnutrition.

637
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:08,779
The shelter is full of malnourished people

638
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,491
I have been carrying this disease
It took me a long time to understand

639
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:17,788
My parents got sick because of this disease.
I decided to flee North Korea

640
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:22,417
To treat this genetic disease for my young son

641
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:25,462
They decided to flee North Korea

642
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:27,881
What’s the result?

643
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,384
Don't talk about treatment.

644
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,220
I can't even have a normal meal in the shelter

645
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,807
Isn't it funny that there is no cure for a disease?

646
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,644
You ask me why I joined this program?

647
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,938
Why are you suddenly curious about this?

648
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,816
Are you afraid that I might go crazy?

649
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,111
That's not the case.

650
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,074
No matter what my purpose is

651
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,535
The important thing is that I risked my life for this

652
00:49:58,286 --> 00:49:59,121
What about you?

653
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,165
Me too

654
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,418
But now I don't know what to do

655
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:08,088
You trust the professor more than anyone else.

656
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,382
Isn't it Tokyo?

657
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,885
The communication was cut off and the professor was outside again.

658
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,806
Even if he
What else can be done about the current situation?

659
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,809
I think it's best if we find another way ourselves.

660
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,228
Are you saying you want to change your plans?

661
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,480
At that time, I followed the professor like a dog

662
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:27,899
Now you suddenly say you are unreliable?

663
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:32,487
Did you know?

664
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,034
The more loyal a dog is to its owner

665
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,328
When the owner is in crisis, the more abnormal the behavior

666
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,329
Do you know why?

667
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:43,623
Because the sky has fallen for it

668
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:57,137
Hey, what are you doing?

669
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,513
Tokyo bitch is a traitor

670
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,557
- I am not
-What are you talking about?

671
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,935
She's the only one I never doubted

672
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,480
Hey, calm down first. You're not thinking straight now.

673
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,648
You gain everyone's trust at the beginning

674
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,401
Is this also a deliberate act to act like a spy?

675
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,695
Hey, stop it now.

676
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:15,030
Otherwise I'll just have to start snatching!

677
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,913
Hey Helsinki, stop him!

678
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,539
It's Tokyo!

679
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,208
-She killed Oslo
-What?

680
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:28,585
Don't listen to that lunatic.

681
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,837
It's not me Helsinki is really not me!

682
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,799
I only believe in the professor.

683
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:36,051
I have already discussed this with the professor.

684
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:38,887
If anything happens, besides the professor's words

685
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:42,265
I'll do what Berlin says.

686
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:44,226
Put the gun down

687
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:46,478
Put the gun down! Why don't you stop it?

688
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:47,771
Why are you like this too?

689
00:51:58,156 --> 00:51:59,741
Where is Mom's hair dryer?

690
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,536
Come, mom will help you dry it

691
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,874
I said that person

692
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,002
Cafe owner

693
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:14,256
- Um, what's wrong?
- I said

694
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:17,801
I had something to say to you

695
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:20,095
But I didn't write it down.

696
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:25,767
But I think
I was going to talk about that person.

697
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,020
Don't bother thinking about it

698
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:31,398
We broke up

699
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:46,538
(Shall we meet today?
Come over when you have time and I'll make you a sandwich)

700
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:52,919
(Police officer Nam Dong-chul)

701
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:55,046
Hello, what's wrong?

702
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,840
The results of drug purchase records have been found

703
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:00,427
Patients usually get their prescriptions from one place
Then buy regularly

704
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,387
But some time ago, someone bought a large amount of this drug.

705
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,681
Investigation reveals prescription was forged

706
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:06,600
Where is the location?

707
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,894
It is a pharmacy near the Kangwon University Hospital

708
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:11,479
Using surveillance video to find the vehicle's movement route

709
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:13,857
The car disappeared near a mountain
There's nothing nearby.

710
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:15,817
Only one resort closed

711
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:17,402
The resort…

712
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:22,115
-Maybe it's the robbers' hiding place.
-Is the professor there too?

713
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:23,533
Possibly

714
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,620
I'm going to that place now.
Please send me a support team.

715
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:27,537
Yes

716
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:40,300
Ask the professor to answer the call

717
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,179
Officer Xuan finished the call.
Rushing to somewhere

718
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:47,891
It is not to go against the direction of the group.

719
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:52,020
I installed a navigation system in her car. Can you confirm it?

720
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:09,955
Come and start from now

721
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,374
I'm here with my comrades

722
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:14,626
Play a fun game

723
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:21,675
Go call everyone over.

724
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:52,163
(Police)

725
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,962
Go behind that.

726
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:00,588
Follow me

727
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:02,590
-The rest follow me
-Yes, I know.

728
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:04,551
Run!

729
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:29,868
Police Officer Li

730
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:31,536
Let’s go in!

731
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:47,302
No target found!

732
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:48,887
No target found!

733
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:51,389
Not here either!

734
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,352
-Call the identification team over
-Yes

735
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:57,771
Found it!

736
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:11,659
This side

737
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:20,085
(Liberate the Korean Peninsula through revolution)

738
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,586
Captain, come and take a look at this one too.

739
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:50,949
What is going on now that there is not enough time?

740
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:51,866
What happened?

741
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,953
By the way, is Berlin feeling better?

742
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:55,870
You will know when you go there

743
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,291
What is going on…

744
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,424
Eh? What's going on?

745
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:09,259
Hey! What are you doing?

746
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:10,176
Revenge for Oslo

747
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:13,471
One of them is a traitor

748
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:14,389
What?

749
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:16,015
Let's take a closer look

750
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,351
No one can deceive my eyes

751
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:20,478
If no one confesses until the end

752
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:22,147
I'll kick both of you out.

753
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:27,652
Hmm?

754
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,113
Come

755
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:36,744
Hello!

756
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,955
Yes, I am a traitor!

757
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:41,583
-I'm a traitor!
-Hello, what's going on?

758
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:43,251
I just knew it

759
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:45,378
Come

760
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,636
-Huh? The door over there is open
-Take a picture now!

761
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,554
What's going on?

762
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:56,681
Why is the door open?

763
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:58,224
-It's open!
-Catch him!

764
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,359
I am a traitor!

765
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,820
Hey, shut up!

766
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:14,491
Hey, Berlin, this kid is so timid.

767
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,493
This guy doesn't have the guts to be a traitor

768
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:17,994
That's right.

769
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:22,081
You also know that he said this only to save Tokyo

770
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:24,626
I know

771
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:26,294
Yes, it's not him

772
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:27,212
I…

773
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:30,340
Shut up you bastard!

774
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,217
The traitor is...

775
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:35,178
Tokyo

776
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:36,554
What?

777
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:50,235
Tokyo!

778
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:49,711
As for what happened

779
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:52,380
You need to interrogate the robbers arrested by the police to find out

780
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:54,173
Oh, someone came out!

781
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:56,301
-Hurry over!
-Someone's coming out!

782
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,147
You come to read

783
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:10,565
Read quickly!

784
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:13,735
The inhuman abuse...

785
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:14,861
Read carefully!

786
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:19,907
Put inhuman abuse

787
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:23,453
Former Director of Kaechon No. 14 Shelter

788
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:25,872
Bring Quan Longxiu to me

789
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:29,626
I'm like this anyway

790
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,086
I will die sooner or later, but I want to see him before I die!

791
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,464
If the director doesn't show up

792
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:37,133
I'll cut her into pieces!

793
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:39,594
The robbers' plan

794
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:44,098
It is about to evolve into
Berlin's Private Revenge in a Half-Crazy State

795
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:48,770
The situation at the Bank of Printing is heading for the worst

796
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:52,607
If Berlin really went crazy

797
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:19,676
Lifting the veil

798
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:23,388
With my narrow eyes

799
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:27,642
Open your eyes and look at the world

800
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,230
Open the windows

801
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:35,733
Let me feel it again

802
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:40,905
Dancing breeze

803
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:47,120
Let me walk on the soft grass

804
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:51,290
I want to hear the spring and the birds singing

805
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:54,335
I want to cry and laugh

806
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:56,754
Please touch my heart

807
01:01:56,838 --> 01:02:00,800
I'm going to the land of happiness

808
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:05,221
My father likes this song very much.

809
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:06,764
Yes

810
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:09,851
When I was a kid, I just sang along.

811
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:12,353
Later I found out that this is a Korean song

812
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:17,233
Tomorrow is finally here

813
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:19,360
Let's drink

814
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:23,448
For our father's unfulfilled wish

815
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:26,033
For the reunited brothers

816
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,129
I will do as you say

817
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,340
But if the worst happens, run away.

818
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:44,302
This won't happen.

819
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:46,637
My Plan

820
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:49,682
Even in the worst of situations, there are solutions.

821
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:55,229
(Economic Cooperation Zone Banknote Printing Bureau Hostage Case)
