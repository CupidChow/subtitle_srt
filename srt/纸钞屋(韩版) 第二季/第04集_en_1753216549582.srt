00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,054
(Two months before the incident)

3
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,597
(Inside story of Councillor Kim Sang-man's divorce lawsuit)

4
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,851
The opposing lawyer obviously wanted to make things worse.

5
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,186
If we join in the fun, we will suffer the consequences.

6
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,398
We published a news article to clarify
How about telling the other person they are lying?

7
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,568
My daughter is under a lot of pressure at school.

8
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:27,944
More effective is

9
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,281
Let your mother testify in court as soon as possible

10
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,533
Can't keep delaying the referee

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,953
Just in case, I'd like to ask

12
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,290
Does your mother have any health problems?

13
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:41,833
No

14
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:44,878
Why then suddenly...

15
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:46,546
I'm fine.

16
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:50,383
The other party asks to see your mother's medical records

17
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,720
They want to prove by any means possible
Your mother is incapable of testifying

18
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,431
This means they have no other options.

19
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,641
Damn

20
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,393
What?

21
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:04,647
Nothing

22
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,150
Let's talk later

23
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,280
Are you okay?

24
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,034
I'm sorry, are you not hurt?

25
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:16,951
Nothing

26
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,704
Car…

27
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:24,709
I…

28
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,337
Why don't you go to the hospital for a checkup?

29
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,464
It doesn't matter

30
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,841
Please give me your business card. Process through insurance.

31
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:32,801
Oh ok

32
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:41,226
It may be dangerous for you to continue driving
How about calling a tow truck?

33
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,437
Thank you for your concern, but it's okay

34
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:47,941
That...

35
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,321
Would you like to have a cup of coffee together?

36
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,409
Is it too old-fashioned?

37
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,747
There is a new cafe in front

38
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,958
The coffee tastes great

39
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,462
Are you expressing affection?

40
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,883
Just think of me as attracting customers

41
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,305
(Goodbye Beauty Cafe)

42
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:38,032
Your way of attracting customers is quite unique.

43
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,451
Um, that...

44
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,788
Actually, it hasn't officially opened yet.

45
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,749
This is the first time I do this

46
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:51,462
I always feel like I'll never see you again after this separation.

47
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,716
Do you like coffee?

48
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,851
No wine?

49
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,436
What?

50
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,021
I asked you if you had any wine?

51
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,816
No need to drive anyway.

52
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,195
I just need a drinking companion

53
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,656
Oh, it's so hot

54
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,782
Two months before the start of the project

55
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,285
Professor creates accidents

56
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,162
Deliberately approached Officer Xuan

57
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:30,960
She was for
Exhausted by the high-profile custody lawsuit

58
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,381
Talk to someone who doesn't know his background
Chatting and laughing for a while

59
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,467
Maybe it was exactly what she wanted at that time.

60
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,722
But the professor who knew Officer Xuan well

61
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,768
It just hit the empty hole in her heart.

62
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:53,107
Make Officer Xuan part of the plan
The professor has completed this preparation.

63
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,816
Leaving without saying hello?

64
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,654
Actually, I am a married woman.

65
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,449
Although I am in the process of divorce

66
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:47,704
Sorry

67
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,165
When I came here, I didn't expect it to turn out like this.

68
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,337
I have been feeling very confused recently so I have…

69
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:03,886
You think I'm hopeless?

70
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:09,767
It doesn't matter

71
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,936
I brought you here for this purpose.

72
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,900
So your plan was successful?

73
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,902
This is just the beginning

74
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,489
I have a lot of things to do with you

75
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:24,991
For example?

76
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,745
Let me think

77
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:32,623
Do you like traveling?

78
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,585
Is it too ordinary?

79
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:37,962
Where to travel?

80
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,466
From Vladivostok
Trans-Eurasian train

81
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,510
Through Moscow to Kyiv

82
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:46,888
What?

83
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,432
This will take about a week, right?

84
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,770
Yes, change trains there.

85
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,022
Go to Kherson

86
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,775
Where is it then?

87
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,569
It is a small port city in southern Ukraine.

88
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,988
A beautiful place

89
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,532
If you go there

90
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,493
Isn't it faster to take a plane?

91
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,704
Although it takes a long time
But train travel is romantic.

92
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,794
Sorry, I don't have any

93
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,754
That kind of romance

94
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,591
I'll contact you again

95
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,181
Some people were fine at the scene of the accident.

96
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,892
But it will cause trouble later

97
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,068
I didn't get to taste coffee today.

98
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,779
I'll come when I have time.

99
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:30,116
(Park Sun-ho)

100
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,075
Why at that time?

101
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,038
If Officer Xuan
No collapse due to overwork

102
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,625
If the professor hadn't come to tidy up the headquarters

103
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,837
They will never see each other again until they die.

104
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,256
Actually, it is right not to meet each other.

105
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,675
Yuzhen!

106
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,303
Wake up

107
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,263
Yuzhen, wake up!

108
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,182
Wake up!

109
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,476
Yuzhen!

110
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,452
The content they revealed was confirmed to be untrue

111
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,830
Most analysts believe

112
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:45,167
The reason why the robbers incited false content
It may be intended to disrupt North-South economic cooperation

113
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,921
Therefore, as Chairman of the Special Committee on Economic Cooperation
Potential candidates to lead economic cooperation summit

114
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:52,466
Kim Sang-man's approval rating is expected to be affected

115
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,595
But polls show
His approval rating remains stable

116
00:09:57,054 --> 00:10:00,266
It seems that there is no need to worry about public opinion for the time being.

117
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,394
I thought Korean media would be a little different

118
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,896
It seems to be no different from the Central Radio Station.

119
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,985
Our group has invested a lot of money in advertising.
They should look at us.

120
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,987
Once we've dealt with the guys inside,

121
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,198
It's only a matter of time before they catch us outside, right?

122
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,828
Don't think too much
Just label them as terrorists

123
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,332
Let's kill them all before the summit.

124
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,334
What if there is a counterattack?

125
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,711
Anyway, the robbers are in a state of restraint.

126
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,464
It’s not too late to deal with it after the summit, right?

127
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,548
Is it because of the support rate?

128
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,800
Anyway, whether it's you or me

129
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,219
As long as this summit fails
Our political careers will be...

130
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,596
Please be quiet for a moment.

131
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,726
Our Actions

132
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,103
It is for the future of the Korean Peninsula that is about to be plundered

133
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,857
Return this land to its true owners
That is to say, we will give it back to the people.

134
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,233
(Hostage Release Preview)

135
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,444
But people outside

136
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,279
Concealing our intentions

137
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,698
Eager to cover it up with lies

138
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,035
It seems that he is afraid that people will know
They are the real robbers.

139
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,333
Then I want to give the people of the north and south a chance

140
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,710
Choose to believe regardless of the safety of the hostages

141
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,837
The real robbers

142
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,547
Or choose to believe us

143
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,758
You choose

144
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,886
Tomorrow at 3pm

145
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,431
We hereby promise

146
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:24,975
Some hostages will be released

147
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,940
Request to stop broadcasting immediately!

148
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,024
The live broadcast has stopped

149
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,360
But people who watched it seemed to be forwarding the video all the time.

150
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,361
Stop it now!

151
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,780
Check out all the live comments!

152
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,407
Damn it!

153
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,576
Member of Parliament

154
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,414
We are doing our best to handle

155
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,999
These assholes' communication equipment doesn't work

156
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,795
So maybe they are using this
Send a signal to the accomplices outside

157
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:56,006
But we are monitoring it thoroughly so...

158
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,174
So I said

159
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,219
Stop them from playing that kind of trick!

160
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,471
We should just cut off the communication network!

161
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,974
If we do this, our communication network will also be disconnected.

162
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,767
And release the hostages

163
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,436
It's good for us anyway...

164
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,479
I will judge whether it is beneficial or not

165
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,981
Shut up those bastards first!

166
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,902
They got a head start

167
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:21,073
In this way
It is unlikely that a crushing victory will be achieved before the summit

168
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,161
Otherwise, just postpone the summit a little bit...

169
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,078
Member of Parliament

170
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,247
Are you kidding?

171
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,291
You might as well hold a press conference

172
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,294
Say publicly that what these bastards say is true

173
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,130
- I said...
-Doing business…

174
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,507
Timing is key

175
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,342
Do you think there is always a chance to become president?

176
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,430
Do you think there will be more development booms in North Korea?
Please!

177
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,768
Please think clearly

178
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,687
The summit will be held as scheduled in three days

179
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,776
As for how to stop them

180
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:58,944
You decide for yourself.

181
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,031
You two are here
Isn't it just to deal with this matter?

182
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,881
If the hostages don't obey and start to rebel

183
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,133
We just bribe them with money?

184
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:22,968
Even so

185
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,096
Anyway, the professor said so in his lecture

186
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,058
But why let the rest go?

187
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,477
There's no point staying anyway.

188
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:35,064
At least do this step
Only the hostages who stay will believe us, right?

189
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,440
This is also one of the reasons

190
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,442
But it is important to get Tokyo back.

191
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,568
-Hmm?
-What?

192
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,655
She risked her life when she went out.
Now let her do something more dangerous?

193
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,615
I have already made an agreement with Tokyo.

194
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,283
Tokyo Mission

195
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,078
The purpose at the beginning was to meet the professor.

196
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,579
-Ah?
-No matter what

197
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,331
There are snipers outside

198
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,458
That's why we need to use the hostages.

199
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,294
It's not easy to shoot if you're among the hostages.

200
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,004
That's right.

201
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,465
Can't we just follow the original plan?

202
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:05,511
Why take the risk when the escape hatch is immediately accessible?

203
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:08,389
Communications will not be interrupted as planned

204
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,933
Tokyo has informed the situation

205
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,726
The professor will give instructions

206
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,479
Know this

207
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,314
There is only one way

208
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:22,236
Kim Sang-man's support rate for the next presidential election

209
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:26,907
Expected to drop by more than 10%

210
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:30,828
Experts say the progress of the Banknote Printing Bureau incident
Not only will it affect the economic cooperation summit

211
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,997
It will also affect

212
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,165
Next presidential election

213
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,585
According to the analysis
This is because the robbers of the Bank of Printing last night

214
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,211
Streaming via the Internet

215
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,756
Announcement that some hostages will be released

216
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,469
The robbers strongly claimed
This incident is not just a robbery and hijacking incident.

217
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,597
To expose

218
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,891
Around the South Korea-North Korea Economic Cooperation Summit

219
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,226
Corruption of certain forces

220
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,645
To assert one's own rationality

221
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,523
Netizens react to the truth about corruption...

222
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:03,152
The professor analyzed it overnight.
The rapidly changing situation inside and outside the Banknote Printing Bureau

223
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,363
Then he concluded

224
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,949
A seismic shift will occur that will destroy his entire plan.

225
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,957
We change our plans

226
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,751
Why the sudden change?

227
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,253
The escape hatch will be open in a few days.

228
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,255
Isn't it enough to just wait until the day of the summit?

229
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,965
We are out of time

230
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,384
Didn't you hear the news on all the time?

231
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,470
Public opinion is also on our side

232
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,180
They can't possibly break in!

233
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,766
Even if I can ride on the back of a tiger

234
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,226
It can't take us where we want to go.

235
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:40,397
Let public opinion be on our side
It is a prerequisite for us to escape.

236
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,400
But things are changing faster than expected

237
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,279
So do you have a solution?

238
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,406
It's not easy, but there is a way

239
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:50,908
That's fine

240
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,243
I will convey

241
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,413
Please

242
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,249
If the revised plan cannot be communicated

243
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,710
Don't say you ran away.

244
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,380
It is possible to be annihilated

245
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,558
The robbers who took over the printing office

246
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:20,354
Announced that some hostages will be released at 3 pm today

247
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,023
The robber's sudden move

248
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,526
What is it for?
Make their revelations more convincing

249
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,028
Or is there another reason?

250
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,323
People are talking about this

251
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,366
Mom

252
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,201
Are you awake?

253
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,912
How did you get here?

254
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,038
The doctor said you are overworked.

255
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,749
Fortunately, it is not another disease

256
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,961
No matter how busy you are at work, you should take care of your health

257
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,005
How did it get to the point where I fainted on the street?

258
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,723
But who sent me to the hospital?

259
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,893
We were also notified by the hospital via phone

260
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,438
According to the nurse

261
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,773
Someone took you to the hospital.

262
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,192
But when we came, you were the only one there

263
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,489
Yuzhen, wake up!

264
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:14,950
Yuzhen!

265
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:24,126
Should we really give them 3 billion if they stay to help us?

266
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:25,753
That's right.

267
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,756
But I said

268
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,218
If it were me, I would go out regardless of the money.

269
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,596
What are you going to do if they come like this?

270
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,015
This won't happen.

271
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,602
You should take a good look at the money.

272
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,228
How despicable people can become

273
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,984
They said they would let us out, it seemed like it was real.

274
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,944
The video has been released

275
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,698
Is it true that I will be paid if I stay?

276
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,910
If Agent Park really gives money
You don't really want to stay?

277
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,789
I'm not kidding when I say 3 billion

278
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,874
This is enough to change your life

279
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,919
Besides, the money being printed
It was supposed to go into the pocket of the bad guy.

280
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:07,878
Are you crazy?

281
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,591
You forgot about the bad guys you mentioned
Is that the person who pays you?

282
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,763
Speaking of which, to be the director

283
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,723
3 billion is nothing now?

284
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,974
Of course

285
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,684
Only 3 billion?

286
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,649
Now it's time to choose

287
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,276
What did you decide to do?

288
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,117
I can understand why I hesitate.

289
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:46,250
Since you gave us the choice

290
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,545
As the director, can I give you some advice?

291
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,547
Tell us

292
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,760
No need to think about it!

293
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,637
This is all a lie!

294
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,638
These bastard robbers...

295
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:05,769
These robbers

296
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,314
Why should you give us such a large sum of money?

297
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,942
They just want to take advantage of us

298
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,362
Do you really think so?

299
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,655
Say it's money

300
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,449
Take advantage of us

301
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,119
What if you don’t keep your promise in the end?

302
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,623
And after we were released
Because he assisted the robbers

303
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:31,503
We will all be fired from the Bureau of Printing and Printing!

304
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:38,010
Uncle Director, whether you leave now or later
You are all going to be fired, right?

305
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,513
What?

306
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,474
Think about what you have done so far.

307
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,853
To survive
It's not the first time that I've put everyone in danger.

308
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,480
What on earth is this kid talking about?

309
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,398
How can I have that?

310
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,316
Ah!

311
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,485
Those who have left must have told this story.

312
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,326
Hey! Does that matter now?

313
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,952
I told you this is all a lie

314
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,454
Helsinki!

315
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,247
Bring me the money

316
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:23,931
Come and see

317
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,308
We didn't lie!

318
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,728
If anyone wants to take it now, just take it.

319
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:31,813
What is the use of this?

320
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,774
Even if you succeed

321
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,902
Anyway, the police will take it away later.

322
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,363
That's right.

323
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,949
So we need to find other safe ways to share the money.

324
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,451
We thought of a way

325
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,453
This method...

326
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,290
I can’t tell you now.

327
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:54,461
If the released hostages tell
All this money will be taken away

328
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,713
If you still can't trust us

329
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,132
Give it to you the way you want it

330
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,969
As Comrade Director said

331
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:07,224
You stay here
You may lose your job.

332
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,308
But this 3 billion

333
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,603
It's enough to start a new life.

334
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:20,028
Now let's start interviewing each of you individually.

335
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,656
Consider carefully

336
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,706
3 billion per person?

337
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,666
Ten people equals 30 billion

338
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,711
Because the cooperation of the hostages is very important

339
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,754
Especially when you are about to escape

340
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,006
Do you have to tempt with money?

341
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,009
What?
Isn't this usually how it's played out in movies?

342
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,594
Sharing the hardships together

343
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,681
In the end, we established a deep bond with each other

344
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,808
Stockholm syndrome?

345
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,019
Oh, I think I've seen it somewhere.

346
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,437
What are you meeting? Shit!

347
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,563
What is that?

348
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,481
Like mental illness or something?

349
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,734
Yeah, almost.

350
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,901
Hostages

351
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,864
Hostages express their emotions
Psychological phenomena projected onto the hijacker

352
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,574
Huh?

353
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,496
-How could you say such a thing?
- I heard it in prison

354
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,418
Although some hostages will have this kind of emotion

355
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,713
But as the hijacking time prolonged
The hostages are becoming increasingly difficult to control.

356
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,882
Emergencies may also occur

357
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,425
What kind of emergency?

358
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,303
Hostage rebellion, escape, etc.?

359
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:27,637
Are you kidding?

360
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,599
Are they Bruce Willis?

361
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,850
Die Hard

362
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:32,976
Oh, right.

363
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,271
It is possible

364
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,899
Well, if this happens

365
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,610
Then the remaining hostages will no longer be afraid of us

366
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,988
If things get worse, they go on strike
Then we definitely can't print money on time

367
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,240
This should never happen.

368
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,325
Back to the point

369
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,994
Will using money to tempt people work in this situation?

370
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,413
Use that 3 billion?

371
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:54,831
Think about it

372
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:59,294
If a hostage chooses 3 billion
And gave up freedom

373
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,922
From that moment on he would want us to succeed.

374
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,926
How much he wants to have 3 billion
How much we hope we will succeed

375
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,304
In this way, they are accomplices.

376
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:10,722
Correct

377
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,810
Don't be nervous, just speak up.

378
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:19,231
Are you really letting us go unconditionally?

379
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,524
Yes

380
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,443
Alas, teacher, in your life
Always been cheated?

381
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,570
If there is a condition

382
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,823
That's going out now.

383
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,158
You can't take the money with you

384
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,703
Have you thought it through?

385
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,915
I just heard that.
Are you still eager to go out?

386
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,585
I thought about that.

387
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,839
You said I could pay you in advance, right?

388
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,592
-Yes, so what?
-The 3 billion

389
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,512
How about we hide in the Bureau of Printing and Printing?

390
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,597
They never thought they would hide here, right?

391
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,723
There is a place only I know

392
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,851
I want to ask you something

393
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:58,478
What?

394
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,314
Are you going out?

395
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,612
-What is your name?
-Hmm?

396
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,698
Name?

397
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:15,745
Oh, but I can't say that.

398
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,669
What should you do if you leave Tokyo?
Aren’t you guys in an affair?

399
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,422
Oh, by the way, it's your unrequited love

400
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:26,840
Stop talking nonsense

401
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:28,967
So what are you going to do?

402
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,887
I finally have a choice this time?

403
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,346
Quite unexpected

404
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,891
How did you become the director with your brain?

405
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,269
You think you're smart, don't you?

406
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,063
You think the police won't know?

407
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,817
After the incident is over
This is a crime scene.

408
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,986
They wish
Find all the clues.

409
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,907
I will reply immediately

410
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,200
I don't have anything to think about

411
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,202
I will stay

412
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,119
Really?

413
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,914
I haven't spoken yet?

414
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,540
Well, if you can't believe us

415
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,251
We will let you go as you wish.

416
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,630
Wait a minute

417
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,965
What solution have you come up with?

418
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,842
Tell me the truth

419
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:12,636
Actually, I

420
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,015
There is no other choice but to stay here

421
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,433
Anyway

422
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:20,477
You've seen it too

423
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,271
People outside are crazy

424
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,315
Are you in this?
Now they don't care

425
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,071
My name is Zexiu

426
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,532
Wu Zexiu

427
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,245
Zexiu

428
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,000
I don't care whether you give me money or not

429
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,127
I will stay

430
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,963
I want to be with Zexiu

431
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,726
Even though it sounds ridiculous

432
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,229
I am now more than ever before

433
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,147
We are all taking our business more seriously

434
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:11,361
You are the best boss I have ever met.

435
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:17,200
I'll tell the director that you are alone.

436
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,953
After the commotion subsides

437
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:22,956
A courier box will be delivered to your home.

438
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,251
Send quietly so no one will know

439
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,310
Come

440
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,936
You choose now

441
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,313
Choose 3 billion?

442
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:47,897
Or choose freedom?

443
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,700
Choose the left side of the Freedom Station

444
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,452
Choose money and stand on the right

445
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,647
Director, you should stand over here.

446
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,283
Annie, what are you doing?

447
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,621
What did you do?

448
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,206
Didn’t I say that you can go out whenever you want?

449
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,541
It's okay, I want to stay

450
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,377
Ah?

451
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:54,881
Well, then, comrades who choose freedom

452
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,760
I will leave here later at the agreed time.

453
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,471
Those who decide to stay will go to the printing factory immediately

454
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,016
Let's print money happily

455
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,937
Let's talk about how to get 3 billion and how to spend it

456
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:10,897
Follow me

457
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,609
Sorry

458
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,820
Wrong time

459
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,072
Yoon Mi-sun

460
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:22,867
She decided to stay

461
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,537
Okay, then stand over here.

462
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,176
Ah, what happened?

463
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:41,761
Ah wait a minute

464
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,764
Wait, what happened?

465
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,268
What's wrong with you? What's wrong with her?

466
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,269
What's going on?

467
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,315
Look into my eyes and tell me

468
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:01,156
Dad

469
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,700
What about me?

470
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,035
I love that girl

471
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,370
What?

472
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,498
Dad, if we get out of here

473
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,334
There will be a lot of money

474
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:17,213
Meishan and I will honor you well then.
We will live happily

475
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,216
We will give you grandchildren...

476
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,012
Are you crazy?

477
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,972
She is a hostage!

478
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,098
So what?

479
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,101
What's wrong with us loving each other?

480
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:31,561
Love?

481
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:35,231
Haven't you heard of Stockholm syndrome?

482
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,484
Oh, really.

483
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,069
Don't pretend to know something you don't

484
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,071
OK

485
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,657
You know what? Really?

486
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:52,832
Did she ever say that she didn't care about money?

487
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,796
Money or no money doesn't matter

488
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,757
As long as your love, right?

489
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,096
Your mother said so too

490
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,060
What do you mean?

491
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,524
I

492
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,027
I never told you
How did I meet your mother?

493
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:23,863
When my dad robbed a bank

494
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,242
Your mother was a counter clerk at the time

495
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:29,702
Ah?

496
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,248
Just like that girl

497
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:38,086
Your mother also said she doesn't need anything

498
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,338
Just want to hold my hand and run away

499
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,632
We thought it was true love.

500
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,845
But after giving birth to you

501
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,265
She immediately told me to give her freedom

502
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,356
You must

503
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,360
Don't be like me!

504
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,781
Although I want to fight back

505
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,783
Denver's subconscious understands

506
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,578
Talking about your father's past

507
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,705
It's just like denying your present

508
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,500
Oh, damn!

509
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,214
Enter from here

510
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,427
Will go here and start printing

511
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:30,889
Come!

512
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,058
To finish the recent backlog of work
You have to do it seriously!

513
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,019
Hey you guys!

514
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,771
Don't just stand there, get to work!

515
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,857
Want to get money for free?

516
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:42,609
Can't you see I'm working hard?

517
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:43,776
Be serious, everyone!

518
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,822
Please help!

519
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,366
Do some work!

520
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,660
You get paid only if you work!

521
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,165
Isn’t it beautiful?

522
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,877
Unconsciously, I will be empty-headed and look at it

523
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,090
Why did you stay?

524
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,801
You can't be doing this for money

525
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,848
Yeah, I don't know myself

526
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,350
What?

527
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,437
I just want to see what you guys will do.

528
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,983
I heard you collapsed from overwork.
Discharged from hospital so soon?

529
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,860
Do you need to rest for a few more days?

530
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,614
Let me first talk about the robbers' announcement of releasing the hostages.

531
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,908
They made such a big noise...

532
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,661
I'll take care of things here.
Take this opportunity to have a good rest.

533
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,037
I have already asked for leave for you.

534
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,581
Director

535
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,421
OK

536
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,263
Hello, where are you going?

537
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,190
You don't run a café anymore?

538
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,113
Yuzhen

539
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,370
It was you who took me to the hospital, right?

540
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,664
It's great to be discharged so quickly.

541
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,840
Now I'm not going to get involved in the printing press anymore.

542
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,177
Then I started to miss you

543
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,304
I started to regret it so I came here

544
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,641
I was confused by the case at that time.

545
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,729
Insider information continues to leak
Captain Che Wuhe suddenly disappeared again

546
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,190
I'm not here to make excuses

547
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,027
Just…

548
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,203
I'm sorry for hurting your feelings.

549
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,419
But I'm sincere to you

550
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,926
Even if we can't meet in the future
I hope you know this

551
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,270
Then I'm leaving

552
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,652
Yuzhen

553
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,219
No matter how perfect the plan is

554
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,222
Nothing will go 100% according to plan

555
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,431
The professor is very clear about this

556
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,394
Because the execution plan

557
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,896
I am an incomplete person who is controlled by emotions.

558
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,319
What the professor didn't have time to understand was

559
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,698
He also belongs to this category

560
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:05,246
After my leave is approved
How about we take a train trip?

561
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,040
When we first met

562
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,084
Didn't you say you wanted to go together?

563
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,296
The city you were going to visit together...

564
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,131
Where did it come from?

565
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:17,383
The name is…

566
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:20,928
Kherson

567
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:38,279
It is the Black Sea and the Dnieper River
Port city at the intersection

568
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,033
Why do you want to go here?

569
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:46,329
My father had heard from others that he had been here before.

570
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,663
From now on

571
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,208
A family lives in a place like this

572
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,462
It became his lifelong wish

573
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,089
Your father?

574
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,346
This is the first time I heard about your family.

575
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,604
I don't like to talk about my family.

576
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:16,150
In his last years
He had forgotten all about Kherson.

577
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,987
He just suffered and died.

578
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:24,033
Does he have dementia?

579
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:25,868
Yes

580
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,622
My father also had dementia at the time.

581
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:41,384
I'm leaving

582
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,970
There are many things to deal with when a store closes

583
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,640
Will we go to Kherson in the future?

584
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,435
When Kherson was first mentioned

585
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,020
The professor never took it seriously.

586
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,815
But now the professor sincerely hopes

587
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,984
I can go there with her hand in hand

588
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,029
Although in a few days
He would have to disappear without a trace.

589
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:04,407
Good

590
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,868
Let's go together after I finish my business in the store.

591
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:26,721
Stockholm or Stockholm?

592
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,014
What do I care about him?

593
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,445
Why are you standing here?

594
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:47,616
Nothing

595
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:50,661
Your father

596
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,998
You want me to dump you, right?

597
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,085
How do you know?

598
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:59,587
It's all written on your face

599
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:11,807
In your opinion
Does she suffer from Stockholm syndrome too?

600
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,936
What does this have to do with anything?

601
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,480
No matter what she thinks

602
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,649
Isn't it enough as long as you have the confidence that you won't regret it?

603
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:28,574
Berlin

604
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,828
You are not from the asylum
Did you bring that woman out?

605
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,414
The Woman Called Seoul

606
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:38,292
And that woman followed you out.

607
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,586
Isn't this true love?

608
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:42,671
Right?

609
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:48,844
I actually regret it.

610
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:52,807
Hmm?

611
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:00,898
Damn…

612
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,042
How did you get here?

613
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,296
What are you talking about?

614
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,007
You are in Pyongyang
Aren’t they children of high-ranking officials who have gone to college?

615
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:31,345
Even if you speak Seoul dialect, you can still hear the accent

616
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,556
Is that so?

617
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:35,808
Maybe

618
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:38,436
The past is not easy to erase

619
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,230
How did you end up in league with those people?

620
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,314
It’s a long story

621
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:44,775
As long as you want

622
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,904
You can live a comfortable life, right?

623
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:57,955
If you regret it, it's not too late now

624
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,833
-As long as you help me...
- Clear my criminal record

625
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,461
Give me a brand new future or something like that?

626
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:06,755
Sorry

627
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,426
I've started a new life

628
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,263
And I am quite satisfied with it now

629
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,519
This confiscated

630
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:23,272
Try to unlock the handcuffs yourself

631
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,982
Just treat it as a punishment for joking around

632
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,122
Where have you been and why are you back now?

633
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,248
I have some things to sort out

634
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,710
If you are ready, shall we go?

635
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:49,673
Wait a minute

636
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:52,927
Hold

637
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,429
This is medicine

638
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,764
Turn it over to Berlin

639
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:02,186
If Berlin is upset...

640
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:03,437
Don't worry

641
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,439
I will drag him out.

642
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:09,818
Let's go

643
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,245
The paper house is ours!

644
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,580
Tell the truth about the secret room summit!

645
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,999
Severely punish those responsible!

646
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:27,294
Tell the truth about the secret room summit!

647
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,173
Against negotiations!

648
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,647
-What's going on?
-What happened!

649
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,238
Why is it so noisy outside?

650
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:58,284
As you instructed, we are within a radius of 100 meters.

651
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,495
But the hostages' families and reporters were mixed together
Difficult to control

652
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:05,291
The robbers sent out a release notice
What is the reason for going to great lengths to attract attention?

653
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,334
They are the propaganda effect

654
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,837
Because of the incident they had last time

655
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,589
Do you know how complicated things are now?

656
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,842
I don't know what's the trick behind their release of the hostages.

657
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,303
I can't be fooled by them anymore.

658
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,472
There can't be anything else at this scene.

659
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,600
It's out of our control, you know?

660
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:25,769
Yes

661
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,439
Deploy troops within 300 meters

662
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,066
Don't let an ant take advantage of you

663
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:34,820
So what should the journalists do?

664
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:39,908
The Internet, YouTube, etc.
Drive out all the messy ones

665
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:41,994
Oh yeah

666
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:44,538
Leave only the media on this list

667
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,416
It has been agreed that no live broadcast will be conducted

668
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:49,209
The content of the report will be broadcast as agreed in advance

669
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,046
Yes

670
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,893
My father also suffered from dementia.

671
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:16,779
Also suffering from?

672
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,212
(Police Commando)

673
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:39,968
The military strength has increased

674
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,970
Could it be that they know our plan?

675
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:42,888
No

676
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:46,767
They should be afraid of public opinion

677
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,894
Makes things more difficult

678
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,032
The atmosphere is not right

679
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:06,453
It is easier to sneak in when there are a lot of people and a lot of noise
But now they are all driven away

680
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,790
This plan should be discontinued immediately

681
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:12,918
Even if the troops doubled, they couldn't get close.

682
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,379
Let Tokyo come back now?

683
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,297
This is tantamount to suicide

684
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:20,092
Let's cancel the hostage release

685
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:21,677
Impossible!

686
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:24,805
What? Are you going to use that to change the direction of public opinion?

687
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:27,099
It is said that this plan is related to our life and death

688
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:29,476
Did the professor say that?

689
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,894
Is it for the purpose of revolution or something?

690
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,855
Isn't this just your own crazy plan?

691
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:35,399
Berlin!

692
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:38,444
Don't talk nonsense and make trouble

693
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:41,822
What can a Korean young master who has no worries about food and clothing understand?

694
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,825
You thought we canceled the hostage release?
Will Tokyo give up?

695
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,161
She would risk her life to get in
Do you know why?

696
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:48,829
She is for us

697
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:50,539
Cancel?

698
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:54,168
That would be like asking for Tokyo's life, do you understand?

699
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:59,214
Hey, what if something happens in Tokyo?

700
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,843
I will kill you, do you know that?

701
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,141
Well, now I have something to look forward to.

702
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,901
Wait a minute, that hurts.

703
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:21,862
You…

704
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,282
Go away!

705
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:28,827
What?

706
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:36,919
Get out!

707
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,673
What do you mean suddenly?

708
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:44,676
Go out and live a normal life.

709
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:46,845
Don't regret it later

710
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:48,639
I won't regret it

711
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,600
I don't care if I will regret it later.

712
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:53,936
I have decided

713
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,396
I'm going to follow you

714
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,401
Hey, don't be confused.

715
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:03,487
I am a robber

716
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:07,157
My dad was a bank robber and was in jail several times.

717
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:09,409
I didn't go to school since I was a child.

718
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:12,162
I'm just a gangster who only knows how to fight!

719
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:16,083
You stay here because of me.

720
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,418
Is this reasonable?

721
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,090
What's wrong with you?

722
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,301
Fuck it!

723
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:30,347
I'm almost there
Can't you just look at the signal and get out of the way?

724
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,766
Why are you talking so much nonsense?

725
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,231
Zexiu

726
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,317
I told you to get out of here.

727
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:45,320
I've lost interest in you

728
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,240
You follow that old guy

729
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,367
It's rare to have such a hot time with me
Just play it and forget it, right?

730
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,828
-What?
- You wouldn't

731
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:56,248
Are you going to pretend to do this to me just for the 3 billion?

732
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,167
I will send you the 3 billion so...

733
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,388
I don't care about the money

734
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,390
You bastard

735
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,438
What are you doing in there? It's time.

736
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:23,692
Hostages to be released gather in the hall!

737
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:38,373
Fuck

738
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,045
Tokyo

739
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:45,797
-Are you listening to me?
-Yeah

740
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,007
I'm ready

741
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:48,717
To be honest, this plan

742
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,303
It will be difficult

743
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:53,639
Once failed

744
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:56,475
Either death or extinction

745
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,603
I understand

746
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,688
I seem to have given you too much burden

747
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:20,624
Professor

748
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,794
I have a question

749
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:24,878
I'm listening

750
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,422
Is your promise still valid?

751
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:29,383
Of course

752
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:30,801
That's fine

753
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:34,388
Rather than worrying, I choose to act

754
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:08,839
It's okay

755
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:29,484
As promised, we unconditionally

756
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:33,030
More than half of the 15 hostages
Send back to reunite with family

757
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:35,741
We are grateful for this period
Hostage comrades, please be patient

758
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:39,327
And their hard work

759
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:42,831
This is a few hundred meters away from the Banknote Printing Bureau.

760
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:45,834
As you can see
Except for some specific media

761
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,378
Others can't even get close to the interview

762
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:51,631
For this unilateral measure
The police said it was out of consideration for maintaining stability

763
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,050
To the people of the north and south…

764
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:57,929
Why is there no signal?

765
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,097
What's going on?

766
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:01,099
-What happened?
-The signal is broken

767
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:02,225
No signal?

768
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,021
Follow me from here to interview over there

769
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:16,531
The nearby base stations and communication networks have been shut down.

770
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:19,451
No microphone
It seems they don't want to continue talking.

771
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:21,912
Look at their confused faces

772
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,506
It's time for everyone to go home

773
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,517
Moving forward

774
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,197
Thank you for your hard work.

775
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,574
Take it slow and be careful

776
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,144
Come out!

777
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:36,862
The time is now!

778
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,746
What is that? Catch it!

779
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:18,403
What is that?

780
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:20,155
- Looks like an accomplice
- That...

781
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:22,449
Are you just going to watch and do nothing? Shoot now!

782
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,658
But now there are hostages...

783
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:33,460
What does a sniper do? Shoot!

784
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,507
-There's a sniper!
- Take cover!

785
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:47,641
Are you crazy? Damn!

786
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:52,145
Close the door!

787
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,439
Come in, come in, Rio!

788
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,275
Come in!

789
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:12,666
Danger!

790
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:18,922
Close the door!

791
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:25,929
Great!

792
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:43,780
Oh my god

793
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:44,906
Oh, I've suffered.

794
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,491
Suffered

795
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:47,701
Thank you for your hard work

796
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,161
Oh, I've suffered.

797
00:54:58,545 --> 00:54:59,504
Not bad

798
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,383
Hey, are you okay?

799
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,844
You almost died just now, did you know that?

800
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,178
But I'm not dead

801
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,059
Yes

802
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,894
Baby, I miss you

803
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:19,399
Done it!

804
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:20,942
Berlin

805
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:25,238
What do you do with this kind of thing?

806
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:26,906
There is a woman who insists that I give it to you

807
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:32,454
Why…

808
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:54,934
You apologize to your father.

809
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,353
Hmm?

810
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:57,937
Why apologize?

811
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,522
After all, he is your father.

812
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:00,440
OK

813
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:20,502
In a few days he'll be fine.

814
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,212
Then he'll say sorry to me

815
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:26,383
Then we chatted and everything was fine.

816
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,510
You don't have to worry

817
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:31,679
Me and my dad

818
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:33,390
We are like this

819
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:51,032
What's wrong with you?

820
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:00,792
What's wrong with you?

821
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,422
Mom, the coffee shop owner

822
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:08,466
Yeah, the one you're dating

823
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:11,094
-Yeah
-What happened to him?

824
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:15,056
Have you seen that person?

825
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:17,517
This

826
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:21,020
He sent you back about a month ago.

827
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,106
After we met, there was no...

828
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:24,315
Please think about it carefully

829
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,580
I'll give you

830
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:42,208
Called

831
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,711
What? What do you mean?

832
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:45,920
I see

833
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:48,465
That person

834
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,684
So I called you

835
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:00,727
See? Here?

836
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,271
He came to see me?

837
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,482
I don't know

838
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,275
-What's wrong, mom?
- I don't know

839
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:08,943
Mom, when was that?

840
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:11,154
When exactly is that?

841
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:13,406
-What exactly happened?
-No, I can't remember.

842
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:15,408
Got it

843
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:19,370
-I don't remember
- I know. Wait a minute.

844
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:35,553
(Cha Moo Hyuk's mother)

845
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:58,284
It's hard to say this at this juncture.

846
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:02,247
But when are you
Meet the man named Park Sun-ho?

847
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,088
The robber chose me?

848
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:13,758
Why did you eavesdrop on my call?

849
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:18,972
Yuzhen that...

850
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,598
Just a moment!

851
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,684
Sunho, what are you doing?

852
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:25,687
Your mother called you.

853
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:28,273
What did you have for breakfast?

854
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:32,527
Sandwiches

855
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:41,744
It is here

856
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:47,875
Seems to have found it

857
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:51,170
Good

858
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:53,816
These bastards...

859
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:24,097
Thank you for your hard work.

860
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:26,683
There are only a few days left so...

861
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:27,975
Wait a minute

862
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:49,622
-This bastard
- Damn

863
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:19,485
Over there!

864
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:28,077
Captain Che Wuhe came to see me that day.
This should be it

865
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:40,465
"Name"

866
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,175

869
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:50,558

877

(Congratulations on the third inter-Korean economic
Cooperation Summit was successfully held)

878
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:39,750
Che Wuhe!

879
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:52,638
Hello!

880
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:55,725
Sorry

881
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:56,642
What about Moscow?

882
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,437
Hmm? I don't know either.

883
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,314
I'll tell him later

884
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:02,857
You tell me

885
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:06,861
The summit will be held in advance

886
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:08,070
In advance?

887
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:10,448
How many days in advance?

888
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:12,742
If the professor guessed correctly

889
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:16,370
That's tomorrow

890
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:19,373
We're leaving here
