1
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,638
(Vladivostok, Russia)

2
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,018
A Korean guy came to the store

3
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,561
Say you want to see the boss

4
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,871
Is it you who asked to see me?

5
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:40,623
Are you a compatriot?

6
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,002
I am Song Xuanhao

7
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:45,712
Fellow countrymen...

8
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,049
Where did you hear about our organization?

9
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:52,177
From the Internet

10
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,477
I admire you

11
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:03,855
Good

12
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,107
Why do you want to see me?

13
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,410
I want to buy weapons

14
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:21,581
But I have to meet your boss in person.

15
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,170
I said I am the boss

16
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,088
Not You

17
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,924
It's Song Joong-ho from Pyeongan Province

18
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,803
I want to talk to him in person.

19
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:15,885
Goddammit

20
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,347
(Vladimir Mayakovsky)

21
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,191
Why are you looking for him?

22
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,778
Are you a police officer?

23
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,990
The reason is that I want to confront him face to face...

24
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,805
I ask you one last time

25
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,766
How do you know Song Zhonghao?

26
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,854
He and I are brothers

27
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,361
Neurosis

28
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,715
Hello!

29
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,551
Say it again

30
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:40,887
Hey! What did you just say?

31
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:49,896
Zhong Hao

32
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,607
You are Song Zhonghao, right?

33
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,526
Long time no see, Zhonghao

34
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,488
You've grown up

35
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:02,992
You've grown so big

36
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:10,917
Let's go

37
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,696
-Mom
-Hurry up and follow your father and brother

38
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,489
They passed by first

39
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,991
Let's go there quickly too

40
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,617
Go ahead

41
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,375
Hide!

42
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,461
Border fugitives are crossing the river!

43
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,838
Over there!

44
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,301
Catch them now!

45
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,477
Jong-ho! Mom!

46
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:12,979
No!

47
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,482
Zhonghao!

48
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,780
Mom…

49
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,199
Mom…

50
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,160
Mom!

51
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,465
Why did you come to me only now?

52
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,471
You may be looking forward to the touching reunion of separated brothers

53
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,435
But I don't even remember my dad's face

54
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,442
I don't blame you

55
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,444
This is the only way to survive

56
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,534
25 years in hell

57
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,370
I have learned this very thoroughly.

58
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:16,667
Dad…

59
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,005
Died

60
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,717
Because of money

61
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,388
Was he scammed?

62
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,224
To get you out of the labor camp.

63
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,267
I'll take you to South Korea.

64
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:35,645
Really…

65
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,148
It requires a lot of money

66
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:42,902
So Dad...

67
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,572
Just rob a bank

68
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,158
He was shot dead by the police

69
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,694
What is this?

70
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,904
It's a plan that Dad didn't complete.

71
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,740
I want to finish it with you

72
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,528
Paper House: Korea

73
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,905
If Comrade Captain Quan Rongzhu did not come forward

74
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,866
I'm going to tear this girl into pieces

75
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,037
Bring Comrade Captain Quan Yongzhu here

76
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,040
Otherwise this girl will be dead, do you hear me?

77
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,710
Call Comrade Battalion Commander Quan Yongzhu over!

78
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,420
8:00 p.m.!

79
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,256
Ask him to come here

80
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,841
20:00

81
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,760
-Snap
-They are outside

82

(Situation at the Mint hostage situation)

83
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,724
Didn't you say it would be resolved soon?

84
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,299
(Liberate the Korean Peninsula through revolution)

85
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,341
Concentrate your search in this area

86
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:53,676
Yes, I understand.

87
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,055

91
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:21,996
Please also look here

93
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,795
As the team leader said, this group of people...

94
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,130
The real purpose is not money

95
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,220
A bit strange

96
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,816
There's a bomb!

97
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,613
We have it here too!

98
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:56,739
Here too!

99
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,658
-Evacuate quickly
-Yes

100
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,411
Leader, let's go!

101
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,080
Let's go

102
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:44,620
Damn

103
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,747
I almost died before I got married.

104
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:53,921
Yes

105
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,508
Song Zhonghao?

106
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,719
Berlin did something stupid

107
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,306
It must be that damn disease that made him lose his mind

108
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,058
-What to do?
- Calm down

109
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,310
Berlin is normal

110
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,311
What?

111
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,271
I think I know

112
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,356
Berlin's reasons for doing so

113
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,484
We will talk about the details later

114
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,610
I'm going back now

115
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,237
You should make some preparations first

116
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:19,864
Search Party!

117
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,453
What's wrong? What happened?

118
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,962
That would make the whole thing fit, right?

119
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,423
These guys

120
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,508
I've been thinking about this since the beginning

121
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,635
Hostage situation at the Mint

122
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,429
Attracting the world's attention

123
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,932
The ultimate goal is to disrupt the ECO talks

124
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,977
Will they launch a terrorist attack?

125
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,521
No way?

126
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,649
I think it's weird

127
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,361
If you really want to cover up the clues
That place should have been blown up long ago.

128
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,905
It should be before we arrive

129
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,240
Blow them up before we figure out what they're up to.

130
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,242
But the bomb...

131
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,287
is to wait until we arrive and confirm the scene

132
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,622
Then it exploded

133
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:13,042
To be honest, it would leave such an important clue.
It’s a bit…

134
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,252
Do you think that was left there for us to see?

135
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,589
Song Zhonghao is also

136
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,592
He wouldn't kick out his accomplice for no reason.

137
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,844
Request to meet Jeon Yong-soo

138
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,225
They suddenly start doing something that attracts attention.

139
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,102
It happened that I lost contact with the professor.

140
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:33,521
Quite the opposite, right?

141
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,024
The professors were worried because they lost contact with them.

142
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,443
You didn't see it, so you don't know.

143
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,779
Song Zhonghao is a madman

144
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,246
Confirm it and you will know

145
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,134
Real name: Li Hongduan

146
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,763
You are already wanted

147
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,431
This record is really gorgeous

148
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,559
Help us

149
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,811
So I can help you get a substantial sentence reduction.

150
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,606
If we can do it before the 20 points proposed by Song Zhonghao

151
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,316
End this hostage situation

152
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,235
You are not an attempted robbery

153
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,238
But will be the hero who rescued dozens of hostages

154
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:26,907
In this way

155
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,326
The prison sentence should be reduced by more than half.

156
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,955
How much will be left if life imprisonment is halved?

157
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,875
50 years?

158
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,209
40 years?

159
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,718
We found your hiding place

160
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,930
There are many of you staying there
No evidence of destruction

161
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,640
“Take back the power of capitalist dogs

162
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,851
"Stolen Unity"

163
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,187
"Liberate the Korean Peninsula through revolution"

164
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:58,731
After seeing these

165
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,108
I knew you guys were robbing the mint.

166
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,360
The purpose is not money

167
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,363
It must have a political purpose.

168
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,451
Damn, what the hell are you talking about?

169
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,496
I'm just tired of hearing this revolution bullshit

170
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,706
That's why I came down to the south

171
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,000
I found that as long as you have money, you can get things done here.

172
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,838
Because they said they could make me rich.
That's why I joined

173
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,383
So you do it for the money

174
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,719
But not the others?

175
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,888
I was also used by those bastards

176
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,431
Did you have a conflict?

177
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,475
So that's why you were kicked out?

178
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,397
That bastard in Berlin said I was a spy

179
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,026
I don't know if he's so sick that his brain is broken.

180
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,195
Huntington's disease?

181
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,112
Yes, that's the one

182
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,865
It seems that the medicine is gone.

183
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,326
He suddenly had a seizure and started to lose his temper

184
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,079
And pointed guns at everybody.

185
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,748
He said I was a reactionary

186
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,249
What a madman

187
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,296
How?

188
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,298
Is there anything on my face?

189
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,220
Bring it in

190
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,187
What are you doing?

191
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,563
What is this for?

192
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,567
Procedurally, we need to confirm
How credible is your confession?

193
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,321
No big deal

194
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,869
Let's do it again?

195
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,710
Why did you say you were kicked out?

196
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,797
You said they framed you as a spy, right?

197
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,426
Yes

198
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,011
And Berlin is crazy, isn't it?

199
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,888
That's why I threw you out

200
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,016
Is that right?

201
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,060
Are you deaf?

202
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,271
Why should I say it a second time?

203
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,648
Let's talk about the professor.

204
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,943
Who is the professor?

205
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,324
Have you met him?

206
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,788
Do you think I would know?

207
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,291
Have you seen it?

208
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,757
Want to know about the professor?

209
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,179
Then I tell you

210
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,724
His characteristics are...

211
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,727
Two eyes

212
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,521
There are two ears

213
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,317
Most importantly

214
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,277
He only has one mouth

215
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:52,613
So

216
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,949
You don't plan to cooperate, right?

217
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,995
You treat me this way
What cooperation are you still talking to me about?

218
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,831
Let me go through the normal process

219
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,458
Offer more attractive conditions

220
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,835
Then I will give you all the information you want.

221
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,005
“More attractive terms”?

222
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,216
Good

223
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:16,386
But

224
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,264
Were you really kicked out?

225
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,563
Hello!

226
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,940
I am a victim too!

227
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,775
How many times do I have to say it?

228
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,151
I am a victim too!

229
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,569
Let me go!

230
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,695
Let me go!

231
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,697
Hey, listen to me carefully

232
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,784
Let me meet you next time
I will definitely kill you

233
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,120
Let go! Let me go!

234
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,747
You bastards! What the hell are you looking at?

235
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,377
We can't transfer her now.

236
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,671
She must be hiding something, we need to continue questioning her...

237
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,297
She's so excited, how are you going to ask?

238
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,634
What if she really hurt you just now?

239
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,469
- But...
-There are too many reporters here

240
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,556
Let's take her into custody and wait for her to calm down.

241
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,516
Come back and interrogate us then, okay?

242
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,522
What are you doing? Let me go!

243
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,566
Let go!

244
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,692
Damn it!

245
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,987
What are you looking at? Shit!

246
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,407
Fuck you! You bastards!

247
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,324
Let go!

248
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,544
The traitor is...

249
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:31,962
Tokyo

250
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:41,305
Tokyo!

251
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,973
-Tokyo!
-No!

252
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,401
I am the traitor

253
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,614
I did it

254
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:05,829
Is this true?

255
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:11,919
Why are you doing this?

256
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,337
Say it!

257
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,506
It's not someone else

258
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,759
How could it be you who betrayed us?

259
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,053
Sorry

260
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,014
I have a son

261
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,309
When he was born

262
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,979
I was going to jail, so I had to send him to an orphanage.

263
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,314
Son?

264
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,400
So what I said before...

265
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,986
The child is in Jin Xiangwan's hands. I was forced to do that.

266
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,490
Sorry

267
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:44,910
Is this okay?

268
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:47,621
You see

269
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,581
I said it was useful

270
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,791
What is going on?

271
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,335
What's going on? Are you two in cahoots?

272
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,005
Okay

273
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,891
That's enough.

274
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,143
Even if it's not Nairobi

275
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,812
Encountering this situation

276
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,648
Everyone here will definitely do the same thing

277
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:15,565
Isn’t it?

278
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,697
Don't worry about the kids

279
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,283
I will definitely find a way

280
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,162
I was planning to go out

281
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,082
I'm going to send Tokyo outside the Mint

282
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,750
Pretend it's an internal conflict

283
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,085
As soon as you go out

284
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,170
You will be caught by the police immediately

285
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,171
The professor will rescue her.

286
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,381
How is this possible?

287
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,591
Even if you are a professor, it’s not that easy, right?

288
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,261
Now cut off contact with the professor
Our top priority

289
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,637
Just contact the professor

290
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,889
Tokyo Go out in person

291
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,975
Tell him the situation and solve it

292
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,728
We still have to solve the problem of Nairobi's son

293
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,897
Hey, this is wrong. This is really dangerous.

294
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,859
You are basically asking Tokyo to jump into a fire pit!

295
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,861
I said I was going to jump.

296
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,322
Someone has to do this anyway.

297
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,698
Tokyo

298
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,122
After the suspect was transferred to the detention center

299
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,999
Will be under strict vigilance and security

300
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:17,294
Accept investigation to help solve this case

301
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,755
In addition, another suspect

302
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,089
He has already been wanted

303
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,008
Notorious criminal Song Zhonghao

304
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,595
Request for an interview with Team Leader Jeon Yong-soo

305
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,930
Experts believe that the head of the group may be involved in this case.

306
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,557
There is some kind of correlation

307
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,641
This is a sedative.

308
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,685
Although it doesn't help

309
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:43,278
Hey, do this kind of thing
Couldn't you tell me first?

310
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,030
You'd never believe me, would you?

311
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,157
I knew it from the beginning

312
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:48,575
You are not the traitor

313
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,665
But to fool others, it must be realistic enough

314
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,794
When I push Tokyo out
The way you yell

315
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,338
Are you sincere?

316
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:04,716
Damn

317
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,469
Tokyo…

318
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,471
Will everything be alright?

319
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,514
Believe in her

320
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,474
She is stronger than anyone else

321
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:19,981
Hey, but...

322
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,943
What if the professor doesn't see our plan?

323
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,821
I'm honest

324
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,365
This method is basically gambling.

325
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:29,366
That's right.

326
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,454
I…

327
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,957
I'm betting my life on this game.

328
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,543
And I believe the professor will...

329
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,711
Understand our plan

330
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,610
How do I use this?

331
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,738
No one else is helping

332
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,284
We have to print money with you

333
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:17,956
Good

334
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,085
We will print in three stages

335
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,720
I will be responsible for operating the machine and acceptance

336
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,436
You just need to help transfer the banknotes...

337
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:42,522
Oslo he…

338
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,485
I won't blame you.

339
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,408
I won't either.

340
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:27,943
How long will it take?

341
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,028
Ten minutes to go

342
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,377
-What happened?
- I'm sorry

343
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,046
A car suddenly rushed out, we went to check

344
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,215
They are fully armed!

345
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,886
Headquarters, this is the 137 transfer vehicle

346
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,471
Currently under attack

347
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,973
Requesting support! Headquarters!

348
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,891
This is the headquarters. I can't hear you clearly.

349
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:00,976
Say it again

350
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,185
-Headquarters!
-What is this for?

351
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,354
-There's a bomb!
-Bomb?

352
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,107
They planted a bomb!

353
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,236
What is going on? Tell me!

354
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,115
-Everyone will die!
- Calm down!

355
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,033
We have to get off the bus immediately!

356
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:26,793
Get Down!

357
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,059
Yes

358
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,354
What did you say?

359
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,231
Yes, I understand.

360
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,817
The transfer vehicle has not arrived yet

361
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,277
-Hasn't it arrived yet?
-What about the radio?

362
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:53,945
Suddenly broke

363
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,197
What is happening?

364
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,240
They…

365
00:26:58,575 --> 00:26:59,659
Attacked the transfer vehicle

366
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,995
What? Who are you talking about?

367
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,415
It is impossible for the professor outside to rescue the prisoner alone.

368
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,919
This means that they have at least
Can suppress the force of transfer and escort vehicles

369
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,087
There must be an accomplice

370
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,839
Do they have more accomplices out there?

371
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,439
Put down the gun!

372
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,691
Put down the gun if you want to die! Quick!

373
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,867
OK, I understand.

374
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,993
Don't Shoot

375
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,372
Put the gun down or I'll shoot you.

376
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,624
- Shoot!
-I'm really going to shoot!

377
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:48,833
I told you to shoot

378
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:50,877
Shoot!

379
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,879
Then you can only shoot.

380
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:55,215
Because we won't listen to you

381
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,759
Then you will hang up

382
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,387
What are you still hesitating about?

383
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,138
Have you fallen in love with her?

384
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,349
Want to go on the road together?

385
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,610
Get out of the car!

386
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,115
Get Down!

387
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,075
Have you heard what the professor said about us?

388
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,035
He did say

389
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:25,995
But I didn't expect so many people

390
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,210
Why didn't you go into the Mint?

391
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,296
Because our boss is Berlin

392
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,674
Nice to meet you

393
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:38,591
I am Seoul

394
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,928
Please, what is going on?

395
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,054
That is to say, this group of people

396
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,390
It is an anti-government terrorist organization.

397
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,934
What the hell? Why are you here?

398
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:48,852
Good

399
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:52,355
From now on, this case
Took over by the Republic of Korea's counter-terrorism forces

400
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,900
In addition to the Director, who is in charge of the area
Everyone else please leave

401
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,527
Who decides?

402
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,947
Didn’t we find evidence in the hiding place?

403
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,366
Now that we have confirmed that these robbers

404
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,868
A terrorist organization with political agenda

405
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,370
We can't waste any more time

406
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,914
The fate of the Korean Peninsula depends on the ECC talks

407
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,583
Do you think the top management will just sit back and do nothing?

408
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,255
Yes, Director

409
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,133
So what do you want?

410
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,012
Could it be…

411
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:29,058
I have some connection with that guy named Song Zhonghao

412
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,352
During hostage negotiations

413
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,689
You know what you absolutely shouldn't do?

414
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,733
That was at the request of the criminals.

415
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:37,984
Bring the person he wants to see to the scene

416
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,029
Because you can't predict what the criminals will do.

417
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,530
This is our purpose

418
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,074
Everyone listen up

419
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,077
When leader Jeon Yong-soo attracted his attention

420
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,580
The counter-terrorist forces will quickly attack them from behind

421
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:51,498
Are you crazy?

422
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,625
This will put the hostages in danger!

423
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,335
Please…

424
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,921
Pull her out

425
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,053
You are here

426
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,766
This is the instruction above, what can I do?

427
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,686
You should go home and rest first.

428
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,230
Anyway,

429
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,731
This should be over soon.

430
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:17,732
Is it true?

431
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,446
If Song Zhonghao kicked Li Hongduan out

432
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,990
Was it all planned to call Jeon Yong-soo over again?

433
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,158
In that case?

434
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,369
They can't contact the professor.

435
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,871
Those people inside are not stupid.

436
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,541
Think about it carefully

437
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,751
Okay?

438
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:41,130
Restored communication with the lost transport vehicle

439
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,091
The prisoner was kidnapped during the transfer.

440
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,136
It seems that they really sent her out on purpose.

441
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,475
Why?

442
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,312
Is it to contact the professor? Or...

443
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,982
Are there any unsolvable problems?

444
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,151
Is it because of the traitor? Otherwise...

445
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,907
I mean...

446
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,075
Why do you keep looking at me?

447
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:10,451
What?

448
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:12,871
Director, please get busy.

449
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,501
Although I don't know Kim Sang-man
How to trick robbers

450
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,838
A robber did listen to him.
Intent on killing Anne

451
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:22,755
What next?

452
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,550
Hearing that I can get a reduced sentence
Is there anyone who still wants to kill people?

453
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,137
That's right.

454
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,598
Maybe it was Kim Sang Man…

455
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:34,809
Who knows what weakness the robber has?

456
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,186
Will she come out to deal with this?

457
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:43,985
Tokyo

458
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,194
Thank you for your hard work

459
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,822
Have you checked what I said?

460
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,117
He has a house in Songshanli
Villa registered under someone else's name

461
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,952
Because it's very private

462
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,245
Perfect for a secret base

463
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,581
If you want to hide the children of Nairobi

464
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:58,583
It's very likely hidden there.

465
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,253
Berlin asked for a date to meet Jeon Yong-soo
It's almost here

466
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:09,052
(1 hour and 40 minutes from the announced time)

467
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:12,138
Mint robber arrested by police
During the transfer

468
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,933
Escaped with the help of a mysterious person who was suspected to be an accomplice

469
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,977
I am so happy to see her on the screen.

470
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:19,395
Hello

471
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,022
So happy?

472
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:23,566
Didn't I tell you not to worry?

473
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:27,737
That is...

474
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,822
Are those mercenaries outside going to rescue her?

475
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,743
They are all trustworthy people

476
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,912
How do you know this?

477
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,372
The professor never mentioned this.

478
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,540
Of course I know

479
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,542
They are a group of people who will go to hell even if I say

480
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,086
The guy who will go with me

481
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,546
What? Could it be that these mercenaries...

482
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:48,633
Was he originally your subordinate?

483
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:57,725
Damn

484
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,437
It feels like it's all in vain to resist them.

485
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,190
Why are you saying this now?

486
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,818
Didn't you just hear?

487
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,319
He's going crazy there

488
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,238
Calling to meet a politician!

489
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,447
If they are not satisfied

490
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,408
We might all die here!

491
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,084
I'm so hungry

492
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:24,585
Hello, Agent Park

493
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,837
Should I half-heartedly agree?

494
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,088
How about forming a cooking group?

495
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,185
Come on, the restaurant can't operate now

496
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,021
Everyone just eat it simply.

497
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,023
Come on, this is the only one

498
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:48,443
Potatoes

499
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,279
You don't even want to cook.

500
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,613
Still dreaming of eating?

501
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:54,532
Don't do that.

502
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,159
What are you doing standing there?

503
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,493
Come and eat quickly

504
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,663
Shameless bastard weasel

505
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,081
You are not allowed to eat!

506
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,459
Aren’t you all hungry?

507
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,711
No matter how unhappy you are, you still have to eat, right?

508
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:07,628
Coming soon

509
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,758
Okay, let's go.

510
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,150
Are you guys performing Romeo and Juliet?

511
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,111
Wake up and eat potatoes!

512
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,831
-Reporter Park
-Yes

513
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,374
Heard about the Mint hostage situation

514
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:48,127
The criminals may have political motives, right?

515
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,922
Yes, an anonymous police source said

516
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,716
Discovered from clues left by the robbers in their hiding place

517
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,761
The Mint hostage situation was not just a robbery

518
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:59,055
It is very likely to be based on specific political purposes

519
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,807
Planned criminal activity

520
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,974
Plus the robber Song Zhonghao

521
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:05,144
Request to meet with North Korean Economic Cooperation Talks Leader Jeon Yong-soo

522
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,563
This also deepens the credibility of this speculation.

523
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,483
Why did he ask to see Captain Jeon Yong-soo?

524
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:14,237
I think this has something to do with his experience as a labor camp commander.

525
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,404
There is a certain correlation

526
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,614
But that's not the same as the armistice...

527
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:17,907
We are ready

528
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,284
If there is any danger, you will be escorted away immediately

529
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,453
There's no need to be so nervous

530
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,414
I want to buy a little more time

531
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,125
It will be more conducive to the implementation of the plan, right?

532
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,754
(30 minutes from the announced time)

533
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,548
In the past, Jeon Yong-soo...

534
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,716
How? Did you find it?

535
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,636
The person standing behind Kim Sang-man at the surrender press conference

536
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,930
Some of them are not relatives of the hostages.

537
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,682
Who are those people?

538
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:45,059
They are the family members of the robbers whose identities have been confirmed.

539
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:46,978
Among them is Shen Yingwen's son

540
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:49,605
Kim Sang-wan took him away for the press conference
But they never sent him back.

541
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,774
Is he threatening her with the child?

542
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,734
Where might he hide the child?

543
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,115
If you want to do such a dirty thing

544
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,116
I know where

545
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:01,993
How do you know?

546
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,245
I lived with that guy for several years.

547
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:12,962
(10 minutes before the announcement time)

548
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,697
Who are you?

549
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,615
Us?

550
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:42,909
Well…

551
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,327
What do you think?

552
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,914
There are at least four of your accomplices here.

553
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,666
There are also North Korean-made AK-105s, etc.

554
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,628
A lot of heavy weapons, that's all I know

555
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,463
Can you tell it just by the sound?

556
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,217
It's amazing

557
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,469
Are you going to launch an armed revolution?

558
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,388
Revolution

559
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,118
Why did it take so long?

560
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,663
I kept running into checkpoints and took a detour.

561
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,456
Now it's time

562
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:43,844
The child is on the second floor

563
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,432
The security is too tight.

564
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,351
We don't have much time

565
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,812
And we must abide by the principles that the professor said

566
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:56,482
There's a rubber bullet inside

567
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,323
This is the first time I have seen such a stubborn man

568
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:05,783
Except Berlin

569
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,037
Is it clear?

570
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:12,748
Let's go

571
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,734
It's time to go.

572
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,227
(Notice time)

573
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,623
(North Korean negotiator Jeon Yong-soo arrives at the Mint)

574
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,336
Long time no see

575
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:42,922
Is that so?

576
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:44,882
I am not

577
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:48,928
Even after I escaped from the labor camp and gained freedom

578
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:51,680
I still see you in my dreams every night

579
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,725
Now I'm your nightmare.

580
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:13,661
Enter

581
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,482
How?

582
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,458
You son of a bitch

583
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:05,713
Asshole!

584
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:45,836
Get out of the way!

585
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,537
The time is now

586
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,560
Is everyone okay?

587
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:28,814
It's ok, everything should be done here.

588
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,040
Today I

589
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,626
To expose your ugly true face

590
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,628
Dig up old issues in public

591
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:52,963
Can anything be changed?

592
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,758
Look at the current situation

593
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:57,676
How did it become like this?

594
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,346
I heard the power was cut off inside.

595
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,265
This scene is almost over, right?

596
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,060
Stop being stubborn

597
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,479
Come away with me

598
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:09,521
Comrade

599
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,566
Tell me what you did in Labor Camp No. 14

600
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,402
Tell Everyone

601
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:19,948
I just fulfilled the responsibility given to me by the party

602
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:24,411
“Responsibility”?

603
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,163
Treat people like dogs and don't give them food

604
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,706
Extorting a confession through torture

605
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,333
Kill them again

606
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:32,211
Answer me, what kind of sacred responsibility is this?

607
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,339
Me!

608
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,426
Even if such a crime is committed, but...

609
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,554
Haven't I already paid for my sins?

610
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,265
You have...

611
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,351
You took revenge on me, didn't you?

612
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:48,310
What?

613
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:51,105
My daughter is a medical worker in a labor camp

614
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,065
Raped by you

615
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,776
Burned to death again!

616
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:57,528
True or false?

617
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,322
(Song Zhonghao asked Jeon Yongsu to confess his past)

618
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,157
- That's too much
-How can this be?

619
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:03,951
Very good

620
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,327
Well done

621
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,162
Will this excite the robbers?

622
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,914
In case someone really dies...

623
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,749
That is also an inevitable sacrifice

624
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,294
After the matter is over, no one will have any opinions

625
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:15,879
Why?

626
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,674
Because people want a hero to solve their problems

627
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:22,845
When the news media

628
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:26,265
I'm sure I'll be busy
Discuss your great contribution this time

629
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:33,939
What is this?

630
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:35,649
-This
-What is this?

631
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,322
(The number of views keeps increasing, who is forwarding it?)

632
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,657
(So many people are watching, what is this?)

633
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,993
(This is more interesting than the hostage situation news)

634
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,453
(What is this live broadcast?)

635
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:48,829
(The robbers broke into a building)

636
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:49,872
(Is there no one up there?)

637
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:50,998
(Exaggerated, very beautiful)

638
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,000
(Shit, I'm so scared. How come it suddenly jumped out?)

639
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,710
(Why are the Mint Robbers here?)

640
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:55,627
(Gun?)

641
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,755
(Is this real? Is this a costume?)

642
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,757
(Seriously? Blow his head off!)

643
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,550
(What a poor aim! Is this true?)

644
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,677
(Is this a real live broadcast?)

645
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,223
(Like a first-person shooter game)

646
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,391
(Super striking)

647
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,602
(I know! This is "The Wire"!)

648
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,855
(Exaggeratedly strong!)

649
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,940
(This doesn’t look like a mint at all)

650
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,150
(There must be many more upstairs)

651
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,485
(Obviously a South Korean guard)

652
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,111
(There are more here, another group is coming)

653
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,821
(The movement is so strong! The sound effects are amazing!)

654
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,490
(Scared, uncle, please don’t block the camera!)

655
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:25,949
(This isn’t a movie at all!)

656
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,326
(You useless people, don't commit suicide)

657
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:29,119
(It seems like someone is dead. Is this okay?)

658
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,662
(The one wearing the mask is the Mint Robber?)

659
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,747
(Cleared? Super kill!)

660
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,457
(The robber's movements don't look like those of a South Korean)

661
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,125
(Not finished yet? Have you defeated the king?)

662
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,585
(Who is that child? Should we save him?)

663
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:38,796
(The little ghost seemed to be kidnapped, and the rescue was successful!)

664
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:47,221
Dongzhe

665
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:49,640
Send support here quickly

666
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,353
Who are you?

667
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:55,979
I'm your mother's friend

668
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,148
Your mother is worried about you

669
00:46:58,732 --> 00:46:59,566
That's why I came to pick you up

670
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,069
Will you come with me?

671
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,045
No wonder I feel so relaxed

672
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:21,672
Don't move

673
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,090
We are here to save the children

674
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,091
I know

675
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,300
But even so

676
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,636
You won't become a hero.

677
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:35,477
It's okay

678
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,188
That aunt is a police officer

679
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,315
Just follow her

680
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,651
She will protect you
Don't get caught by the scary uncle here

681
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:43,694
What?

682
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,696
Auntie is a good person

683
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:47,823
Right?

684
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:53,328
Yes

685
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,038
Auntie is not a bad person

686
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:58,417
Come here

687
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,669
Okay?

688
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,264
Don't act rashly!

689
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:14,266
You wouldn't shoot in front of the kids, would you?

690
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,727
Can't you just stop forcing me to shoot?

691
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,021
Kim Sang-wan's dog will wake up soon

692
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:21,231
Should we protect the children first?

693
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:09,696
Of course…

694
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,448
(Jeon Yong-soo uses the pain of losing his daughter to atone for his past sins)

695
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,784
The treatment in North Korean labor camps is indeed not very good

696
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,704
Most of the people outside the camp starved to death.

697
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,039
How good will it be inside?

698
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,208
It's all my fault! But...

699
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,461
I think I have paid the price

700
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:27,255
Although not her biological daughter

701
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,592
But she is more important than my life

702
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,553
Because of my sins she died

703
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,681
Have you finished your performance?

704
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,191
Please take a look at this

705
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,449
A person contacted one of our partners

706
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,326
Take her only child hostage

707
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,996
And threatened her to kill Anne

708
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:03,166
Fortunately, everyone has just seen
We rescued the child

709
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:06,044
And handed him over safely to the police for protection

710
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:08,964
Also

711
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:11,258
Now what Jeon Yong-soo said

712
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,844
It's all fake

713
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,762
Ask me how I know?

714
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:26,982
Because I

715
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,317
That is what he said is more important than life...

716
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,861
(Instant video of the Mint robbers)

717
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:32,821
...unrelated daughter

718
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,657
He started raping me when I was little.

719
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:39,745
To keep me by your side
Let me go to the labor camp as a medical staff

720
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:45,125
Even if he kills and tortures people for fun

721
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,293
Or play tricks on anyone

722
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,088
No one there can resist him

723
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,174
Except for one person

724
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:53,967
Except Song Zhonghao

725
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,095
Song Zhonghao is not afraid of him at all

726
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,515
When I fell in love with Song Zhonghao

727
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,352
Jeon Yong-soo wants to kill us all

728
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:08,273
Song Zhonghao started a riot to save me

729
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,400
Such a person

730
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:13,111
Now posing as a missionary of peace

731
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,406
Came to South Korea to attend the Economic Cooperation Meeting

732
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,992
And who invited him?

733
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,202
That is…

734
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,163
Chairman of the United Future Party

735
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,290
He is also the chairman of the Special Committee for North-South Economic Cooperation

736
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:27,542
Member of the Council of Representatives Kim Sang-man

737
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,213
He also threatened Nairobi with children

738
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,673
The bastard who had persuaded her to kill Anne

739
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:34,925
What's going on?

740
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,885
What should I do?

741
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:38,428
Call him back quickly

742
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:39,846
Come back soon!

743
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:45,185
That group of people

744
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,270
Killing Annie

745
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,647
What exactly do you want to gain?

746
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,650
Economic cooperation? Peaceful reunification?

747
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:54,861
Or should the people of the North and the South live a good life together?

748
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:55,779
Neither

749
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,865
They don't care about these things at all

750
00:51:58,949 --> 00:51:59,866
This meeting

751
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,953
They just want to fill their pockets

752
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,704
It's just a trick.

753
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,039
I said it must be like this

754
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:08,667
Please look at

755
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,752
What is money?

756
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,587
It's just some paper.

757
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:16,049
That is to say, in this
Print as many as you want

758
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,801
But if you decide how much money to print

759
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,886
How to use the money

760
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:21,638
If they were a bunch of thieves

761
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,641
Should we stop them?

762
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,060
Because this house that prints money

763
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:29,187
Originally belonged to the people

764
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,150
(Real-time situation in front of the Mint)

765
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:37,362
- Good
-What's going on?

766
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,156
Who is the thief now?

767
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,033
Who is the real master?

768
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,512
Is this all true?

769
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,139
Please say something

770
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:07,225
Leader Jeon Yong-soo left the scene without saying a word

771
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,518
Is the call connected? Go ask!

772
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:11,271
Wow, Berlin, you look awesome!

773
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,398
Thank you for your hard work

774
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:22,741
Be careful!

775
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,576
This guy is here again

776
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,245
How long can Berlin survive?

777
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:28,788
Don't know

778
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,374
Did he go in there hoping to die in the mint?

779
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,501
If he had such a damn idea

780
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:37,881
I'll kill him first.

781
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:44,179
Kim Sang-man said
That was a lie the robbers used to incite the masses.

782
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:46,348
He claimed that he did this to protect his children.

783
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:49,893
I knew he would say that.

784
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:53,438
Even if Shen Yingwen is arrested to testify later
He will deny it all.

785
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,025
Okay, I'm on my way back.

786
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,027
Let's talk about it later

787
00:53:59,110 --> 00:53:59,945
Got it

788
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,364
Aunt

789
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,366
What?

790
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,161
Are those mother’s friends just now bad people?

791
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,122
Is that my mother too?

792
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:20,548
Time's up

793
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:22,384
Let's go

794
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,682
You don't have to be so afraid

795
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,353
In fact, everything was planned by Berlin

796
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,272
Why do you do this?

797
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:36,481
Why drag me into this?

798
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:38,024
Wait and you will know

799
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,610
No matter what happens

800
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:43,029
You will never get hurt

801
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,992
At that time, a bomb was planted in the vault to kill me.

802
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:49,869
Is this also arranged?

803
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,583
Actually, I did that.

804
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,294
I was forced

805
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,089
Because Kim Sang-wan threatened me

806
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:04,759
I don't believe it

807
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,012
Now no matter what you say

808
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,472
I don't believe any of it

809
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,687
Come on, I'm sorry.

810
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:19,858
Damn

811
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:21,568
Potatoes again?

812
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:23,778
Give me some kimchi, please.

813
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,238
If you don't want to eat it, we'll push it away.

814
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:30,327
Well, it’s better than going hungry, right?

815
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:32,579
What's wrong with you?

816
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:34,914
You need to eat to have strength.

817
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,753
Share this among you.

818
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,087
Thank you

819
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,423
Come, eat

820
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,219
Are you doing this for the children?

821
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,599
I am really glad

822
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,226
You didn't run away, you came back here

823
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:57,103
Thank you

824
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:00,565
Thank you for surviving

825
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,033
Come, eat

826
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,133
Hey! What are you doing? Please!

827
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,719
Leave some for others to eat!

828
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:48,029
What for?

829
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:49,906
I'm in so much pain

830
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,324
What?

831
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:56,746
This…

832
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,498
It seems that there is no inflammation anymore.

833
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:00,417
Does it hurt?

834
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,836
I didn't say where it hurts.

835
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:06,965
What else?

836
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:09,426
What are you doing now?

837
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,970
How long are you going to hide from me?

838
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:16,724
How can I have that?

839
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:22,605
It's not that I can't leave

840
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:25,608
Just didn't leave

841
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:29,612
What? Are you crazy?

842
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,199
I must be crazy

843
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,298
What are you doing here?

844
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,592
Oh, I'm changing her dressing.

845
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:52,969
Her wound is a little inflamed.

846
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:54,637
All is well

847
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:56,306
Your dad is looking for you

848
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:58,433
I'll take her back, you go quickly

849
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:00,185
Oh, OK, got it.

850
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:11,988
I sent the child back

851
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:16,326
Send the police officers in charge to the facility temporarily.

852
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,370
Well, now the public opinion is very fierce

853
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:20,914
Kim Sang-wan probably won't make a move again.

854
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:24,375
What's next?

855
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:27,462
What?

856
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:29,839
Do you really not care?

857
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:31,591
What else can we do?

858
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,593
This is indicated above.

859
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:35,512
Team Leader

860
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,725
We let Li Hongduan escape

861
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,394
Not only did they fail to catch the professor,

862
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,439
And was played around by that group of people

863
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,360
I have nothing to complain about.

864
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,786
Now that it's like this

865
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,204
Don't go back to the team yet, take a good rest.

866
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:03,706
Otherwise you will be exhausted

867
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:05,792
Good

868
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:09,587
You've worked hard too

869
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:45,999
Back to the point

870
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:50,503
We're all here for the money, right?

871
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:54,173
What you said in front of Jeon Yong-soo was so true

872
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,134
Is that so?

873
00:59:58,052 --> 00:59:59,887
This is part of the plan

874
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:00,805
Plan?

875
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:02,181
What's the plan?

876
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:06,936
“The house that prints banknotes belongs to the people”?

877
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,439
Hey, what the hell is that?

878
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:13,276
Locked in here

879
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,485
Holding the intention of being shot

880
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:16,779
We are the ones who print money desperately

881
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,656
How can it be the people’s thing?

882
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,366
Well, that is...

883
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,827
I'm not interested in any grand plan.

884
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:24,245
Rio

885
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:28,458
I don't know why you came here with the intention of dying.

886
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,084
But don't drag us down

887
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,421
Don't ruin the professor's plan.

888
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,181
This is for my brother.

889
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:45,141
What? Brother?

890
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,811
Yes, that's why I risked my life to come here

891
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,856
It is to ensure that my brother's plan will succeed

892
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:54,442
You mean teach him...

893
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:56,944
Make us like revolutionaries

894
01:00:58,571 --> 01:00:59,906
These are also the professor's plans

895
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:02,784
Political prisoner?

896
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,911
Is this possible?

897
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,330
If we succeed in being made political prisoners

898
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:09,916
That will ensure a way out.

899
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:10,958
What does it mean?

900
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,669
In this emergency, the police

901
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,171
will assume that our goal is to prevent the talks

902
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:18,091
As long as Seoul and the mercenaries show up in public

903
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,843
They will not be able to exclude

904
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,512
An armed force with a certain amount of firepower

905
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:24,514
Possibility of terrorist attack on talks

906
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:27,809
Kim Sang-wan and his group will try every possible means to manipulate public opinion

907
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:29,560
Trying to cover up the truth

908
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:32,313
But those who already know the truth

909
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:33,856
Will support us

910
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:35,274
Standing on the streets

911
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,235
(The paper house is ours)

912
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:44,283
In this way
The final stage of this play is set

913
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,419
This is the professor's plan, and it is also my plan.

914
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:55,962
Hey, in this case...

915
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:59,632
Why did you keep hiding the fact that you two were brothers?

916
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,051
I suggested not to tell you.

917
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:03,469
If I hadn't hidden it from everyone

918
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:05,596
When Nairobi Betrayed

919
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,515
The professor's identity will be exposed.

920
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:14,313
You guys are having a really good chat.

921
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:16,482
I have gathered all the hostages.

922
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,819
Hostages? Why are you gathering hostages again?

923
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,702
We are ready to welcome Tokyo

924
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,079
Hello, what did you say?

925
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:41,674
If any of you want to go out

926
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:44,260
I'll let you go

927
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:45,678
But

928
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:49,348
