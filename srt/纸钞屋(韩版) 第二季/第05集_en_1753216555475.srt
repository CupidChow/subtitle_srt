1
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:13,013
We're going to pretend to take hostages to buy time.

2
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,515
This way, we can spend nine days
Print the money we want

3
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:16,975
And dig out an escape route

4
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,811
Once Moscow has dug its escape tunnel…

5
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,397
But I dug alone

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,691
I don't know if it's too late.

7
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:25,859
Absolutely

8
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:27,986
Because there will be mercenaries digging from outside at the same time

9
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,070
What next?

10
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:30,780
How to move money?

11
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,949
Four trillion dollars is not a small amount of money

12
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,745
We use underground waterways

13
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:38,747
Packed in rubber boats and shipped out

14
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,956
Just two hours

15
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,335
This is the end of the escape route.

16
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,212
Enter the secret base at the end of the passage

17
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,173
There will be a camouflaged truck waiting there.

18
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,883
As long as we load the money onto the truck

19
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:51,551
It will disappear without a trace

20
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,845
But this isn't a magic show.

21
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,972
The police outside must have widened their eyes.

22
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,182
Trying every possible means to catch us

23
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,934
So we have to choose the day when the ECC talks will take place.

24
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,312
Escape from this place

25
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,940
The tenth day after we entered the Mint

26
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,318
Peace Hotel near the secret base

27
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,320
The South-North Economic Cooperation Talks will be held

28
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,156
Will the security be tighter then?

29
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:14,783
That's right.

30
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,660
Because the rulers on both sides

31
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,121
Betting everything on this meeting

32
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,716
But by then
People will find the real robber

33
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,219
It's not us, it's them

34
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,428
And gathered at Peace Square

35
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,222
That area

36
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,682
There will be extreme chaos

37
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:07,627
(Taedong River Beer)

38
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,345
Are you ready?

39
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,627
No weapons found!

40
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,822
Severely punish those responsible!

41
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,040
(The paper house is ours)

42
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,250
Severely punish those responsible!

43
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,712
Severely punish those responsible!

44
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:41,012
Severely punish those responsible...

45
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,942
But Oslo is dead.

46
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,085
Helsinki!

47
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,505
Helsinki

48
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,507
No!

49
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:18,883
Get out your gun!

50
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,468
Damn it!

51
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,304
-Hurry up!
-Hurry up!

52
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,222
Take it

53
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,140
Take it

54
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:28,893
-Berlin
-Berlin

55
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:29,852
Berlin!

56
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,312
Rio, wake up!

57
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:32,772
Let’s go!

58
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,366
Dad!

59
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,159
A bunch of bastards!

60
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:56,045
No!

61
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,340
Dad...

62
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,041
The situation has been resolved...

63
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,935
No...

64
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:53,936
No!

65
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,419
Paper House: Korea

66
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:04,549
Rio

67
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:09,762
Are you listening?

68
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,432
Yes

69
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,852
I know everyone must be very surprised

70
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,603
The meeting date is brought forward

71
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,857
This means that all escape plans must be made in advance.

72
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,735
A lot of money has been printed, forget about the rest

73
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,071
But the escape route has not been dug yet.

74
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,281
Yeah

75
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,240
It's impossible

76
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,702
Who cares about the talks? Can’t you hold on a little longer?

77
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:33,661
No

78
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,955
They signed at the meeting

79
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,165
The police will rush in immediately

80
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:40,209
Because they no longer need to care about the news media

81
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,128
Does everyone understand?

82
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:43,671
Tomorrow is

83
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:45,756
We're leaving here

84
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,718
The action has to be accelerated

85
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,179
We need to use the remaining hostages more effectively

86
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,931
The escape route is the most urgent

87
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,766
I'll try to send everyone there.

88
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,603
This is very important, remember to tell Moscow

89
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,604
Got it

90
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,409
That...

91
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:14,994
Tokyo, etc.

92
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,288
I mean...

93
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,624
The meeting will be held in advance

94
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,001
Is this just the professor's guess?

95
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:23,753
What next?

96
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,299
Our communication was interrupted

97
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,302
Oslo will die, the professor didn't expect it

98
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:32,845
Seriously speaking

99
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,514
The meeting will be held in advance

100
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,057
This is something the professor did not expect.

101
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,767
That's why it turned out like this, wasn't it?

102
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,061
The professor is not a prophet.

103
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,313
Just our leader

104
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,733
Okay, then...

105
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,360
If the leader

106
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,238
Hiding something from the rest of us

107
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,156
Can you still trust him?

108
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:57,036
You can't figure out why Berlin got a terminal illness
Do you still insist on coming in?

109
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,830
I just found out that guy is a brother of the professor

110
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,917
He asked us not to tell each other our names.

111
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,502
But they concealed the fact that they were brothers

112
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,090
Did you already know that?

113
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,300
I only found out about this when I went out this time.

114
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,141
Good

115
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,061
Berlin comes from a North Korean labor camp

116
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,854
The professor is a North Korean defector

117
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,942
I don't know they did this.
What a great goal

118
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,361
But at least it's not for money

119
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,822
They might think it's okay to die here.

120
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,951
Willing to risk your life to do something

121
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,246
It doesn't mean that death doesn't matter.

122
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:45,501
It just represents the value of that thing
Enough to make people die without regrets

123
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,059
Sorry

124
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,772
I don't know what their great goal is.

125
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,609
But I don't care

126
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,530
Rio

127
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,829
Dad, are you here?

128
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:23,831
Dad...

129
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,503
Dad...

130
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,422
Strong men follow Helsinki

131
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,883
Rio!

132
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,384
Where are you Rio?

133
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,803
Call Rio now!

134
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,139
Rio, come quickly!

135
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,515
-Rio!
-What for?

136
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,018
Rio! You little brat! Come on!

137
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,853
Dad, are you okay?

138
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,688
What's going on?

139
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,607
Rio, what should we do?

140
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,151
You think of a way! Damn!

141
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,195
Take it off

142
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,696
What are you doing? Get the first aid kit!

143
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,614
Got it

144
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,241
-Don't move
-I'm fine

145
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,577
- Be careful
- Be careful

146
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,287
Fuck! Son of a bitch!

147
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,333
Hey, think of a solution!

148
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,710
As the final action approaches

149
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,629
Accidents keep happening

150
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,673
Let things gradually develop in the worst direction

151
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,927
Inside the Mint, Moscow is in danger of death

152
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,471
Sir, wake up!

153
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,098
Are you okay?

154
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,307
He is seriously injured.

155
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,477
Outside the Mint
Che Wuyi learns the location of the secret base

156
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,604
Out of the professor's control

157
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,410
The police inspector

158
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,745
Finally found out the professor's true identity

159
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,833
The professor's seemingly perfect escape plan

160
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,918
It has begun to disintegrate

161
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,763
They don't have enough people to print money

162
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,307
Tell the hostages that they can get 3 billion if they help

163
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,268
The director of the mint also defected

164
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,353
I just don’t know how to give…

165
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,604
Money is just bait

166
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,648
Half of the hostages escaped

167
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,859
This is done to make the rest of the people obey.

168
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,281
It's so annoying, they want to hold on till the end, right?

169
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,908
The meeting will be held in two days.

170
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,578
Can't we just rush in?

171
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,539
They have released several hostages.

172
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,416
There are still hostages who voluntarily stay inside

173
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,084
It may be a bit difficult to attack now

174
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,878
Because public opinion is now leaning towards that side

175
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:37,882
It's Song Zhonghao

176
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:39,967
Him again?

177
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,094
What happened this time?

178
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,146
Let's go

179
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,399
Go down the stairs

180
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,694
Stop

181
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,282
About Us

182
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,576
As agreed, peacefully...

183
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,869
Released the hostages

184
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,872
You arranged snipers to shoot us.

185
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,874
So we have people injured

186
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,375
Is he kidding?

187
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,961
"You are the ones who are using the release of hostages to cause trouble.

188
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,380
We did what we had to do.”
Just tell him

189
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,633
If you can follow the agreement

190
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,384
Peaceful release of hostages

191
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,178
There will be no such thing!

192
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,096
I don't have time to argue with you!

193
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,640
We have some people seriously injured.

194
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,558
I demand a medical team!

195
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:31,268
What to do?

196
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,728
Tell him if he wants treatment

197
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,064
Send the injured to us.

198
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,734
If you want to receive treatment

199
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,861
Just send the injured out!

200
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,114
A bunch of bastards!

201
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,493
Let's go

202
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,746
Back away slowly

203
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,213
Will they send the wounded out?

204
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:00,673
Don't know

205
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,300
Maybe he's just trying to buy time.

206
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,803
But if the injured are hostages...

207
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:09,974
No problem

208
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:12,977
Prepare the car

209
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,144
Where are you going?

210
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:16,605
You wait here

211
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:33,330
The floor where Che Wuyi lives is full of police officers

212
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,623
Impossible to get close

213
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,089
I'm not sure how much Che Wuyi knows

214
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,675
The only thing that is certain is that he knows where this place is.

215
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,552
As long as he tells the police where he is.

216
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,137
Our plan is over.

217
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,264
He may be in a coma for many days.

218
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,393
We cannot continue with the plan at any risk.

219
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,186
Otherwise…

220
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,565
How about using a police inspector?

221
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,651
No

222
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,194
No use

223
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,114
Why? Among the remaining cards in our hand

224
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,658
She is the most reliable one.

225
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,168
Hello? Woojin?

226
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,462
Hello? Are you in the cafe?

227
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,214
Yes, what's the matter?

228
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,507
No, that...

229
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,928
I heard that my colleague suddenly had a car accident.

230
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,846
So I'm going to the hospital now.

231
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,765
The car suddenly broke down.

232
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,809
I happened to be near the coffee shop

233
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,102
If you have time...

234
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,606
OK, I understand.

235
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,233
I'll be there soon, please wait for me, okay

236
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,266
I have done all the emergency treatment I could...

237
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,479
What should I do then?

238
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,495
It just so happens that I can't contact the professor at this time

239
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,373
Shit, I'm going to collapse

240
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,796
I know you are sad

241
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,215
But now the plan should be the priority

242
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,426
Before the end of the meeting

243
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,636
We must do everything we can to escape

244
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,805
This is how Moscow can be saved

245
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,683
Our plan will be successful.

246
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,185
It's all over

247
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,313
What's over?

248
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,398
Hello

249
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,607
Let's just admit it

250
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,276
Projects established by professors

251
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,319
Already ruined

252
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,613
Damn, you idiot

253
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,532
What the hell are you talking about?

254
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,744
Hey, Berlin, tell them yourself.

255
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,455
Okay, let me tell you.

256
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,541
The professor and Berlin are brothers

257
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,919
Obviously from North Korea
Pretending to be South Korean

258
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,630
Let public opinion be on our side?

259
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,383
Let everyone truly believe that we are the revolutionary army?

260
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,428
Is that really for us?

261
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,055
Otherwise why?

262
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,724
Hey, revolution, revenge?

263
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,477
Fuck it, what the hell is that to me?

264
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,645
Even if these two communists

265
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,814
Willing to die for that shit

266
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,399
But I don't want to

267
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,401
You don’t want to either, do you?

268
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,486
Rio

269
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,324
Hello, Helsinki

270
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,492
No matter what the professor says

271
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,410
Oslo, who never talked back

272
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,746
What's happening now?

273
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,999
Right? Nairobi, you too

274
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,294
Don’t you still want to see your son?

275
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,338
Are we going to meet at the farewell ceremony?

276
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,843
And you too! You dead pig!

277
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:16,845
Want to save your dad

278
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,430
Send him out now!

279
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,307
Rather than die here

280
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,602
It's better to go to jail and receive treatment.

281
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,568
Even if it's only a few hundred million yuan

282
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,570
I will definitely take my share with me

283
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,155
Don't just trust the professor.

284
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,740
Finally died here

285
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,242
Find a way to escape on your own

286
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,539
-What the hell!
-Rio!

287
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,376
Is what that boy said true?

288
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,671
We did hide our brotherhood.

289
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,257
But the rest is Rio's fantasy

290
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,716
Tell me the truth!

291
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,095
Said he would go out on the day of the meeting

292
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,472
Is it really for safety and escape?

293
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:04,810
Helsinki

294
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,812
Dad...

295
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,230
Could you please get up for a moment?

296
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,107
Get up, let's go out.

297
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,109
I will never go out

298
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,862
But there's no other way now, okay?

299
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,905
It's better than staying here

300
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,533
It would be better to die in there in the end

301
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,828
Then die here

302
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,497
I absolutely don't want to go to the kiln again

303
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,457
Dad, please!

304
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,669
Please listen to me!

305
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,047
Listen to me, everyone.

306
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,549
You…

307
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,552
There's no time to keep arguing here.

308
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,220
Dig the tunnel first

309
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,806
Let's see whether we should go out or what?

310
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,808
Not much left

311
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,604
I will try my best to hold on

312
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,107
As Moscow says

313
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,401
We only have one day left

314
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,196
Is what the professor said true?

315
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,114
We'll know tomorrow anyway.

316
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,617
Instead of hesitating about what to do

317
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,744
Wouldn't it be better to do what we can do now?

318
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,538
You go quickly

319
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,083
Got it

320
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,253
Oshan

321
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,425
When I went down to dig the tunnel

322
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,428
Please help me take care of my old man.

323
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,013
Okay?

324
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,727
Helsinki

325
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,688
If you have nothing to do
Stop wasting your energy there.

326
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:32,689
Come with me now

327
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:33,941
Anyway, I want to escape alive.

328
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,400
We still have to dig a hole, don't we?

329
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:37,903
Let’s go! Damn!

330
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:50,958
I'll be here with you

331
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,044
In fact, whether it is Berlin or me

332
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,296
As uneasy as Rio

333
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,924
Because of what we can do

334
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,052
Just believe that the professor's prediction will not be wrong

335
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,179
(Kim Sang-man's approval rating plummets)

336
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,264
Don't even mention electing a president.

337
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,849
Even the talks may have to be suspended
You said you had a good idea?

338
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,685
About Us

339
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,561
Move the meeting forward to tomorrow

340
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:13,855
What does this mean?

341
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,316
This isn't a game of house, how can you...

342
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,567
No

343
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,361
It seems possible

344
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,530
We are so tied up in doing things now.

345
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,783
Isn't it because I'm afraid of
Could anything go wrong?

346
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,911
To be honest, all the negotiations behind the scenes have been completed.

347
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,621
We just need to sign.

348
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,957
Now it's just moving the date forward

349
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,751
Additional 4 trillion yuan in loans to North Korean investment companies

350
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,128
Just sign...

351
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,254
No matter what the public opinion is

352
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,464
You can directly attack the mint.

353
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,432
Since currently

354
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:51,435
The unfortunate incident at the Mint remains unresolved

355
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,353
The public's anxiety is growing

356
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,730
(No signal)

357
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,156
But the communication was interrupted and we couldn't contact the outside world.

358
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:05,782
Confidence is seriously shaken

359
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,600
Therefore, the governments of both the North and the South

360
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,102
A consensus has been reached and we hope to complete the talks as soon as possible

361
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,189
After consideration

362
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:39,983
Decision to hold talks

363
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,569
One day in advance

364
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,071
Regarding the previous robber's revelations

365
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:47,407
We want to hear your true thoughts, Member of Parliament
Rather than the official position

366
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,160
Is the advance of the talks related to the robbers' revelations?

367
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,203
Member of Parliament!

368
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,475
Get in the car!

369
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,853
My car keys are not where they belong.

370
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,063
It took me a while to find it.

371
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,399
No wonder it's so slow

372
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:24,486
I was still troubled for a while
I'm thinking about taking a taxi.

373
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,322
Sorry

374
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:29,533
However

375
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,494
Which hospital was your colleague sent to?

376
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,496
Five-star hospital

377
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,344
You have seen him too, right?

378
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,304
Captain Che Wuyi

379
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,017
When you came to the emergency response team to see me

380
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,442
Is he seriously injured?

381
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,277
I heard he hasn't regained consciousness yet.

382
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,029
Actual situation

383
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,364
You have to go and see it to know

384
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,214
Where did Yoon Mi-sun go?

385
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,675
Since you all came back by yourself

386
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,719
You should have come work with us, damn it.

387
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,305
Moscow was injured just now

388
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,264
She is taking care of him

389
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,643
She has become yours.

390
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,146
This is because it involves family members.

391
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,609
Stop talking about your family.

392
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,194
Let's print money quickly, uncle

393
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,532
Uncle, you should stop talking nonsense and get moving.

394
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,659
Work is not done with your mouth

395
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,411
It's done by hand.

396
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,290
You...

397
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,759
Just hold on a little longer

398
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:11,676
Selection…

399
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,348
No, Denver will take you out.

400
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,937
You are mad at him because of me.

401
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:23,980
I know

402
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,944
Miss, where is your hometown?

403
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,030
Kaesong

404
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,491
Did you graduate from college there?

405
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,619
Such a smart and beautiful lady

406
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,579
Why did you choose that guy?

407
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:47,128
I have never in my life...

408
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,258
I never choose to do anything.

409
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,052
Whether it is school or work

410
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,888
All are chosen according to the parents' wishes.

411
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,348
Love is also

412
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,436
When the factory manager said he liked me

413
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:07,023
I think even if I'm divorced
He is also a powerful man

414
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,026
My parents will be happy that I chose him.

415
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,362
Although he said he wanted a divorce

416
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,905
Finally, you are just lying to me

417
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:15,949
But I didn't feel sad

418
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,077
Then I met Denver

419
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,831
Although he is clumsy in everything he does

420
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:25,458
But they are all sincere

421
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,627
So I…

422
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,045
For the first time in my life

423
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,966
According to your true thoughts

424
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,718
Choose that person

425
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,053
At your age

426
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,890
It's normal to think this way.

427
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:42,976
But

428
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,813
Wait for you to go outside and take a look

429
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:51,151
You will find that there are people like him everywhere.

430
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,030
You should just leave here.

431
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,533
Why are you running back?

432
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,785
The thought of never seeing him again
I feel like I can't survive

433
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,331
Seeing him makes me feel alive again

434
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,666
Feeling able to breathe

435
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,127
Now of course you would think so

436
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,215
But a dog will always eat shit

437
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:17,594
He will make you sad sooner or later

438
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,347
But when the time comes

439
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,308
You are already a criminal

440
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,437
There's no way back.

441
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,485
I might regret it.

442
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,031
But let him leave like this

443
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,408
Continue to live your previous life

444
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,537
Won't you regret it?

445
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,182
Go ahead, I'll wait for you

446
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:05,517
Thank you

447
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,507
I just went to check on him.

448
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,883
Do you want to go up together?

449
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:42,470
Really?

450
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,180
Then…

451
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:45,598
OK

452
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,243
Target entered

453
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,540
Confirm the target

454
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,007
He is suspected of leaking internal information

455
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,176
Suddenly disappeared during the pursuit

456
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,096
I didn't expect him to show up like this again.

457
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,432
How did he become like this?

458
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,309
He seemed to be running away from someone.

459
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,519
That's why there was a car accident

460
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,188
The people chasing him are not the police

461
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,067
It should be that group of people.

462
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,695
Robber?

463
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,365
Because he has information he shouldn't know.

464
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,242
That's why, right?

465
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,916
When Captain Cha wakes up, he will be able to figure it out...

466
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,461
What is it?

467
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,216
When will he wake up?

468
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:46,970
Don't know

469
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,764
Could you wait here for a moment?

470
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,016
I'm going to talk to the doctor.

471
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:54,602
Good

472
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,282
Support team on standby

473
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,199
Got it

474
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,340
Even if I don't come back

475
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,717
Continue to implement the plan

476
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,427
What does this mean?

477
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,929
If he tells everything, it's over.

478
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,266
In a hospital full of police officers

479
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,603
It's not easy to shut him up.

480
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,606
It is even more difficult to escape safely.

481
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,399
But if you get caught

482
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,067
What's the point of all this?

483
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,861
As long as our plan can succeed

484
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,324
Even if I have to spend the rest of my life in prison

485
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:51,993
I don't care either

486
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:19,395
What did the doctor say?

487
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,154
He was too badly injured to regain consciousness.

488
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,449
You have to wait at least a few days.

489
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,869
Even if I wake up, there is no guarantee...

490
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,121
Can communicate with people

491
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:38,665
Actually…

492
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:45,588
Although I want to arrest him immediately
Make him become this kind of person

493
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,801
But I've quit the response team.

494
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,011
This is not my jurisdiction.

495
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,597
I really can't do anything

496
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,358
It's not your fault

497
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,402
Captain Che Wuyi

498
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,197
Will wake up soon

499
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,638
Really…

500
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,016
Don't you want me to take you there?

501
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,183
It doesn't matter

502
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,145
The director said he's coming soon, I want to meet him

503
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,125
Is he really a professor?

504
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:09,130
Should we arrest him immediately?

505
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,508
To stop their plan

506
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,010
We have to catch them all

507
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,596
They've been fooling the police.

508
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,889
Playing me around

509
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,516
Now I must think we are all still in the dark

510
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,814
I will definitely make him pay a heavy price

511
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,360
I'm on my way back

512
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,613
Fortunately, Che Wuyi is still in a coma

513
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,741
This road seems to lead to the meeting place.

514
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,951
Is terrorism their goal?

515
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,411
You'll know once you catch him.

516
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,747
I am responsible for this matter

517
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,082
You ask the agency for support

518
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,166
OK, I understand.

519
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,346
Take a break and continue

520
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,098
You keep doing this

521
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,809
You might die earlier than your father.

522
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,105
Stop talking nonsense

523
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,190
Clear up the soil here quickly

524
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,169
He just parked the car

525
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,212
Have we arrived at the base yet?

526
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,634
Check the surrounding terrain and cut off their retreat

527
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,416
No one

528
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:11,919
Suspect vehicle found

529
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,046
The suspect appears to have taken refuge inside the building.

530
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,716
It is estimated that he has many accomplices, so everyone should be careful.

531
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,243
Here it is!

532
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,147
I'm on my way back

533
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,065
(5 minutes ago)

534
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,399
Fortunately, Che Wuyi is still in a coma

535
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,026
More importantly

536
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:19,528
I wasn't in the police car before.
Have you installed a locator?

537
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,239
Yes, what's wrong?

538
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,782
I saw her coming this way.

539
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,453
Could it be…

540
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,104
I told you that guy is a professor.

541
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,188
You mean

542
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,440
He approached you deliberately to steal our information?

543
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,693
-Where is Che Wuyi?
-I'm not sure

544
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,027
But maybe during the investigation

545
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,404
They caught me

546
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,197
In conclusion

547
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,741
You just had the chance to catch him, but you missed the chance, right?

548
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,285
No, I am...

549
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,494
Because I want to catch them all...

550
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:09,745
You have left the response team

551
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,664
You should just give us the information!

552
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:12,999
What’s more…

553
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,671
Besides, you said he is your boyfriend, right?

554
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,047
This is no small matter

555
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,217
Are you saying that I let him go on purpose?

556
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,344
You can explain it slowly during the internal investigation later.

557
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,264
Now I'm going to temporarily suspend you, that's it.

558
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,578
So that woman is doubting you?

559
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,707
No clues related to the police inspector can be left behind.

560
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,625
I think you'll figure it out.

561
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,087
Anyway, the news just came out

562
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,089
They decided to hold the meeting a day earlier.

563
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,553
We also have to...

564
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,181
Step up

565
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,397
You didn't say

566
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,066
Do you want to find a way to survive by yourself?

567
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,611
No, I still want to escape from here.

568
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,251
You're gone, it's time to change shifts

569
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,544
What are you here for?

570
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,926
Do you know how to dig?

571
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,471
In order to survive, is there anything you can't do?

572
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:53,432
Do you really think

573
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,267
The professor will harm us

574
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,520
Are all of them dead?

575
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:00,689
I don't know.

576
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:03,651
How do I know if he will stab us in the back?

577
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,195
You too

578
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,989
Stop thinking the professor will help you.

579
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,574
Wait until this tunnel is dug through.

580
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,660
Take your dad out right now.

581
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,204
It's so annoying, so naive

582
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:20,876
Tokyo Says

583
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,004
When we need to change our plans

584
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:28,008
I just imagined our escape in my mind

585
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,093
Like a movie

586
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,138
What next?

587
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,434
In the end we all died

588
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,069
Rio

589
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,238
I'm talking about you

590
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,657
Wait until this tunnel is dug through.

591
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,869
You go first

592
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:00,833
Among Us

593
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,960
You are the youngest

594
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,256
And your family is waiting for you.

595
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,800
What about you, asshole?

596
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,678
Oh, damn.

597
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:14,805
Me

598
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,141
I have to take care of my dad here

599
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,145
And if I leave the others behind and run away

600
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,189
He will definitely be beaten to death by that old man.

601
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,235
Go away, you little bastard.

602
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,739
You are a weakling who has never served in the army.

603
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,616
I just don't know how to use a shovel.

604
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,802
So you either get shot or you get killed.

605
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:56,639
Or maybe he was beaten to death by his dad, is that what you mean?

606
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,474
“Unity brings life

607
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,851
If we separate, we will die", you know?

608
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,978
Haven't you heard this? Idiot!

609
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,525
Hey, do you know who said this?

610
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,609
Damn

611
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:13,364
Admiral Yi Sun-sin, right?

612
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,909
Former President Syngman Rhee!

613
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,620
And he ran away after saying this.

614
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,581
"Death is life

615
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,500
You must live and die”

616
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,585
This is what General Yi Sun-sin said, you fool

617
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,003
This is so cool

618
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:33,467
If you want to live, you will die

619
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:36,679
If you want to die, you can live

620
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,347
A bunch of bastards!

621
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,654
Did you hear that?

622
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,201
Who's that over there?

623
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,327
Did you hear that?

624
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,662
I heard it!

625
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:02,955
Dig it through quickly!

626
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,957
Oh my god! Shit!

627
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:06,709
Rio

628
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,295
Damn, Rio, we’re going to dig through it!

629
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,546
Wow, that’s great work!

630
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:11,463
Hey, wait!

631
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,257
Hello!

632
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,217
Moscow!

633
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,428
He was shot in Moscow!

634
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,513
The situation is critical

635
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,764
Don't worry

636
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,683
Once the tunnel is dug, we will treat him.

637
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,059
We will be ready

638
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,269
-Okay!
-Okay!

639
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:28,022
-Okay, thank you!
-Oh my God, there is help!

640
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,457
（Police District Map）

641
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:58,427
You said you had to give the gun back.

642
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,221
I thought you were on vacation

643
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,895
This is where Captain Cha had a car accident

644
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,065
After the professor came out of the hospital

645
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,775
The car is heading this way

646
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,402
In this case

647
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,613
Their secret base

648
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:18,864
Between these two points

649
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,283
In this area

650
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:23,827
There

651
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,747
There is a new shopping mall

652
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,915
Very good

653
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,542
- Really?
-Yes

654
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,672
The surveillance camera over there must have just been installed properly.

655
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:41,929
Are you going out?

656
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,390
But Min-ah is almost back

657
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,599
You guys can have dinner.

658
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,104
Take good care of yourself

659
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:51,689
You know that, right?

660
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,941
You are the head of our family

661
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,993
Uncle, please wake up

662
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:08,580
Are you okay?

663
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:14,962
Go call Denver

664
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:17,798
Fast

665
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,851
This…

666
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,269
What is this?

667
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:38,110
We are saved!

668
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:39,361
Choose the best!

669
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,197
Weishan, come and see

670
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:49,163
Oshan

671
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,623
Look, look here

672
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:53,584
We're almost there

673
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,544
We are saved!

674
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,508
Go check it out

675
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,488
Sorry

676
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:24,865
Are you more sober?

677
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:26,950
Wife

678
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:29,745
I…

679
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:33,415
I'm sorry

680
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,376
Didn’t you say that?

681
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,212
Our Selection

682
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,924
Will become exactly like me

683
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:44,885
I…

684
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,763
In order to prevent him from doing this

685
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,433
Fighting for my life

686
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,311
No

687
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:57,648
Zexiu is a good child

688
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,484
Very manly and reliable

689
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,238
Really?

690
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,450
Didn't I lead him astray?

691
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:10,994
He is a good kid

692
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:12,746
It's all thanks to you

693
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,290
Thank you

694
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:24,758
Dad, what's wrong with you?

695
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,510
Wake up!

696
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,095
Dad...

697
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,180
Dad, I'm here, okay?

698
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,182
I'm here, look at me

699
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,435
-Dad
- Let me take a look

700
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,478
Let me see

701
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:39,106
You should think of a solution quickly

702
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,858
Damn it, Dad.

703
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,192
Rio

704
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,945
Rio, you better think of a solution quickly!

705
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,159
A big man

706
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:54,538
Why are you crying here?

707
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:56,915
Dad

708
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,126
Are you awake?

709
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,210
Yeah

710
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,295
Dad

711
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:02,212
Me

712
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:05,132
I dug the tunnel, did you hear me?

713
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:08,927
Really?

714
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:09,845
Really

715
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:12,264
Thank you for your hard work

716
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,182
We are now

717
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:16,351
Everything will be fine as long as you escape, okay?

718
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:18,979
Let's go

719
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,275
Choose the best

720
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,360
After you go out

721
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,197
Be good

722
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:32,117
Take care of our goodness

723
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,286
You…

724
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,413
If you dare to hurt her heart

725
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,082
I will definitely…

726
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,668
I will beat you to death

727
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,922
Okay, I won't hurt her feelings.

728
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:54,014
I love you

729
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,270
I also...

730
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:01,521
I love you too

731
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,357
I love you

732
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,274
So

733
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:07,110
Can you please cheer up and hold on a little longer?

734
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:13,325
I have never once in my life

735
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,204
Digging holes like this is fun

736
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,208
It's all thanks to you

737
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:25,462
I'm old and useless

738
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:27,214
Selecting talents is also a waste of time

739
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,092
You treat us as family.

740
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:33,637
Thank you

741
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:38,308
It's too late to introduce myself

742
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:41,853
I…

743
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:45,315
Wu Wanshi

744
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,861
Wu Wan…

745
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:53,073
Knowledge

746
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:35,824
Dad...

747
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:37,951
Dad

748
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,329
Dad, what's wrong with you?

749
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:45,584
Dad, can you open your eyes?

750
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,045
Dad, you can't close your eyes

751
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,464
Dad, wake up!

752
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,466
Come on, Dad!

753
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,260
I dug all the tunnels.

754
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:56,845
Uncle

755
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:01,433
Now we just need to get out of here.

756
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,393
Dad...

757
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,897
How could this happen?

758
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,110
Dad

759
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:35,926
Why is the atmosphere like this?

760
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,469
Are you remembering now?

761
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:39,888
Just enough to save some electricity

762
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,724
Grandpa suggested lighting candles during Qingming Festival

763
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:02,244
I'll just come alone.

764
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:03,453
You go take a rest

765
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,081
No

766
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,375
My old man

767
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:09,960
I hate seeing...

768
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,254
I'm lazy

769
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:17,801
Let's listen to Mr. Wu Wanshi

770
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,095
Get out of here now

771
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:23,390
Live a happy life

772
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,255
To be honest

773
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,591
This is my first time
I saw someone die in front of me.

774
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,677
But his expression looks so peaceful

775
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:03,180
If I hadn't met the professor

776
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:04,848
Everyone will live well

777
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:06,349
What's going on?

778
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:11,062
When I first met the professor

779
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:15,442
He is my friend who robbed the loan shark with me

780
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:17,694
The day he was shot and killed

781
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,864
Her final expression

782
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:22,699
I can't forget it at all

783
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:25,911
I don't want to see that expression again

784
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,581
That's why I joined the professor's plan.

785
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:32,500
How did you meet?

786
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:35,503
She was the first friend I made after I came to South Korea.

787
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,215
We work as waiters in a restaurant

788
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,509
I saw her eating the leftovers from the guests.

789
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,595
I stared at her

790
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:45,680
She handed it to me and asked me if I wanted it.

791
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:48,850
Wow, you guys are real friends.

792
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:52,020
Is she also North Korean?

793
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:52,938
No

794
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:56,733
She is South Korean

795
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,365
After my father died

796
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,992
I completely consider myself a South Korean

797
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,119
In this world where money is everything

798
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:10,455
I'll sell everything for success

799
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:12,707
The last thing I sold

800
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,168
It is the conscience of being a scholar

801
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,921
Our group will provide capital and teach you...

802
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:20,799
Just help develop an economic cooperation model

803
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:22,509
Your research

804
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,469
Will be the key to the unification of the Korean Peninsula

805
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:28,390
But my plan to accelerate unification

806
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:30,517
It's just a way for them to make money

807
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,185
The last piece of land

808
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,854
It has become a huge springboard for the rich to take advantage of opportunities.

809
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,986
An ordinary girl who likes Korean pop music

810
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,320
Why I became a robber

811
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,698
The reason why your friend died so tragically

812
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,950
Maybe it's my responsibility.

813
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,204
It's all because of those bastards, right?

814
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:54,874
They are the real thieves

815
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:57,127
We still have time

816
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:58,962
Can also stop them

817
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,423
Get back the future they stole

818
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,721
Okay, I know this is very important.

819
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,307
But is it really necessary to gamble your life like this?

820
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:14,019
Is it necessary to go through life and death like this?

821
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:17,355
The reason why I risked my life to come back

822
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,482
Not just for this

823
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,276
What else?

824
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,111
You and I

825
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,071
The road to take is different

826
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,990
Because of our origin and background

827
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,284
The environments we grew up in are very different.

828
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,369
But as Moscow says

829
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,955
We are already a family

830
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:35,832
I think the professor must also...

831
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:37,792
Sorry to interrupt you.

832
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,463
I have to dig a tunnel.

833
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,840
Otherwise, that idiot in Denver is going to go crazy again.

834
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:47,844
I'll listen to you next time.

835
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:07,864
When we first came in here

836
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:11,368
I really don't like you guys.

837
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,285
Me too

838
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,624
Because of our life experiences

839
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:20,460
The reasons for needing money are different.

840
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,755
But all the way to today

841
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,425
Now I don't care about those

842
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:29,886
I'm starting to like you guys

843
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,140
So what I want to say is…

844
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,058
Okay

845
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,227
Don't tell those corny nonsense

846
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:38,937
We also know

847
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:39,979
Rio, right?

848
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:41,731
It's annoying

849
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,111
Good

850
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,906
Even though our reasons for coming here are different

851
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,534
But today we are leaving here together

852
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:57,122
Good

853
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:58,957
Then let’s take action

854
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:10,301
This is the third time
The venue of the final North-South economic cooperation talks

855
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:12,053
Peace Square near Peace Hotel

856
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:14,347
I heard that the meeting will be held one day earlier

857
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,224
People gathered at the scene

858
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:17,684
Many people believe that this meeting

859
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:20,728
Will be a great help to the Korean Peninsula, which is about to be unified
Lay the foundation for economic development

860
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,439
Took to the streets to express support

861
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,276
(The paper house is ours)

862
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,529
(Traitors Kim Sang-man and Jeon Yong-soo, get out!)

863
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,407
-Kim Sang-man!
-Kim Sang-man!

864
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:34,784
Some of the people

865
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,454
Agree with the robbers who occupied the Mint

866
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:40,665
Launch a demonstration to demand an immediate end to the talks

867
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,001
Kim Sang Man!

868
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,420
Song Xuanhao?

869
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:47,922
Is he the professor?

870
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,592
He must have faked suicide.

871
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:52,385
And planned this robbery

872
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:54,053
No wonder

873
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,639
Really interesting

874
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,308
What should the Mint do?

875
00:57:58,391 --> 00:57:59,392
Anyway

876
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:02,270
The meeting ended with just taking photos and signing autographs.

877
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:04,147
Once the talks were over, the offensive was launched

878
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:10,153
I understand

879
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,364
Also

880
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,159
The goal of the operation

881
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:17,202
Not arresting them

882
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:19,412
Instead, they should shoot and kill everyone.

883
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:30,131
Member of Parliament

884
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,341
He is here

885
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,725
Member of Parliament, please say a word

886
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:46,022
The atmosphere in the square was just as we expected.

887
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:47,357
Good

888
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,068
I'm going down

889
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:51,444
I…

890
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,256
What? You think you can fool me forever?

891
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,717
This area is surrounded

892
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,177
Don't waste your energy on tricks.

893
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:18,805
I think you're acting alone

894
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,640
Because you didn't arrest me right away

895
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,768
Is there anything you would like to ask me privately?

896
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:29,983
Don't move

897
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,277
What do you want to know?

898
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:35,154
The speeches that have been used to incite public opinion so far

899
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,158
Are they all lies?

900
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:42,120
Is it to escape from here during the chaos?

901
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:43,288
Is that all?

902
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,045
Blindly follow the road paved in front of you

903
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:52,630
It is easy to be confused

904
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:55,883
You have to let yourself get lost

905
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:59,053
Because this is the only way to change the status quo

906
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,514
Try saying something nonsense again.

907
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,308
I'll shoot you in the head right now

908
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:06,894
You are right

909
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,939
We need to take advantage of the chaos

910
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:12,817
Get away from here

911
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,736
What are the unifying things?

912
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:16,946
Is this all bullshit?

913
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,949
The things you wrote in your hideout

914
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:24,037
Is that what Berlin said in front of the media?

915
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:24,954
No

916
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:29,417
That's the real reason we decided to do this.

917
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:31,586
What?

918
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:32,712
My late father

919
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,048
I was a construction technician in North Korea

920
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,634
He carried out secret missions under the orders of the Party.

921
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:41,179
That is, after the Cold War between Korea and South Korea ended
Close the old tunnel

922
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:45,933
My father followed orders and sealed almost all the tunnels.

923
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:47,685
Only one of them remains

924
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,523
Zhonghao's condition is getting worse

925
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,984
He knew there was no cure in North Korea.

926
01:00:55,693 --> 01:00:58,488
But he was discovered by the party before he could escape, so...

927
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,782
You got separated when you escaped from North Korea at the Yalu River?

928
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,202
I know all this

929
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:07,413
What's important is what comes next

930
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:10,541
In order to rescue Zhonghao, a large sum of money is needed.

931
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:11,709
So my father...

932
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:13,086
Run to rob a bank

933
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:15,672
Then he died

934
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:18,633
Do you think you are the only one with a tragic story?

935
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:20,093
That’s the problem!

936
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,136
At that time, I thought that all this was a tragedy

937
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,888
It's all because of the division of the country.

938
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:26,933
But until now, these tragedies continue to happen!

939
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,059
Why?

940
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:32,188
Because those who are greedy for money
A bastard who is willing to sell out his country!

941
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,148
Stop talking bullshit!

942
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:36,150
Conferences currently being held outside

943
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:38,528
Not for real unification or economic cooperation

944
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,322
It was the thieves who wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to make a fortune.

945
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:43,950
What a trick!

946
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:46,494
How can you be sure?

947
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,329
What is your basis?

948
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:50,123
Capital flows to earn profits

949
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:52,125
If these benefits are guaranteed by the state

950
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,376
Unification can significantly advance

951
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:55,420
Large companies can also use quantitative easing as a financial leverage

952
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:57,797
Maximize benefits and create a win-win situation!

953
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,133
You ask me how can I be sure this will happen?

954
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,970
Because I was the one who came up with this plan.

955
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:07,265
What?

956
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:09,183
Chairman Wu Caiyun of Five Star Group

957
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:13,062
And the politicians who received his support

958
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,649
- Could it be...
-Yes

959
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:17,984
It just so happens

960
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:20,027
That person is your ex-husband Kim Sang-man

961
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:24,407
I'm going to steal the money from their pockets

962
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:26,117
Let the world know who the real thief is

963
01:02:26,617 --> 01:02:28,578
But then you're still a thief!

964
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:30,079
Once I leave here

965
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:33,249
I will spread my share of the money in the city center

966
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:35,126
Just check the serial number of the money

967
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:37,628
People will know that what we say is true.

968
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:40,256
Sorry, this won't happen.

969
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:45,762
If you are arrested here

970
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:49,056
I will die at the hands of Kim Sang-man

971
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:52,643
You knew this, so you came here alone, right?

972
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,188
Even if I die

973
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:59,108
How do we print so much money in the Mint?

974
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:00,943
And what kind of money is that?

975
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:05,072
We must also let the world know

976
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:09,452
Please

977
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:13,539
Are you serious?

978
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,500
I will never again...

979
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:18,711
I don't want to deceive you anymore

980
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:21,422
My feelings for you

981
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,175
It's all true

982
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:28,471
Stop lying.

983
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:32,266
You approached me in the first place just to use me!

984
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:34,393
That was indeed the case at the beginning

985
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:37,688
I should hold on to the end

986
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:42,652
But I can't do it

987
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:56,082
Sorry

988
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:02,143
