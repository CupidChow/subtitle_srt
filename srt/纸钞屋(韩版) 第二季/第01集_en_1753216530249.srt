NETFLIX series

2
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,446
When the Korean Peninsula was still in the Cold War

3
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:33,199
For double agents

4
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,909
The name Che Wuhe is like the god of death.

5
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,211
They walked towards the Chinese Embassy

6
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,171
Stop

7
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,875
You guys stay here, I'll handle it.

8
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,376
Yes

9
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,841
Comrade, forgive me

10
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,176
Is that what I taught you?

11
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,888
Have you gained weight around your waist? You are not as agile as before

12
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,598
Comrade

13
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,559
Spare my life

14
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,646
This is the last sentence he left before he died?

15
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,279
The era of division is over

16
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,119
Say it again

17
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,997
I heard that an agreement has been reached.

18
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,541
Little chess pieces like us

19
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,877
It will be discarded after use!

20
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:01,389
For the sake of our old friendship
I wanted you to die less painfully.

21
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,110
You bastard!

22
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,290
But it is well known

23
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,792
The double agent was telling the truth

24
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,338
(Ministry of Security of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea)

25
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,302
Our Department
Will become an organization that never existed

26
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,390
What is my future mission?

27
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:45,767
Mission?

28
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,977
Be a security guard or something like that

29
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,814
(Smoking causes erectile dysfunction)

30
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,776
No thanks

31
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,325
What appeared before Wu He was the flame of the new era

32
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:03,785
In that flame

33
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,121
His life's hard work is burning

34
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:26,826
Hello

35
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,834
Who are you?

36
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,463
Your last visit
The Bureau of Printing and Printing's tent against the team, right?

37
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:40,798
Oh, you are...

38
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,509
Yuzhen’s colleague, right?

39
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,386
My name is Che Wuhe

40
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,985
-She's here
-Please say a few words about the current situation

41
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,445
Please say something

42
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,452
Where is Captain Che?

43
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,413
According to North Korean officials
He said last night that he was going out to investigate something.

44
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,414
What are you investigating late at night?

45
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,416
That's not clear

46
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,169
What on earth are you trying to say by gathering all these people together so early in the morning?

47
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,255
What does this look like?

48
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,092
I have blurry vision lately

49
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,301
What is this?

50
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,640
-This is…
-It's a hundred thousand yuan note.

51
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,725
Yes, it's money.

52
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,605
The robbers were printing money inside.

53
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,240
Captain Xuan often mentions you

54
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,034
Yuzhen?

55
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,536
Tell her to come here often

56
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,872
I've always wanted to come and see this

57
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:58,084
I just happened to see you walk into the store when I was leaving get off work.

58
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,838
This place has not officially opened yet.

59
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,551
Am I being disrespectful?

60
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,928
I came in when I was hungry.

61
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,555
No, that's not the case.

62
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:14,475
Since you are Yuzhen's colleague, you are my honored guest.

63
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,603
So…

64
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,692
What should we prepare for you?

65
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:25,945
(Captain Xuan Yuzhen)

66
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:41,502
He doesn’t answer?

67
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,379
Yes

68
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,338
So

69
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,592
To let us know that the robbers are printing money inside

70
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,385
So the hostages slipped this to us?

71
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,928
But how is this possible?

72
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,848
Can the money in it be printed out so casually?

73
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,016
What about the serial number?

74
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,852
Even if it is printed
But it can obviously be tracked.

75
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,812
Since there is a professional hacker inside

76
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,356
Then there is another
It is no surprise that he is an expert on paper money.

77
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,901
I don't know their specific operations.

78
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:11,032
But at least it explains
Why do they seem to be stalling?

79
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,995
If this is the real purpose of the robbers
So what is important to us is

80
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,081
Completely change the response method

81
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,583
Officer Xuan, wait a moment.

82
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,710
In case what you said is true

83
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:25,296
This is beyond what we can handle.

84
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,131
Report to your superiors first

85
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,176
Then figure out
Can robbers really circulate printed money?

86
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,677
Should we confirm this with the banknote printing authority first?

87
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,805
Let me first check the power consumption inside the Banknote Printing Bureau.

88
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:35,806
Good

89
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,059
I will report to my superiors as soon as possible for confirmation.

90
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,436
You are ready. We will act when they give the order.

91
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,854
Good

92
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,690
These bastards really caused a big mess

93
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,985
They should be smelling the new money now.
Are you happy?

94
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,070
Let them have some fun first

95
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,990
The happiness won't last long

96
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,675
It seems you are really hungry

97
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,677
Wow, this is really delicious.

98
99
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,598
It's been more than two months
Why hasn't it officially opened yet?

99
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,350
Business will definitely be booming.

100
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,444
Maybe I didn’t do enough market research.

101
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,946
I heard that our coffee

102
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,074
A bit more bitter than the coffee North Koreans drink

103
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,867
Oh, you mean Sambo Coffee?

104
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,161
It tastes similar to Korean instant coffee

105
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,246
Yes

106
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,874
I'm thinking about changing the atmosphere and menu of the store.

107
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:48,004
Where is the bathroom?

108
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,757
The bathroom? It's over there.

109
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,751
The bathroom is not here

110
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:10,961
Is that so?

111
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,298
What is this room used for?

112
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,591
This is my private space

113
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,390
What is this?

114
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,688
For a man in his forties
It's a blushing hobby

115
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,273
Let's go down

116
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:32,775
Good

117
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,423
This is the Economic Cooperation Zone Scientific Investigation Team

118
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,634
I am responsible
Captain Cha Moo-hyuk of the North Korean Security Department in the Banknote Printing Bureau case

119
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,302
Can fingerprint recognition be performed now?

120
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,222
If a case has already been filed, then it is possible.

121
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:05,349
It's urgent, please.

122
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,439
Is this your grandson? So cute.

123
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,691
It’s only been a hundred days, right?

124
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:57,985
How do you know so much?

125
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,946
Do you have children?

126
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,533
How is that possible?

127
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,826
Look at my figure

128
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,246
The mother of the child can't have such curves

129
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,087
Don't worry

130
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,465
You will be out with your family soon.

131
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,591
Really?

132
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,343
I won't lie about this.

133
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:31,727
Leading to

134
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,062
Ouch

135
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,941
The Land of Happiness

136
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:38,692
Together towards

137
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,238
Happiness

138
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,615
You drank too much that day

139
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,200
Didn’t you cry and want to see your mother?

140
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,827
How could this be possible?

141
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,787
Don't say such crazy things

142
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,455
Hey, come in quickly.

143
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,581
Hello

144
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,337
Are you the new security guard?

145
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,214
Can you do the job?

146
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,170
(The Blood-Drinking Bird)

147
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,425
What do you do?

148
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,135
Are you reading a book?

149
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,179
The monitoring team was lazy and not on duty.

150
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,056
I am here to monitor

151
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,060
Isn't it because
You came here because you miss the position of captain?

152
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,478
This position is more comfortable to sit in

153
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,565
Actually, I

154
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,692
Prefer to sit on the stone slab

155
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,084
Fortunately, we evacuated in time

156
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,254
The police seem to not care whether we live or die, right?

157
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:24,590
Who knows?

158
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,426
You didn't intend to save people from the beginning, right?

159
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,058
Back to the point

160
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,145
Even if the Director of the Banknote Printing Bureau knew about it in advance
How did she know?

161
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,440
Know what?

162
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,610
The special forces soldier named Park Cheol-woo or something

163
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:45,945
Conduct covert operations

164
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,906
How did she know this?

165
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,240
I just don't understand

166
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,995
Should I have told her in advance?

167
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,582
She is not an ordinary child

168
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,585
She is the daughter of the American ambassador.

169
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,837
VIP among VIPs

170
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,130
Do you have any basis for what you said?

171
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,008
She was the one who told me that we needed to move the hostages.

172
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,177
She must be feeling guilty.

173
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,680
It doesn't matter whether we live or die

174
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,974
Noble people must live.

175
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,141
Isn't that what it means?

176
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,018
Say less

177
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,566
Korean Peninsula Unified Banknote Printing Bureau

178
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,735
The hostage situation lasted for a long time

179
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,530
How will the South Korean and North Korean governments resolve this incident?

180
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,657
Attracting worldwide attention

181
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,451
Foreign media reports and analysis

182
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,997
So far, the two countries' response measures seem inadequate.

183
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:41,875
Ambassador's current status...

184
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,877
My daughter has been in there for days!

185
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,505
Please calm down first.

186
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,090
Don’t you have a daughter too?

187
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,925
If it were you, would you be able to stay calm?

188
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,468
I totally understand

189
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,596
So I do this
It is to prevent the police from saying...

190
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,682
Don't give me the cold shoulder

191
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:59,518
As long as my Annie has one less hair

192
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,021
Don’t even think about holding an economic cooperation zone summit!

193
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,397
Ambassador

194
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,567
Is there any connection between the summit and the Bureau of Printing and Banknotes incident?

195
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,068
Councillor Kim

196
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,696
The Director of the CIA was my classmate at Brown University

197
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,781
Listen to that friend

198
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:17,244
Mr. Wu and you
I plan to take this opportunity to make some money.

199
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,663
-This is...
-That's it!

200
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,373
Please tell Mr. Wu

201
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:26,003
If anything happens to Anne
You guys can't take a penny.

202
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,314
Is he angry?

203
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,816
It seems that we can no longer suppress it by force.

204
206
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,573
I have a wide network of contacts.
I just heard something

205
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,744
Those despicable robbers

206
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,496
Printing money in the Banknote Printing Bureau

207
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,791
What? How is this possible...

208
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,209
Me

209
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,586
Just to develop the land in North Korea

210
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:11,048
How much money was scattered on the barren land?

211
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,385
Besides, in order to make you, the congressman, become president
How much did I spend?

212
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,678
If this money is wasted

213
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,848
Then the deal between us is gone.

214
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,813
That's what he said, but look at his attitude

215
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,273
We can't just go our own way.

216
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,526
So what is so difficult about it?

217
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,529
Isn't it enough to just solve his daughter's problem?

218
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,594
Confirmed power consumption

219
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,263
Obviously, the printing press was started.

220
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,141
What does it say above?

221
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,976
Oh, I've reported it.

222
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,312
They said we should discuss countermeasures first, since this is a serious case.

223
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,690
What?

224
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:11,567
What about the serial number?

225
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,527
Have you confirmed whether it can be circulated?

226
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,281
This is just to confirm

227
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,869
Are we allowed to work or not?

228
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,080
Let's put that aside for now.

229
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,667
Instructions from above to temporarily stop monitoring of the Banknote Printing Bureau's communications

230
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:31,962
What are you talking about?

231
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,548
Why the sudden pause?

232
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,885
Alas, many people protested against this.

233
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,386
Just do it anyway

234
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,847
What kind of logic is this?

235
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,974
Since it is a major case
Why do we have to tie our hands?

236
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,060
Captain, outside...

237
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,944
Warning to the robbers who illegally occupied the Bank of Printing

238
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:00,616
As a citizen

239
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,367
Also a member of the parliament of the Republic of Korea

240
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,037
I, Jin Shangwan, sternly warn you

241
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,123
In this union of north and south

242
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,168
A moment towards harmony and growth

243
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,794
History will never tolerate

244
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:18,383
Terrorist acts of violence and incitement to conflict

245
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,220
Please let the kind citizens who are held hostage

246
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,889
Return to their families

247
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,183
Even if one of you

248
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:29,228
I can understand the feelings of the families gathered here.

249
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,687
Please take action

250
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:31,939
Courage

251
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,608
For the robbers who can cooperate to calm the situation

252
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,986
We guarantee full exemption

253
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,157
As a party representative, I will make suggestions to the president

254
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,993
If there is such a desire

255
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,579
-Please contact me
-Take a quick shot!

256
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,332
- I'll help you
-No entry!

257
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,337
Captain Che, where are you?

258
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,048
Member Kim Sang-man asked us to stop monitoring

259
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,967
And sent a persuasive broadcast to the robbers

260
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:00,884
Please come back soon

261
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,184
Damn

262
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,936
Who would be convinced by such words?

263
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,690
Asking someone to contact you without giving them a number

264
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,941
That's right

265
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,193
On the hostages' cell phones
Could something have been installed?

266
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,032
Oh, there is a possibility

267
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,911
These bastards have so many tricks up their sleeves.

268
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,664
Are they stupid?

269
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,458
You are stupid

270
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:38,672
Yeah

271
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,925
It was too noisy outside so I just watched it.

272
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,886
But no one cares

273
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,222
Are you calling just for this?

274
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,142
You are intercepting
Cha Wuhe’s cell phone calls and text messages?

275
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,060
Yeah, you told me to do this.

276
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,104
I need you to do something for me right now

277
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,127
(Economic Cooperation Zone Police Department)

278
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:35,562
Is it okay?

279
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,274
What?

280
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,902
Previously on TV

281
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:45,447
Are they your parents?

282
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,788
-Did the professor tell you that?
-No

283
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,581
I can tell from your expression.

284
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,091
What? Are you afraid that I will betray you?

285
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:05,759
No

286
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,929
Didn’t you say you wanted to earn enough money to buy an island?

287
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,609
-Where are you going?
- Go to the bathroom

288
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,090
“I’m staying here”

289
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,633
She should be given an award

290
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:49,594
I heard the teacher talking to others.

291
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,639
She said the policeman started looking for her as soon as he came in.

292
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,474
Think about it

293
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,560
We are held hostage
Isn’t it because I’m in the same class with her?

294
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:57,811
That's right.

295
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:59,521
Her father is a prominent figure.

296
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,275
Don't pay attention to them

297
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,243
Thank you

298
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:15,787
I said Annie

299
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,039
You're at least close to me, right?

300
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,960
If the police come and only rescue you

301
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,045
Can you take me with you?

302
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,465
I want to go home so badly

303
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,507
Okay, I promise this.

304
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,844
As a trade, you have to do one thing for us.

305
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,162
(I'll help you escape)

306
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,123
(1:00pm, underground safe A02
Don’t be late if you come alone)

307
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:54,010
“Because the police are incompetent
Member Kim Sang-wan personally took action

308
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,972
Is he really a candidate for the next presidential election?"

309
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,477
I'm still wondering
Why is he so passionate all of a sudden?

310
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,145
It turns out that there are plans

311
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,147
No

312
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,192
He is so actively involved

313
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,237
There must be another reason

314
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,784
-Have you received a response from the Ministry of Finance?
-Yes

315
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,578
Just received it but...

316
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,495
What's wrong?

317
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,331
The money of the Banknote Printing Bureau is issued according to the annual issuance plan

318
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,833
Has a fixed serial number

319
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,419
This shows that the robbers cannot just print and distribute them.

320
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:29,421
Generally speaking, this is the case

321
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,048
What about the general situation? What about the exceptional situation?

322
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:36,344
After this economic cooperation summit
A certain amount is planned to be issued additionally

323
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,971
This amount is enough...

324
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,181
(4 trillion won)

325
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,641
How many zeros are there?

326
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,024
So I can't trust the police.

327
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,277
We have to make our own living

328
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:54,738
But

329
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,074
What can we do?

330
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,410
But then again

331
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,414
Director, you also knew in advance that this mess would happen.
Isn’t it?

332
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,000
Why didn't you stop it when you knew it?

333
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,336
I advised you that it was dangerous.

334
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,630
But they don't listen to me

335
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,175
Go ask the policeman.

336
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,718
Ask me if what I said is true

337
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,179
I don't know where he's been held.

338
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:20,972
How can I ask?

339
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,099
What? Hello, Chief Cui

340
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,560
Talk to me with respect.

341
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,478
Hello!

342
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,105
What are you doing?

343
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,683
This is not a small amount of money, this is four trillion

344
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,434
This amount is in accordance with the unknown serial number

345
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,145
Already allocated to the unified fund

346
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,106
Rather than circulating in the market

347
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,109
This means that the robbers can print and take away the banknotes at will.

348
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:15,694
You knew this, didn’t you?

349
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,612
That's why you insisted on participating in this matter

350
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,489
Our divorce process was the same.

351
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,866
You just like to keep dragging it out

352
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,414
If I come forward and solve this matter as soon as possible
You'll have to thank me then.

353
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,211
Could it be that among the robbers
Has anyone contacted you after watching your broadcast?

354
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,965
You don't need to know this
Go and prepare for the aftermath.

355
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,426
It would be better to suppress it as soon as possible.

356
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,553
National events are just around the corner
What happened?

357
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,681
Post-processing? What does that mean?

358
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:47,517
-Don't you know that you can't suppress it by force?
-What's wrong? What's going on?

359
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,227
Are you talking about the safety of the hostages again?

360
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,938
Isn’t it because of the American ambassador’s daughter?

361
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,615
You asked the robbers to transfer Annie out?

362
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,326
This

363
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:08,747
Even so

364
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,458
Will those weak police officers take action immediately?

365
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,461
If this is not the case

366
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,048
No way

367
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,968
Are you crazy? Stop it now!

368
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,598
If you give up custody of Min-ah

369
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,433
I can think about it

370
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,548
Connect this call directly to the professor

371
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,883
Right now

372
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,557
What happened suddenly?

373
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,268
Although there were many unexpected events in the middle

374
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:15,271
But I think we have reached some consensus

375
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:16,689
What?

376
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,860
Can't anyone die at this point?

377
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:21,778
Yes

378
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,488
Listen to me

379
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,700
There is a traitor among you robbers

380
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,037
Although I don't know who he is

381
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,873
But he wanted to kill Anne.

382
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:58,606
Where is Annie?

383
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:00,608
Haven't you seen Annie?

384
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:04,821
Search

385
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:15,290
Where the hell did that little one go?

386
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,332
What?

387
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,710
Is there anyone else who was bought by that crappy radio?

388
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,837
It's not important now

389
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,131
Let's find Annie first.

390
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,758
You've got to keep an eye on them, right?

391
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:27,468
Let's go

392
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,514
It seems something happened

393
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,976
Hey, is it to transfer that girl out?

394
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,936
What the hell is going on outside?

395
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,822
Annie is missing. Come out quickly.

396
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,372
Where have you been?

397
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,242
Be good, got it?

398
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:51,094
You didn’t find it and you can’t see it from the surveillance video?

399
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,178
Check this out

400
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,639
This was taken 20 minutes ago.

401
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,975
Took the bomb from the storage room and went out

402
00:32:58,643 --> 00:32:59,852
Bomb?

403
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,938
Who is it?

404
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,440
See which direction it moves

405
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,488
Wait a minute here

406
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,323
This direction is weird.

407
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,075
Back a little bit

408
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,791
Put a bomb in the safe

409
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:26,796
Damn

410
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,409
-Nothing new?
-Not yet

411
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,953
Are you crazy? Why tell the robbers?

412
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,123
Are we going to watch the casualties happen?

413
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,001
Do you feel you are not responsible if something goes wrong?

414
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:13,926
No!

415
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:19,599
Damn

416
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,520
Something seems to have exploded?

417
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,189
Be quiet!

418
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,322
Didn't you hear any sound?

419
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:43,748
Where is Annie?

420
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:48,127
-What is going on?
-Nothing bad will happen to Anne, right?

421
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,254
I don’t know how to go back to your place!

422
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,006
Hurry up!

423
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,594
Anne!

424
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:02,767
Are you okay?

425
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,062
Where have you been?

426
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:08,356
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay? Are you okay?

427
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,149
-What's going on?
-Are you okay?

428
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:13,903
She said someone handed her a note.
It said that they would help her get out of this situation and let her get to the vault.

429
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,492
This is what Helsinki picked up in front of the exhibition hall

430
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,452
I've been monitoring it.

431
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:22,703
Just when I'm not paying attention

432
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,456
Where is the surveillance video?

433
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,834
You can’t find who it is even after searching everywhere?

434
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:31,003
It should be a clever way to go into the blind spot.

435
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:32,672
Directions cannot be connected

436
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,007
If we were one of us

437
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,802
You must know the location of the camera

438
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,805
Damn it!

439
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,765
Which bastard is this?

440
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,935
Don’t you know that people who lose their temper are the most suspicious?

441
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,354
What?

442
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,149
-It can't be you?
-Okay, stop!

443
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,442
Isn't it okay if no one dies?

444
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,990
Oh shit

445
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,576
It's clear one of us is a traitor

446
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,580
When the seeds of doubt began to spread between us

447
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:09,750
The hostages rallied around Anne who had returned.

448
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:13,713
I told you to get away by yourself, but you didn’t leave?

449
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,341
I went there

450
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:21,220
I couldn't stay there for even a minute.

451
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,098
But the thought of me running away alone

452
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,766
I feel bad.

453
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:29,604
Didn't you realize it was a trap?

454
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:31,939
OK

455
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,901
I'm worried if I go out alone

456
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:38,279
Are the people here more dangerous?

457
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,158
I don't know, I just feel embarrassed.

458
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:45,912
As she said

459
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:47,830
I am also ashamed

460
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,917
Now is the time for everyone to work together

461
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,502
We are divided into South Korea and North Korea

462
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,629
Now we shouldn't do this

463
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,881
It seems safer than ours.

464
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,217
The police are more concerned about resolving the situation as quickly as possible.

465
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,219
The robbers said
As long as we cooperate, we will be safe

466
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,137
But you can’t believe this anymore, can you?

467
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:04,639
How to say it

468
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,475
What you said makes sense

469
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,436
Are we going to join hands in rebellion?

470
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,939
You can't always go bare-handed

471
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,899
Against those guys with guns?

472
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,317
Also

473
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,445
It's fortunate that no one was injured.

474
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,328
Let's go

475
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,205
Thank you for your hard work

476
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,171
Actually, I have another reason to come back.

477
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,592
Guards and North Korean police

478
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,928
I know where they are being held.

479
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:54,563
Professor?

480
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:57,024
We felt a vibration inside
What's going on?

481
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,192
No big deal

482
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,027
Anne is safe

483
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:03,698
It's a blessing

484
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,534
Is this really okay?

485
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,578
Thanks for telling me in time.

486
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,292
Have we finally established trust in each other?

487
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,254
That's right.

488
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,131
It's the truth

489
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,049
Now it's your turn to tell me?

490
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,051
Your real purpose

491
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:26,846
Never seen your face

492
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,015
I've never heard your real voice.

493
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,308
Professor

494
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:32,727
I personally admire you

495
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,439
If we meet in a different way
Maybe we will become friends

496
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,232
So I ask you

497
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:39,900
If you tell the truth

498
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,945
We won't do anything behind your back.

499
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,405
If we can establish a true consultative relationship

500
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,490
We can avoid the worst situation

501
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,414
I don't understand what you are saying

502
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,005
Are you going to continue with this attitude?

503
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,090
You are not in the Bureau of Printing

504
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:04,967
We also know this

505
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:09,430
You are outside observing everything and pretending to negotiate

506
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:13,476
But in fact you are thinking
How to stab our police in the back

507
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,770
Did you have a lot of fun during this period?

508
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,898
Don't find fault

509
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,734
Think about how to deal with Jin Shangwan

510
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,445
I don't want another person to come between us

511
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,489
Why on earth does he always want to get involved?

512
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,240
You should know better than me, right?

513
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,243
I'll ask you again

514
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,496
This might be the last chance

515
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,540
You need to think before answering

516
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:37,958
You

517
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,587
What do you really want?

518
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:45,966
I'll say it again

519
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,595
I just want to make a lot of money

520
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,391
Without hurting anyone

521
00:39:58,687 --> 00:39:59,522
Got it

522
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,744
Let's start working

523
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,373
-Restart real-time monitoring
- Got it

524
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,583
Wait, that requires instructions from the higher-ups...

525
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,253
-I'm going to stop paying attention to that kind of instructions
-What?

526
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,171
Because of economic cooperation or something
No matter whether people live or die

527
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,548
Just want to end it as soon as possible

528
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,967
The robbers are printing money.

529
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,094
And the money printed is as much as 4 trillion

530
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:31,929
How is this possible?

531
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:37,184
For the upcoming economic cooperation
Prepared to be issued in the name of unified funds

532
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:41,605
How did the robbers know this?
Do they have some political purpose?

533
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,566
We don't know the specifics.

534
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,985
Our job is
Stop the robbers from taking a penny from there

535
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:47,903
Then rescue people safely

536
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,324
Any external interference that interferes with this work

537
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,034
I will never tolerate it again

538
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,416
So what can you do?

539
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,919
It is difficult to save people safely

540
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:07,965
But it is easy to stop printing money

541
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,010
It is to turn on the electricity

542
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:13,679
Cut off

543
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,869
Did you really look carefully?

544
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:39,788
You mean the surveillance camera?

545
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,625
If you don't believe me, check it yourself

546
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,711
When Kim Sang-wan was talking nonsense

547
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:48,422
Among the hostages' families

548
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,257
Are your parents here?

549
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,176
How long do you plan to hide?

550
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,641
My...

551
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,267
That's just...

552
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,560
I told him not to tell.

553
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:10,986
Afraid of causing unnecessary suspicion
For example, the current situation

554
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:18,285
If it happened before the traitor appeared, it would be fine.

555
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,288
Now, does this suspicion seem reasonable?

556
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:28,921
Although it is a good idea

557
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,049
But it is a major national facility after all.
Permission required

558
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,802
If the news leaks to
Was it in the ears of Kim Sang-man or the professor?

559
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:35,719
Captain

560
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,681
Checked the communication records during the period of suspension of monitoring

561
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,808
Records of communications with hostages' cell phones outside

562
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,810
Was it done by the robbers bribed by Jin Shangwan?

563
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:44,770
Is it the call record?

564
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:45,854
No

565
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,607
It's a text message but it's a bit weird

566
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:52,903
(The monitoring is released and Jin Shangwan wants to contact the robbers
Please confirm your intention)

567
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,196
(I confirm the police's movements)

568
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,407
Who sent it?

569
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,034
It's Captain Cha Moo-hyuk

570
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,202
-What?
-What's going on?

571
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:03,330
Could it be that Captain Che Wuhe is a spy for the robbers?

572
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,374
What is your current position?

573
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,336
West of Economic Cooperation Zone

574
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,046
Looks like I'm about to be fired by the opposing team

575
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,965
Just run to the west to inquire about information?

576
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:21,181
I was busy tinkering with Che Wuhe's phone all day.

577
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,182
So what?

578
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:26,061
Just follow the professor's instructions
Busy inserting fake text

579
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:29,273
At the same time, we must cut off his contact with Officer Xuan.

580
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,275
Eh? Take a look

581
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,751
Have I asked you to identify anything?

582
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,503
Completed the take

583
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,922
Analyzing the pattern now, it will take some time

584
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,342
Can't you hurry up? It's urgent.

585
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,844
It seems you have watched some Korean TV series

586
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:02,222
This isn't like a TV show
Put it into the database and the results will pop out

587
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,891
Among dozens of similar models

588
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,143
-Use your naked eye...
-I know the suspect's face

589
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,519
I just need to confirm if it's him

590
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:08,896
Oh, really.

591
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,774
They are all programmed and cannot be faster

592
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,401
Hey, please.

593
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,611
Sorry, no

594
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,947
Hey, hello

595
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,200
Are you Captain Che Wuhe of the Ministry of State Security?

596
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,620
What's the matter?

597
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,623
I am Li Chengmin, a police officer from the West Security Section of the Economic Cooperation Zone

598
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:41,804
What are you doing?

599
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:45,933
We got you to the robbers

600
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,518
Evidence of leaked investigation information

601
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:48,477
What?

602
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:00,698
Open the door!

603
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,116
Che Wuhe, open the door!

604
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:03,909
Open the door!

605
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,244
Open the door, bastard!

606
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,413
(Evidence: Craft knife)

607
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,123
Open the door!

608
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,292
-Open the door!
-Cha Moo Hyuk!

609
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:15,671
Open the door bastard!

610
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:19,758
Open the door quickly!

611
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,222
Open the door quickly!

612
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:28,600
There may be a traitor among you

613
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,060
So I entrusted him with the task privately.

614
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,854
Let the traitor

615
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,857
Create another traitor?

616
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,947
As Rio said, Che Wuhe started to doubt me.

617
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,699
Oh, it's fun

618
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,201
Why don't you continue talking nonsense?

619
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:51,081
This little bastard just doesn't want to be a doctor
You hid all the way here, didn't you?

620
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,375
But to really become a robber

621
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,002
He suddenly realized that this was no joke.

622
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:58,839
I like Tokyo.
No matter how hard he tried, Tokyo wouldn't even look at him.

623
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,258
I also saw your parents' faces on the radio.

624
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:02,593
Hello

625
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,095
You want to escape again?

626
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:06,764
Is it?

627
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,058
Won't you shut up?

628
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,394
What's wrong with you?

629
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,563
When I was about to open the vault
It was Rio who came to rescue me.

630
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:16,565
Still want to be a man?

631
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:19,109
Is it because you don't want to see the person you love die?

632
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,405
Damn, I'm really going crazy

633
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,449
Hey, don't you look suspicious?

634
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,326
Would you like everyone to give their alibi?

635
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:28,786
Stop

636
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:30,370
Listen

637
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,623
There are traitors among us

638
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,291
Need to find it as soon as possible

639
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:37,795
But if we suspect each other because of a traitor

640
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,839
It will cause great chaos and get out of control

641
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,383
You guys should leave your place to Tokyo and listen to her.

642
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,385
I have to finish dealing with Cha Moo Hyuk's matter.

643
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:50,307
Wait a minute

644
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,435
Going to voicemail

645
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,813
The call fee will be charged after the beep

646
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,691
Park Sun-ho is the professor

647
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,613
I'll tell you the details when we meet.

648
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:06,990
I'm going to your house now

649
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,881
He won't answer, right? He must be up to something.

650
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,091
I'm going crazy

651
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:27,761
Captain

652
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,805
It is said that Captain Che escaped

653
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,431
What?

654
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:35,310
Said to be a spy
I felt something was wrong with him from the beginning.

655
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,728
Wait a minute

656
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:38,981
This is a bit strange

657
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,984
Until yesterday
He also clearly said that he suspected someone was the professor.

658
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:43,485
Why did he say that?

659
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,696
You said that to avoid suspicion, right?

660
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:46,697
At a glance

661
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:52,035
I plan to find the professor.

662
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,040
When did you meet
The one called Park Sun-ho?

663
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,044
I

664
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,213
I'll go check something and come back soon.

665
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,842
-Before I come back, I will be ready for battle
- Got it

666
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:25,485
Cooking staff, assemble quickly!

667
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:35,913
That

668
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,290
What's wrong? Aren't you from the kitchen team?

669
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:42,336
The sister on duty feels unwell
Let me take her place once

670
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:47,007
I sit and do nothing
I will start to have wild thoughts

671
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,093
Okay then

672
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:51,762
Move!

673
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,638
Brat

674
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:57,119
If she told her daughter what she had seen

675
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,329
That's all over

676
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,750
After much thought, there is only one solution

677
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,387
Hello, are you Yuzhen?

678
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,639
What's wrong, mom?

679
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,184
Mom

680
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:04,186
Mom

681
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:07,105
Yes

682
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,358
Who are you?

683
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:11,777
Mom!

684
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:14,696
Oh, are you Yuzhen?

685
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,782
Did I call you?

686
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:19,951
I took the medicine...

687
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,912
I didn't know your mother was sick
What is the disease?

688
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:22,829
(Oral medication)

689
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,457
Just old age disease

690
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,711
Thanks to my confusion

691
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:33,090
I can listen to my daughter who is busy at work talk more

692
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:38,011
Mom, it's okay. Take care of yourself.

693
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:53,902
This is God's help

694
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:57,823
In the end, the professor did not shoot Officer Xuan's mother.

695
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:00,408
This put the professor in a state of fear.

696
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:04,329
He felt his feelings for Officer Xuan
It might ruin the whole plan.

697
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:08,667
(Heping Road Economic Cooperation Zone Charging Station)

698
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,125
Why are you stunned again?

699
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,169
That...

700
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:54,921
Dad

701
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:59,593
If there is a traitor among us

702
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,469
Dad, who do you think it will be?

703
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,013
Are you worried about what happened just now?

704
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:06,224
Nairobi is probably busy managing the factory

705
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:10,061
Helsinki Oslo They are a little fat

706
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:13,857
Besides, they were busy guarding these hostages.

707
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,985
Who the hell is this?

708
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:21,156
Stop talking nonsense and take care of them.

709
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:28,371
Although I don't know what happened
When the robbers are not paying attention

710
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,248
Now is the perfect time

711
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,167
You just go and have a rest

712
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,544
Nothing

713
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,380
Who is this meal for?

714
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,883
It's for the guards, so give it more.

715
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:41,509
Oslo will take it

716
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,815
Thanks to Annie for knowing the location

717
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,359
We can take a gamble

718
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,174
Even if the note is passed to the police or guards

719
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,259
What's next?

720
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,974
Do you really need to poop?

721
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:32,310
If you play tricks again, you will die this time.

722
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,228
Oh, I am this person

723
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:37,315
Have irritable bowel syndrome

724
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:38,984
Really

725
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:57,836
Oh, it's disgusting

726
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:20,483
Director, you must perform your mission well this time.

727
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:24,696
Damn

728
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:26,698
I'm so nervous.

729
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,977
The traitor was caught on camera at this time

730
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:59,564
Rio, you were not in the director's office at the time.

731
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:01,441
Don't you poop or pee?

732
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,650
Hey, look.

733
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:06,237
Oslo is also between the exhibition hall and the basement
Walking back and forth and not in position

734
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,782
Damn, Denver and Nairobi are not here.

735
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,992
We are not machines, we are human beings.

736
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:13,912
Can I leave my position temporarily?

737
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:18,625
Rio is right so calm down first…

738
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:19,918
Let’s think about it from another angle

739
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:25,757
Is this kid
Did he sneak out when everyone was not in position?

740
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,386
Besides, who knows the location of the cameras best?

741
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:32,722
Oh, really.

742
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:17,100
Why did you come here suddenly? We didn't contact you in advance.

743
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,436
Because I suddenly want to see you

744
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,440
The store is closed. Where did you go?

745
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,777
I suddenly have an urgent matter

746
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:29,737
Urgent

747
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:31,489
What is that?

748
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,203
What's wrong?

749
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:38,913
What can I do for you?

750
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:42,959
It suddenly occurred to me

751
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:46,546
Shanhao, you seem to know a lot about me.

752
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:51,050
But on the other hand, I don’t seem to know you very well.

753
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,847
Are you not good at talking about yourself?

754
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,811
Can we go in first and talk later?

755
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:14,699
-Yuzhen
-Don't move

756
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:18,161
Don't ask anything, go upstairs

757
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:22,081
That...

758
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,042
At least tell me why

759
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,043
Two months ago

760
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,295
Why are you approaching me?

761
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:28,546
Why? What is this?

762
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,381
Okay, let’s go upstairs!

763
00:58:58,576 --> 00:58:59,410
Open it

764
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,249
Does it have to be like this?

765
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:06,417
I want to know what you are hiding

766
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:09,254
Open it quickly!

767
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:39,993
Are you satisfied?

768
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:43,621
Sorry

769
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:45,498
Actually…

770
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:51,796
People who work with me

771
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:56,342
Wanted for leaking official secrets

772
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,011
But he turned out to be a trustworthy person.

773
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:01,180
The last thing he said was

774
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:04,434
It's about you, Sunho, so I also...

775
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:06,019
Can you treat me so casually?

776
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,314
How can this be?

777
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:11,399
No, that's not what I meant...

778
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:13,860
Yuzhen Our Relationship

779
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,154
Let's stop here

780
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,366
-Shan Hao
-Please go

781
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:23,995
Please go away!

782
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:28,291
I won't send it.

783
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,604
Actually, before Officer Xuan came to see him

784
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:51,814
The professor has already thought about ending this relationship.

785
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:55,985
But he didn't expect it to hurt him so much

786
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:58,363
Now that Che Wuhe has been eliminated

787
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:01,949
In fact, the existence of Officer Xuan
Very helpful for our plan

788
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:03,868
(Park Sun-ho)

789
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:05,662
But the professor felt her presence

790
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,664
Gradually became my weakness

791
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:08,581
(Police officer Nam Dong-chul)

792
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:11,918
As a result, a heavy price had to be paid

793
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:12,835
Hello

794
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,047
Captain, everything is ready.

795
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:17,757
Got it

796
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:37,402
It’s really annoying. I said it wasn’t me!

797
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:39,445
Rio

798
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:42,240
What? You don't believe me either?

799
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:44,325
I believe you

800
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:47,328
Then why did you let that madman make such random judgments?

801
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:48,579
You should calm down too.

802
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:50,748
The more this happens, the better it is for the enemy.

803
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:52,417
You let me calm down?

804
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,711
How do you ask me to calm down?

805
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:55,628
Rio

806
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:57,922
Release

807
01:01:58,005 --> 01:02:01,300
Guilty people are always angrier. Look at this smell.

808
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:02,719
Damn

809
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:06,973
Hey Nairobi, you came just in time.

810
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:09,183
Hmm, what's the matter?

811
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:12,854
Although we haven't heard of it yet
Family situation in Nairobi

812
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:16,149
But imagine
Your dad or mom appears on that TV

813
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:17,859
How would you feel?

814
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:19,986
Me

815
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:22,739
Money is more important to me

816
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:25,908
I didn't even look for my family.

817
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:29,954
That's right.
Isn't it for money that we risk our lives to come here?

818
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:32,415
You two go to hell.

819
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,251
Look at this stinky boy, he has a dirty mouth

820
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:36,377
Think about it

821
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:39,547
Besides you, is there any comrade who is not in urgent need of money?

822
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:42,508
And you are the only one who can go back to reunite with your family

823
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:44,677
Hey, tell the truth

824
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:47,638
I almost cried when I saw my father's face

825
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:49,182
My impression of my father

826
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:51,934
He wouldn't do that even if you asked him to.

827
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,019
But so what?

828
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:55,646
That's why
Will I betray you and kill Annie?

829
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,398
I'd rather die!

830
01:02:58,399 --> 01:02:59,650
I quit!

831
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,572
Then stop bragging and just die.

832
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:07,283
Berlin Stop

833
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,414
Oh, it's true

834
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:17,126
The upstairs quarrel started again.

835
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,045
The conclusion will be revealed soon.

836
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,673
-We just need to do our part.
-Is that so?

837
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,511
I'm going to bring some water to the hostages downstairs.

838
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:27,970
It seems like I have finished drinking again

839
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:30,139
Hello

840
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:31,766
Let's do it tomorrow

841
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:34,936
What should I do if I urinate and poop after drinking?

842
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,979
All tied up

843
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:39,106
It's pitiful to be locked in a small space.

844
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:41,150
I'll be back soon

845
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:59,210
Why would you be a robber if you are so soft-hearted?

846
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:44,422
What's going on...

847
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:01,939
Don't

848
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:04,609
Put the gun down

849
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:06,861
Rio, just admit it.

850
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:09,864
Otherwise I'll let Tokyo die for you

851
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:13,200
Everything is ready

852
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,338
Notify all confrontation teams

853
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:26,756
From this moment on

854
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:29,467
Will cut off the printing press

855
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:31,552
All power supplies

856
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:50,668
