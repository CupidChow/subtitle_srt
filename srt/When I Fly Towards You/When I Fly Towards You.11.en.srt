Happy New Year, Rang Rang.
[Episode 11]

13
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:24,540
Dad.

14
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:26,800
You're putting up paper-cut so early this year.

15
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,139
Your grandma made the paper-cut out earlier and sent them over long ago.

16
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:30,960
So I'm thinking of putting all of them up.

17
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,420
Help me see if this position is just right.

18
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,979
Move a bit to the left.

19
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,019
To the left?

20
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,079
- Like this?
- Yes.

21
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:39,900
Okay, good.

22
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,120
I'm pasting it now.

23
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,500
Guys.

24
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,299
I'll go out for New Year shopping later.

25
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,500
Tell me what else we need.

26
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,720
Mom. I need a pair of shoes.

27
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,539
Didn't you buy a pair of snow boots last year?

28
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,840
You haven't worn them much yet.

29
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,279
Mom. A new look in the new year!

30
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,040
It's an auspicious sign.

31
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,441
All right, then.

32
00:02:00,441 --> 00:02:01,840
Go and pick one for yourself,

33
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,739
so you won't complain about my taste.

34
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,520
Thank you, Mom.

35
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,779
Dear. My belt...

36
00:02:10,779 --> 00:02:12,779
Your belt is still in a good state.

37
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,000
The color has come off.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,600
So I'm thinking of getting a new one for the new year.

39
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,780
For good luck.

40
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,180
All right, then. I'll get one for you in the mall later.

41
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,921
Sure. I'm full of energy now.

42
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,340
Rang Rang. We've put up paper-cut out today.

43
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,460
What are you doing?

44
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,780
Doing homework.

45
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,340
Rang Rang. I made dumplings today,

46
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,980
and finally, they were well-wrapped.

47
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,300
♫ Without any reason ♫

48
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,140
I guess you're good at making dumplings too.

49
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,500
♫ It’s unexplainable ♫

50
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,700
Is this really a dumpling?

51
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,260
No.

52
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,500
I can't help much.

53
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,219
My parents prefer that I study.

54
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:27,980
♫ That brought you into my life ♫

55
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,459
My parents wouldn't have thought of that.

56
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,579
They summoned me to clean all the glasses in the house.

57
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,440
I'm about to develop a phobia for glasses.

58
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,400
Rang Rang. What are you doing?

59
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,780
At the library. Reading.

60
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,440
♫ I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me ♫

61
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,360
Rang Rang.

62
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,200
You should do something fun during the break.

63
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,940
What things are considered fun?

64
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,120
Everything that makes you happy is fun.

65
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,480
♫ But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore ♫

66
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,660
♫ I believe you'll walk to me step by step ♫

67
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,659
Today, I took Su Su out and we enjoyed the sunset.

68
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,021
It was beautiful.

69
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:11,320
♫ I believe you will come to know the true me ♫

70
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,340
I'm envious.

71
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:13,740
♫ Just like the moon and the sunset ♫

72
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,740
Envious?

73
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:16,320
♫ They come in turn but never miss each other ♫

74
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,919
Of Su Su.

75
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,840
♫ I want to give you a perfect encounter ♫

76
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,540
Brother.

77
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,840
Yes?

78
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,620
Brother.

79
00:04:24,621 --> 00:04:27,139
Why don't you go out? It's a holiday.

80
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,840
Uncle and his family just left.

81
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,980
I have a lot of homework to do.

82
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,419
Is Jiangyi a good place for fun, Brother?

83
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,419
Yes.

84
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,979
I have a friend from Jiangyi.

85
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,600
I really want to go there

86
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,059
every time he describes his hometown to me.

87
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:42,080
Brother. You're now staying at Uncle's house.

88
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,520
If you have time next semester,

89
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,899
shall I stay with you for several days?

90
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,660
Mom and Dad said you didn't have many friends there.

91
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,080
No, I don't have time.

92
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,339
Is your schedule packed?

93
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,960
I have plans with friends during my free time.

94
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,263
- You're home.
- Yes.

95
00:05:06,282 --> 00:05:08,259
I could smell the food as I was coming in.

96
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,180
It smells so good.

97
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,700
- Dad, you came back at the perfect time.
- Certainly.

98
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,139
Old Su.

99
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,739
Didn't you go to buy cured meat?

100
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,979
Why are you back empty-handed? Where's the meat?

101
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:21,259
I was about to tell you about it.

102
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,600
Mom called me saying that my grandmother is celebrating her birthday this year.

103
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,319
We're asked to return home to celebrate the New Year.

104
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,579
So I'm asking for your opinion.

105
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,059
If we're going back to celebrate the New Year, we don't need the meat.

106
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,619
So I didn't buy it.

107
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,500
Great-Grandmother?

108
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:34,920
Did you forget?

109
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,080
She carried you in her arms when you were little.

110
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,259
The grand-grandmother in the hometown.

111
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,500
But our preparation would go to waste

112
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,359
if we're not celebrating here?

113
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:47,219
Besides, Uncle and his family will surely go, too.

114
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,499
Where should all of us sleep, then?

115
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
I have to start working on the fifth day of the New Year.

116
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,480
Don't you think we'll be spending most of the time on the road?

117
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,920
Yes, it's bothersome.

118
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,179
Exactly.

119
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,300
Suyang is quite a distance away from Jiangyi.

120
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,460
Suyang?

121
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,179
Don't hesitate then! We must go!

122
00:06:07,179 --> 00:06:10,339
Great-Grandmother carried me in her arms before. And it's her birthday.

123
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,619
How can we not attend it when so many others are going?

124
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,199
Reunion is the most important thing in the New Year.

125
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,299
- You...
- I was considering it just now.

126
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,519
Now I've made up my mind.

127
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,659
I don't mind squeezing in somewhere to sleep.

128
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,780
Attending is the most important.

129
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,780
Look, she has become sensible out of a sudden.

130
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,239
That's settled, then.

131
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:30,600
We're celebrating the New Year at Suyang

132
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,680
and coming back on the second day of the New Year. All right?

133
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,179
Okay.

134
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,060
I've finished eating. I'm packing up for the trip to Suyang.

135
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,580
You're packing now?

136
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,579
Gosh, this girl.

137
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,760
Why... Why is she suddenly so excited about it?

138
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,440
The cohesion of the family, I guess.

139
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,059
Rang Rang.

140
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,920
I've finished all the Chinese assignments.

141
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,600
Let me give you a test.

142
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,280
What test?

143
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,779
Phrase chain.

144
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,940
I'll go first.

145
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,440
Enchanted in dreams.

146
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,060
Soulfully captivated.

147
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,120
Oh, I know what you mean.

148
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,159
It's my turn.

149
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:21,900
Dull.

150
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,020
Ludicrous.

151
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,779
Rang Rang, are you insulting me?

152
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,400
Do you want to continue?

153
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,400
You can't take advantage of the game to do that.

154
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,520
I'll forgive you this time.

155
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,500
But I will change the phrase.

156
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,760
Repetitive practice.

157
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,100
Enthralled artwork.

158
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,080
Kungfu Panda.

159
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,140
Tom and Jerry.

160
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,540
Rang Rang, don't just make random answers.

161
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,580
That's not the rule.

162
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,800
Well, forget it.

163
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,100
Rang Rang, you have a bad temper, you know?

164
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,960
Only I can put up with you.

165
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,859
I'll forgive you this time as long as you buy me bubble tea

166
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,660
when I arrive in Suyang,

167
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,099
You're coming to Suyang?

168
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,020
Yes.

169
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:22,000
We're visiting our relatives. So we'll celebrate the New Year there.

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,160
Zhang Lurang, are you very surprised and a little bit happy?

171
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,400
Aiyo, don't be shy.

172
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,260
Speak out if you're happy. Otherwise, I wouldn't know about that.

173
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,339
Suyang is a boring place.

174
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,120
It won't be boring when you're there.

175
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,520
Good night.

176
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,940
Good night.

177
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm really looking forward to the New Year!

178
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,040
I'll get in the car first.

179
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,860
Put it here.

180
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,739
Dad, how long will the journey take?

181
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,560
Four hours if there's no traffic jam.

182
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,580
We should be there in the afternoon.

183
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,050
Rang Rang, I'm heading out now.

184
00:09:22,901 --> 00:09:26,540
Sister, I heard that Luli ranked first in the final exam this semester again.

185
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,960
He participated in a competition before the final exams,

186
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,499
so he didn't have much time to revise

187
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,899
and ended up ranking third in the city.

188
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,480
His ranking dropped slightly.

189
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,939
Are you still not satisfied?

190
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,659
Luli excels in his studies and he's obedient too.

191
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,300
We'd be over the moon if this were to happen to us.

192
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,499
He's disciplined.

193
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,300
And we don't really worry much about him.

194
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,420
Luli.

195
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,059
Can you tutor your cousin when you have time?

196
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,960
- He even struggles with the holiday homework.
- Okay.

197
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,640
You've been a good boy since little.

198
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,600
Sister. Where is Lurang?

199
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,620
How did he do in the exams?

200
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,760
Brother...

201
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,720
Aunt, Uncle.

202
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,240
Hello.

203
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,500
Lurang is still as quiet as before.

204
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,839
It's not good for him, though.

205
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:17,220
He should learn from Luli. Be more cheerful.

206
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,080
That's just how he is.

207
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,540
But he's obedient.

208
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,579
He went to Jiangyi to study this semester, right?

209
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,139
What's his ranking in the semester final exam?

210
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,779
I heard that only the top five of his school

211
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,420
are qualified to enter Hua University.

212
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,379
A'Rang.

213
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,579
Take Luli and your cousins to the library this afternoon.

214
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,900
Get them some books to read.

215
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,659
Ask A'Li to do it.

216
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,380
I have plans later.

217
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,220
I'm going back to my room.

218
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,380
Lurang hasn't been close to us since little.

219
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,739
Given his character, it might be hard to get along well with his classmates either.

220
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:06,220
He has friends and he's doing quite well at school.

221
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,920
Mom.

222
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,939
I'll go back to my room and study.

223
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,419
Sure.

224
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,480
Go ahead.

225
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,260
Enjoy the food here, Sister.

226
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,539
I've arrived at Suyang.

227
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,080
Now I'm going to take a nap.

228
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,040
See you tonight.

229
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,459
Mom, please let me be.

230
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,320
Your aunt will be back very late tonight.

231
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,179
Both your dad and I have to clean up the place.

232
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,339
So you take Xuan Xuan to the supermarket

233
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,819
to buy some flower seeds, peanuts, and snacks.

234
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,380
It's easy.

235
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,619
But I've put on my pajamas.

236
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,780
I want to take a nap.

237
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,440
You can't sleep well at night if you take a nap now.

238
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,200
I can go by myself.

239
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,940
I know the way anyway.

240
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,379
Come on, go with him.

241
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,000
Hurry up.

242
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,600
Aren't you going to get changed?

243
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,379
It's fine.

244
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:15,920
No one knows me here anyway.

245
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,520
But...

246
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,560
it's not appropriate, is it?

247
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,360
Why don't you wait for me on the side?

248
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,060
Don't worry, I can handle this myself...

249
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,180
Are you ready?

250
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,140
Let's count down for the big sales now.

251
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,920
Ten, nine,

252
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:48,640
eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

253
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,760
Starts now.

254
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:06,740
I took this first.

255
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,890
- I got it first.
- I got it first. Let go.

256
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,480
- I got it first.
- No, I got it first.

257
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,160
You're being unreasonable, young lady.

258
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,860
I took it first.

259
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,470
I grabbed it first.

260
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,410
Su Zaizai.

261
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:40,879
Rang Rang. Please don't get me wrong.

262
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:43,579
I don't usually wear like this at home.

263
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,099
It just happened that I didn't groom up nicely today

264
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,620
and ran into you.

265
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,680
No, I remember you being like this in the past.

266
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,660
You... You've remembered it wrong.

267
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,440
He has a poor memory.

268
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,999
I planned to study after taking a nap

269
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:05,500
and meet with you tonight.

270
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,180
I didn't expect to bump into you there.

271
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,779
You haven't even started doing your holiday homework,

272
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,640
let alone study.

273
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,720
Except for math, I've almost finished everything else.

274
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,580
My math isn't as good as yours so I'm slow.

275
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,179
Are you good at math?

276
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,619
I like math too.

277
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,240
But no one in our family is good at it.

278
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,580
Su Zaizai barely passed math exams before.

279
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,139
This little brat has to embarrass me.

280
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,140
She gets bogged down every time I ask her math questions.

281
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,840
But she's good at English.

282
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,299
I always failed my English exams.

283
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,579
And she's been helping me.

284
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:55,219
Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.

285
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,859
That's common.

286
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,320
Sister, are you so good at English?

287
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,819
Of course.

288
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:06,100
I just don't brag about it.

289
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,920
Rang Rang. My aunt's place is just ahead.

290
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,259
Do you want to come over?

291
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,940
Now?

292
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,860
Please come.

293
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,980
I need your help with my homework.

294
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,340
Are you in a hurry to go home?

295
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,241
Not at all.

296
00:15:31,241 --> 00:15:33,100
Let's go.

297
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,821
Rang Rang. Look.

298
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:42,460
We've encountered the most secretive intelligence community in the world.

299
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,400
What do you mean?

300
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,740
Literally.

301
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,580
So, let's go.

302
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,500
What?

303
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:14,080
A boy?

304
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,920
They're on their way here?

305
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,400
Okay, got it.

306
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,200
Thank you so much.

307
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,460
Hey. What boy were you talking about?

308
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,339
Zaizai's uncle's third aunt's sister's neighbor

309
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,920
said that she saw Zai was on the way home with a boy.

310
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,659
They were talking and laughing.

311
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,080
They seemed quite close.

312
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,979
Uncle's third aunt...

313
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,379
Who is that?

314
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,859
That's not the point.

315
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,640
The point is, Zaizai is still young

316
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,339
and she's bringing a boy home all of a sudden.

317
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,259
Is this boy someone she just met?

318
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,459
What's his character?

319
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,539
How's his family?

320
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,120
Does he have any bad habits?

321
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,619
We're clueless about him.

322
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,240
It's dangerous.

323
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,320
Besides, he made Zaizai bring him home right after they met?

324
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,799
This guy can't be good.

325
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:03,099
That's exactly what I meant.

326
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,840
No way, I must teach him a lesson.

327
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,740
I...

328
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:13,580
We shall see if he can take a good beating.

329
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,240
All right.

330
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,779
I think there are only my parents at home.

331
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:23,040
Don't worry, they are very welcoming.

332
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,260
Stop right there.

333
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,459
Uh... Nice to meet you, Uncle.

334
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,139
I'm Su Zaizai's classmate.

335
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,420
My name is Zhang Lurang.

336
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,040
Zhang Lurang?

337
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,400
He's been tutoring me in Math and Physics.

338
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,160
He's excellent.

339
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,899
He's the classmate you mentioned?

340
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,140
Why didn't you inform us that your friend was coming over?

341
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,540
Well... Is the lantern a bit slanted?

342
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,780
Xiao Zhang.

343
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,100
Yes.

344
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,540
Come on in.

345
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,620
Why are you standing outside?

346
00:18:12,621 --> 00:18:15,080
Come on and take a seat.

347
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,179
Please take a seat.

348
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,879
Make yourself at home. Come on and sit.

349
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:22,260
Make yourself comfortable.

350
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,419
Xiao Zhang.

351
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,360
Are you in the same class as Zaizai?

352
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,900
No.

353
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,500
I can tell he's a good boy.

354
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:37,780
Zaizai does very poorly in science.

355
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,819
I'm grateful to you for tutoring her.

356
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,799
It's nothing. She helps me too.

357
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:44,040
You see, they help each other.

358
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,660
Exactly.

359
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:54,280
Oh, where's Zaizai?

360
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,220
What were you talking about?

361
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,299
Well, I just changed into some casual clothes.

362
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,280
This is the least casual outfit you've ever put on.

363
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,699
Brother Rang, can you come to my room and help me with my homework?

364
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,139
Brother Rang?

365
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,060
Yes.

366
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:22,939
I heard Sister calling him "Rang"...

367
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,120
Didn't you say you want to study?

368
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,940
Go ahead.

369
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,240
Go now.

370
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:38,419
Xiao Zhang, since you're here, please stay for dinner.

371
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,539
It's a good chance to taste the cooking of Zaizai's dad.

372
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,120
I'm not staying for dinner.

373
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,500
It's getting late.

374
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,801
Oh, yeah.

375
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:46,499
Stay here and have dinner with us.

376
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,619
I'm cooking.

377
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,100
You can have a taste of it.

378
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,721
Zaizai, I need your help.

379
00:19:51,721 --> 00:19:52,800
Okay.

380
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,000
Hey.

381
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,480
You should stay.

382
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,280
Sit here and stay with your friend.

383
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,059
I'll help him. All right?

384
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,880
Xiao Zhang, is there anything you can't eat?

385
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,479
He can't eat shrimp.

386
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:08,960
I see.

387
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,420
All right.

388
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,440
How did you know?

389
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,340
Well. Before, every time we ate at the place of Guan Fang's grandma,

390
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,939
you never ate shrimp balls.

391
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,080
So I asked Gu Ran.

392
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:31,679
Do you suddenly realize that I'm caring and attentive aside from being cheerful?

393
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,260
Is that really funny?

394
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,139
Where's Zaizai?

395
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,820
I asked her to walk Zhang out.

396
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:57,179
Someone said this boy must have harbored evil intentions.

397
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,719
Yet, you kept calling him Xiao Zhang with that amiable tone.

398
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:02,140
You changed your attitude quickly enough.

399
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,839
You should take the actual situation into consideration.

400
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:10,619
Look at Xiao Zhang's appearance, demeanor, and attitude,

401
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,560
do you think he's bad-natured?

402
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,899
Besides, he's tutoring Zaizai in Math.

403
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,660
He's so helpful.

404
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,680
You know, I wanted a boyfriend like him

405
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,800
when I was Zaizai's age.

406
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,379
And you're so lucky.

407
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,380
You found one.

408
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,639
Rang Rang, did my parents make you uncomfortable during dinner?

409
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:56,259
That's just how my family is.

410
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,960
They can never stay quiet for a minute.

411
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,320
That's good.

412
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,620
Good?

413
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,660
My family doesn't usually talk to each other.

414
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,920
We focus on our own things.

415
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,360
Having meals is like completing a daily task

416
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,540
where we gather at a place at fixed times.

417
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,739
You don't talk to each other?

418
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,960
Isn't that boring?

419
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,580
Yes, it's boring.

420
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,940
Rang Rang, I give you the privilege to chat with me.

421
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,640
You're now my first contact.

422
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,139
You're prioritized.

423
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,140
Call me any time if you want to talk to someone.

424
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,499
Rang Rang.

425
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:02,519
Does our meeting at Suyang count as an interesting event during your boring holiday?

426
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,690
Yes.

427
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,999
Mom, your favorite sketch is about to finish.

428
00:23:30,999 --> 00:23:33,099
How's the patient now?

429
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,199
Okay.

430
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:36,579
I'll be right there.

431
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,459
My patient has had an adverse reaction.

432
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,579
I need to head to the hospital now.

433
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,360
Old Gu. Do the dishes.

434
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,800
Be careful on your way.

435
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,160
Okay.

436
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,780
Hey.

437
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,660
But it's New Year's Eve today.

438
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,480
The emergency department is always busy.

439
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,000
She has no choice.

440
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,500
I'm saying that she hasn't had the dumplings

441
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,580
I made this afternoon.

442
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,179
She misses out on the delicacies.

443
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:10,060
You can save some for her.

444
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,720
Hello.

445
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,920
It's all right. I'm free to talk.

446
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,120
Oh.

447
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,739
You should pay attention to your sickness.

448
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,219
Don't go out often.

449
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,780
The temperature drops a lot and the cold will hurt your lungs.

450
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,880
Yes.

451
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,159
Careful with your diet too.

452
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,200
Avoid overly sweet, spicy,

453
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,480
or salty foods.

454
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,099
Welcome Chinese New Year with joyfulness.

455
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,659
May you have a Happy Chinese New Year

456
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,619
and delightful Chinese New Year's Eve.

457
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,099
Your happiness brings me joy.

458
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,659
Your happiness sweetens my days.

459
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:10,020
Wish you a Happy New Year in the Year of Dragon.

460
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,700
♫ I admitted that I’d made a mistake ♫

461
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,540
Hello. Gu Ran.

462
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,339
That's so insincere.

463
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,900
You just forwarded the New Year's greetings without revising the zodiac year.

464
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,020
Gosh. My bad.

465
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,520
I'm lighting fireworks with others. What are you doing?

466
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,459
Do you play with fireworks today?

467
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,140
Fireworks aren't allowed in the city. You know that.

468
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,920
Listen to this.

469
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,160
Listen. Do you hear it?

470
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:40,440
♫ You give your all to me ♫

471
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,000
Yeah.

♫ my mind’s been overwhelmed by ♫

473
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,739
Why don't you watch the New Year's Gala at home?

474
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,659
What are you looking at?

475
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,779
Grandma.

476
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:59,380
I always feel that every New Year is the same.

477
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,580
Everyone eats, sets off fireworks, and watches the Gala.

478
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,600
They don't even change the sequence.

479
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,680
But why do people still look forward to the New Year?

480
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:18,379
Because today is a day everyone chooses

481
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,580
to be with people who are worth it.

482
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:26,059
Don't you think wishing "Happy New Year"

483
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:31,219
to the same person every year is fortunate?

484
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:34,040
♫ I said flowers eventually wither, so you no longer buy me flowers ♫

485
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,299

Great-Grandmother. I can't take the red envelope.

Zaizai, just take it.

509
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,280
Great-Grandmother is so fond of you.

510
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,300
There's no need.

511
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,620
These eggs don't cost much.

512
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,100
Just take them.

513
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,200
Otherwise, she won't be able to sleep tonight.

514
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,220
All right. We'll take the eggs.

515
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,961
Zaizai, take it. Take it.

00:27:54,961 --> 00:27:56,579
Thank you, Great-Grandmother.

Sure.

519
00:27:59,001 --> 00:28:00,660
We'll come back to visit again when we have time.

520
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,060
Okay.

521
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,720
See you.

522
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,920
See you, Auntie.

523
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,380
See you, Great-Grandmother.

524
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,320
Drive safely.

525
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,560
What's the meaning of celebrating New Year?

526
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,080
That's to bond with people.

527
00:28:21,978 --> 00:28:24,080
Ugh, your room is so smelly.

528
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,620
What kind of smell?

529
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,560
You haven't been moving since the New Year started.

530
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,459
What kind of smell?

531
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:32,960
Like something's gone sour.

532
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,839
Get up. Bring the things with you.

533
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,120
We're going to pay a New Year's call to Dr. Gu.

534
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,360
He took good care of your grandma when she was in hospital.

535
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,800
We should be grateful.

536
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,660
Get up now.

537
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:48,379
Just say it when you want me to carry things for you. Let's go.

538
00:28:48,379 --> 00:28:49,880
Good. That's right.

539
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,700
You're more sensible after the New Year.

540
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,880
Pay a new year's call? Are you visiting your relatives?

541
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,880
No. It's my grandma's attending physician.

542
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,240
My dad said we must express our gratitude.

543
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,339
I got to go now. I'm almost there.

544
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:08,260
My hands are strained carrying the fruit basket.

545
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,800
Your dad indeed knows you well.

546
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,060
What do you mean?

547
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,000
It's a big waste of your great physique

548
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,520
for not carrying the fruit basket.

549
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,580
You should be glad that you're not with me now.

550
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,960
Otherwise, you wouldn't be laughing.

551
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,440
Jiang Jia, come.

552
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,620
Come here. Here we are.

553
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,820
Okay.

554
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,679
Son.

555
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,380
Go and get the door.

556
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,680
Okay.

557
00:29:41,374 --> 00:29:42,061
Why?

558
00:29:42,061 --> 00:29:44,520
Are you going to pop up from my phone and punch me?

559
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,839
Hello.

560
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:52,640
I'm looking for Dr. Gu...

561
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,519
No way.

562
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:01,560
You did pop up.

563
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,960
Gu Ran?

564
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,650
What?

565
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,680
Do you know each other?

566
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,219
Rang Rang, what are you looking at?

567
00:30:11,219 --> 00:30:12,860
You're completely absorbed.

568
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,220
I just feel

569
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,840
that fireworks are beautiful.

570
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,379
Have you not played with fireworks during the New Year before?

571
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,780
Nope.

572
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:25,480
So, will you think of me whenever you see fireworks?

573
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,775
My new year's wish for this year is

574
00:30:28,775 --> 00:30:32,899
that fireworks factories remain fully stocked before I turn 100.

575
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:38,400
♫ I guess I’ve fallen in love with you ♫

576
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,140
♫ Without any reason ♫

577
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:46,010
♫ It’s unexplainable ♫

578
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:53,020
♫ I guess it must be the hand of destiny ♫

579
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,800
♫ That brought you into my life ♫

580
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,480
♫ The best version of you ♫

581
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,130
♫ You gave me courage and love ♫

582
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,159
♫ You’re the reason I believe in love ♫

583
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:16,200
♫ I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me ♫

584
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,830
♫ Even if it makes it hard for me to let go ♫

585
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,960
♫ Too scared to tell you, “I love you” ♫

586
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:31,530
♫ But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore ♫
