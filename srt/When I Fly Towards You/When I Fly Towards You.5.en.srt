♫ I’m softly embracing all the little joys I’ve treasured ♫

Those moments I have never regretted.
[Episode 5]

12
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,150
Bye-bye.

13
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,059
How was it?

14
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,920
I was cool, huh?

15
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,970
Yes.

16
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,579
Hear that?

17
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,380
Cool!

18
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,340
- Nice!
- Take a break, take a break!

19
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,100
Why is she still here?

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,120
I shouldn't have been so charismatic just now.

21
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,920
What are you saying?

22
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,780
Come here.

23
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,740
Look. She's looking this way again.

24
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,899
There are so many people here.

25
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:24,640
This is embarrassing!

26
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:32,040
Why do I feel like she's not looking at you?

27
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,540
Impossible.

28
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,000
Shen Qianyu, go for it! You can do it!

29
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,040
Shen Qianyu, go for it!

30
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,760
The person you like is Shen Qianyu?

31
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,340
Yeah. Why?

32
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,140
Then!

33
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,740
Why did you...

34
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,940
Why did you keep smiling at me all this while?

35
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,380
Who was looking at you?

36
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,119
I was looking at Senior Qianyu.

37
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:25,700
You, though, keep blocking my view and spouting nonsense.

38
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,640
Y-You even praised me when we got the supplies!

39
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,780
Oh. You have the guts to mention that?

40
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,040
If you didn't pose as Zhang Lurang, would we have got your names wrong?

41
00:03:35,619 --> 00:03:37,680
Got our names wrong?

42
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,920
Uh-huh.

43
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,499
Got our names wrong?

44
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,000
Yeah.

45
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,739
How could you get our names wrong?

46
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,559
One has two characters, while the other has three. One's Zhang and one's Gu.

47
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:54,699
One of them is... handsome, and the other, even more so!

48
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,720
How could you get our names wrong?

49
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,240
Are you... questioning me?

50
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,620
This is a huge misunderstanding.

51
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,059
So... You were praising Zhang Lurang?

52
00:04:14,059 --> 00:04:16,539
Of course. Should I praise you instead?

53
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:19,000
Did he get off on the wrong foot today?

54
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,659
So that's the truth.

55
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,100
Only an instant cardio reliever can save him now.

56
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,660
No wonder.

57
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,599
I was confused why you guys were always around when I was playing basketball with Qianyu!

58
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:33,800
You do have ulterior motives!

59
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,679
Hey, be careful. What do you mean by...

60
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,019
Did you call him "Brother Qianyu"?

61
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,819
Are you two friends?

62
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,260
Yeah. Our dads are colleagues.

63
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,960
We play basketball together a lot.

64
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,600
What?

65
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,819
You had such a long game just now.

66
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,460
Are you tired? Are you thirsty?

67
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,619
Is the milk tea enough?

68
00:04:59,619 --> 00:05:02,620
Would you like me to buy you another cup?

69
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,480
Hey, Gu Ran! Don't go!

70
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,339
You said Brother Qianyu likes white the other time.

71
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,920
What kind of white is it? Beige? Ivory? Milky?

72
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,360
Hey, Gu Ran! Don't be so petty!

73
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,659
Or we could talk about something else!

74
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,819
Like what Brother Qianyu likes to eat or drink, what books he reads, you should know all that, right?

75
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:22,659
Can you stop following me?

76
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,980
Gu Ran, don't run!

77
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,059
Why are you still here?

78
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,020
What's it got to do with you?

79
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,660
Gu Ran.

80
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,859
My dad is working overtime today.

81
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,860
Your parents as well.

82
00:05:34,861 --> 00:05:36,499
Why don't we dine out together?

83
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,579
Sure.

84
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,299
You could bring your friend if you want.

85
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,800
- I don't...
- Me!

86
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,620
I want to come too.

87
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,020
Are we friends?

88
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,760
Of course not.

89
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,259
Our relationship... exceeds friendship!

90
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,639
We run late together, get punished together, through thick and thin...

91
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,620
Our friendship is more precious than gold!

92
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,700
Don't force me to tell the others about how you were locked up.

93
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,900
She is absolutely right.

94
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,900
We... We're really good friends.

95
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,800
Yeah.

96
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,020
- Let's go, then.
- Let's go!

97
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,440
Yeah!

98
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,380
Oh, right.

99
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:36,939
I have to help Ms. Zhang tabulate the scores for the mid-terms.

100
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,179
You guys should leave first.

101
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,299
Alone?

102
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,500
Yeah. Just a little left.

103
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,680
Do you think I'm capable and somewhat impressive?

104
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,439
You sure aren't humble. We'll get going then.

105
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,560
Bye-bye!

106
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,260
Why did it suddenly rain?

107
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,540
And it doesn't look like it's going to stop any time sooner.

108
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,740
I should wait.

109
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,779
Rang Rang.

110
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:33,099
I read my horoscope the other day, and the book said my lucky element is water.

111
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:37,459
I didn't believe it at first, but now I think it's pretty accurate.

112
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:39,240
Why?

113
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,400
Because good things happen when it rains!

114
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,739
I first met you at a corner shop in the rain.

115
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,379
I got to know your name in a field in the rain.

116
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,700
Seems like everything related to rain is also related to you.

117
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,400
It rained three times last week and twice this week.

118
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,420
Well, in that case, it means that only rainy days related to you are meaningful to me.

119
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,120
Rang Rang, surely you didn't come back just for me today?

120
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,360
I forgot my notes.

121
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,760
I see.

122
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,139
If it rains next time, and you forget your umbrella, you could check the teacher's office.

123
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:23,920
They might have a spare.

124
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,399
But if you tell me you'd be coming beforehand, I don't mind being in the rain again.

125
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,660
Here.

126
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,740
Your house's right up front.

127
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,980
You can take the umbrella.

128
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,660
Rang Rang! See you tomorrow!

Why the sudden treat?

137
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
You're so cheerful too.

138
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,419
The food in the canteen was delicious today.

139
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,100
Can't I be happy about it?

140
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,140
Hurry up and choose.

141
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,739
You said it's your treat.

142
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,259
I won't hold back then!

143
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,800
A treat?

144
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,420
Who's treating?

145
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,960
Me! I'm feeling happy today.

146
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,219
I'm treating everyone!

147
00:10:28,219 --> 00:10:30,360
Then I won't hold back either!

148
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,819
Why is it them again?

149
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:35,180
They sure like the attention.

150
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,000
Let's go.

151
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,979
Zaizai, do you have enough pocket money?

152
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,520
Rest assured.

153
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,000
My dad just gave me this morning!

154
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,820
What should I get for Rang Rang?

155
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,470
Did they all go out for lunch?

156
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,240
Keep it up!

Su Zaizai. Why are you here?

159
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,920
Of course, I have something to do.

160
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,219
Don't you have your own classroom?

161
00:11:48,219 --> 00:11:50,840
Why do you keep visiting our class?

162
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,939
Is the first period after lunch English?

163
00:11:58,939 --> 00:12:00,140
What's wrong?

164
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,240
I'm doomed!

165
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,000
There's dictation!

166
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,980
I forgot to memorize them!

167
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,700
Hey, did you guys see an envelope?

168
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,540
An envelope?

169
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,480
Yeah.

170
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,960

171
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,379

172
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,379
What letter? That's our class fund!

173
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:14,419
The class fund is gone?

174
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,300
Yeah. I just went out to get the newspapers.

175
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,240
It was gone when I came back.

176
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,140
Don't be nervous. Look for it again.

177
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,620

I can't find it anywhere.

183
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,779
Don't jump to conclusions. It's serious if it involves theft.

184
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:41,580
That's right.

185
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:45,060
Hey, have you checked thoroughly?

186
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,899
I have been counting the fees during lunch.

187
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:51,219
Between that, I've only gone to the mart to buy a pen.

188
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,500
Then... I went to the Office of Academic Affairs to collect the newspapers.

189
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,880
The money was gone when I returned!

190
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,000
How long were you away?

191
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,880
Was there no one in the classroom?

192
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,220
I went out for... around ten minutes.

193
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,520
When I returned,

194
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,620
I only saw...

195
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,260
Su Zaizai alone.

196
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,780
- Stop crying.
- Okay.

197
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,179
Let's go check the security footage.

198
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,860
Okay.

199
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,760
Director Chang, calm down first.

200
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,379
Ye Zhenxin might have accidentally left the money somewhere.

201
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,160
Let's look for it again.

202
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,140
The security camera caught everything.

203
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,379
Ye Zhenxin has always been an exemplary student.

204
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,760
Why would she lie?

205
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,400
Hey, Director Chang!

206
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,340
Director Chang, you wanted to see me?

207
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:02,140
Su Zaizai. During the break, did you visit Class 1?

208
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,840
I did.

209
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,940
Why did you go there?

210
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,740
Did you go to see a teacher?

211
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,440
What happened?

212
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,399
The class fund for Class 1 is gone.

213
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,740
When we checked the CCTV,

214
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,820
you were the only one in Class 1 during the break.

215
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:30,840
So... Are you suspecting me of stealing the money?

216
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,040
I didn't steal it.

217
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,960
Director Chang.

218
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,499
I believe Su Zaizai won't steal anything.

219
00:14:38,499 --> 00:14:40,699
She has always been a good student. She is really helpful as well.

220
00:14:40,699 --> 00:14:44,679
Enough. During the break, did you visit Class 1?

221
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,780
Tell us.

222
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:50,540
What did you do in Class 1?

223
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:56,040
I went to see my friend, but he wasn't there.

224
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,099
Su Zaizai, during the lecture break,

225
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:03,739
didn't you treat several classmates to snacks in the mart today?

226
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:05,780
Where did that money come from?

227
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,820
What are you trying to say?

228
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,580
That's my own money.

229
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,340
I went to the mart before visiting your class.

230
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,860
Is there any relation between those two incidents?

231
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,680
I just want to clear up the misunderstandings.

232
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,259
Since you said that, you went there after me as well.

233
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:24,619
Doesn't that also make you a suspect?

234
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:25,779
What nonsense are you spouting?

235
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,560
That's impossible.

236
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,819
Ye Zhenxin went back to her own classroom.

237
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,339
Director Chang, I think it has nothing to do with which class I belong to.

238
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:36,600
If you suspect me of taking the money, Miss Ye Zhenxin

239
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,940
should bring out evidence to prove it.

240
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,120
I don't need to come up with evidence to prove my innocence.

241
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,820
Su Zaizai. We are all willing to believe you.

242
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,200
But you have to give us a reasonable explanation.

243
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,500
You're from Class 9.

244
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,280
Why aren't you resting in your classroom,

245
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,580
and instead, you visited Class 1?

246
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,740
She was there to see me.

247
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,540
Sometimes, falling for a person can happen in an instant.

248
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,299
I remember that moment clearly, it was a rainy day.

249
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,800
It was the moment he glanced over, the moment our eyes met.

250
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,239
But I never understood the reason.

251
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:46,839
The lucky thing is, I've never regretted it.

252
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,859
I've never regretted going to the mart when it was raining.

253
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,400
I've never regretted scolding him for no reason.

254
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,900
I've never regretted meeting him, and then falling for him.

255
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,580
She knew you were not in the classroom,

256
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,340
but she still entered your class.

257
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,100
Why is that so?

258
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,840
She was there to bring me notes.

259
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,420
Notes?

260
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,480
Su Zaizai tutored me before.

261
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,600
I know about that.

262
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,940
I asked her to do it.

263
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,520
I felt it was effective, so I asked her to tutor me.

264
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,420
She was there today to give me the notes.

265
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,240
Here are the notes.

266
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,919
Students helping each other out is a good thing.

267
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,459
You should've said it.

268
00:17:43,459 --> 00:17:44,260
That'd solve things.

269
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,219
But, Director Chang, we haven't found the class funds!

270
00:17:47,219 --> 00:17:50,139
Also, during that period,

271
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:52,840
Su Zaizai was indeed the only one in our classroom.

272
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,419
Then, after I left, you were also the only one in the class!

273
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:59,960
I discovered that the money was missing after I went back!

274
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,259
Also, if you weren't feeling guilty,

275
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:06,040
why didn't you explain things before Zhang Lurang was here?

276
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,640
I asked her to keep it a secret.

277
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,840
Because... I don't want others to know

278
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,700
how bad my English scores are

279
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,540
and that I need to be tutored by a student from a regular class.

280
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,419
Hey. That's not a good way to think.

281
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:26,699
What's wrong with a regular class?

282
00:18:26,699 --> 00:18:28,040
Everyone has their strengths.

283
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,020
Su Zaizai was kind enough to tutor you,

284
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,140
and she even got misunderstood.

285
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,240
You can't say it's a total misunderstanding.

286
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,280
Ye Zhenxin.

287
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,160
We do not have sufficient evidence

288
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,760
to prove Su Zaizai took the money.

289
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,979
Before the truth comes to light,

290
00:18:43,979 --> 00:18:47,499
if we spread baseless rumors just based on our speculations,

291
00:18:47,499 --> 00:18:49,820
wouldn't that hurt other students too?

292
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,040
Don't you think so?

293
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,779
That's right, Director Chang.

294
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:55,939
I feel we should investigate this properly.

295
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:57,299
You're right.

296
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:58,799
How about this, Ms. Zhang?

297
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,320
Return to the classroom first and search the classroom thoroughly.

298
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,279
Before we have any concrete clues,

299
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,080
we will not suspect any student.

300
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,560
Okay, Director Chang.

301
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,040
I will investigate this properly.

302
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,000
All right. Leave this matter to us teachers.

303
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,460
Head back first.

304
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,560
Let's go.

305
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,560
Wait.

306
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,200
Your notes.

307
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,199
They're pretty good.

308
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:24,399
Keep it up.

309
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:26,140
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

310
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,900
Su Zaizai.

311
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,060
You...

312
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,660
Why didn't you tell them just now?

313
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,080
That you were there to see me?

314
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,080
Didn't you say you don't want others to know you're struggling with English

315
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,320
and that you need to be tutored by a student from a regular class?

316
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,440
I think so too.

317
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,820
I'm worried you might feel embarrassed.

318
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,600
That's not it.

319
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,760
I don't think it's embarrassing.

320
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:15,080
I also don't want the teachers to misunderstand you.

321
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:21,960
However, I really don't know you were collecting class funds today.

322
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,840
And I don't know which one is Ye Zhenxin's seat.

323
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,260
I just wanted to put the notes on your table with the tidbits and coke.

324
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,360
Su Zaizai.

325
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,859
I believe you.

326
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:39,800
♫ It’s unexplainable ♫

327
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,979
The more I think about it, the angrier I feel.

328
00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:45,000
How could they interrogate you without any evidence?

329
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,520
I just hope they find the money quickly.

330
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,599
Otherwise, even if there is no evidence, they will still suspect me.

331
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:53,120
What if they really can't find it?

332
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,119
Can't they hold the person who lost the money responsible?

333
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,840
That makes sense.

334
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,680
Ye Zhenxin is not a kid.

335
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,360
How could she lose the funds like that?

336
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,000
Or is it that no matter what happens,

337
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,800
so long as you can cry and act sorry, it'll be fine?

338
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,380
Why don't you cry too?

339
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,180
Huh?

340
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,060
You should act pitiful too. Anyone could do that!

341
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,200
That's right.

342
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,060
You should cry too.

343
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,060
Cry! Cry!

344
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,919
Like this?

345
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,240
It's a little off, not real enough.

346
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,000
[Class 1, Grade 10]

347
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,579
Who stole it?

348
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,400
I heard it's Su Zaizai from Class 9.

349
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,360
So she stole it?

350
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,160
I think so.

351
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,820
Didn't you see her steal it that day?

352
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,040
What are you guys talking about?

353
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,440
The tri-city joint examination is right around the corner, you know!

354
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,060
Must you talk during class?

355
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,680
About the class funds, please refrain from talking too much about it.

356
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,480
Let's all look for it after class.

357
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,319
Even if we can't find it, the teachers will handle it.

358
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:20,720
Just focus on your studies.

359
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,760
Help me pass it.

360
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,500
What is this?

361
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,260
What is this? Pass it back.

362
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,820
[I think it's her, we should get it from her!]

363
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,919
[Have you heard? We lost our class fund. Over 2,000 yuan!]

364
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,520
[It's said that a girl from Class 9 came. Don't know what she was here for.]

365
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,460
Jiang Jiang!

366
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,521
- Jiang Jiang!
- Huh?

367
00:23:26,521 --> 00:23:27,981
Are you heading home straight after school?

368
00:23:27,981 --> 00:23:30,160
- If it's not urgent...
- Zai, you can head home first. I have something to do.

369
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,460
Be careful on your way back!

370
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:14,360
Auntie, where is Class 1's placed today?

371
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,880
We have so much trash every day.

372
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,959
How would we know?

373
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:18,880
We dumped them together.

374
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,979
Oh, but...

375
00:24:19,979 --> 00:24:21,740
All trash from Grade 10 is there.

376
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,680
There's another heap there as well.

377
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,760
Thank you!

378
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,600
It's all right.

379
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,519
I don't see it here either!

380
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:40,620
Search more thoroughly!

381
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,620
Zhang Lurang, take that one.

382
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,160
Su Zaizai.

383
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,440
What do you mean by Su Zaizai?

384
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,279
♫ slowly blew past your left ear and whispered something to you ♫

385
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,439
♫ slowly blew past your left ear and whispered something to you ♫

386
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,260
♫ slowly blew past your left ear and whispered something to you ♫

387
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:24,020
♫ The balcony is filled with hibiscus blooming in midsummer ♫

388
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,740
♫ The balcony is filled with hibiscus blooming in midsummer ♫

389
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:31,870
♫ And there is a soul that is anxious when it's about to meet you ♫

390
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,880
That sundae was quite yummy.

391
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,550
Let's go after class.

392
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,180
Sure.

393
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,520
After class.

394
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,560
Class Rep.

395
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,140
Did you find the class fund?

396
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,880
No.

397
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,899
I thought you found it.

398
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,539
Since you seem so relaxed.

399
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,840
That's right.

400
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,780
You're acting like we're the ones who lost it.

401
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,579
I helped to collect the class funds.

402
00:25:55,579 --> 00:25:57,880
Now you want to blame me when it's gone?

403
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,400
Ye Zhenxin.

404
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,079
Won't you think it over again?

405
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,120
Could it be that you misplaced it?

406
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,041
I don't understand.

407
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:16,441
Why do you guys trust someone from another class this much?

408
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,160
Okay. So you guys don't believe me?

409
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,600
Come. Search it yourself.

410
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,800
You'd better find it!

411
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,960
Otherwise, I...

412
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,380
"I"?

413
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,340
"I" what?

414
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,800
What's in the book?

415
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,030
it's in her book.

416
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,020
Is that the class fund?

417
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,380
Do you really want us to look for it ourselves?

418
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,120
It's really with her!

419
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,560
She hid it, didn't she?

420
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,839
Don't slander me!

421
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,499
I really couldn't find it yesterday!

422
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,160
Who knows... Who knows if Su Zaizai put it back herself?

423
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,760
Ye Zhenxin.

424
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,120
Rumors are scary.

425
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,000
Haven't you realized that?

426
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,620
I'm sorry, Zhang Lurang.

427
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,160
I dragged you into this by accident.

428
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,760
I'm really sorry.

429
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,000
You shouldn't apologize to me.

430
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,160
You owe Su Zaizai an apology.

431
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,260
It's found!

432
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,919
What's found?

433
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:41,920
That thing!

434
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,820
Class 1's class fund!

435
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,459
They found it in their own class!

436
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,579
That's great. Your innocence has been proven!

437
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,601
How did they find it?

438
00:27:47,601 --> 00:27:48,939
I was just getting there.

439
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,360
It's so dramatic!

440
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,960
It was right inside their class rep's bag!

441
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,479
They found it on the spot!

442
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:57,259
She totally made a fool of herself.

443
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:57,921
Huh?

444
00:27:57,921 --> 00:27:59,560
Why didn't they find it before then?

445
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,600
She never checked it properly.

446
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,979
That's too much!

447
00:28:02,979 --> 00:28:04,560
The money was with her all along.

448
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,939
How could she say you took it without any hesitation?

449
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,540
Yeah.

450
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,400
I'll head out for a bit.

451
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,260
Zaizai, where are you going?

452
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,681
You're skipping your break?

453
00:28:11,681 --> 00:28:12,859
I need an apology.

454
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,880
I'll go with you!

455
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,060
Do you need this many people to watch?

456
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,979
It's break time. There are people everywhere.

457
00:28:28,979 --> 00:28:30,940
If you prefer for it, we could go to the teacher's office

458
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,200
and talk in private.

459
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,740
We'll do this here, then.

460
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,180
I'm sorry.

461
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,880
All right?

462
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,720
You call that an apology?

463
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,440
You didn't even look into my eyes.

464
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,161
Okay.

465
00:28:46,161 --> 00:28:47,760
I'll say it again.

466
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,959
I am sorry.

467
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:51,480
Surely you've heard it now?

468
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,739
I heard it.

469
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,020
But I don't accept it.

470
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,800
What do you mean?

471
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,280
"I'm sorry" and "It's fine"

472
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,160
are sincere words spoken to correct mistakes and hurt.

473
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,040
They are not words that you now speak carelessly of

474
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,700
to pretend that mistakes didn't occur.

475
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,160
If that's the case, I'm sorry.

476
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,980
I don't accept it.

477
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,180
Su Zaizai!

478
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,419
That girl's pretty cool.

479
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,440
What's her name?

480
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,240
Hey, Zhang Lurang.

481
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,120
Let's have dinner at my place!

482
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,479
My grandma's been talking about

483
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:35,680
letting you guys try her new dish.

484
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,000
Tonight?

485
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,800
Yeah, let's go!

486
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,641
It's the weekend tomorrow anyway.

487
00:29:38,641 --> 00:29:41,640
Yeah. I've told Su Zaizai and the rest too.

488
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,440
Okay.

489
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,880
Actually, it's really thanks to Guan Fang and the guys.

490
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,919
No matter how the others suspected me,

491
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:53,960
they've always believed me.

492
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,519
They even helped me find the money in the end.

493
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:58,840
I am grateful to them a lot.

494
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,760
Boys this age are like that.

495
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,679
They look childish, but instead of speaking nice words,

496
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:11,260
they prefer to show it with action.

497
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,180
Here.

498
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,100
Eat slowly, all right?

499
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,620
I'll head to the other street for some ingredients.

500
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,781
Grandma, I'll go with you!

501
00:30:28,781 --> 00:30:30,699
No need. I can go there myself.

502
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,200
Just keep your friends company.

503
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,400
Take whatever you need.

504
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,000
Okay.

505
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,880
You guys... What did you talk about?

506
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,860
Nothing.

507
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,659
Here. Cheers!

508
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:47,760
I'll treat everyone to the amusement park tomorrow!

509
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,440
Bottoms up! Cheers!

510
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,379
Ah, right.

511
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:57,160
Who asked Ye Zhenxin to check her bag?

512
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,140
Didn't she insist that it was not in her bag?

513
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,860
I think it was...

514
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,040
Them two!

515
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,540
Was it us?

516
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,700
I don't really remember.

517
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,639
No matter who it was, I thank you guys.

518
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,361
I am actually pretty touched.

519
00:31:17,361 --> 00:31:20,080
We usually fool around. Being all serious like this

520
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,139
feels so weird.

521
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,540
Also, didn't people always cry during such moments in dramas?

522
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,520
You didn't cry at all.

523
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,579
This is nothing.

524
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:31,181
Here, cry!

525
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:33,999
I'm telling you guys. Zaizai is really good at pretending to cry.

526
00:31:33,999 --> 00:31:36,139
She'd shiver a bit and shake her shoulders.

527
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,120
She could also...

528
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,160
That's hard to believe.

529
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,220
Was it that real?

530
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,160
It was.

531
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,280
Huh?

532
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,260
Have you seen it?

533
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,200
Are you angry because I pretended to cry?

534
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,499
No.

535
00:32:02,499 --> 00:32:05,060
What is on your mind, then?

536
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,720
Well...

537
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,579
In the teacher's office, Ye Zhenxin cried,

538
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,180
so the teachers all sided with her.

539
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,159
Since you're good at pretending to cry,

540
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,000
why did you only fume?

541
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,580
Why should I cry?

542
