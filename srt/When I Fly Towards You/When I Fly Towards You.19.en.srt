[Episode 19]

13
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,379
Summer Market?

14
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,579
Yes.

15
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,579
Rang Rang said there will be a market at Haiyue Square tomorrow.

16
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,740
He said he wanted to go together.

17
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,159
What do you think of confessing to him using this opportunity?

18
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,059
Is it proper?

19
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,100
Why not?

20
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,160
I think so too.

21
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,739
Well, Zaizai.

22
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,379
If you confess now,

23
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,260
what if Zhang Lurang doesn't go to the same university as you?

24
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,780
It'll be four years.

25
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,139
Whatever.

26
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,579
Anywhere can be reached by train or plane.

27
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,900
Do you think we won't meet each other?

28
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,380
I envy your courage.

29
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,579
Zaizai, I've always had a question for you.

30
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,880
Why are you so sure that you like Zhang Lurang?

31
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,640
Am I not the person who should know best about who I like?

32
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,979
When he is happy, I'm happier than him.

33
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,939
When he is upset, I'm also upset.

34
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,779
With him around, I don't find Mathematics questions difficult.

35
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,780
Once he's not around, even the holiday feels long.

36
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,079
Liking someone means caring for him.

37
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:33,220
Jiang Jiang, have you felt this before?

38
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,900
No.

39
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,880
Not even with Brother Qianyu.

40
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,819
I only think he is great.

41
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,979
He can solve any trouble well, no matter what it is.

42
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,920
He is different from a clumsy person like me,

43
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,520
so I idolize him.

44
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,180
However, you might not know it sometimes if you like someone.

45
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:01,179
I read on the internet that your subconscious won't lie to you.

46
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,820
Jiang Jiang. When was the last time you felt your heart racing?

47
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,939
You thought about someone, right?

48
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,300
Who is it? Do I know him?

49
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,640
Oh, no! Didn't you plan to confess?

50
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,880
Do you know what you are going to say?

51
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,480
No.

52
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,000
Help me see which clothes I'm going to wear.

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,479
There's no rush in deciding your outfit.

54
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:28,779
I think we need a detailed plan

55
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,620
to make sure everything goes well.

56
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,800
Well, the idol dramas I've watched all these years are finally useful.

57
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,219
Jiang Jiang, I think I'm a little nervous.

58
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,520
Well, don't be.

59
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,659
Remember the few points I told you.

60
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,300
You'll definitely make it.

61
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,579
Hey, he's here.

62
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,240
I'm going.

63
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,379
Step one.

64
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,499
Change the way you speak.

65
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,579
Speak softly and in a coquettish way.

66
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,859
Act cute.

67
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,979
More importantly, call him "Brother."

68
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,480
Many guys like that.

69
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,139
Rang Rang.

70
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,380
Over here.

71
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,919
Have you been waiting for a long time?

72
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,040
No. I just arrived.

73
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,300
Brother Rang, let's go.

74
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,120
Su Zaizai.

75
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,300
Yes?

76
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,380
Act normal.

77
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,039
Yes.

78
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,919
Well, my throat was not feeling well.

79
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:45,200
It's feeling much better now.

80
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,700
Let's go.

81
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,780
[Summer Market]

82
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,699
Step two.

83
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,779
Create physical contact opportunities.

84
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,459
For example, you can accidentally touch his arm

85
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,139
or fall into his embrace.

86
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,680
Then, you will feel your heart racing.

87
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,339
That was close, Rang Rang.

88
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,280
I'm glad you are around.

89
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,880
Are you all right?

90
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,619
How... How?

91
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,499
Thankfully, I was quick to react.

92
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,339
Look how skinny you are.

93
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,180
You'd have been badly hurt if you had fallen.

94
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,620
Sorry.

95
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,019
Are you all right?

96
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,520
I'm fine.

97
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,460
Let's walk on the side.

98
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,700
Okay.

99
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,219
The most important third step.

100
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,499
Signaling.

101
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,739
A confession requires foreshadowing.

102
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,979
You need to let him know what you think.

103
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,780
Confessing after that increases your success rate.

104
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,740
What's wrong?

105
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,360
Rang Rang. I've been very stressed recently.

106
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,139
My parents want me to get married before 30.

107
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,139
That means I have to get engaged at 29

108
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,939
and meet my partner's parents at 28.

109
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,379
I think being in a relationship for ten years sounds about right.

110
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,680
It means I'll need to start dating at 18.

111
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,280
You'll be 19 in a few months.

112
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,640
Can you make it?

113
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,579
Well...

114
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,040
I think I can accept being in a relationship for nine years.

115
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,420
Oh, Rang Rang.

116
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,380
Are you an Aries?

117
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,299
When I read the horoscope book yesterday,

118
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,939
it said that Aries is a good match for Sagittarius.

119
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,179
Coincidentally, I am a Sagittarius.

120
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,179
I'm celebrating my birthday on the lunar calendar.

121
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,140
If it's the normal calendar,

122
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,880
I'm a Pisces.

123
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,140
I don't think the horoscope is accurate.

124
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,019
If all of these don't work,

125
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,379
you'll have to use your ultimate move.

126
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,979
I have a distant relative who lost his job two days ago.

127
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:41,379
He will be opening a tarot shop at the market today.

128
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,379
I already told him about it.

129
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,419
Bring Zhang Lurang over.

130
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,980
You will definitely succeed with his help.

131
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,979
The horoscope is not accurate,

132
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,699
but I know someone who is really good at tarot card reading.

133
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,779
Since the fireworks won't start any sooner,

134
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,979
let's go there and take a look first.

135
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,179
Really good at it?

136
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,400
That's right. He is very reliable.

137
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,579
Coming to me is the right choice.

138
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,819
I'm famous in my village for tarot card reading.

139
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,099
Let's just talk about what happened last month.

140
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,979
Erniu, who was living beside my house, had the flu.

141
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,840
I told him he would recover within a week.

142
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,520
Do you know what happened next?

143
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,139
He recovered in less than a week.

144
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,739
Those who have seen my ability will always say

145
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,520
I'm very accurate.

146
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,179
What is your name?

147
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,280
My surname is Hao.

148
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,600
My name is Zhun.
(T/N: It means "very accurate")

149
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,490
Okay then!

150
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,779
Since we met here, it means we are fated.

151
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:58,780
Why don't I simply take a look for you two?

152
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,780
Here.

153
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,300
Pick a card with your feeling.

154
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
This one?

155
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,900
Oh.

156
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,960
Oh, my!

157
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,120
This is an amazing card.

158
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:20,080
Looking at this card, I can see that you are a very lucky person.

159
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,179
You will also bring your luck to the people around you,

160
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,980
especially people who are close.

161
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:39,099
Whoever becomes your boyfriend in the future must be very happy.

162
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,540
Hey, pick a card.

163
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,840
Oh.

164
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,580
This one.

165
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,920
This is amazing.

166
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,659
It's great.

167
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,059
Let me tell you.

168
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:59,539
From this card, I can see what your future girlfriend looks like.

169
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,640
She...

170
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,640
She... I think she

171
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,340
has bangs and bright eyes, and she's wearing pink.

172
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:24,200
Can you see what her name is?

173
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,480
Of course.

174
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,140
What is your name?

175
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:37,640
Su Zaizai.

176
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,140
Louder. I can't hear you.

177
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,080
Why are you looking at me? She couldn't be Su Zaizai, could she?

178
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,080
Yes! Her name is Su Zaizai!

179
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,400
It's too obvious.

180
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,720
I think it's okay.

181
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,500
Whatever. I've tried my best. Just leave it to fate.

182
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,520
Jiang Jia?

183
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,419
Why are you here too?

184
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,939
I promised to meet He Yu and the rest here.

185
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,680
Brother Gu Ran, is this your friend?

186
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,699
Oh.

187
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,379
She is the daughter of my mother's colleague.

188
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,200
They are eating around here, so I took her here.

189
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,360
We are childhood friends.

190
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,560
We only got to know each other last year.

191
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,440
We already know each other for so long?

192
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,719
Since you are Gu Ran's friend,

193
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:35,299
do you know if he has anyone he likes?

194
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,900
He wouldn't tell me even if I asked him.

195
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,341
- He...
- I do.

196
00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:41,100
I have someone I like.

197
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,040
The person I like is her.

198
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,019
You can't simply say that.

199
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,320
I didn't.

200
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,059
She might not be the most outstanding person.

201
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,560
She likes to hop around singing out-of-tune songs.

202
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,099
She'd be too sad to eat because of a bad ending in a novel.

203
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,900
When she is angry, I can't even stand her.

204
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,340
However, when she smiles,

205
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,800
she is the only person I see.

206
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,459
I've made it clear to you.

207
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,220
Can I go now?

208
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,360
Did you reward me for using me as a shield?

209
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,500
That was an emergency.

210
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,360
Fine. What reward do you want?

211
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,040
I'll give it to you later.

212
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,760
I'm not that petty.

213
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,619
My friend just helped me.

214
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,000
Can you help patronize his business?

215
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,459
Your friend?

216
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,520
Who is it? Where do you know him?

217
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,599
Do you know his details?

218
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:07,440
A distant relative.

219
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,600
It's fine then.

220
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,460
Let me see.

221
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,900
That's...

222
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,000
Both of you have a deep fate.

223
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,819
This card is the Lovers.

224
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,619
It represents a choice in love.

225
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,320
That means one of you is troubled by love.

226
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,859
Can you ever stop the nonsense? You even lied to me.

227
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,979
No.

228
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,939
Hey.

229
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,099
Be honest with me. Did Jiang Jia bribe you?

230
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,819
You're taking advantage of me.

231
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,619
I'm the one who gets the short end of the stick.

232
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,859
I can't see that.

233
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,860
That's because you are blind.

234
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:49,059
When I go to university, people will be queuing to pursue me.

235
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,180
Can any one of them be compared to me?

236
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,020
He Yu and the rest are here.

237
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,560
I'm leaving.

238
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,979
Hey, was what you said about fate true?

239
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,380
Do you wish it's true or not?

240
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,699
Enough. Forget it.

241
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,620
I shouldn't have taken it so seriously.

242
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,060
I wish you good business.

243
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,100
Thank you.

244
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,200
Why does it feel like he is cursing me?

245
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,060
Really?

246
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,120
What if he confesses to you?

247
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,259
I don't think I will accept it.

248
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:37,140
What about you?

249
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:40,460
What do you do if a good friend confesses to you?

250
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,419
I won't date one of my good friends.

251
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,899
I think it's not easy being friends.

252
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,579
What if something happens after we start dating?

253
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,379
It'll be awkward if we can't even be friends.

254
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,600
Yes. You are right.

255
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,260
Hey, Gu Ran.

256
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,219
What a coincidence.

257
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,260
You can buy us ice cream.

258
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,859
I'm only buying ice creams for Fu Yao and the rest.

259
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,899
You just get lucky that you are with them.

260
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,260
So petty.

261
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,219
There are no clouds tonight.

262
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,280
I'm sure the fireworks will be nice.

263
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,960
There should be some time until the fireworks display.

264
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,779
Let's play a game.

265
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,140
Sure.

266
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,819
There's a game going viral on the internet.

267
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,219
Let me give you a test.

268
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,579
The rule is simple.

269
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,200
Use three words to form a sentence.

270
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,760
All right.

271
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,600
First question.

272
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,859
Su Zaizai.

273
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,960
Su Su.

274
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,300
Cute.

275
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,800
Su Zaizai

276
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,900
is jealous that Su Su is cuter than her.

277
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,739
What?

278
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,800
It should be Su Zaizai is cuter than Su Su.

279
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,200
You can also say Su Zaizai is as cute as Su Su.

280
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,300
Second question.

281
00:16:04,301 --> 00:16:07,459
Every day. Meet. Cake.

282
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:12,220
If you eat cake every day, you will meet the doctor.

283
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,219
You are not wrong,

284
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:19,459
but the first sentence I can think of is "Meeting you every day

285
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,000
is as sweet as eating a cake."

286
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,440
Third question.

287
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,800
Su Su. Jelly. Angry.

288
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,820
Su Su...

289
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,940
Ate my jelly, so I'm angry.

290
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,240
You are so petty.

291
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,699
No.

292
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,200
I kept asking you questions. You should ask me a question too.

293
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,699
Let me tell you.

294
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,499
I'm good at this game.

295
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,860
You can give me a difficult one.

296
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,579
Zhang Lurang...

297
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,240
Likes...

298
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,300
Su Zaizai.

299
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:19,000
Do you think I've been confident in doing everything?

300
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,140
Yes.

301
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,800
It's not right.

302
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,900
For example, being honest with you.

303
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,739
Honest...

304
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,940
Honest... about what?

305
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,040
♫ She opens the windows of the room in summer ♫

306
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,861
I like you.

307
00:17:35,861 --> 00:17:39,120
♫ She opens the windows of the room in summer ♫

308
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:47,239
♫ The surface of the ocean is golden ♫

309
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:56,179
♫ From far away, you are waiting for me to set sail ♫

310
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:03,039
♫ To find the treasure ♫

311
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,400
I think we can check our scores tomorrow.

312
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,640
Yes.

313
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,639
- Are you nervous?
- N-Nervous?

314
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,459
What's there to be nervous about?

315
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,000
It's just being in a relationship.

316
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,440
I'm talking about our scores.

317
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:34,160
I think there shouldn't be a problem.

318
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,499
Don't you have many things to say usually?

319
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,240
Why are you so quiet today?

320
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:52,700
I don't speak much usually.

321
00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:00,459
I remember there's a food street behind East China University that's quite famous.

322
00:19:00,459 --> 00:19:02,419
We must visit it.

323
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,400
Let's go together.

324
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:24,040
♫ I guess I’ve fallen in love with you ♫

325
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,720
♫ Without any reason ♫

326
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,900
♫ It’s unexplainable ♫

327
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:38,640
♫ I guess it must be the hand of destiny ♫

328
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,340
♫ That brought you into my life ♫

329
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,680
♫ The best version of you ♫

330
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,160
I'm in a relationship with Rang Rang!

331
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,720
Am I dreaming?

332
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,400
♫ You’re the reason I believe in love ♫

333
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,220
Calm down, Su Zaizai.

334
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,099
Isn't this normal?

335
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,139
Don't be so excited.

336
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,700
I'm sure Rang Rang is very calm.

337
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,560
♫ Even if it makes it hard for me to let go ♫

338
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,499
Rang Rang, are you asleep?

339
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:09,139
♫ Too scared to tell you, “I love you” ♫

340
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,200
A'Rang, pour me a glass.

341
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,540
♫ But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore ♫

342
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,920
♫ I believe you'll walk to me step by step ♫

343
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,539
♫ I believe you will come to know the true me ♫

344
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:27,559
♫ Just like the moon and the sunset ♫

345
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,000
A'Rang!

346
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,300
Why are you so happy?

347
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,700
Did something happy happen to you?

348
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,640
♫ I want to give you a perfect encounter ♫

349
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,859
Water!

350
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,060
Oh.

351
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:49,720
♫ Thank you for getting into my heart ♫

352
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,539
♫ I believe you'll walk to me step by step ♫

353
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,199
Rang Rang, are you asleep?

354
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:58,820
♫ I believe you will come to know the true me ♫

355
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,019
♫ Just like the moon and the sunset ♫

356
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,620
I don't think

357
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,920
I can sleep.

358
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,279
♫ They come in turn but never miss each other ♫

359
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:10,000
♫ I want to give you a perfect encounter ♫

360
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,619
♫ I believe I'll pass by unintentionally ♫

361
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:17,200
♫ For love, we should be brave ♫

362
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,360
♫ Thank you for getting into my heart ♫

363
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,920
What time is it?

364
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,339
Ten seconds to go.

365
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:28,779
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

366
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,120
You can check it now.

367
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,840
Hurry.

368
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,040
[Exam Results | Su Zaizai | Total Score: 586]

369
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,620
It's 586!

370
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,100
Dad! I've never gotten such a high score!

371
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,940
Mom, pinch me! Quickly!

372
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,899
There's no need.

373
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,499
My daughter is the best.

374
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,059
I must call your homeroom teacher.

375
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,379
He asked about your result in the morning.

376
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,980
Let me buy some ingredients and celebrate tonight.

377
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,039
Rang Rang. I can go to East China University!

378
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,599
Did Rang Rang get a bad result?

379
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:25,760
I'm downstairs.

380
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,260
Rang Rang!

381
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,620
Did you check your result too?

382
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,659
I thought about it.

383
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,819
Going to which university isn't important.

384
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,699
The distance is not a problem. I can...

385
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,979
I think the distance between the male dorms and female dorms isn't that far.

386
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,680
Rang Rang.

387
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,320
I'll be in charge of your life at the university for four years.

388
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,100
Zhang Lurang, what do you think about that?

389
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,660
I'm honored.

390
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,280
I want to write down all the things

391
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,779
I want to do with you before the university starts

392
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,360
and complete them one by one.

393
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,500
What is the first thing?

394
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,300
Watch the sunrise.

395
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,400
There's no need to wait for so long.

396
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,820
Let's go together.

397
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,480
Watch the sunrise.

398
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,940
No.

399
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,660
A date between two people.

400
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,099
It's the right time.

401
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,019
If we go now, we might be able to rent a good tent.

402
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,300
Let's go.

403
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,600
Well...

404
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,659
What's wrong?

405
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,739
Hurry!

406
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,380
Help me install the light.

407
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,600
How can you camp without this?

408
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,659
Gu... Gu Ran?

409
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,820
Why are you stuttering after a few days?

410
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,000
He came to my house and saw me packing.

411
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,579
I knew you were trying to give me a surprise,

412
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,379
but it's better to tell me beforehand about camping

413
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,320
so we can get prepared.

414
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,700
Did you say we?

415
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,680
Zaizai!

416
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,419
When Gu Ran told me that, I knew he would spoil your plan.

417
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,339
It's all right. I'm here.

418
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,800
I'll help you get rid of him.

419
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,500
What a relief.

420
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,760
Let's go then.

421
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,060
Wait. Someone's not here yet.

422
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,100
Hey.

423
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,820
If I'm not here, all of you will have to suffer.

424
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,400
Don't move.

425
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,880
What are you looking at?

426
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,980
Why is there such a senseless person?

427
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,100
Here you go.

428
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,400
Gu Ran.

429
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,219
What?

430
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,860
I have something I need help with. Come and help me.

431
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,600
Oh.

432
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,760
As expected.

433
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,260
With great power comes great responsibility.

434
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,420
I'm going there.

435
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,280
Call me if you need me.

436
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,460
I'm not in a bad mood.

437
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,960
I just want to make you happy.

438
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:57,280
Are we going to look at the stars tonight?

439
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,700
Sure.

440
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,459
I didn't expect the stars here to be so pretty.

441
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,360
Why didn't I realize the stars were so big previously?

442
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,560
Gu Ran.

443
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,520
Jiang Jia?

444
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,080
Are you here to look at the stars too?

445
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,260
You look like a star yourself.

446
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,579
I just realized my torch is broken.

447
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,260
I'm sure you can fix it since you are so great.

448
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,620
You have good taste.

449
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,610
Lead the way, Xiao Jia.

450
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:10,610
It's my first time finding Gu Ran so annoying.

451
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:24,450
How surprising. You do know how to fix it.

452
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:28,050
I have many things that can still surprise you.

453
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,009
How is it?

454
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,729
Do you think I'm very handsome now?

455
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,570
How narcissistic.

456
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,410
Give me that.

457
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:47,470
♫ The gentle summer breeze ♫

458
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:50,509
♫ slowly blew past your left ear and whispered something to you ♫

459
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:53,470
♫ slowly blew past your left ear and whispered something to you ♫

460
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,649
♫ The balcony is filled with hibiscus blooming in midsummer ♫

461
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,150
Your hair is messy.

462
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,790
♫ The balcony is filled with hibiscus blooming in midsummer ♫

463
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:05,690
♫ And there is a soul that is anxious when it's about to meet you ♫

464
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:07,630
When I'm not around in the future,

465
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,889
who will help you when you're so clumsy?

466
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,310
You won't be going too far anyway.

467
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:17,010
♫ Does meeting me make you happy too? ♫

468
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:18,609
I'm going abroad.

469
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:21,110
Even if you are going abroad...

470
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:26,670
♫ I dream of castles and colorful whirpools ♫

471
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:30,209
♫ When the wind by the sea hears you say you like me too ♫

472
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:33,049
Is this another joke?

473
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,030
This is not funny.

474
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,410
No.

475
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:40,970
I discussed it with my parents for a long time.

476
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:44,010
This foreign exchange opportunity is very important.

477
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,870
I want to take a look.

478
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:51,330
That's great.

479
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,550
Then...

480
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:00,010
Have you told Zhang Lurang and the rest?

481
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,809
No.

482
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,270
Days later, perhaps.

483
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:08,110
I'm sure they will be shocked when they find out this.

484
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,410
Slowly.

485
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,530
What's wrong?

486
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,609
I'm so happy.

487
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,670
It feels unreal.

488
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,549
You won't escape if I hold you.

489
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:24,610
It feels a lot better.

490
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,730
No.

491
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,310
Don't you feel cold?

492
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:37,629
This development is too fast.

493
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:39,610
It's like dreaming.

494
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,909
Su Zaizai.

495
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:47,310
I know you want me to act normal again.

496
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,670
Come inside.

497
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,929
My Rang Rang is so smart.

498
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:59,350
I don't feel cold like this.

499
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:11,110
Is the toilet over here?

500
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:27,370
I don't know when we will meet again after I go overseas this time.

501
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,410
- I...
- Gu Ran!

502
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:37,009
Are you saying something behind my back?

503
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,870
Let me hear it too.

504
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,570
It's nothing.

505
00:31:40,571 --> 00:31:42,049
Gu Ran was helping me fix the torch.

506
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,490
What's wrong?

507
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,850
What did I want to tell you?

508
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,990
Oh, right!

509
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,649
Let me tell you.

510
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,809
Something's wrong with this place.

511
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:57,849
I saw two people hugging outside.

512
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,910
When I looked closely,

513
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:04,050
it looked like a person with two heads.

514
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:06,090
That's so scary.

515
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:09,650
Something's wrong indeed.

516
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,039
Something's wrong in your head.

517
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,639
You don't believe me?

518
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,799
I saw it clearly.

519
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,360
That person was wearing a black jacket.

520
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,559
Just like this.

521
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:27,199
The other head is a female with long hair.

522
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,100
As long as hers.

523
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,519
I made a mistake.

524
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,039
I saw nothing.

525
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,520
I didn't see anything.

526
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,499
I made a mistake.

527
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:49,439
It's late. Go back to sleep.

528
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,999
We need to watch the sunrise tomorrow.

529
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,600
Yes. Let's go.

530
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,500
Then,

531
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,240
I'm going back too.

532
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,860
Okay.

533
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,660
What's wrong with them?

534
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,460
They were triggered.

535
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,359
Don't you have anything to say?

536
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,620
When did it happen?

537
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,360
You hid it without telling me.

538
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,900
Did I?

539
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,240
You...

540
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,800
Not really.

541
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,381
You can be in a relationship,

542
00:33:43,381 --> 00:33:45,820
but you must promise me one thing.

543
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,860
You must never tell my grandma this.

544
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:55,720
I can foresee how hard it is for me to be in a relationship.

545
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,999
If my grandma finds out you have a girlfriend now,

546
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,460
she will be disappointed with me and torture me more.

547
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,400
I'm serious. Why are you playing with your phone?

548
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,240
I'm saying goodnight to her.

549
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,400
I can't keep this conversation going anymore.

550
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,620
I'm going abroad.

551
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,399
Is this another joke?

552
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,840
This is not funny.

553
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,719
No.

554
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,959
I discussed it with my parents for a long time.

555
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,000
This foreign exchange opportunity is very important.

556
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,760
I want to take a look.

557
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:14,100
It's my first time waking up so early just to watch the sunrise.

558
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,159
I suddenly realized we watched many sunsets before,

559
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,719
and we watched the sunrise today.

560
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,199
Are we ending what we started?

561
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,920
Knock on wood.

562
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,140
We still have a long way to go.

563
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,960
This is not the end.

564
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,480
You are right. It's not over yet.

565
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,899
The results are out.

566
00:35:39,899 --> 00:35:42,540
Have you decided where you want to go?

567
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,590
Both of us applied for East China University.

568
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,850
It's already been planned for a long time.

569
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,970
What about you?

570
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,890
Me?

571
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,209
Do you remember Yong'an where we went to?

572
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,929
I'll be there for four years.

573
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:59,209
Not bad.

574
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:01,710
Yong'an University is famous for its economics courses.

575
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:05,190
Sure. Who do you think I am?

576
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:16,190
The sun is there.

577
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:30,750
This is great.

578
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:34,710
We all have our own goals and directions to work hard toward.

579
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:37,009
I hope the next time we watch the sunrise,

580
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:39,870
we will become better people.

581
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,010
We will.

582
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:57,950
The next time we meet, we'll have to say, "It's been a long time!"

583
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:05,470
Go somewhere further and see a brighter light!

584
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:09,250
The sunrise is so pretty!

[To Jiang Jia]

586
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,809
You didn't expect me to write you a letter, right?

587
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,250
I'm surprised too.

588
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,249
It's obvious

589
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:52,169
how difficult it is for someone bad at language to write this,

590
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,190
so please don't laugh at me.

591
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,729
Let me guess.

592
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:57,969
When you are reading this letter,

593
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,449
you should be preparing your daily necessities in your dorm.

594
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,650
As for me, I should be at the airport already.

595
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:05,390
Please have your ticket ready to board.

596
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,249
I didn't tell all of you

597
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,670
because I was afraid when I saw you...

598
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:18,320
When I saw all of you, I would be reluctant to leave.

♫ The mark on uniforms ♫

600
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,189
However, it's different if I tell you.

601
00:38:22,189 --> 00:38:23,449
You are so smart.

602
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:26,969
When they are mad, you can help me calm them down at least.

603
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:30,150
Days ago, I watched a movie and learned a sentence.

604

♫ Curtians flowing slightly as we did our revision and school selection ♫

605

♫ Summer has gone by ♫

607
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,870
To make it simple, when I first met all of you,

608
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:43,249
I knew we would get along well.

609
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,850
The truth is that my intuition is correct.

610
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,870
I remember when we got punished together during military training.

611
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,150
The rubbish dumps we searched through.

612
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:56,129
The sunrise, sunset, fireworks, and snow we watched together,

613
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:59,050
and three years of wishing each other a happy new year.

614
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,890
♫ The summer belonging to us ♫

615
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:03,529
I'm happy to have all of you in my youth,

616
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:07,329
but there is a saying that life is like a train journey.

617
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:09,489
Someone has to leave at certain stations.

618
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:11,609
Guan Fang chose Economics.

619
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,990
You insisted on studying Journalism.

620
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:16,450
Su Zaizai and A'Rang are finally together.

621
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:18,609
It's so great.

622
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,409
I believe everyone will one day

623
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:22,650
meet somewhere higher in the future.

624
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:28,550
I'm not worried about everyone else.

625
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,350
I only think

626
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:35,689
you look courageous sometimes, but you are timid sometimes.

627
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:38,450
I'm sure you are very nervous now that you are alone.

628
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:41,009
Do you still remember what I said?

629
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:43,009
Go ahead.

630
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,449
It's dark in front.

631
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:46,449
If you are afraid, just call my name.

632
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,550
My name will give you strength.

633
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,710
♫ Butterflies in my stomach ♫

634
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:56,110

635
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,249
that they can eat well, drink well,

636
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,489
and sleep well every day in the future.

637
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:00,870
I hope they can always have choices

638
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,950
and everyone they meet will be passionate.

639
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,849
Even if we are miles apart,

640
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:07,770
we will still shine when we don't see each other.

641
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:10,310
♫ Because I think of you sometimes ♫

642

That's all.

644
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:17,310
If I write any more,

645
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:19,870
I might not bring myself to leave.

646
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:22,270
Finally, let me confirm this again.

647
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,870
No matter where I am,

648
