What on Earth did you pack in your bag? It's heavy.

17
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:45,280

It's the 20th today.

Then let us leave something behind at least.

I used to be clueless and had a distorted understanding of this world.

63
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,340
Then I met a group of people, including everyone here,

64
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,939

65
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:06,720

00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,920
Just get back to your work.

184
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,219
Please calm down.

185
00:11:58,219 --> 00:12:00,619
The ingredients we use are delivered on the same day.

186
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,699
We've never had such a situation before.

187
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,080
We also ordered the mango pomelo sago.

188
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,080
There's no problem at all.

189
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,100
If I say this is spoiled, it's spoiled.

190
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,879
Ah, I see. How about this?

191
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:18,200
You don't have to pay for this.

192
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,680
How about that?

193
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,459
We ate something at your place today.

194
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:24,520
If it gives us food poisoning,

195
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,299
we'll have to go to the hospital.

196
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:28,720
So what are you going to do about the medical expenses?

197
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,519
You're clearly trying to extort money.

198
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,760
Watch what you're saying!

199
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,459
You shouldn't go too far.

200
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,720
Hey, guys. Calm down.

201
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,880
Well, Misters.

202
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,120
Take this and buy something to eat and drink to nourish your health.

203
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,680
You're a sensible kid.

204
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,680
I'll see you two off.

205
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,860
You guys can carry on eating.

206
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,499
Give me back the money.

207
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:13,499
What?

208
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,660
Give the money back.

209
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,740
There's no reason for us to give the money back to you.

210
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,759
Is there something wrong with you?

211
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,700
You need some beating.

212
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,540
What?

213
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,920
What are you trying to do?

214
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,620
Give it back?

215
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,840
Why is he not back yet?

216
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,779
Could Guan Fang be bullied because of his gentle personality?

217
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,280
It's possible.

218
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,940
Those two people are not the ones to mess with.

219
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,660
Let me go and check.

220
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,639
Brother, it's our first time doing this.

221
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,299
We were out of our minds.

222
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,800
We won't do it the next time.

223
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,180
We'll avoid your shop next time.

224
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,681
Next time?

225
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:17,979
I mean there won't be a next time.

226
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,499
We promise.

227
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,620
Yes.

228
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,320
Hey!

229
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,200
What are you doing?

230
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,679
How much money can a student like him have?

231
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:45,240
That's enough.

232
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,179
Sorry, Brother.

233
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,020
I'm sorry.

234
00:14:51,021 --> 00:14:52,459
Let's talk it out.

235
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,740
Just don't hit us.

236
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,680
No!

237
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,560
Ahem.

238
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,460
Don't just stand there.

239
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:02,600
Apologize to him.

240
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,860
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

241
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,560
We won't do it next time.

242
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,000
That's more like it.

243
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Listen.

244
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,019
Don't let me see you guys around the shop.

245
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,620
Do you hear me?

246
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,180
No, we won't.

247
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,680
Get lost!

248
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,500
Gu Ran did a great job.

249
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,040
I didn't expect you to be so capable.

250
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,620
Are you okay?

251
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,560
Oh, it's nothing.

252
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,579
It's just that these guys are weird.

253
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,400
They suddenly acted like they were being bullied.

254
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,160
And you,

255
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,979
you shouldn't be scared when you run into people like them.

256
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,400
Just look what I did.

257
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,419
See how scared they were just now?

258
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:52,500
But they're too timid.

259
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,860
I didn't even hit them.

260
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,360
Two cowards who've never seen the world.

261
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,480
Thank you.

262
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,420
Grandma, I'm back.

263
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,740
Xiao Fang, come here.

264
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,920
Why are you so serious?

265
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,000
Did you get into a fight again today?

266
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,219
Grandma, what are you thinking?

267
00:16:39,219 --> 00:16:41,540
I'm not someone who loves to fight.

268
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,280
I'm glad to hear that.

269
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,240
I'm genuinely worried.

270
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,039
In the past, you would come home with injuries on your face.

271
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:53,919
You would get new injuries when the old ones weren't healed yet.

272
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,039
That was such a long time ago.

273
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:01,380
I was young and ignorant at the time.

274
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,280
Grandma, please stop bringing up my past.

275
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,200
Jiang Jia and the rest teased me for over a week

276
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,179
about the bed-wetting incident you told them about.

277
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,899
So don't bring it up anymore.

278
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,960
I'm glad you didn't fight.

279
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,279
But the friends you're making are pretty nice.

280
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:16,940
I like them.

281
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:21,140
You should be more like them.

282
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,620
I don't want you to be who you were before.

283
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,359
Grandma, don't worry.

284
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,980
I won't.

285
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,360
You must be hungry.

286
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,159
I made rib stew for you.

287
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:35,379
It's your favorite.

288
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,240
If you want some, come and get it.

289
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,280
Wang Hao!

290
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,779
Didn't you switch duty with Guan Fang?

291
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,219
Aren't you going to clean?

292
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,459
Guan Fang, you see.

293
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,579
My relatives are visiting today.

294
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,200
How about you do the duty today?

295
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,940
I'll return the favor next time.

296
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:17,862
Well...

297
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:21,014
what do you think?

298
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,369
I can go home later.

299
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:28,170
Then I'll stay for the duty and go home after that.

300
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,170
You can go now.

301
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,730
I don't have much homework today.

302
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,829
So I'll go and help out before going home.

303
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,570
Okay. Grandma, don't worry.

304
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,449
I'll be right there. I'm hanging up now.

305
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,810
Brother, he was the one who took our money.

306
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:54,029
So you were the one who picked on my friends?

307
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,549
It was him. Him!

308
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,230
D-Did you ask me before you did that?

309
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,469
Okay.

310
00:19:02,469 --> 00:19:04,310
Wait.

311
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,310
I dare you to leave.

312
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,150
After you leave, we'll go to your grandma.

313
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:13,270
It's called Guan's Dessert Shop, right?

314
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,410
That old woman is pretty old.

315
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,689
So it's normal if she stumbles or bumps into things.

316
00:19:18,689 --> 00:19:19,890
Yes.

317
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,390
Jeez.

318
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,470
Hey, what are you doing?

319
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,769
What are you doing?

320
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:25,330
I'm not exaggerating.

321
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,410
Guan Fang has clearly changed.

322
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,370
It's not just about the duty.

323
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,250
When someone tried to take over our basketball court today,

324
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,410
he didn't let them.

325
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,509
He just won a game and took it back.

326
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,749
If it were before, he would have given up.

327
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:41,229
This shows what we taught Guan Fang is effective.

328
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,830
That's right.

329
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,430
We've essentially saved his future.

330
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,570
That's noble.

331
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,430
Go away! Get away!

332
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,770
Beat him!

333
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,970
This is not just a change, he practically transformed.

334
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,990
Help him out!

335
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:15,429
I apologize for what I said before.
[Guan's Dessert Shop]

336
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:16,549
Gu Ran didn't teach you.

337
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,590
But you should teach him.

338
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,990
If I had known

339
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,989
he was good at this, I wouldn't have joined in the fight.

340
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,929
Luckily we found out in time.

341
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:28,949
Or else it'd be embarrassing for us

342
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,670
to teach you more nonsense.

343
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:36,190
At first, I didn't want you guys to find out.

344
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,530
It's nothing to be proud of.

345
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:44,390
You could say I was at a rebellious stage.

346
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,769
It was in the 8th grade.

347
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:53,610
At that time, I just felt studying rigid things was useless.

348
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,030
So I wanted to make a name for myself with my fists

349
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:00,129
and mistook immaturity for brotherhood.

350
00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:03,950
My temper would explode at the slightest provocation.

351
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,890
Hey!

352
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,610
♫ Baby, you promise me ♫

353
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,389
Listen closely.

354
00:21:21,389 --> 00:21:23,609
If I ever see you messing with my friends again,

355
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:26,610
I'll beat you up every time I see you.

356
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,990
I'm not exaggerating.

357
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,610
At that time, almost no one at school wanted to have anything to do with me.

358
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,810
Even the teachers thought I was a troublemaker.

359
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,870
The most common phrase I heard back then was,

360
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,910
"One drop of poison

361
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,790
infects the whole tun of wine."

362
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,610
Look at you, you can't even stand or sit properly.

363
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,430
Stand here as punishment. Stand properly.

364
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:52,240
♫ Keep crying but myself tell me can't go on ♫

365
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,850
To prevent myself from spoiling their precious wine,

366
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:01,530
I started skipping school even more.

367
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,390
Maybe it wasn't just rebellion.

368
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,450
I was already a bad person.

369
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,729
So what those hooligans did was something you used to do?

370
00:22:12,729 --> 00:22:15,890
You're quite legendary.

371
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:19,649
But looking back now, I was so full of myself back then.

372
00:22:19,649 --> 00:22:21,650
I thought I was tough and cool.

373
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,930
Right. When I skipped a physical education class,

374
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,810
my parents gave me a beating.

375
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:29,030
Didn't your grandma punish you?

376
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:32,710
Right. How did you eventually change yourself?

377
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,389
Later, I suddenly realized...

378
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,830
Gosh, just leave. Leave.

379
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,530
The so-called invincibility I thought I had

380
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,509
was because someone was silently

381
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,610
facing the consequences for me.

382
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,829
I caused trouble.

383
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,070
She apologized.

384
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:59,929
I don't know since when it had became a given.

385
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:02,730
Grandma, I'll be honest with you.

386
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,889
No school would dare to accept a student like Guan Fang.

387
00:23:05,889 --> 00:23:08,469
We've given him so many chances.

388
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,650
But he keeps repeating his mistakes.

389
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:15,290
We truly have no other choice but to advise him to drop out.

390
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,897
Miss, y-you're right.

391
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:25,209
But Fang was a really good kid when he was young.

392
00:23:25,209 --> 00:23:27,290
I'll try and talk to him again.

393
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,669
He used to listen to me the most when he was a child.

394
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,190
Oh, please.

395
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:31,450
We're really in a difficult position here.

396
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,749
Please, I beg you. Please.

397
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,450
My grandma used to be quite fierce when she was young.

398
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:39,030
She had a reputation in the surrounding area.

399
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,090
I've never seen her pleading

400
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:45,170
with someone in such a humble way.

401
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,069
Oh, Fang.

402
00:23:47,069 --> 00:23:49,870
Let's go home.

403
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,210
That was when I realized
[Disciplinary Office]

404
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:58,470
that she seemed to have aged a bit.

405
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:03,490
Xiao Fang, sometimes I envy you.

406
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,589
You see, you can still study at this age.

407
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:10,130
You still have opportunities to do what you like.

408
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:13,570
Actually, fists can't save the world.

409
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,610
You still need to use the pen.

410
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:23,870
Stop fighting and focus on studying, okay?

411
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,310
Okay.

412
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:36,190
♫ I admitted that I’d made a mistake ♫

413
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,169
I can't even imagine

414
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:41,730
how she managed to bear so much finger-pointing

415
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,730
♫ ... head to a new city ♫

416
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:49,430
and calmly discuss the future with me with such a frail body.

417
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:55,820
♫ I know there’s something wrong, but give me some time so I could fix it ♫

418
00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:01,310
♫ You give your all to me ♫

419
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,029
The story is over.

420
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:05,930
After that, I turned over a new leaf and became a different person.

421
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,130
♫ beautiful unavoidable things ♫

422
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:08,710
What do you think?

423
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,149
I used to be quite lost, right?

424
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:14,690
No, it's the coolest thing for a wanderer to turn back.

425
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,650
It's super cool.

426
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:21,110
♫ I wanna love you more just like before ♫

427
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:27,000
♫ I miss getting up with you playing the Beatles’ songs just like before ♫

428
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:35,220
♫ I miss going out with you on an ordinary day just like before ♫

429
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:41,509
Goodbye, Grandma.

430
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,790
Goodbye.

431
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,330
- Let's go.
- Let's go home.

432
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,810
Let's head home.

433
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,390
It feels cold all of a sudden.

434
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,310
Come.

435
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:05,689
Watch your step.

436
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:06,950
Okay.

437
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,090
How fast time flies.

438
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:13,930
It's another year already.

439
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,489
I only learned today

440
00:26:16,489 --> 00:26:19,990
that you wanted to be a boxing champion when you were young.

441
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,210
Well, you did say it was when I was young.

442
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,970
I'm a lot older now.

443
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:29,610
Do you blame me for being too strict with you back then?

444
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,909
Come on, how could I?

445
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,669
You said it yourself, it was when I was young.

446
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,330
I'm a lot older now.

447
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,171
You sure are. You'll be one year older soon.

448
00:26:38,171 --> 00:26:40,410
Do you still have any dreams now?

449
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,429
Yes.

450
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:44,850
I hope...

451
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:52,870
I hope you can accompany me for a long, long time.

452
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,610
"With lowered head and skillful fingers playing endlessly,

453
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:05,470
talking about countless things."

454
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,109
"Lightly..."

455
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:11,309
"Slowly plucking and strumming.

456
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,949
Plucking and strumming..."

457
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,410
"From now on, the emperor will no longer attend the morning court."

458
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:18,050
"From now on..."

459
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,390
What?

460
00:27:20,391 --> 00:27:22,330
Don't mess around.

461
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,370
You have an exam in ten minutes.

462
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,909
Can you memorize it all?

463
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,150
I want to memorize as much as I can.

464
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:32,310
This cold air is like a natural energizer.

465
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,429
I'll no longer believe those study methods online.

466
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,549
What methods?

467
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,309
They say if you can sleep using the books as a pillow,

468
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:44,290
the knowledge will enter your brain by itself.

469
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,249
I slept with the books as a pillow all night.

470
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:47,650
Then what happened?

471
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,450
I woke up with a stiff neck.

472
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,430
Let's go. It's about time.

473
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,110
Let's go.

474
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,430
Good luck.

475
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:00,870
Bye-bye.

476
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,430
Rang Rang, good luck.

477
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,310
You too.

478
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,829
Stop studying.

479
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,210
Let's go.

480
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,770
Rang Rang, when are you going back to Suyang?

481
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,341
Tomorrow.

482
00:28:22,114 --> 00:28:23,814
So soon.

483
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:31,530
Take these.

484
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,950
What about you?

485
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,990
I'm not cold.

486
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:47,030
Your gloves are surely different.

487
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,510
I don't feel cold at all.

488
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,110
You're exaggerating.

489
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,310
What's wrong?

490
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:03,569
We'll be apart for a month once you go back.

491
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:05,170
Every glance counts now.

492
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,430
I have to make good use of my time to look at you more.

493
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,029
It's only a month.

494
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:14,130
Relationships between people need maintenance.

495
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,829
Even if we don't contact each other for just one week,

496
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,989
the feelings can fade.

497
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,850
I don't want the first thing I say to you

498
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:23,030
when you come back to be, "Long time no see,

499
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:25,010
do you still remember me?"

500
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,329
So I'll text you.

501
00:29:28,329 --> 00:29:30,990
I'll take the initiative to keep in touch

502
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,989
since I'm used to it anyway.

503
00:29:32,989 --> 00:29:34,450
Well, I'll go now.

504
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,790
I'll reply to you.

505
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:42,829
I will reply to your text messages.

506
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:44,550
It's a deal then.

507
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,490
Yes.

508
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,360
♫ The first time I saw you, I was so nervous ♫

509
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,460

♫ The first time I saw you, I was so nervous ♫

511
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,060

It's the first snow.

514
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,220
♫ I can't seem to find a topic to start a conversation ♫

515
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,179
♫ You approached me and stretched your hand out ♫

516
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,520
♫ Tightly holding my hand and never letting go ♫

517
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,860
♫ Tightly holding my hand and never letting go ♫

518
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,080
I noticed that when the world created Grandma,

519
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,860
it seemed to follow a fixed formula.

520
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,240
Grandma's sliced apples always have a subtle flavor of green onions.

521
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:40,300
Grandma always hunches her back, yet her steps are steady.

522
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,720
Grandma's washed apron is bright white, tidy, and clean.

523
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,039
Come and have some.

524
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,540
Have some fruit.

525
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:53,760
Grandma always thinks we never eat enough.

526
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,620
Here you go.

527
00:30:54,621 --> 00:30:57,180
We still have grapes.

528
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,980
Enjoy yourselves.

529
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,560
Grandma's living space is small,

530
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,920
too small to fit large furniture,

531
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,099
yet it's also spacious.

532
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:11,220
It's spacious enough to encompass our entire childhood.

533
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,939
I kind of miss Grandma.

534
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:20,160
But I dare not tell dad about it because I know

535
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,760
he misses his mom too.

536
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,724
[I kind of miss Grandma.]

537
00:31:30,725 --> 00:31:32,649

♫ The best version of you ♫

545
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,850
♫ You gave me courage and love ♫

546
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:11,879
♫ You’re the reason I believe in love ♫

547
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:19,020
♫ I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me ♫

548
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,849
♫ Even if it makes it hard for me to let go ♫

549
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:27,080
♫ Too scared to tell you, “I love you” ♫

550
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:34,250
♫ But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore ♫
