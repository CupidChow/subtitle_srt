[To: Su Zaizai. From: Zhang Luli.]

14
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:31,320
Long time no see, Sister Zaizai.

15
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,360
I can't use my phone any more as the NCEE is around the corner.

16
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,400
I can only write letters instead.

17
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,679
I spoke to brother on the phone a while back.

18
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,599
He's in a good mood and told me a lot about you guys.

19
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:44,759
I don't know anyone else.

20
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,699
But judging from the way he talked about them, they must be just as interesting as you.

21
00:01:49,699 --> 00:01:54,579
You said brother became friends with you because you kept bothering him.

22
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:55,959
Let me tell you in secret.

23
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:59,959
I've seen brother play with that doll several times.

24
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:03,759
He must be happy to have you as a friend but wouldn't admit it.

25
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,460
My brother's kind of cute.

26
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,239
Oh, by the way, I talked to my parents once after I got back.

27
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,360
I think they're slowly changing.

28
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,419
Well. I hope things get better.

29
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:19,880
Sister Zaizai, I wish you all the best too.

30
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,380
Zaizai! You're going to be late for school if you don't leave now.

31
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,380
Coming!

[The First High School Affiliated to Jiangyi University]

33
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,599
You used to look forward to your birthday before it even came.

34
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:41,160
Why do you not want to celebrate your birthday this year?

35
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,559
I know there are some things I can't get away with,

36
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:51,099
but I can't help but think my birthday is before the winter break.

37
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:55,260
After my birthday, Zhang Lurang will go back to Suyang.

38
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,660
Suddenly I don't feel like celebrating it.

39
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,459
It's exactly because he's leaving that we must enjoy your birthday so that it's meaningful.

40
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:07,899
We must have a good time. Come on.

41
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,079
This is so difficult.

42
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:15,199
What's so difficult about buying a gift?

43
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:20,439
Winter is coming. You can buy a scarf or gloves.

44
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:24,540
Or... Bracelets are good too.

45
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,740
Most girls like pretty things.

46
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,020
Do you like pretty things too?

47
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,040
Are you asking that question...

48
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,740
to taunt me about not being like most girls out there?

49
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,979
Forget it. There's no use keeping it after buying it.

50
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,339
I got it from the malatang's raffle event in the canteen.

51
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:46,380
There's no use for me keeping it. You can have it.

52
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:51,820
No. Knowing Jiang Jia's personality, she'll be waiting at the canteen entrance tomorrow.

53
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,539
I found this on the roadside. I'm lucky, aren't I?

54
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,490
That's too fake.

55
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,700
Gu Ran.

56
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,440
Have you done something bad? You looked scared.

57
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,080
What do you want with me at this hour?

58
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,740
Well... It's just that...

59
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,879
I just bought Su Zaizai's birthday gift.

60
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,859
It's one of those carved wooden dolls.

61
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:25,239
Don't you know her better? What do you think?

62
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:28,140
Not bad. Zaizai would probably like it.

63
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,280
Is that all?

64
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,940
Yes. What else could there be?

65
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,719
By the way, I was just buying the gift in the store.

66
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:39,639
And they happened to have a promotion.

67
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,139
Buy two and get 20% off. I was tricked into buying this.

68
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:45,940
It's no use to me. So I thought I could give it to you.

69
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,039
If you don't want it...

70
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,940
Why wouldn't I reject something free?

71
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,240
You don't like me, do you?

72
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,340
Who did you say I like? You?

73
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,519
How is that possible?

74
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,599
What's so good about you?

75
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Besides having big eyes, fair skin, a small face, curly lashes, and being tall...

76
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,720
what strength do you possess?

77
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,540
Oh, I...

78
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,900
What I meant is that you're not really my type.

79
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,540
Don't overthink it.

80
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,040
Okay.

81
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,740
That's good. I thought you had a thing for me. You scared me.

82
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,040
Don't flatter yourself.

83
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,600
We finally made it to Friday without the evening self-study class.

84
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,000
- We're leaving first.
- Bye-bye.

85
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,740
See you next week.

86
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,919
Let's go. Let's go get Zhang Lurang and the rest.

87
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:25,819
It's on me today. I already decided on which restaurant we're going.

88
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:28,380
If it's your treat, be careful we'll make you broke.

89
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,240
Well... My birthday is a happy event.

90
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,380
Su Zaizai, Mr. Lin wants to see you.

91
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,740
Huh?

92
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,180
Okay.

93
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,439
I wonder what it's about.

94
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,420
Why don't I text you the address?

95
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,479
You guys can head there first. I'll catch up with you in a minute.

96
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay. Then we'll leave first.

97
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,560
Yeah, okay.

98
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,200
Sir.

99
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,839
Mr. Lin, you wanted to see me?

100
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,059
It's no big deal.

101
00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:03,199
Grade 10 just finished the monthly exam. They want to get the English results soon.

102
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,739
I don't have enough people to mark the test papers. So I thought I could use your help.

103
00:08:06,739 --> 00:08:10,380
Mark the section of multiple choice questions by referring to this answer sheet.

104
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,939
It won't take long. Are you in a hurry to leave?

105
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:18,140
I'm not.

106
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,660
Okay.

107
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,220
Then sit at the table over there and mark the papers.

108
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,940
Thank you.

109
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,519
Are you done?

110
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,199
Goodbye, Mr. Lin.

111
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,519
Thank you so much for today. Be careful on your way home.

112
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,200
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

113
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,619
It's late. Why don't you guys go home first?

114
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,819
What?

115
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:07,719
I guess we have no choice. We'll celebrate your birthday tomorrow.

116
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,040
It's fine. We can do it anytime.

Why would we?

125

Even if they left, I wouldn't.

126
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,600
You've gone too far by belittling others to make yourself look good.

127

We're not leaving, okay?

128

What do you think? My idea's better, right?

What do you think? Isn't it great?

Where's the gift? It grew wings and flew to your room.

132
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,540
It's the most important part now.

133
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,219
Su Zaizai. Make a wish.

It's the first time A'Rang has celebrated someone else's birthday.

135
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,520
He doesn't even celebrate his own birthday.

136
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,079
My wish is simple.

137
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,460
It's not too much if I make two wishes, right?

138
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:27,940
Firstly, I hope everyone can be as happy as today every day.

139
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,440
What about the second wish?

140
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,140
I'm not telling you my second wish.

141

My second wish

145
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,540
is that I wish I can celebrate Rang Rang's 18th birthday with him.

00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,099
We'll be in class at that time. We won't be able to see you off.

176
00:13:58,099 --> 00:13:59,199
It's all right.

177
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,020
I'm not going very far anyway.

178
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,760
I can come back during the holidays.

179
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,120
That's right. We can visit you if you can't come.

180
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,380
Besides, more than a year isn't that long.

181
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,040
It'll be over soon.

182
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,593
Yeah.

183
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,219
Yeah. Soon.

184
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,399
Then we have a deal to keep in touch.

185
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,599
It's good enough that you don't harass Zhang Lurang.

186
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,100
Harass?

187
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,280
It's caring.

188
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,380
Why hasn't the line gotten any shorter in a long time?

189
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,280
Sorry, let me through.

190
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,320
- Sorry.
- Be careful.

191
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,440
Is something wrong?

192
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,759
Kids.

193
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,119
Calm down, kids.

194
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,560
We have some issues with the computer. We're getting someone to fix it.

195
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,400
It might take a while.

196
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,480
Can I have a look at it?

197
00:14:52,481 --> 00:14:54,260
I know something about computers.

198
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,280
Sure. Come here.

199
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,540
All right.

200
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,399
This kid is amazing.

201
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,599
He fixed it so quickly.

202
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,919
It's just a hobby.

203
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,320
Gu Ran, you're amazing.

204
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,020
You kept it from us.

205
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,100
I just got lucky today.

206
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,339
Why are you being humble? You're really good.

207
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,039
I only play computer games and surf the Internet.

208
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,080
Yet you know how to fix computers.

209
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,200
It's not that difficult.

210
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,420
Well... my talent did most of the job.

211
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,100
All right. We can proceed.

212
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,400
Are you friends?

213
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,820
Yes. Best friends.

214
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,839
If it weren't for this boy, who knows how long we would've to wait?

215
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,819
Why don't we let them take the photos first?

216
00:16:07,819 --> 00:16:08,780
Sure.

217
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,280
Let's take your photos first then.

218
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,760
Really?

219
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,280
Let's get changed into the outfit for the photo shoot.

220
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,080
It's so cold. It's good that the air conditioner is on.

221
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,200
Kids. You go first.

222
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,480
All right, sit tight.

223
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320
You smile so happily.

224
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,100
Looks like you're in a good mood after fixing the computer.

225
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,100
All right. Three, two, one.

226
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,440
Okay. Look at the camera.

227
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,780
Three, two, one.

228
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,199
Tilt your head a little to the left.

Okay. Three, two, one.

00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,140
Let me see yours.

231
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,020
It looks really good.

232
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,100
Students, take the photos yourselves.

233
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,433
Okay.

234
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:10,799
Why do I look so creepy?

235
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,359
Let me see.

236
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,599
I want to see it too.

237
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,639

239
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,820
Hello. Can we get another photo?

240
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,119
Oh, Guan Fang. Stop it.

241
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,919
I meant a group photo.

242
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,180
Sure. Go on.

243
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,219
There's no one left anyway.

244
00:17:31,219 --> 00:17:32,659
You don't need instructions from me this time.

It's snowing.

278
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,039
That means it's our second winter together.

279
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,320
Rang Rang, happy one-year anniversary.

00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,499

Think of it as proof of what we just talked about.

282
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,160
Okay.

283
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,760
Look.

284
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,300
The snow left a mark.

285
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:19,899
So you can't go back on what you promised someone during the first snow.

286
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:22,580
Or there will be serious consequences.

287
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,600
What consequences?

288
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,900
I'll get angry.

So I began writing my first letter.

298
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,140
How are you getting used to Suyang now that school has started?

299
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:22,619
To be honest, I'm not used to taking public transport and going home alone.

300
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:25,279
So I started riding the bicycle again.

301
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,399
Hello, Mr. Lin.

302
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,100
- Su Zaizai.

But the learning progress is slightly faster than Jiangyi.

311
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,960
I've adapted to this place.

312
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,460
I scored 122 in English for the monthly exam.

313
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,839

315
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,719
When I went to buy study materials, I found

316
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,279
that the supermarket with the flash sale that year has been converted into a bookstore.

317
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,840
You can come and check it out when you have the chance.

Spring comes later in Suyang than in Jiangyi.

319
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,780
I heard that the winter jasmine on Jiangyi's roadside has bloomed.

00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,860
It's so embarrassing.

324
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,699
Don't remember these things.

Let me tell you something interesting.

326
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,599
April Fool's Day this year, Guan Fang and Gu Ran acted in The Emperor's New Clothes.

327
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:35,300
It's so funny.

329
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,000
By the way, I'm also studying hard.

00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:51,660
admiringly, yes, looking admiringly at us.

00:23:58,901 --> 00:24:01,919
Oh. I seem to have an irregular heartbeat.

357
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,200
I have a rapid heartbeat.

358
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,519
It keeps thumping.

359
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,740
It's all my fault.

360
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,420
I shouldn't have thought of you during the physical examination.

361
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,659

00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,400
I want to study economics.

Hey, what's that look?

376
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,199
I've never been wrong working out the accounts for my grandma since I was a kid.

377
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:19,540
I look financially savvy.

378
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,000
What about you?

379
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,860
Me?

380
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,959

381
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,260
My parents are doctors. I can't lose to them.

382
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,000

383

What about you? What do you want to study?

384
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,120
I haven't made up my mind yet.

Oh, our math papers are released.

389
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,600

- Su Zaizai.
- Diameter?
 (T/N: Tissue and diameter sound similar in Chinse)

396
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,720
Which question?

397
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,940

00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,760
I think they've gone dumb from studying.

399
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,360
Both of them were so distracted.

00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,640
There's still some time before the NCEE.

401
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,900
Could it be that they are too stressed?

402
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,399

414
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,319
Why are you sighing?

415
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,820
Haven't you heard a saying?

416
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,079
Everyone's luck is limited.

417
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,940
If you sigh a lot, your luck will slip away.

Why are you here?

419
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,919
I was picking up a ball over there.

420
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,679
I was about to get it, but a gust of wind blew it away.

421
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,999
I looked up.

422
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,260
Turns out you were sighing.

423
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,359
Tell me. How are things lately?

424
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,140
Zaizai's dream is to be a diplomatic translator.

425
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,359
Guan Fang wants to study economics.

426
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,159
You all have dreams.

427
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,160
But I don't.

428
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,240
I've never thought about it.

429
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,579
All I know is that I will go to junior high after finishing primary school.

430
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:20,500
After finishing junior high, I have to go to high school.

431
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,199
But I now realize there will be no more rules.

432
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,400
I have to proceed on my own.

433
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,940
It's weird, right?

434
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,140
Few people have no dreams.

435
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,260
I don't even have any strengths.

436
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,040
Who says you don't?

437
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,220
Do I have any?

438
00:28:46,063 --> 00:28:47,663
You...

439
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,840
Never mind. I won't give you a hard time.

440
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,769
Come on. It's time for the evening self-study session.

441
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:02,470
No matter what, we have to pass NCEE first.

442
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,250
Hello, long time no see.

443
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:26,410
Today is January 1st, 2015.

444
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:28,429
It's the start of a new year.

445
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:31,790
The second semester of Grade 12 is coming up.

446
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:36,989
We only have a one-day holiday.

447
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,989
I'm going back to school tomorrow.

448
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:41,130
There's nothing special about the holiday.

449
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:44,030
All I do is study.

450
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:48,490
But something made me happy.

451
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,389
Rang Rang sent me a letter again.

452
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:55,970
This is the seventh letter.

453
00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:01,229
The content is nothing more than to wish me a happy new year

454
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:05,789
and sadness and guilt for not being able to be by my side

455
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,869
for the coming year.

456
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,389
I understand.

457
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,290
I'm very forgiving anyway.

458
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:14,270
He can make it up later.

459
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:22,190
And I've only used three of these photo papers.

460
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,109
Don't blame me for being slow.

461
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:27,109
I thought about using them all at once.

462
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:31,270
But I think it's too reckless.

463
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:35,530
Besides, there's no way I'll make Rang Rang someone who doesn't keep their promises.

464
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:41,150
So I won't finish them before I get some decent grades.

465
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,789
All right, I'll stop here.

466
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,190
I'm going to continue studying.

467
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,600
Bye.

468
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,730
The phrase "Reading a letter is like talking face to face"

469
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:55,069
