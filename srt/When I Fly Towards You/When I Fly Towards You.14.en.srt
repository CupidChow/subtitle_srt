Excuse me, Sister. Can you go back to where we were?

354
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,869
They should be in the equipment room, beside the light sticks.

355
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:08,750
It's just one bag, not very heavy.

356
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,110
I have to get them to move these things over quickly.

357
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,909
Okay.

358
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:14,810
I can go and get them.

359

If you go, she'll have to move your things.

360
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,790
They are too heavy for her.

361
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,129
It's okay.

362
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,250
I can do it. It won't take long.

We're not.

Turn right from the entrance. The third room.

It's okay.

I'll just go the other way.

378

I'll certainly find a way out from such a small place.

- Hello, can you hear me?

Leave it there and I'll go get it.

Wait a minute. I calculated. It should be ¥355.

421
00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:01,549
I subtracted 30 because someone made a complaint about how you worked.

00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,090
Jiang Jiang.

528
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,310
What did you say?

529
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,569
What's on your mind? You're totally in a daze.

530
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:24,290
Senior Qianyu has a girlfriend?

531
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:31,269
So... Are you feeling okay?

532
00:36:31,269 --> 00:36:32,610
I'm okay.

533
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,609
I just didn't expect this to happen so soon.

534
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,950
Guess fate often comes unannounced.

535
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,389
Hey. That girl is so pretty.

536
00:36:40,389 --> 00:36:43,950
Senior Qianyu was smiling so happily beside her.

537
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:49,270
So you really thought of him as an older brother.

538
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,570
I guess so.

539
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,529
Something got into my eye.

540
00:36:58,529 --> 00:36:59,610
Are you all right?

541
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:02,730
Don't rub it so hard.

542
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,350
Hold on a second, Grandma.

543
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:07,189
The signal isn't good here.

544
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,490
Let me try up on the rooftop.

545
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,530
Are you okay?

546
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,890
Better now.

547
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,169
Weren't you going to call your grandma?

548
00:37:30,169 --> 00:37:31,309
That was quick.

549
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,490
I went to the rooftop.

550
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:37,280
But I saw Jiang Jia crying there.

551
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,200
So I came back.

552
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,479
I guess the news of Senior Qianyu getting a girlfriend is a bigger shock to her than I thought.

553
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,939
Is she very upset?

554
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,220
She kept rubbing her eyes.

555
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:55,820
Gosh. Hopefully, she'll be in a better mood when we go to the music festival tomorrow.
