15

Well. Grade 12 students have tight schedules

19
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,669

20
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,930
Oh.

21
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,789
I'm pretty sure he's not a parent.

22
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,349
He said his son was in Grade 12.

23
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,170
But he headed for the Grade 11 school building.

24
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,469
And he looked sneaky and guilty.

25
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,430
A lot of things have been missing from the school buildings recently.

26
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,950
It must be his doings.

The lock on the west school gate is broken.

It's not fixed yet.

29
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,109
And he came from that direction.

30
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,989
There's a good chance he'll leave from there.

31
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,149

00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,450

00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,439
♫ The balcony is filled with hibiscus blooming in midsummer ♫

353
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:43,579
She woke up at noon. She's still feeling weary.

354
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:45,899
She would doze off after a little while.

355
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:48,779
I'm glad she's awake. We won't be going inside then.

356
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:51,180
We should let Grandma get more rest.

357
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,080
Chen Lan's family, remember to pay the fees and collect the medication.

358
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,580
Okay. Thank you.

359
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,440
Gosh, you seem like you haven't slept all night.

360
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,360
You should get some sleep.

361
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,200
Okay?

362
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,081
I'm familiar with the hospital.

363
00:23:09,081 --> 00:23:11,500
We can take care of these small things, like paying the fees for you.

364
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,100
Yeah, you probably haven't eaten either.

365
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,080
Rang Rang and I will go and buy you some food.

366
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,460
Thank you.

367
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,840
Come on.

368
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,240
It has only been just a few days.

369
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,850
But your wrinkles have increased a lot.

370
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:24,509
How about buying some of those toners or creams

371
00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:29,349
they mention on TV that wrinkles disappear immediately after applying them?

372
00:24:29,349 --> 00:24:31,790
Let's see if they work.

373
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,930
It would be great if they did.

374
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,870
- Grandma?
- Yes?

375
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:46,990
You're awake.

376
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:53,729
I thought I heard Gu Ran and the others talking.

377
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,709
Yes.

378
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:56,769
They'll be here later.

379
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,350
Okay.

380
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:03,430
Is the graduation ceremony over?

381
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:13,589
Old Chen said they waited outside the school entrance

382
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:17,509
on their children's graduation day.

383
00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:20,310
I didn't even know about it

384
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,990
and couldn't go to pick you up.

385
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,770
Your graduation ceremony

386
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:35,290
is only once.

387
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:44,350
At first, I planned to close the shop early to attend it,

388
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:50,470
but I couldn't make it.

389
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:55,409
Instead, you ended up coming to the hospital,

390
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:58,830
busying yourself tirelessly.

391
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:10,010
Time really flies.

392
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:16,910
I always feel like yesterday you were shorter than me.

393
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,190
But in the blink of an eye,

394
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:22,870
you've grown so much.

395
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:27,130
You've become an adult.

396
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:35,290
Grandma, please come to send me off when the university semester starts.

397
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:39,750
And when I find a job, you can pick me up and drop me off.

398
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:47,230
By then, I probably won't be able to walk anymore.

399
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,750
Then, I'll be the one who picks you up.

400
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,430
If that doesn't work, I'll carry you on my back.

401
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:57,149
Oh, no. That would be so tiring.

402
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:01,030
But when I was little,

403
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:05,570
didn't you always carry me like that too?

404
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,190
Okay.

405
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,950
You're such a good child.

406
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,130
Okay.

407
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,589
She can be discharged now?

408
00:27:21,589 --> 00:27:24,490
Yes. I'll take care of the procedure later.

409
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,990
That's great.

410
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:29,270
Didn't you see how well Guan Fang took care of his grandma these past two days?

411
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:32,390
Oh, man. At first, my mom only used A'Rang to nag at me.

412
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,689
It's really great now.

413
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,450
She has one more name she can use.

414
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:43,690
I always thought I would become an adult once I turned 18.

415
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:49,829
But recently, I've realized that being an adult means taking responsibility.

416
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,869
My grandma has had a hard life.

417
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:56,750
It's my turn to protect her now.

418
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,350
I'm lucky to have you guys now.

419
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:05,070
That means adults also need friends.

420
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,350
Yes, they do.

421
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:13,229
Because only with friends around can adults temporarily not act like adults.

422
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:17,990
The evening after the rain looks beautiful.

423
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,249
Tomorrow will be nice weather.

424
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,970
Yes, I'm sure it is.

425
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:34,230
♫ Baby, you promise me everything, you kissed me cheek on your doorstep ♫

426
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:43,020
♫ Your lips so charming, tell me you will never ever ever break my heart ♫

427
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:51,960
♫ First time try to frozen my lonely heart ♫

428
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,510
Rang Rang, this is me.

429
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,690
You should go back and rest early.

430
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:00,470
Su Zaizai,

431
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:06,210
tomorrow will be nice weather.

432
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:09,430
You mentioned it earlier.

433
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,310
So, are you free?

434
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:21,270
♫ But I can't falling again ♫

435
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,409
I'm really going to graduate.

436
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:33,450
I just realized how reluctant I am to leave.

437
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,529
Actually, there's one thing in high school

438
00:29:36,529 --> 00:29:38,610
that I regret and have always resented.

439
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:43,329
That is, I never had the chance to experience being in the same class as Rang Rang.

440
00:29:43,329 --> 00:29:45,490
Such a pity.

441
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,329
I wanted to sit next to him

442
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:53,010
and stay together with him for 12 hours from morning to evening's self-study class.

443
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:55,449
Then, I'd pretend to borrow a pen from him

444
00:29:55,449 --> 00:29:57,950
and turn my head and say...

445
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:01,310
Rang Rang, what are you doing here?

446
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,250
What are you recording?

447
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:08,490
I'm recording precious memories of our high school graduation.

448
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,330
Then, did you record it?

449
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:13,409
Yes, I did. Thank you, Rang Rang.

450
00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:17,150
♫ Even if it makes it hard for me to let go ♫

451
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:20,030
♫ Too scared to tell you, “I love you” ♫

452
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:23,670
♫ But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore ♫

453
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:28,790
How nice it is that we're deskmates at this moment.

454
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:34,170
♫ I guess I’ve fallen in love with you ♫

455
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:37,990
♫ Without any reason ♫

456
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:42,170
♫ It’s unexplainable ♫

457
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:48,810
♫ I guess it must be the hand of destiny ♫

458
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:52,550
♫ That brought you into my life ♫

459
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:56,530
♫ The best version of you ♫

460
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:02,009
♫ You gave me courage and love ♫

461
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:05,129
♫ You’re the reason I believe in love ♫

462
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:11,850
♫ I'm not afraid of having regrets as long as you’re with me ♫

463
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:17,010
♫ Even if it makes it hard for me to let go ♫

464
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,829
♫ Too scared to tell you, “I love you” ♫

465
00:31:19,829 --> 00:31:28,110
♫ But now, I don’t want to hesitate anymore ♫
