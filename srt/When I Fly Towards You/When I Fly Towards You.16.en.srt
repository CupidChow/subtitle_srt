[Episode 16]

13
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,380
Zhang Lurang is going to transfer?

14
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,960
Why so sudden?

15
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,680
I heard this from my mother.

16
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,659
Perhaps it's due to his enrollment status.

17
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,500
I don't think A'Rang wants to leave.

18
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,900
He is not like himself recently.

19
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,160
He doesn't tell us about it.

20
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,319
Does Su Zaizai know about it?

21
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:38,859
Of course. She looks upset recently.

22
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:40,880
I thought she had a fight with someone.

23
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,140
I'm sure it's because of Zhang Lurang's transfer.

24
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,719
You are right. I'm sure Zhang Lurang told her first.

25
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,040
Zaizai must be sad right now.

26
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,840
I need to think of something to comfort her.

27
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,090
Wait...

28
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,080
Comforting her?

29
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,220
Won't she add fuel to the fire instead?

30
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,840
That's hard to say.

31
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,340
Are you upset because of Zhang Lurang recently?

32
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,440
Did you notice it too?

33
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,240
It's too obvious.

34
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,380
It has been days since you two went home together.

35
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,379
I do understand your feeling.

36
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,440
I have experienced the same thing, after all.

37
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,520
Was it because of Senior Qianyu?

38
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,340
It is hard to accept at first,

39
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,819
but you need to go with the flow. Just accept the truth.

40
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,899
I just can't accept it.

41
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:51,979
I don't think it's that bad.

42
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:55,659
Even if Zhang Lurang is going to transfer to another school, you can still call him.

43
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:56,980
Suyang isn't far.

44
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,500
You can go see him during the holidays.

45
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,500
Transfer?

46
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:10,319
Are you not feeling upset because of Zhang Lurang's transfer?

47
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,040
Is he going to transfer?

48
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,020
Didn't you know about it?

49
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,460
When is he leaving?

50
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,919
I don't know. Do you want me to ask Gu Ran?

51
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,460
All of you knew except for me.

52
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,679
- Zaizai...
- Go back without me. I'm going to ask him.

53
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,120
What's wrong with you?

54
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,400
Are you going to transfer?

55
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,260
Actually,

56
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,180
I wanted to turn around and run home a few times on my way here.

57
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,320
I was afraid of hearing your answer,

58
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,520
but if I don't ask you now,

59
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,440
I'm not sure if I will still have the courage to ask you again tomorrow.

60
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,240
I thought...

61
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,019
♫ The first time I saw you, I was so nervous ♫

62
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:43,160
I thought you only find me annoying

63
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,540
and that at least we are still friends.

64
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,320
I'll just stop pestering you.

65
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:56,800
But everyone knew about your transfer, except for me.

66
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,560
What you did makes me think I'm not important at all.

67
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,940
♫ I'm used to having you by my side ♫

68
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,480
♫ The look you have while taking care of me ♫

69
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,220
Sorry.

70
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,320
It's getting late. I'm leaving.

71
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,979
Su Zaizai.

72
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:26,279
♫ I want to see the sunrise with you ♫

74
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:40,040
♫ I'll sing a song I wrote for you ♫

♫ It makes me melt like the sweetest sugar ♫

♫ You are the sweetest of sugar ♫

78
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,000
Zaizai, aren't you sitting here?

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,860
No, I'm not.

80
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,120
I don't want to be a nuisance.

81
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,739
Wait.

82
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,760
Where's Su Zaizai?

83
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,099
Zaizai is on duty. She went to get water.

84
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,620
Alone?

85
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,020
Yes.

86
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,260
Me too.

87
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,539
Brother Ran, are you willing to stay back and complete this honorable mission with us?

88
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:00,520
No.

89
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,040
Brother Rang, what about you?

90
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,200
Sure.

91
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,950
I knew you'd say yes.

92
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,280
Hey.

93
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,180
Brother Rang. I'm touched.

94
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,420
I'm going to get water.

95
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,940
I can do it myself.

96
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,920
Hey, Su Zaizai.

97
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,900
Don't you think Su Zaizai has been acting weird recently?

98
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,880
When she told us she was leaving,

99
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,160
she was talking to all of us, except for you.

100
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,700
What did you do to make her hate you so much?

101
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,840
Zaizai?

102
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,480
Who is that person?

103
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,279
I don't know.

104
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,760
You don't know when you are so close to her?

105
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,300
What a useless friend.

106
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,780
Zhang Lurang is closer to her.

107
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,500
Well, it's not necessary now.

108
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,739
The guy is quite handsome.

109
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:22,019
How is he handsome?

110
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:24,420
It's not the weekends and he's not wearing a uniform.

111
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,380
He's obviously doing something shady.

112
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,379
I heard girls from our class saying there have been

113
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:32,780
boys from other schools coming to the entrance to seek out girls recently.

114
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,220
They also whistled like hooligans.

115
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,500
Is he one of them?

116
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,460
No. I must ask her at night.

117
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,200
Hey. I heard girls from our class saying there have been

118
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,620
boys from other schools coming to the entrance to seek out girls recently.

119
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,240
They also whistled like hooligans.

120
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,720
Is he one of them?

121
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,300
A'Rang.

122
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,440
A'Rang!

123
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,899
Uncle, I'm going to the convenience store.

124
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:15,459
Hey, don't forget your wallet.

125
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:17,640
My wallet.

126
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,320
Why is he so absent-minded?

127
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,860
Yes.

128
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,900
This is not bad. Why aren't you eating?

129
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,860
Eat more if you like it.

130
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,680
Oh, right.

131
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,839
Did you tell your friends in your previous school when you transferred?

132
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,339
Of course. We are friends, after all.

133
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:50,080
Was there someone you didn't tell?

134
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,339
There was one.

135
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:54,179
A girl from the next class was very annoying,

136
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:56,379
so I didn't tell her about the transfer.

137
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:59,359
If I told her, she would ask many questions.

138
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:03,039
If she comes to see me during the holidays, it'll be more troublesome.

139
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,120
Well, when someone is too animated,

140
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,280
it is actually a burden for others sometimes.

141
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,480
You should eat air instead.

142
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,959
What are you doing? Is this how you treat your brother?

143
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,019
Mind your words. You are my cousin.

144
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:19,420
It belongs to the one who pays.

145
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,020
- No. It's mine.
- Give it to me!

146
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,599
I don't care. It's mine.

147
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:25,739
You mustn't eat anymore.

148
00:10:25,739 --> 00:10:27,540
I'm going to eat.

149
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,659
This, this, and this. They are all delicious.

150
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:32,200
Try it.

151
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,239
You ate it? I'll choke you!

152
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:43,020
Su Zaizai.

153
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,279
What are you doing?

154
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,440
What am I doing?

155
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,900
Come on, she is the one beating me up.

156
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,680
I'll walk you home.

157
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,500
No.

158
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,200
Su Zaizai.

159
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,080
You can say that I'm annoying.

160
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,100
I don't mean to be around you anyway.

161
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,840
Let's go.

162
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,700
Say something.

163
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,360
Who was that person?

164
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,679
Just a classmate.

165
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,480
A classmate?

166
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,019
Did you forget the look on his face?

167
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,880
He thought I was bullying you.

168
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,800
There's no way he's just a classmate.

169
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,139
He has a sense of justice.

170
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,640
Aren't all guys like that?

171
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,360
You don't know men at all.

172

At the convenience store, why did you...

173
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,580
Forget it.

174
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,640

212
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,480
I made you angry.

I think that if you find me annoying, I can...

214
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,660
I've never found you annoying.

215
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,800
Why did you tell everyone about the transfer except for me?

216
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,640
I've never told them about it.

217
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,120
I wanted...

218
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,080
I wanted you to be the first one to know,

219
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,400
but I thought about it for a long time

220
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,560
and didn't know how to tell you.

221
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,200
Why?

222
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,380
Because you are

223
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,260

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,340
There are a few months left.

227
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,700
Are you still angry?

228
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,260
Well, yes.

229
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,620
I'm a little angry.

230
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,859
Actually, not just a little.

231
00:15:34,859 --> 00:15:38,560
I was so angry that I couldn't eat lunch well for a few days.

232
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,200
Make your choice.

233
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,760
Pick one between comforting me or losing me.

234
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,900
If you won't pick,

235
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,240
I'm really getting angry.

236
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,400
How do I comfort you?

237
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,100
Just act cute.

I don't feel like it.

250
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,859
You are angry then.

251
00:16:48,859 --> 00:16:50,860
Why would I be angry? I don't want to be angry.

It's on this floor, so all of you should remove

the things in your drawers.

00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,000
but his exam is important,

272
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,140
so his father and I came together because we were worried.

Why would there be a problem?

290
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,419
A'Li liked sleeping with A'Rang when he was young.

00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,700

00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,460
to ask Luli if you have any questions.

296

I think so.

00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,220
What about your personalities?

358

No.

359

00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,180
My younger brother.

365
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,040
No.

366
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,460
You are the best-looking person.

367
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,460
Maybe...

368
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,940
you are the only one who thinks so.

369
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,399
Hey, Zhang Lurang.

370
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:06,199
I heard the genius in Grade 12 is your younger brother.

371
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:07,539
Is that true?

372
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,259
If you use your curiosity in studying,

373
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,360
Old Zhang would be so happy waking up from his dream.

374
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,339
My academic results are so-so.

375
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,739
I envy Zhang Lurang.

376
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,740
He doesn't have to tutor his younger brother. He can be the one being tutored instead.

377
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,139
These people are too free.

378
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,860
They learn about gossip faster than anyone else.

379
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,059
Their names are so similar.

380
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,699
Turns out they are really siblings.

381
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,459
Why do you get your news so quickly?

382
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,640
It's all over the forum.

383
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,179
Everyone already knows about it.

384
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,139
Yes.

385
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,259
I'm really envious of his family's genes.

386
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,500
How can both their children be so excellent?

387
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,819
Why his younger brother in Grade 12

388
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,299
has got so many awards

389
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,600
while Zhang Lurang is only in Grade 11?

390
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,760
He is not as good as his younger brother in this.

391
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,339
What do you mean by "only"?

392
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,859
All of us are only in Grade 11.

393
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,619
Everyone is different. You can't keep comparing them.

394
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,299
They are brothers.

395
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,940
It's normal to compare them.

396
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,159
I'm just saying.

397
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,600
You're so petty.

398
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,560
Yes, I am petty.

399
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,760
You're not eating at the canteen as well?

400
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,639
It's too crowded. My ears hurt.

401
00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:19,900
Aren't we going to your place?

402
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,040
You have good taste.

403
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,859
Wow.

404
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,320
What is it?
[Zhang Lurang, English 110]

405
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,340
Rang Rang.

406
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,760
You got 110 in your English for your last monthly exam.

407
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,820
Which teacher is so good at teaching you?

408
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,179
Why are you not ashamed of praising yourself?

409
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,080
Why should I feel embarrassed?

410
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,060
Guan Fang.

411
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:44,060
What's that on your lip?

412
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,280
Lip balm.

413
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,580
Jiang Jia gave it to me.

414
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,460
Huh?

415
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,419
Why do you know I used lip balm?

416
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,560
Isn't it transparent?

417
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,480
Sorry. I didn't know this lip balm changes color.

418
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,659
Jiang Jia.

419
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,379
Don't you run away from this!

420
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,580
I will run!

421
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,900
I'm going to kill you!

422
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,419
Brother.

423
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,619
Why don't we go to the amusement park tomorrow?

424
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,620
Didn't they say the Jiangyi Amusement Park is fun?

425
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,340
I have homework to do.

426
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,040
What about the day after tomorrow?

427
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,559
Do you want to go somewhere else? We can...

428
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,420
We'll see about that.

429
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,780
Okay.

430
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,980
I won't disturb you anymore.

431
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,659
Brother.

432
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:12,900
Are you done with your homework?

433
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,980
Yes.

434
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,919
Do you want to play games?

435
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,139
I brought it from Suyang especially.

436
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,659
I'm stuck at this stage.

437
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,700
I'm sure you can complete it immediately.

438
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,060
Play on your own.

439
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,460
Just half an hour.

440
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,780
Okay.

441
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,560
Brother, you are cheating!

442
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,440
I'll go easy on you in the next round.

443
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,260
You said it.

444
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,700
Be quiet. Our kids are studying.

445
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,280
Sure.

446
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,640
A'Rang.

447
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,760
Do you know what time it is?

448
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,960
Why are you still asking him to play games with you?

449
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,620
It's not brother...

450
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,499
I don't know what to say.

451
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,619
Your brother never plays games back at home

452
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,820
and he starts doing bad things as soon as he is in Jiangyi.

453
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,880
Playing too much makes you lose your ambition.

454
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,739
A'Rang.

455
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,019
Can you be considerate to me and your dad?

456
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,059
If you can be as serious as your brother...

457
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,360
Mom!

458
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,020
Can you please stop it?

459
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,219
Did I say anything wrong?

460
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,819
What is with that attitude?

461
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,600
Stop it!

462
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,420
I asked him to play with me, but you didn't even ask.

463
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:54,479
Seriously. Can you stop doing this?

464
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,910
- You...
- A'Li...

465
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,460
Coming.

466
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,440
Mom. Is Luli in your room?

467
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,420
No.

468
00:29:18,421 --> 00:29:19,960
Isn't he in your room?

469
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,530
No. I called him and no one picked up.

470
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,900
What?

471
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,260
A'Li.

472
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,700
Lin Mao, is A'Li in your room?

473
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,660
No.

474
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,200
What?

475
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,980
What's wrong?

476
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:34,280
Our son is missing.

477
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,820
A'Li.

478
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,739
What's going on?

479
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,481
A'Li!

480
00:29:37,481 --> 00:29:38,240
What's going on?

481
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,640
A'Li.

482
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,659
Why didn't you know when he left

483
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,500
when both of you were in the same room?

484
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,740
Enough, Sister.

485
00:29:46,741 --> 00:29:48,019
It's no use talking about this.

486
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,579
Let's go out and find him.

487
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,819
A'Li is not familiar with Jiangyi.

488
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,860
I don't think he's far from here.

489
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,980
Yes. Let's go find him.

490
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,020
Let's go.

491
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,800
You want the Superb Mosquito Repellent, right?

492
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,140
All right. I know.

493
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:09,980
I'll go home after I buy it.

494
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,099
Aren't these brands similar?

495
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,700
Do you see a 16-year-old student around here?

496
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,960
Rang Rang?

497
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,379
Why do you look so worried?

498
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,539
Did something happen?

499
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,699
My brother went missing.

500
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,700
He is quite emotional.

501
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,860
It's a boy.

502
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,360
He is wearing a gray short-sleeve shirt.

503
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,380
I don't think I've seen him.

504
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,340
Sure.

505
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,880
Thank you.

506
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,720
I'm leaving.

507
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,740
Hey, Rang Rang.

508
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,019
You are not as familiar with Jiangyi as me.

509
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,800
Let me search for him with you.

510
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,279
- Sure.
- Let's go.

511
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,610
Luli!

512
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:55,780
Sorry...

513
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,580
Luli!

514
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,500
The number you've dial cannot be connected.

515
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,920
He is not picking up his phone.

516
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,219
Is he still not picking up?

517
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,520
Let's look over there, Sister.

518
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,440
Sure.

519
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,580
Zhang Luli!

520
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,920
Luli!

521
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,780
Hey. Did you find him?

522
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,641
No. What about you?

523
00:31:17,641 --> 00:31:18,900
No.

524
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,440
We went all the way to the school and didn't see him.

525
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,960
He's not at the bus station either.

526
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,659
Let's report it to the police if nothing else works.

527
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,900
The police sure can do more than us.

528
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,260
Yes. Let's call the police.

529
00:31:30,261 --> 00:31:31,459
We'll go right now.

530
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,920
Let's go.

531
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,561
A'Rang. Go back to rest.

532
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:36,180
We don't need so many people.

533
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,739
How can he rest at a time like this?

534
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,000
Zhang Lurang, seriously.

535
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,159
You were with your brother,

536
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:43,440
but you didn't even know when he left.

537
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,139
That's enough.

538
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,640
Would this have happened if you didn't scold him?

539
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,980
What did I say?

540
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,939
Well, why are you talking about this?

541
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,300
The most important thing is to find A'Li.

542
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,540
I'll go find him at another place.

543
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,100
Call the police.

544
00:32:01,101 --> 00:32:02,040
Let's go look for him.

545
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,740
- Quick!
- Let's go.

546
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,999
You don't know me, but I know you.

547
00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:43,100
Zhang Luli, right?

548
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,200
I am Su Zaizai, your brother's friend.

549
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,200
Are you the one

550
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,300
who gave him the talking doll?

551
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,580
Doll?

552
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,960
Oh.

553
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,580
That one?

554
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,900
Your brother even told you that?

555
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,320
I saw it myself.

556
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,800
He'd never talk about these things with me.

557
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,600
When I knew I would be coming here, I was very happy

558
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,800
because this place must be great since my brother likes it.

559
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,840
I idolize him.

560
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,560
I didn't know how to tie my shoelaces when I was young.

561
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,920
My brother always helped me with it.

562
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,019
I didn't remember the way back home.

563
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:39,039
Brother.

564
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,360
He would wait at the school's entrance for me.

565
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,420
Sometimes, he would also buy me lollipops with his pocket money.

566
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:51,300
He is only a year older than me,

567
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,520
but I already thought he was amazing back then.

568
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,200
He is so much more amazing than me.

569
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,640
Perhaps the bias started with an extra fried egg,

570
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,120
a parents' meet where only one can be chosen,
[Welcome Parents]

571
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,900
or a pointless comparison.

572
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,160
And they started to get used to it

573
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,740
and take everything for granted.

574
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:18,600
Even I became the accomplice.

575
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,139
Hey, Luli.

576
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:25,360
Brother.

577
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,080
Do you know how to solve this question?

578
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,720
Yes.

579
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,521
Oh. Then...

580
00:34:31,521 --> 00:34:32,699
This question is easy.

581
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,099
Brother, don't you know how to do it?

582
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,500
I was happy.

583
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:40,080
My all-mighty brother asked me a question.

584
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,360
I thought I could help him.

585
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,800
However,

586
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,820
I was immature back then.

587
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,760
I was

588
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,360
very immature.

589
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,619
Later, I realized

590
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,240
all of them were saying...

591
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,079
A'Rang,

592
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:56,840
your scores are so much lower than your younger brother's.

593
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,380
Did you even study?

594
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,160
A'Rang, I'm tired of lecturing you.

595
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,680
You can ask your brother if you don't know.

597

I thought that was his personality

602
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,620

615
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:03,840
I had to pester Zhang Lurang for him to become my friend.

616
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,959
Really?

617
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:06,060
Yes.

I think I get along well with your brother.

625

How so?

626
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,200
Because we have the same idol.

627
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,279
He envies me because I can go to school with you

628
00:38:13,279 --> 00:38:17,100
and take the same bus, and because we have mutual friends.

629
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,640
I envy him for having a good brother

630
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,299
who waited for him at the school entrance

631
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,660
and helped him tie his shoelaces.

632

00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,140
Yes.

00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,099
was always the genius as mentioned by everyone,

636
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,460
but I neglected the fact that he is only 16 years old.

637
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,500
