They're enough to get him a sentence.

God knows if he can make it out of jail.

339

we can't get the goods back anyway.

while we do all the fieldwork.

682
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,230
Captain Luo,
I didn't blow my cover last time.

683
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,510
I failed
because that person had no intention

684
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,440
to make a transaction with me.

685
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,670
I'll definitely perform better this time.

686
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,480
Trust me.

687
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,800
Actually, Zhi'an is quite meticulous.

688
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,110
She just doesn't look much like
a narcotics officer.

689
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:40,570
Thanks.

690
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,180
Captain Luo,
I can play a wide range of roles.

691
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,190
I can play the role
of a small-town delinquent,

692
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,190
a lonely rich girl,

693
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,280
or...

694
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,320
an energetic college girl.

695
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,030
If necessary, I can also be...

696
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,110
Alright. Stop.

697
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,510
Now you're just gibbering.

698
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,070
Luo,

699
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,390
based on the previous experience,

700
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,070
I think Zhi'an can handle this task.

701
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,000
I'll be with her this time.

702
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,660
There shouldn't be a problem.

703
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,480
Okay.
You'll be in charge of this operation,

704
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,480
with Zixian's assistance.

705
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:02,710
Got it.

706
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,190
Take action.

707
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:03,670
Okay.

708
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:04,900
Great!

709
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,000
Uncle Ma,

710
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:35,750
what else would you like?

711
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:36,440
Nothing.

712
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:37,870
♪ Let her know what's on your mind ♪

713
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,150
You've got meat and vegetables.

714
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:37,670
Take your pick.

715
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:38,840
It's enough. I can't eat more.

716
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,780
Come on!

717
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,850
♪ I have little expectations for him ♪

718
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:47,110
♪ I dare not express my thoughts ♪

719
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,140
Two chicken feet, grabbing money for us.

720
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,110
-Hope we'll make a big fortune.
-Sure.

721
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:50,920
Let me help.

722
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,360
Sir.

723
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,590
I'll take these.

724
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,080
We were just talking about Lili.

725
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,320
Who is she close with?

726
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,920
Lili?

727
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:06,880
She's close with Four-Eyes.

728
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,980
♪ He looks all handsome and decent ♪

729
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,240
Hao can't help but drool

730
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,710
at the sight of Lili.

731
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,600
Is that so?

732
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:13,550
♪ She has a nice figure ♪

733
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,710
♪ I have higher and higher expectations
for him ♪

734
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,400
This boosts masculinity.

735
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,310
Have some.

736
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:17,950
Eat up.

737
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:18,660
Do you...

738
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,330
know

739
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,980
♪ His gaze happens to fall upon me ♪

740
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,320
Lili's background?

741
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,590
She never came from much.

742
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,400
She just knows

743
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,000
many people of every stripe.

744
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:29,960
Duozai wanted

745
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,480
to buy a car,

746
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:33,800
and Lili introduced him to a dealer.

747
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,550
Really?

748
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,290
What kind of car?

749
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,050
I'd rather not say,

750
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,860
to avoid shedding tears.

751
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,480
Hao.

752
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:06,250
Where are you?

753
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,030
Anything wrong?

754
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,670
No big deal.

755
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,450
Mr. Zhen.

756
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:31,890
Thank you.

757
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,630
Are you free

758
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,560
after lunch?

759
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,830
Yes.

760
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:38,720
Well,

761
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:40,810
then join me in a little project.

762
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,760
A little project?

763
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:43,840
Let's go for it.
