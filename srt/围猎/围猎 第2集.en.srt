They're valuable!

374

They are the most expensive equipment

375
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,050
in the game.

They can be traded or gifted.

378
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,780
Trading only refers to

379

Yes.

382
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,110
But they can be exchanged

383
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,720

387
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,350
Maybe they use virtual currency

388
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,610
to replace drug money.

389
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,830

Would that solve the case?

396

It's not that simple.

397

We can't solve cases based on imagination.

398
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,640
Right. If it were that easy,

399

we'd all be out of the job.

They didn't show up.

How long did you wait?

Less than half an hour.

When we arrived there,

705
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,750
there was no word from Mastermind.

706
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,960
That's exactly right.

We were communicating just fine before.

He told me to go to Sanyuan Alley,

That's normal.

How is that possible?

I didn't do anything.

Yes.

It's simple.

how could you possibly deal with someone

721

Right?

They're not all as naive as you.

726
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,160
Then why did he arrange to meet me?

To see who you are.

If you don't believe me, go back.

You'll probably find video footage.

In that footage,

the dealer might appear,

737
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,310

You'd better cooperate with us.

867
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,550
I demand protection for my family.

868
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,450
Then I'll tell you.

869
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,380
I'll tell you everything.

870
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,970
Is that all you want?

871
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,600
That can be arranged.

872
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,920
Just cooperate with us.

873
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,520
Tell us everything you know,

874
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,650
and the police will protect them well.

875
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,890
So you hurt yourself

876
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,510
for such a simple reason.

877
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:31,000
My family is innocent.
