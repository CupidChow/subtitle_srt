♫  Don't hold back, grow with all your might  ♫

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,720

♫  Now is the time to format your life  ♫

10

11

18
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,000
   

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,310
   

20
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,120
You call that studying?

21
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,550
Of course, I'm studying!

22
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,390
I'm studying history,

23
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,640
the tragic history of my dear sister.

24
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,750
I heard you scored even lower than Yi Tianyu.

25
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,090
- Dead last, huh? 
 - Give it back!

26
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,520
Isn't he the guy always showing off on the basketball court?

27
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,720
He's not bad.

28
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,110
But still a little off compared to me.

29
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,080
- Give it back! 
 - No, no, no.

30
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,270
Give it to me! Don't make me hit you!

31
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,190
- Hurry up! Give it to me! 
 - Hit me.

32
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,550
Beg me. Beg, and I might give it back.

33
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,850
Not happening, just give me that!

34
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,740
What's with all the noise? 
    

35
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,830
Mom, help me out here.

36
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,520
I asked her for a workbook, but she just won't give it to me.

37
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,640
Mom, Gu Mingze always scribbles all over my workbooks.

38
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,150
I have to buy new ones every semester. You have to back me up here!

39
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,870
Didn't I already pay you back for those?

40
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,040
I gave you ten yuan.

41
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,520
- What ten yuan? 
 - What's that accent?

42
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,830
You only lived in the south a few more years than Jiao Jiao,

43
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,800
but you still can't shake that accent.

44
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,920
You two fight all the time.

45
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,530
You speak Cantonese, she speaks Mandarin, and it's driving me nuts!

46
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,590
Can you just stop fighting?

47
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,900
Focus on your studies.

48
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,640
You!

49
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,840
Sit down.

50
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,060
Behave!

51
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,080
Why are you staring at me like that?

52
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,750
Aren't you supposed to think your big brother is all mighty now?

53
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,558
How do you know Yi Tianyu?

54
00:03:18,558 --> 00:03:20,150
What? You want to know?

55
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,660
I know a lot more than you think.

56
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,321
But don't worry, Shiyun asked me to keep your secret.

57
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:29,360
When I promise something, I keep it.

58
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,870
You should feel lucky to have a bestie like her.

59
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,640
 Keep my secret? 

60
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,850
 She just wants it to be someone else who spreads my embarrassing story. 

61
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:42,040
 Too bad, she found this idiot. 

62
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,040
Do you know that sometimes girls say the opposite of what they mean?

63
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,520
What opposite? What do you mean?

64
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,800
Fine.

65
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,030
It's best if you never find out.

66
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,920
 This time, I really am breaking up with him. 

67
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,640
 Just calmly talk to Yi Tianyu. 

68
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,370
 - I'll call a taxi and accompany you back. 
 - I... 

69
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,660
 She always outperformed me in exams back then. 

70
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,400
 If Yi Tianyu hadn't shown up, 

71
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,390
 she might have been the one to go to Jinghai University, not me. 

72
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,523
 My mom always compares the two of us, 

73
00:04:29,523 --> 00:04:32,470
 saying I can never outscore Auntie Li's daughter. 

74
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,640
 Well, look at her now. All tear-eyed. 

75
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,080
 That's probably as far as she'll ever go in life. 

76
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,870
Mama, good morning. 
    

77
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,490
Morning.

78
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,460
Auntie Sitong isn't here yet?

79
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,630
Don't get me started.

80
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,750
I've had it with Li Sitong.

81
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,630
I told her that since she has two kids preparing for the college entrance exams,

82
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,320
she could come in a bit later.

83
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,460
I didn't think she'd take it seriously.

84
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,070
Maybe she just got held up.

85
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,830
Mom, I won't be having breakfast at home today.

86
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,270
I have to rush to school for the morning reading class.

87
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,370
Hurry up then.

88
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,560
I'll take some bread.

89
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,140
Sorry, sorry, I'm late!

90
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,270
Uh... something urgent came up at home.

91
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,850
I'll make breakfast for you right now.

92
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,120
It's all Xuejiao's fault.

93
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,310
It's okay, Auntie Sitong.

94
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,410
Don't blame Xuejiao.

95
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,892
Actually, she's...

96
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:30,760
- really trying.... 
 - She's really been working very hard.

97
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,200
She even ordered a whole stack of prep books.

98
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,270
They blocked my door this morning.

99
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,060
Oh, I'll go and make breakfast.

100
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,300
Even other people's kids are striving so hard.

101
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,130
Don't just stand here; forget about this bread.

102
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,540
Go to morning reading. Hurry up!

103
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,530
Yes, Mama.

104
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,790
I bought all these books from you, Lin Zhihua.

105
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,060
Let's see how you'll thank me.

106
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,410
Xuejiao.

107
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,600
Coming.

108
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,720
What?

109
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,230
   

110
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,500
A late birthday present.

111
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,380
I loaded all the romance novels you've wanted to read

112
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,910
into this electronic dictionary.

113
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,350
You can read all you want. Your parents will never find out.

114
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,000
Read them without worrying.

115
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,370
You're so thoughtful.

116
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,990
Thanks.

117
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,980
I'm heading back now.

118
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,210
 That two-faced girl. What is she plotting this time? 

119
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,980
 - Zhou Shiyun? 
 - You're Director Lin's most valued hire. 

120
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,940
 It's only right that I see you out. 

121
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,560
 But, Miss Zhou, 

122
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,650
 you do owe me a dinner. 

123
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,681
 Official headcount is tight these days. 

124
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:15,660
 I had to kick a contractor out to make room for you. 

125
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,450
 What do you mean? 

126
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,540
 We planted a critical bug in her code. 

127
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,570
What do you think? That stuff is exciting, right?

128
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,640
Absolutely.

129
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,400
 

130
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,150
What?

131
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,290
Why is it...

132
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,840
 Ask somebody for... 

133
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,800
 What a good kid. 

134
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,740
In trouble again?

135
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,101
Try not to scream too loudly when getting beaten.

136
00:07:42,101 --> 00:07:44,421
I need to study.

137
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:45,995
Stop!

138
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,350
Dad, you're calling me?

139
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,240
Why did you change my intention form?

140
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,090
Dad, maybe you got too excited and ticked the wrong box?

141
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,420
Why would I touch your form?

142
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,730
Come look at this yourself.

143
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,990
The check marks are exactly the same as yours.

144
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,570
I mean, why would you mess with his form?

145
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,480
How could you do this?

146
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,649
Dad! Dad! Calm down.

147
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:13,810
Just fill out a new one.

148
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,420
You can't beat up the kid.

149
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,535
Fill out a new one?

150
00:08:18,535 --> 00:08:20,765
Look at this, just look. 
    

151
00:08:20,765 --> 00:08:22,000
The severance pay has already come in.

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,890
I've spent my whole life at that factory!

153
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,640
How could you do something so reckless like that?

154
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,330
- Dad! Dad! Don't do it! 
 - Just yell at her dad.

155
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:35,200
- Don't hit her, just... 
 - What are you hitting me for, Dad?

156
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,570
Keep running, I dare you!

157
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,060
- Don't hit me. 
 - It's all right.

158
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,648
 As reported by our station, 
   

159
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:46,420
 the famous phone brand Yanuo officially declared bankruptcy today. 

160
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,920
 Yanuo's largest parts supplier, 

161
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,511
 our city's South District Component Factory was hit 

162
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:53,060
 with huge order cancellations with no legal recourse. 

163
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,940
 Coming up next: the financial news. 

164
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,970
Wait... what?

165
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,670
This...

166
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,390
Dad! Dad!

167
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,670
Doctor, how is he?

168
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,145
Nothing serious.

169
00:09:11,145 --> 00:09:12,910
Once his blood pressure stabilizes, he can go home.

170
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,830
Thank goodness.

171
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,480
Thank you.

172
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,390
Gu Xuejiao, you've been acting strange lately.

173
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,770
Why did you mess with Dad's intention form?

174
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,320
And you actually did the right thing.

175
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,750
Otherwise, he would have lost everything, his job, and the severance pay.

176
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,980
True.

177
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,420
I can predict the future. How about that?

178
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,290
With just one flick of my finger,

179
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,190
not only can we keep Dad's severance,

180
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,100
we can even get filthy rich.

181
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,980
I just give you an inch and you take a mile, don't you?

182
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,620
If you're that good, you can see the future,

183
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,550
why don't you buy a lottery ticket?

184
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:58,560
Why worry about Dad's severance pay?

185
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,110
 You think I don't want to? 

186
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,580
If you can predict the future,

187
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:10,730
can you tell me whether Shiyun and I will get into the same university?

188
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,730
Where are you going?

189
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,550
Tutor Lin! What a coincidence.

190
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,430
- Long time no see. 
 - It's you again.

191
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:56,460
Tutor Lin, looks like you're in a good mood today.

192
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,684
You think you can tell I'm in a good mood?

193
00:10:59,684 --> 00:11:00,840
I'm not going to be your tutor.

194
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,310
I haven't said anything yet.

195
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,720
But you still know what I was going to say.

196
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,980
That just shows we're in sync.

197
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,420
You're just the right tutor for me.

198
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,910
Tutor Lin.

199
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,580
Stop sticking to me like glue.

200
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,510
Not until you say yes.

201
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,400
Tutor Lin, please.

202
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,600
Tutor Lin...

203
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,050
Tutor Lin.

204
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,970
What happened to Tutor Xiao Gao?

205
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,580
We didn't talk much, but every time we met,

206
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,610
he encouraged me and told me not to give up.

207
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,960
I didn't imagine that he was this sick...

208
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,090
You should go.

209
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,600
Tutor Lin,

210
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,860
I think when Tutor Xiao Gao wakes up,

211
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,790
he would want his life and his work to stay the same.

212
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,910
Otherwise, he might really be upset.

213
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,800
I'll get going now.

214
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,780
It looks like you really did tell her not to give up.

215
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,800
Come with me.

216
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,680
I can tutor you,

217
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,950
but find all of these first. Then we can talk.

218
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,910
What are these?

219
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,010
Out-of-print study materials.

220
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,000
If they're out of print, where am I supposed to find them?

221
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,050
What did Tutor Gao tell you?

222
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,220
"Don't give up."

223
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,440
Tutor Lin! Let's add each other on WeChat.

224
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,070
That way, I won't have to stalk you.

225
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,310
I can't add you. No more spots in my quota.

226
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,693
No more spots?

227
00:13:11,693 --> 00:13:14,325
No ineffective socializing. No adding people I don't need.

228
00:13:14,325 --> 00:13:15,404
Okay.

229
00:13:15,404 --> 00:13:17,334
Excuse me.

230
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,170
   

231
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,980
 Gao Rui is your best friend. 

232
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,670
 You're hurting more than anyone else. 

233
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,500
 But this wasn't your fault. 

234
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,320
 It was a failure of safety awareness by the whole project team. 

235
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,700
 I should've stopped Old Gao earlier. 

236
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,910
 None of us wanted this to happen. 

237
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,010
 This is hard for everyone. 

238
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,440
 But you are taking this too hard. 

239
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,150
 I believe Gao Rui wouldn't want to see you like this. 

240
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,720
 I've got an idea for you. 

241
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,310
 Gao Rui has been working multiple part-time jobs. 

242
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:18,340
 Why don't you take over his work and keep things running? 

243
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,849
 That way, when he wakes up, his life will still look the same. 

244
00:14:21,849 --> 00:14:23,014
 Nothing will have changed. 

245
00:14:23,014 --> 00:14:25,070
   

246
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:45,160
To make more money, you've got to invest.

247
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,320
You think that can make you money by investing?

248
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,160
Tell me. How many people actually benefit from investing?

249
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,610
You know, most of them lose money.

250
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,250
It's not that easy for the average person.

251
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,270
Now, I actually agree with that point of view.

252
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,250
But am I an "average person"?

253
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,650
If it weren't for my foresight,

254
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:06,280
would we even have that severance payout?

255
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,050
All right, that's enough. No more talk about this money.

256
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,800
I'm going to look up the interest on a 5-year fixed deposit.

257
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,194
Honey, don't you want to hear my investment plan?

258
00:15:16,194 --> 00:15:17,750
Look at your mom.

259
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,540
If it weren't for my vision, we wouldn't even...

260
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,030
Listen, here's my plan.

261
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,670
Brother.

262
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,850
Gu Xuejiao, what do you want?

263
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,700
Why aren't you using my name? It's scary.

264
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,240
Brother, it's your third try at the college entrance exams this year.

265
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,760
You must have a ton of study materials, right?

266
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,240
Have you ever heard about some sort of "Secret Cram Study Guides,"

267
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,580
"Top Students' 300 Must-Do Questions," or something like that?

268
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,920
What are those?

269
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,410
I have plenty of review materials.

270
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,840
But how would I even know exactly what I have?

271
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,510
Since when have you suddenly cared so much about studying?

272
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:02,520
Aren't you going a little overboard, turning grief into motivation?

273
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,160
Do you have money?

274
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,340
I just remembered I need to buy some new materials.

275
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,170
You think I would believe that?

276
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,750
No.

277
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,640
That's mine!

278
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,810
Mine!

279
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,850
I know Dad keeps his cash here!

280
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,160
- I'm off. 
 - Gu Mingze!

281
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,050
- Give it to me! 
 - Bye-bye.

282
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,040
Gu Ming... Dad!

283
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,580
Yes. What?

284
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,212
- What is it? 
 - Your...

285
00:16:34,212 --> 00:16:37,370
- My what? 
 - His what?

286
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:41,140
Ugh, the pickles today were too spicy.

287
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,730
 Over here! 

288
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,260
 Nice! 

289
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,780
   

290
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,220
Where could I get these?

291
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,510
 Since they're out of print, even if someone has them, 

292
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,950
 they probably wouldn't share them with me. 

293
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,890
 Nice! 

294
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,030
 Nice! 

295
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,650
 Why isn't she excited like she usually is at a basketball competition? 

296
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,190
 Why is she suddenly so down? 

297
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,787
 Weird. 

298
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:17,980
 Please bless us. 

299
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,930
Xuejiao, you want to join us?

300
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,020
For what?

301
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,540
Praying that our class wins the basketball championship this year.

302
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,190
This formation is really effective.

303
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,771
To show my sincerity, I even baked these cupcakes myself.

304
00:17:28,771 --> 00:17:31,500
You can sit with Yi Tianyu. You should cheer for him, too.

305
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,260
Maybe next time, when you set up a "top-scorer formation."

306
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,200
Then, I'll set it up for you.

307
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,120
Dear God, I didn't make that wish.

308
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,400
Don't waste my wish, please.

309
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,890
Look, Xuejiao. Our class is leading by a lot.

310
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,990
See? See? The formation really worked!

311
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,170
If I've got this free time,

312
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,590
I might as well do two more problems instead.

313
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,400
 Go team! 

314
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,440
Did I somehow make her mad? She's turned against me?

315
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,840
Go! Go!

316
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,260
Go! Go! Go! Go!

317
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,080
It's time for class. I'm heading back.

318
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,060
Yi Tianyu, man! What are you doing? Defense!

319
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,689
- Tianyu! Defense! 
 - Okay, okay.

320
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,730
Yi Tianyu, go, go!

321
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,710
Pass the ball! Pass!

322
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,190
What are you thinking? Defense!

323
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,540
Defense, dude!

324
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,240
Watch out!

325
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,790
 First, pretend to accidentally hit her. 

326
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,720
 Then, flash my most handsome smile and apologize. 

327
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,950
 She'll surely be so touched and forgive me for everything. 

328
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,730
 Yi Tianyu, you're such a genius. 

329
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,400
Excuse me, excuse me.

330
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,480
Are you okay?

331
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:03,100
Your arm is probably too sore to aim straight.

332
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,880
Here, apply this.

333
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,000
Chen Xiao, you're so thoughtful.

334
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,400
 Looks like she's not mad anymore. 

335
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,750
 As expected, a charming smile always works. 

336
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,740
Thanks.

337
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,650
Come on, let's keep playing.

338
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,780
 Connections are wealth. 

339
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,890
 Good looks are valuable, too. 

340
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,400
 If someone is willing to pay for a pretty face, 

341
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,710
 why not make the most of it? 

342
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:38,200
 Yi Tianyu, you're finally useful for once. 

343
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,920
♫  Block everything that is of no importance  ♫ 
    

344
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,040
♫  Block out the ridicule from outsiders   ♫

345
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,230
♫  Block out the powerless prayers  ♫

346
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,580
♫  Block out meaningless slogans  ♫

347
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,990
Why share it with others?

348
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,550
True value comes from sharing.

349
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,930
You have to give to gain. 
    

350
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,640
 Yi Tianyu's personal books. 
   

351
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,400
 Anyone interested? 
   

352
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,450
 Step one, 

353
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,370
 create a private user zone.  
    

354
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,920
He's so handsome.

355
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,320
Join the group, hurry!

356
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,360
766, 766.

357
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,880
- There are photos in the group! 
  - Hooked, right? 

358
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,230
 Step two, hunger marketing. 

359
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,600
 Play right into the fans' psychology. 

360
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,000
 Who has Top Student's class notes from every year? 

361
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,165
 - I do, I do! 
 - I want them, too! 

362
00:20:18,165 --> 00:20:20,240
 Who can get me the "Top Student's 300 Must-Do Math Questions"? A surprise gift awaits. 

363
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,610
"300 Must-Do Math Questions"?

364
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,120
 "Whoever can get me the Top Student's 300 Must-Do Math Questions, 

365
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,450
 A surprise gift awaits." 

366
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,120
I remember you have some rare study review materials, right?

367
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,980
Although they revised them, there's one called

368
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,060
"300 Must-Do Questions."

369
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,790
You're looking for this, too?

370
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,890
Is it trending lately?

371
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,100
Gu Xuejiao is also asking about it.

372
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,920
 She must want to compete with me. 

373
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,400
 She must want to block my way. 

374
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,880
We mustn't let her get it.

375
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,320
So sorry, Teacher.

376
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:01,360
First point. Remember, this is a point we can take note.

377
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,760
And that is absolute freedom of thought.

378
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,230
After school tomorrow, can we go to that restaurant again?

379
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,920
- Okay. 
 - But I think that boss is cutting back on portions.

380
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,580
- It wasn't enough for me. 
 - Hand it over.

381
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,920
I don't have any money.

382
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,080
Who asked you for money?

383
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,840
What I want is the "300 Must-Do Math Questions". 
 - Don't.

384
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,550
- Don't get involved. You don't want to cross her. 
 - That is rare study review material.

385
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:24,230
She's bullying our class rep.

386
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,160
I can't just watch her being bullied.

387
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,360
Also, look, we are three people here.

388
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,610
She's alone.

389
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:30,790
We can easily handle her.

390
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,240
Let's go.

391
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,160
Stop right there.

392
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,320
Gu Xuejiao, I haven't come looking for you yet.

393
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,830
how come you just brought yourself to me?

394
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,750
Well, we won't disturb your team bonding.

395
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,840
We're leaving.

396
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,360
Weren't you pretty tough just now?

397
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,390
Why are you so scared now?

398
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:13,380
It's not polite to point at people like this. Did you know that?

399
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:21,070
What can you do about it?

400
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:28,460
I'll count to three.

401
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,350
One.

402
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,920
Two.

403
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,774
Three.

404
00:22:34,774 --> 00:22:36,634
- Run! 
 - Fight...

405
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,540
So pathetic.

406
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,480
So these are your friends?

407
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
Gu Xuejiao!

408
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,160
- You all right? 
 - I'm fine.

409
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,510
Where's Xuejiao?

410
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,210
No idea.

411
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,650
- Gu Xuejiao, put it down! 
 - Get back, back!

412
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:18,080
It's so dirty! Yuck.

413
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,160
You're the ones who cornered me here.

414
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,730
Back!

415
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,680
- You two, go. 
 - Try me!

416
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,840
I dare you!

417
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,630
My hands are shaky. I've got Parkinson's, you know.

418
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,950
Back!

419
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,730
Parkinson's...

420
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:37,830
Gu Xuejiao, you... just you wait!

421
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,030
Xuejiao,

422
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,400
let her pick it up herself.

423
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,090
Or you'll make her bag smell bad, too.

424
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,170
Thanks.

425
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,190
No need to thank me.

426
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,270
Liu Xuewei.

427
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:37,110
can you give me this as a reward?

428
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:53,220
   

429
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:16,090
   
   

430
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,120
Hello.

431
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,720
How much?

432
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,690
¥20.

433
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,120
Thanks.

434
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:50,260
I've gathered all the study materials you asked for.

435
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:16,540
A quick test; let's see where you  are now.

436
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,360
Let me see.

437
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,820
Wait, hold on.

438
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,777
   
   

439
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,230
That's it for today.

440
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,060
Finish your food and go home.

441
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,230
With just this little bit?

442
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,640
I'm still going to be hungry.

443
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,890
Then eat more at home.

444
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,070
I haven't finished the test yet.

445
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,780
You won't be able to.

446
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,780
You've hit your limit.

447
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,030
I was in the top 20 back in Grade 10.

448
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,260
But now you're near the bottom.

449
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,340
Face it.

450
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,510
I think there's still hope for me.

451
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:00,380
Well, I don't think so.

452
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:12,270
 I knew you'd give up when it got hard. 

453
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,230
We're closing.

454
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,790
Aren't you leaving?

455
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:05,380
I must solve this question.

456
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,550
Let me see.

457
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,990
Your approach was right this time,

458
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,320
but the calculations were a bit complicated.

459
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,980
Try to simplify it.

460
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:25,790
I told you. With my brilliant mind, I can definitely solve it.

461
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,690
It's late. Finish it when you get home.

462
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,820
Then send me a pic of it.

463
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,720
Oh, no.

464
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,400
What?

465
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,400
It's locked.

466
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,190
What do we do?

467
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,000
Figure something out.

468
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,920
Where is that little brat?

469
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,440
Getting home later than me?

470
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,840
 Xuejiao. 

471
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,810
 Xuejiao, are you asleep? 

472
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,710
She must've worked really hard.

473
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,930
She went to bed so early.

474
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,020
 Where the heck are you? Come home. 

475
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,190
 At Zhou Shiyun's place. 

476
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,920
 Do not disturb me. 

477
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,140
I was being kind covering for you.

478
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,380
And you went to Shiyun's place without even telling me?

479
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,990
Problem solved. But it'll take a while.

480
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,260
Burning the midnight oil surrounded by books.

481
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,810
When I get into Jinghai University and come back to give a talk,

482
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:26,030
I'll make sure this glorious moment gets spread around at No.7 High.

483
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,260
You don't need to prepare a script.

484
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,070
You won't need it.

485
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,060
Buzzkill.

486
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,920
All this trouble for one question, was it worth it?

487
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,600
Totally.

488
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,730
You're not going to quit soon, right?

489
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,540
You seem like an impulsive person.

490
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,690
Impulsive people tend to quit easily.

491
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:55,600
They jump into things without thinking.

492
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,110
Then quit halfway through when there's something new.

493
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,610
So you gave me a tough test on purpose

494
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:07,780
to see if I would give up easily?

495
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,570
Stereotype.

496
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:17,730
 If you don't help me, you're on your own. 

497
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,040
-   
 -  

498
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,001
   

499
00:32:20,001 --> 00:32:22,590
 Xuejiao, your blanket. 

500
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,170
 Hey, Xuejiao. 

501
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,110
Don't put it over your head.

502
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,630
You'll run out of air.

503
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,210
Here.

504
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:39,260
You... This kid, sleeping like you're performing a circus act.

505
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:43,000
The light's still on.

506
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,590
It would be great if only these two kids could balance each other out.

507
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:52,060
One studies like crazy, the other won't study at all.

508
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,110
 You're toast. 
   

509
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,340
 Mom's doing a room check. 

510
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,340
Barely lasted a minute.

511
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,280
 Okay, okay. 

512
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,800
 Out of sight, out of mind. 

513
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,130
 Might as well focus and do the questions. 

514
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,760
   

515
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:35,050
Mingze, you're still up?

516
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,670
- Mom. 
 - What are you doing?

517
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:48,540
I read on a forum that light exercise before bed helps you sleep better.

518
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,950
Want to give it a try?

519
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:53,280
Stop wasting your time on these pointless things.

520
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,800
Keep it down.

521
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,280
Your sister's asleep.

522
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,590
Learn from her. Go to bed early and get up early.

523
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:02,550
Focus on your studies.

524
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,670
I will next time.

525
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,930
Watch your head.

526
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:20,830
 Hello, the number you've dialed is powered off. 

527
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,950
Powered off?

528
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:26,300
You little punk. Going rogue now?

529
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,070
If it weren't for your brilliant big brother,

530
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,760
you'd have gotten a good beating by now.

531
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,410
 You and Xuejiao, don't worry. Have fun. 

532
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:34,530
 I've got you covered. 

533
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,680
 You won't be caught. 

534
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,050
I got it...!

535
00:34:50,276 --> 00:34:52,256
Lin Zhihua.

536
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:12,230
Sour face.

537
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,800
How dare you? You think you're something?

538
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,530
I...

539
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:52,350
 No. What am I doing? 

540
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:12,580
There really are only five people.

541
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,150
It's okay.

542
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:19,050
I'll help you connect with the entire world.

543
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:36,850
   

544
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,770
Who's that?

545
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,760
   

546
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,620
Now, what do I do?

547
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,650
 Old Gao! 

548
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:49,990
 Old Gao! 

549
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,180
 Old Lin! 

550
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,760
   

551
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,240
   

552
00:37:11,139 --> 00:37:14,820
 Gao Rui. Time of death, September 5, 2014, 

553
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,650
 19 minutes and 32 seconds past 10:00 p.m. 

554
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,900
You... You had a nightmare?

555
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,150
No nightmare is any scarier than you.

556
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,720
Drop your stereotypes.

557
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,920
Get ready to be scared to death by me!

558
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,810
I figured it out. Look.

559
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:46,480
I solved it myself. Let me show you my calculations.

560
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,460
This...

561
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,040
an=2−1/an−1.

562
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,850
So, an+1=2−1/an.

563
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,380
Right?

564
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:15,760
So, bn+1−bn=1/an+1−1−1/an−1

565
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,800
=1/2−1/an−1=1/an−1.

566
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,460
Right?

567
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,540
And then, BN plus one minus BN.

568
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,880
What's that sound?

569
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,010
- There's... 
 - A monster.

570
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,720
Quick, hide.

571
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:10,150
I... I'll protect you, don't be scared.

572
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:19,000
Don't be scared! I'll protect you!

573
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,420
What's going on?

574
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,890
Lady with pliers, who are you?

575
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,630
I should be asking you who you are.

576
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,180
Petal, who is this silly girl?

577
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,300
- Petal? 
 - I'm Petal.

578
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,800
Don't call me that in front of strangers.

579
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,610
You know each other?

580
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,270
She's my sister.

581
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:42,000
Lin Zhiyue.

582
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,200
Sounds like a name his sister would have.

583
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,570
Zhiyue, are you usually this aggressive?

584
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:50,180
Takes one to know one.

585
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,670
Petal's your nickname?

586
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,390
Yes.

587
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:58,260
All right, pack up your things and go home.

588
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,770
It's weird to stare at people like that.

589
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,840
High schooler?

590
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,130
Yes.

591
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:19,870
I understand.

592
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:22,550
So you deleted your big sis from WeChat

593
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:25,280
to make room for this girl, huh?

594
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,560
   

595
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,890
Not going to admit it? Fine, I'll just ask her.

596
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,070
Don't be ridiculous.

597
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:47,050
Little sister.

598
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:49,830
Why are you here so late?

599
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:52,300
How did you and Petal meet?

600
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,820
- I... 
 - I'm her tutor.

601
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,410
I help her with schoolwork.

602
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,850
So you're agreeing to tutor me?

603
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,590
Yes. Go to Jinghai University.

604
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:25,040
