1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,960
Try to grow up

2
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,960
Flowers in the summer

3
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,960
Now tell the truth about life

4
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,200
It's not complicated to count flowers

5
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,120
The youth is swaying

6
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,080
We are getting stronger

7
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,880
My heart is still hot and boiling

8
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,720
Follow the rhythm and release it gently

9
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,640
The night sky is brightening, only the fireflies are in the way

10
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,440
I will fly bravely with you

11
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,160
My love is still hot and boiling

12
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,960
The bright and smiling eyes

13
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,640
Let us cross the barrier of time

14
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,280
Mr. Fighting

15
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,840
Episode 14

16
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
The cruise control is normal.

17
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,720
Everything is normal.

18
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,720
Ready to start.

19
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,720
Copy that.

20
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,720
Start the automatic driving.

21
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,720
Copy that.

22
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,720
Copy that.

23
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,720
Test the vehicle.

24
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,720
The cruise control is confirmed.

25
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,720
Automatic driving is normal.

26
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,720
Turning is normal.

27
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,720
Start.

28
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,720
Please report the speed.

29
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,720
The speed is 5 kilometers per hour.

30
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,720
The speed is 5 kilometers per hour.

31
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,720
The speed is 5 kilometers per hour.

32
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,720
The speed is 5 kilometers per hour.

33
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,720
The speed is 5 kilometers per hour.

34
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,720
The speed is 5 kilometers per hour.

35
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,720
Report the speed.

36
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,720
The speed is 10 kilometers per hour.

37
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,720
The speed is 10 kilometers per hour.

38
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,720
Unlock obstacles.

39
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,720
10 meters from the obstacle.

40
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,720
Start automatic driving.

41
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,720
Avoid the normal obstacle.

42
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,720
Please drive carefully.

43
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,720
Gao.

44
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,720
Gao.

45
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
Senior Li.

46
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,720
Stop the test immediately.

47
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,720
There's something wrong with the data.

48
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,720
What's going on?

49
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,720
It's impossible, Senior.

50
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,720
These are the data from online simulation.

51
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,720
There's nothing wrong with it.

52
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,720
The 1% of the online simulation's failure rate

53
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,720
doesn't guarantee the safety of the test.

54
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,720
Lin Jia Dong.

55
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,720
Accept Gao's intelligent driving mode immediately.

56
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,720
Let him manually operate the vehicle and leave the test area.

57
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,720
Master.

58
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,720
Experts are watching in the closed room.

59
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,720
Don't worry.

60
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
The probability of 1% is not that small.

61
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,720
Except that the loss is 100%.

62
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,720
I'm the one in charge.

63
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,720
I'll be in charge of everything.

64
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,720
Stop the test.

65
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
Stop the test.

66
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,720
Senior Gao.

67
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
Senior Lin informed us to stop the test.

68
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,720
Please turn off the unmanned driving mode.

69
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
Search and return manually.

70
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
Please report the speed.

71
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,720
10 kilometers per hour.

72
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,720
What's the speed of the speed of the test?

73
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
20 kilometers per hour.

74
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,720
10 kilometers per hour.

75
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,720
What's the speed of the speed of the test?

76
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,720
50 kilometers per hour.

77
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
It's getting faster.

78
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,720
The speed of the speed of the test is 10 kilometers per hour.

79
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,720
Report the speed of the test.

80
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,720
The speed of the test is 55 kilometers per hour.

81
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,720
The speed of the test is 60 kilometers per hour.

82
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,720
Senior Lin.

83
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,720
What should we do?

84
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
We can't stop.

85
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,720
We can't stop. I'm here too.

86
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,720
What's going on?

87
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,720
The speed of the test is 65 kilometers per hour.

88
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
We don't have time.

89
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,720
Let's change the test.

90
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,720
Gao, calm down.

91
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,720
I'm in the far end now.

92
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
I'll help you stop the car.

93
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
Stop the car.

94
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,720
Can you hear me?

95
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,720
The speed is 75.

96
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
Keep accelerating.

97
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,720
Keep accelerating.

98
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,720
Are you done?

99
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,720
Yes.

100
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
How's the speed?

101
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
It's getting faster.

102
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,720
Can you slow down?

103
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,720
It's still accelerating.

104
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
The speed of the test is not working.

105
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
What's the speed of the test?

106
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,720
It's 85.

107
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,720
You're on the line of the wind.

108
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
What should we do?

109
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,720
Why can't we slow down?

110
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,720
Let's slow down together.

111
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,720
Gao.

112
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,720
I'll go to the direction before the speed of the test.

113
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,720
No.

114
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,720
It's still accelerating.

115
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,720
What should we do?

116
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,720
We can't stop.

117
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,720
I was wrong.

118
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,720
I didn't listen to you.

119
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
I didn't check the code.

120
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
I'll listen to you next time.

121
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,720
Lin, slow down.

122
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,720
Control the direction.

123
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,720
It's going up.

124
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
It's going down.

125
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,720
It's useless.

126
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
The whole system is stopping the car.

127
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720
Hurry up.

128
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,720
Try again.

129
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
It's useless.

130
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
Keep it up, Gao Rui.

131
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,720
We have to find a way to reduce the damage to the lowest.

132
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
Lin, what should we do?

133
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
We'll be here today.

134
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
We'll slow down the collision of the collision-resistant band.

135
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
It's useless.

136
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
It's 95.

137
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,720
What should we do?

138
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,720
We'll slow down the collision-resistant band again.

139
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
Gao.

140
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,720
Gao Rui.

141
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
Senior Gao.

142
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
Please leave.

143
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
The traffic signal has disappeared.

144
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,720
Please review again.

145
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,720
Gao Rui.

146
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,720
The time of death is September 5, 2014.

147
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
20.20, 19 minutes and 32 seconds.

148
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,720
Is Gao Rui's family here?

149
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
They're back.

150
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
Gao Rui.

151
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
Gao Rui.

152
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,720
Gao Rui.

153
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
Gao Rui.

154
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
Gao Rui.

155
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
Gao Rui.

156
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
Gao Rui.

157
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,720
Gao Rui.

158
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,720
Gao Rui.

159
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,720
Gao Rui, it's too late.

160
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
He's in coma now and has been transferred to the ICU.

161
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
Go pay the hospital bill.

162
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,720
It seems that everything was a re-release in the past.

163
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,720
But fortunately, it's not exactly the same.

164
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,720
This time, thehur wied is 07

165
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
1 3

166
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,400
13

167
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,360
14

168
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,960
14

169
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,520
28

170
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,760
28

171
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,640
What

172
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,720
Please

173
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,600
This time, thehur transcended represents 1 4

174
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,560
Three.

175
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,560
Three, two.

176
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,080
Five, and the number?

177
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,160
Three, right?

178
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,480
Yes, but it could be a big prize.

179
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,280
There are two numbers.

180
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,280
The special number is

181
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,800
00411.

182
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,480
But the prize is good.

183
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,240
A lot of money.

184
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,440
You can have fun.

185
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,080
Money for life.

186
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,600
Why is it so strange

187
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,640
to buy lottery tickets recently?

188
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,240
Hello.

189
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,040
Where is Gu's house?

190
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,280
Over there.

191
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,200
Over there?

192
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,960
Yes.

193
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,960
Okay, thank you.

194
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Why is it so familiar?

195
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
Hello.

196
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,440
Hello.

197
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
Hello.

198
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,440
Hello.

199
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,440
Hello.

200
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
Hello.

201
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
Hello.

202
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,440
Hello.

203
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
Hello.

204
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,440
Hello.

205
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,640
Hello.

206
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,640
Hello.

207
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,200
Deathotypes are always valuable

208
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,360
and surprising.

209
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,860
As long as we live with them...

210
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,640
There will be a chance!

211
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,640
There will be a chance.

212
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,400
Who is that bad guy in that car?

213
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,860
It could be someone else.

214
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,900
Then

215
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,960
let it go.

216
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
I'm back.

217
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,640
I'm back.

218
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,640
Where are they?

219
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,640
I just gave them a debug plan.

220
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,640
They went to the factory to test it.

221
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,640
That's good.

222
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,640
I'm not convenient to move around.

223
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,640
There are too many people here.

224
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
I'm here to do something.

225
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,640
Let's go.

226
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
Lin,

227
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,640
what's in the bag?

228
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,640
I'm hungry.

229
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
It's work supplies.

230
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,640
Work supplies?

231
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
It's for class.

232
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
And it's for helping you.

233
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,640
You're going to give the class to Gu later?

234
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,640
But this...

235
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,640
Isn't it a fire extinguisher?

236
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,640
It's a fire extinguisher.

237
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,640
It's a fire extinguisher.

238
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,640
Which class are you going to use?

239
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,640
Don't touch it.

240
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
It's easy to explode.

241
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,640
Medical miracle.

242
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,640
You...

243
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,640
You just pretend that nothing happened.

244
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,640
Well,

245
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,640
you...

246
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,640
You go and give it to Gu.

247
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,640
I'll go and give it to him.

248
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,640
I'll go and give it to him.

249
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,640
Gu Xue Jiao will help you.

250
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,640
You're sitting comfortably.

251
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,640
Gu Xue Jiao gave you the idea, right?

252
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,640
You can go to class later.

253
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,640
Don't betray me.

254
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
Don't worry.

255
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,640
But you...

256
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,640
You should have helped me earlier.

257
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Come and help me move something.

258
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
I'll do it.

259
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,640
I'll do it.

260
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,640
I'll do it.

261
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,640
Look.

262
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,640
You should do it like this.

263
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,640
First, this...

264
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,640
Do you want to move it down a little bit?

265
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,640
When will the teacher arrive?

266
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,640
It's convenient for me to pick her up.

267
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,640
Who told you I invited her?

268
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,640
Why not?

269
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,640
She only cared about your grades a few days ago.

270
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,640
She even told me that you don't like to talk to her recently.

271
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
What's wrong with you two?

272
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
I didn't say that.

273
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
I just said that.

274
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
I just said that.

275
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
I just said that.

276
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,640
I just said that.

277
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,640
I didn't say that, Gu Mingze.

278
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
You really can't tell, right?

279
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,640
What is it?

280
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,640
Our family's short-sightedness

281
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,640
should be written in the family history.

282
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,640
You really didn't hear it?

283
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,640
No.

284
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,640
Xue Jiao, let me help you.

285
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,640
Let me do it.

286
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,640
Thank you for me, uncle.

287
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
I made him pay for it.

288
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
But is he going to have

289
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,640
some important event today?

290
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,640
I think he's dressed very...

291
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,640
He's a man.

292
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
He's handsome and handsome.

293
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,640
My dad said that his project is not going well.

294
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,640
He wants to keep up with the times.

295
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,640
He wants to adapt to modern society.

296
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,640
He wants to be a pig in the wind.

297
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,640
He's being influenced by

298
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,640
a master of engineering.

299
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,640
My dad is the boss of a project

300
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,640
with him before.

301
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,640
He's been in a few plays.

302
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,640
Do you know Tang Qingqing?

303
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,640
Do you want the autograph?

304
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,640
My dad can get it.

305
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,640
You're a pig, right?

306
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,640
Really, I want it.

307
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,640
I want it, too.

308
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,640
I want it, too.

309
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,640
Really, it's okay.

310
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
Tang Qingqing.

311
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
No.

312
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,640
Why?

313
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,640
Is it because of this?

314
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,640
Investing in his movie is definitely a disaster.

315
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,640
A disaster?

316
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,640
It's not a disaster, it's a love movie.

317
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,640
What's wrong?

318
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,640
You're his black fan.

319
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,640
I'll explain it to you later.

320
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,640
It's almost time.

321
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,640
I invited a VIP guest today.

322
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,640
He'll be here soon.

323
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,640
I'll go and pick him up.

324
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,640
I'm your VIP guest.

325
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,640
You.

326
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
What's wrong?

327
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
You're really taking yourself seriously.

328
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,640
Mr. Lawyer.

329
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,640
Mr. Lawyer.

330
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,640
He's my uncle.

331
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
Your gifts are so grand.

332
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,640
They're so popular.

333
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,640
They're so popular.

334
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
Yeah, Mr. Lawyer.

335
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,640
What if someone else orders the rooftop?

336
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,640
You.

337
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,640
You're always ready.

338
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,640
Mr. Lawyer, sit down.

339
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,640
Okay.

340
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
We have a lot of food today.

341
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
Let's go.

342
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,640
Lu Xuejiao, I'll give you another chance.

343
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,640
If you invite Shi Yun here,

344
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,640
I'll forgive you.

345
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
You're so good.

346
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
You can go and invite him.

347
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
He's not going to listen to you.

348
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,640
Don't blame me for being cruel.

349
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,640
Hello, Ms. Zhang.

350
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,640
Come here.

351
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
Take off your clothes.

352
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,640
Why are you still sitting here?

353
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,640
I told you to go up and give some charcoal.

354
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,640
Don't let Xuejiao's classmate wait for me.

355
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
Don't worry.

356
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,640
I just gave a wave of charcoal.

357
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,640
We have time.

358
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
Let's talk about me.

359
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
What?

360
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,640
You don't say I don't think about it.

361
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
You were snoring all night last night.

362
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,640
I didn't sleep well.

363
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,640
No, no, no.

364
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,640
It's not about snoring.

365
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,640
What else do you have?

366
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,640
Didn't I tell you yesterday?

367
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,640
About buying a car.

368
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,640
What car?

369
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,640
We're just getting better now.

370
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,640
I...

371
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,640
I think so.

372
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,640
You said I was so old.

373
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,640
I'm at home every day.

374
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,640
It's not appropriate.

375
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,640
Let's buy a car.

376
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,640
Our own car.

377
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,640
I go out and run every month.

378
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,640
I can make some money.

379
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,640
The most important thing is our own car.

380
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,640
No need to pay the company's share of the money.

381
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,640
How good is that?

382
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,640
I can take you to work.

383
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,640
No, no, no.

384
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,640
I don't like you.

385
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,640
You want to drive a black car.

386
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,640
You want to drive a black car.

387
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,640
Don't take me as an eye.

388
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,640
Your grandpa always thinks of things

389
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,640
so simple.

390
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,640
Where did the money come from?

391
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,640
Isn't our money in the stock market?

392
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,640
Isn't our money in the stock market?

393
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,640
Didn't you say that the money in the stock market

394
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,640
was rising?

395
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,640
Why do you think of driving?

396
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,640
Yes.

397
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,640
The stock market is growing.

398
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,640
I didn't buy a car.

399
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,640
It's not that.

400
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,640
Xue Jiao.

401
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,640
Xue Jiao saw me go to see the car two days ago.

402
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
She told me that there was a

403
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,640
special car registration.

404
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,640
She gave me a list.

405
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,640
No.

406
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,640
She asked you to go to the public book.

407
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
I drive a special car.

408
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,640
Why should I go to the public book?

409
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,640
I'll give you a list.

410
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,640
You can have a look.

411
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,640
What public book?

412
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,640
What kind of new character is that?

413
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
Okay, it's done.

414
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,640
Great.

415
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,640
Teacher, teach me how to make sausages.

416
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,640
Okay, no problem.

417
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,640
This is for Xue Jiao.

418
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,640
You have a good sense of taste.

419
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,640
Yi Tianyu.

420
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,640
The basketball league is in two days.

421
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,640
Let's talk about tactics.

422
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,640
Let's play with each other.

423
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,640
Come on, sit down.

424
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,640
Here, yuzu watermelon.

425
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
You don't invite me to the hospital.

426
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,640
I won't let you do as you wish.

427
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
Brother Li, let me help you.

428
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,640
Who is your favorite player?

429
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,640
Who is your favorite player?

430
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,640
Don't worry.

431
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
What's the benefit of Gao Rui's agreement?

432
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,640
What's the benefit?

433
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,640
He's fooled you.

434
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,640
I told him that

435
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,640
I would teach you after the college entrance examination.

436
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,640
Really? Great.

437
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,640
Look.

438
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,640
Brother Gao can't do this.

439
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,640
He can't hide it from the teacher.

440
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,640
He can't do this.

441
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
Thank you.

442
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,640
Come on, it's ready.

443
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,640
Thank you, Brother Li.

444
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,640
Thank you, Brother Li.

445
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
I want a ham sausage.

446
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,640
It looks delicious.

447
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,640
Thank you.

448
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,640
I want a ham sausage.

449
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,640
No, no, no.

450
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,640
Which one?

451
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,640
I don't want it.

452
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,640
It's so delicious.

453
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
Forget it.

454
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,640
I'll buy it for you.

455
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,640
Play the song.

456
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,640
When did you learn music?

457
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,640
Xu Jiao, what do you want to listen to?

458
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,640
I'll sing for you.

459
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
Then...

460
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,640
Guo Lun.

461
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,640
It's too hard to say.

462
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,640
I just learned it not long ago.

463
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,640
How about I sing my favorite song?

464
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,640
Xu Jiao, remember to applaud me.

465
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,640
Let's applaud.

466
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,640
Come on.

467
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,640
Let fate decide

468
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,640
Let us give up all courage

469
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,640
I'm willing to take this journey with you

470
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,640
If you also

471
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,640
Know the secrets of my eyes

472
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,640
I will find you in my heart

473
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:56,640
I tried to open my eyes

474
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
Because I'm sure to love

475
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,640
I'm waiting for you in the wind

476
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,640
The wind is blowing in the big wild

477
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,640
What's wrong?

478
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,640
Are you sick?

479
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,640
Are you sick?

480
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,640
I have a cold.

481
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,640
I'm so close to you

482
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,640
I know it must be you

483
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,640
Keep singing.

484
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,640
Be quiet.

485
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,640
A little.

486
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,640
Sorry. Sorry.

487
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,640
Help me take it.

488
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,640
What are you doing?

489
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,640
Press it. Press it.

490
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,640
It's wet.

491
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,640
I didn't mean to.

492
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,640
Are you okay?

493
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,640
Thank you.

494
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,640
I'll go get some water.

495
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
Congratulations. Congratulations.

496
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,640
It's not going to stop.

497
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,640
Congratulations. Congratulations.

498
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,640
Do you want to see the rainbow?

499
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,640
Move away. Move away.

500
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,640
Come on.

501
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,640
Rainbow.

502
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,640
Rainbow.

503
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,640
Come back. Come back.

504
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,640
Rainbow.

505
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,640
Sunshine.

506
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,640
Rainbow.

507
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,640
Running.

508
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,640
Flying.

509
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,640
Friendship.

510
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,640
Family.

511
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,640
Bloom.

512
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,640
Growth.

513
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,640
My youth.

514
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,640
My rebirth youth.

515
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,640
Thank you.

516
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,640
Accompany me in the sunshine.

517
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,640
Let's show off like a rainbow.

518
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,640
Now we are going to tell the truth.

519
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,640
It's not complicated to tell the truth.

520
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,640
The youth is swaying.

521
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,640
We are getting stronger.

522
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,640
My heart is still hot and boiling.

523
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,640
Follow the rhythm and release it gently.

524
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,640
The night sky is lighting up the fire.

525
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,640
This time,

526
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,640
it finally reverses the high school I went to last time.

527
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,640
Their company also replaced the love story.

528
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,640
It became the most unforgettable memory of this time.

529
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,640
Let us cross the barrier of time.

530
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,640
We can see the beautiful scenery.

531
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,640
The beautiful scenery.

532
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,640
No.

533
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,640
Why I am the one who goes to fire?

534
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,640
Gu Xuejiao.

535
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,640
You can't fail twice in the same hole.

536
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,640
Let you be lost.

537
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,640
As the saying goes,

538
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,640
Draw the top as strength.

539
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,560
And knowledge is strength.

540
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,640
Learn to calm down.

541
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,800
You don't learn to be proud.

542
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,240
You're so advanced.

543
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,880
Do you still give people a way out?

544
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,520
Really.

545
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,600
You're a hard worker.

546
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,640
There's no way.

547
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,640
There's really a gift.

548
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,640
Didn't you say it's a hundred sets of five-three?

549
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,640
Don't you want to know

550
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,640
how to be a top student from the top three?

551
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,640
Talent, hard work and luck.

552
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,640
I've seen all of these.

553
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,640
You have them all.

554
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,640
So I can only give you my experience

555
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,640
as a small gift.

556
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,640
I'll try to help you.

557
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,640
I'll help my wife find a way in.

558
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,640
What are you doing?

559
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,640
We're getting in friendship to learn.

560
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,640
Be careful.

561
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,640
I'll find one for My daughter.

562
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,640
OK.

563
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,920
Don't worry.

564
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,640
She's not like you.

565
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,080
It's an excellent team.

566
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,360
I can definitely win this round.

567
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,320
I'll beat you.

568
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,640
Gao, flowers are blooming in the morning.

569
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,000
Master, you've given me a big one this time.

570
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,200
I'm unlucky today.

571
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,400
Hello, Gui Bin.

572
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,600
Welcome.

573
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,800
Please take your personal belongings

574
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,160
and have a good rest.

575
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,320
Son, the flowers just now

576
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,440
just started blooming.

577
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,960
It's all thanks to you.

578
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,040
Those uncles were so happy.

579
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,440
If I go there to buy cement sand,

580
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,360
he'll be embarrassed if he doesn't make a discount.

581
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Do we need that few tons of sand?

582
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,160
A few tons of sand?

583
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,000
I ordered a dozen of cars from them.

584
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,640
This is the pattern of the old Yi family.

585
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,720
What to do, what to do, what to win.

586
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,800
By the way, is your flower ring

587
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,760
enough?

588
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,160
Come on.

589
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,840
Give me some more.

590
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:37,920
Thank you, dad.

591
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,000
Here's a signature.

592
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,840
Take it to Gui Bin.

593
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,320
What's wrong?

594
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,200
You're awake again?

595
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,760
No.

596
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,880
It's just that Tang Jingjing...

597
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,840
Tang Jingjing's movie.

598
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,680
This is the leading actor of the film industry, right?

599
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,720
There are so many information about the film industry.

600
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,520
Aren't you afraid that your dad will be a dead man?

601
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,120
Let me analyze it for you.

602
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,960
Look, the leading actor of this company.

603
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,360
This, this, this, yellow.

604
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,040
This, this, this, it's done.

605
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,800
What's the common point?

606
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:26,580
Their bosses are all

607
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,620
the same.

608
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,220
Why are you so superstitious?

609
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:29,860
It's not me.

610
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,580
It's the conclusion that Xue Jiao gave you.

611
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,020
That's quite scientific.

612
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,500
You turn your face faster than a tree.

613
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,380
Gui Bin's words are worth referring to.

614
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,020
How about we stop talking about Tang Jingjing?

615
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,500
Son, let me tell you.

616
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,580
For girls,

617
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,740
it's important to obey the rules.

618
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,020
But a man with a strong opinion is more attractive.

619
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,180
Don't worry about the investment.

620
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,980
I'll sign the contract next week.

621
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,060
This is the confidence of the old Yijie.

622
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,460
The company must stop with me now.

623
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,180
The company must stop with me now.

624
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,060
I know you've come so far.

625
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,620
I'll let you know if you 2013.

626
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,060
I'm coming.

627
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,860
Sorry to keep you waiting.

628
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,020
I'm coming.

629
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,220
Be careful.

630
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,220
Thank you.

631
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,860
Hello, Mr. Cheng.

632
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,500
I'm your online driver, Mr. Gu.

633
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,260
I'm very happy to serve you.

634
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,100
Mr. Gu,

635
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,220
Mr. Gu,

636
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,940
don't get lost

637
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,980
when you're on a plane.

638
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,500
I can't.

639
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,300
We're all

640
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,580
monitoring the back of the platform.

641
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,860
We're all following the navigation.

642
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,500
Don't worry.

643
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,020
It's my first time

644
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,420
to ride a online driver.

645
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,300
My son taught me how to ride.

646
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,500
Technology is so advanced now.

647
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,100
Yes.

648
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,140
My daughter told me

649
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,660
you can be a online driver.

650
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,180
I didn't know that.

651
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:46,820
I think

652
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,820
it's more convenient

653
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,140
to ride a car

654
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,020
and walk on it

655
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:51,980
when you're busy.

656
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,820
I don't know how to use

657
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,540
the app.

658
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,020
Times are different.

659
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:57,980
It's good.

660
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,260
At least you have insurance, right?

661
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,380
It's better than the black car you drove.

662
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,060
You're right.

663
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,660
I'm driving this car now.

664
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,340
It's not a traffic jam.

665
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,620
I'm not afraid of it.

666
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,180
Something happened in front of you.

667
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,900
What's wrong with this car?

668
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,220
Let's go.

669
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:14,940
Sir,

670
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,540
I'm changing the plane.

671
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,580
We can just overtake the car.

672
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,740
What's wrong?

673
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,300
My daughter always says

674
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,380
the safety of passengers

675
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,820
is the most important.

676
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,540
Your daughter is a good girl.

677
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,580
I'm sorry.

678
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,220
When we arrive at the airport,

679
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,340
you can run in front of us.

680
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,460
I'll get your luggage.

681
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,100
I'll follow you.

682
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,980
Did you put your luggage in the car?

683
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,020
My luggage?

684
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,380
No, I didn't.

685
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,060
You didn't?

686
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,340
I didn't.

687
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,340
You didn't?

688
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,580
Turn around and go back.

689
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,580
Hurry up.

690
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,580
You'll lose it.

691
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,380
This car is driving.

692
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,180
Dear passengers,

693
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,140
I'm sorry to inform you

694
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,060
that the flight you're taking

695
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,100
to Shenzhen, CA171, has been cancelled.

696
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,620
I haven't seen Huang Li yet.

697
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,580
Everything is going wrong.

698
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,100
Mr. Yi,

699
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,420
the master has replied.

700
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,660
You're right.

701
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,980
The flight is cancelled.

702
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,500
It's a disaster.

703
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,900
1314.

704
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,420
817.

705
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,420
817.

706
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,740
1314.

707
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,020
1314, 817.

708
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,500
817, 1314.

709
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,260
Yes.

710
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,620
Yes.

711
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,620
Don't go.

712
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,180
You'll die.

713
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,420
I'm sorry.

714
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,500
You'll die.

715
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,620
It's destiny.

716
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,420
It's destiny.

717
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,220
My son doesn't want me to

718
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,300
go to the play Tang Jingjing.

719
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,740
I can't go.

720
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,780
Okay, master.

721
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,580
Don't worry.

722
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,060
I'm not in a hurry.

723
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:05,300
Okay.

724
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,100
Drive slowly.

725
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,620
Okay.

726
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,740
Your luggage...

727
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,500
Hurry up.

728
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,460
Don't lose it.

729
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,060
Hurry up.

730
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:13,980
Okay.

731
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,300
Turn off the S-pillar.

732
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,980
It's a bit expensive.

733
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,300
It's okay. I'll pay you.

734
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,340
We have money.

735
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,020
Brother Lin,

736
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,900
you have to take a day off again.

737
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,660
Are you waiting for your junior?

738
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,140
But,

739
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,060
since I finished the work last time,

740
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,540
she has taken a week off.

741
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,060
What's wrong?

742
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:40,860
Are you sick?

743
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,620
This one, this one, this one.

744
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,740
It's done.

745
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,140
What's the connection?

746
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,300
The boss of the play,

747
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,220
Huang Le, is a tiger.

748
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,300
What did your father say?

749
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,820
Tiger?

750
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,220
Yes.

751
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,700
So, from the scientific

752
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,820
or the perspective of suspense,

753
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,180
your father can't touch this play.

754
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,940
What's wrong, brother?

755
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,460
This is the test of the summer.

756
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,940
The environment parameter of the 10 times of the super-pillar

757
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,580
is normal for the sound.

758
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,340
Why are you nervous?

759
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,380
What's wrong with you today?

760
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,860
You're not worried?

761
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,660
But,

762
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,900
you just deliberately

763
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,460
wanted to save me.

764
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,140
I'm still very touched.

765
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,860
I have to send a good circle of friends

766
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,860
to praise you.

767
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,300
There is no time to be quiet.

768
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,140
In danger,

769
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,020
it's all brothers who put me on the list.

770
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,180
You're not bad.

771
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,420
The text is too rough.

772
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,700
Now, the text of the circle of friends

773
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,820
has to be strong.

774
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,660
Otherwise,

775
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,780
no one likes it.

776
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,020
The high school life now is quite rich.

777
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,500
You even like to play.

778
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
All right.

779
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,820
The break time is up.

780
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,340
Continue with the stress test.

781
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,700
He should also take some stress tests.

782
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,060
He's quite weird.

783
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,540
One, two, three, eight.

784
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:27,260
One, two, three, eight.

785
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,460
These kids...

786
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:33,540
One, two, three, eight.

787
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,860
Our school's eight students

788
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,700
are very lucky.

789
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,900
This time, we have to take out

790
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,060
the prestige of the main factory

791
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,540
and get on their radar.

792
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,540
If you put all the shots

793
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,980
and learn something,

794
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,580
you will definitely be the first.

795
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,220
I have to do two sets of questions in my time.

796
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,060
The combination of prison and review efficiency

797
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,340
can be doubled.

798
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,260
You obviously learned it from me.

799
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,380
Shiyuan, are you here to see me?

800
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,860
Yes, you have to do your best today.

801
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,660
I will.

802
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,380
They are waiting for you.

803
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,100
You go and prepare.

804
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:01,660
Follow me.

805
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,260
Come on, you have to win.

806
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:03,980
OK, bye.

807
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,500
Why are you on the field of the class of the first grade?

808
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,980
Go, go, go.

809
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,020
Both sides, enter the field.

810
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,260
Both sides, attention.

811
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,300
Go, go, go.

812
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,900
Go, go, go.

813
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,780
Go, go, go.

814
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,740
Go, go, go.

815
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,260
Go, go, go.

816
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:36,860
Go for it.

817
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,340
Go for it.

818
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,780
Come on, come on.

819
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,080
foot pitch, foot pitch,

820
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,920
demand for support.

821
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,200
foot pitch, foot pitch,

822
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,760
demand for support.

823
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,440
foot pitch, foot pitch,

824
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,040
demand for support.

825
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,400
foot pitch, foot pitch,

826
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,800
demand for support.

827
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,560
foot pitch, foot pitch,

828
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,160
demand for support.

829
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,060
Climb the wall, climb up

830
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:12,060
Don't be afraid of the so-called school

831
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,860
You are also the choice of others

832
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,660
Don't stop, don't hesitate

833
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,060
The world is open

834
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,260
I didn't expect she was pretty good

835
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:26,060
Now call the sound of the bell

836
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,860
Seven, seven, nine

837
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,260
Seven, eight, nine

838
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,060
Come on

839
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,660
Seven, eight, nine

840
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,460
Seven, seven

841
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,860
I think you are right

842
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,060
I should take a breath of justice

843
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,860
Come on, come on

844
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,460
Seven, seven, eight, nine

845
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,460
What are you looking at?

846
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,060
Why are you here?

847
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,460
You were on the court just now

848
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,260
Seven, seven, eight

849
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,660
It's been a long time since I played basketball

850
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,860
in the school of Chen Mingyi

851
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,060
I'm sorry

852
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,060
I have to lie down

853
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,060
and cheer for them

854
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,060
Seven, seven, eight, nine

855
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,460
Seven, eight, nine

856
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,460
Seven, eight, nine

857
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,460
Seven, eight, nine

858
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,860
Seven, eight, nine

859
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,060
What are you doing?

860
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,660
You are being punished

861
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,460
You are there

862
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,060
Come on

863
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,060
Seven, seven, eight, nine

864
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:43,060
Seven, seven, eight, nine

865
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:46,060
Seven, seven, eight, nine

866
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:49,060
Seven, seven, eight, nine

867
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,060
Seven, seven, eight, nine

868
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,060
Yang Hong

869
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,060
What are you doing?

870
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,060
You are playing baseball

871
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,060
Yang Hong

872
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,060
Are you okay?

873
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,060
What are you doing?

874
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,060
You are playing baseball

875
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,060
He is playing with Jiang Wu De

876
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,060
What are you doing?

877
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,060
Stop

878
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,060
Are you okay?

879
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,060
Are you okay?

880
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,060
Are you okay?

881
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,060
Are you okay?

882
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,060
Sit down, let me see

883
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,060
Sit down

884
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,060
Why is our T-bone still not on the court?

885
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,060
Our T-bone is also injured

886
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,060
We don't have a T-bone

887
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,060
What should we do?

888
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,060
I don't know

889
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,060
Shi Yue, do you have a tissue?

890
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,060
Yes, in my bag

891
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,060
Give it to you

892
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,060
Let me see

893
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,060
Yi Tianyue, you go

894
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,060
You usually skip classes every day

895
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,060
Research tactics

896
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,060
Now is the time for you to show

897
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,060
I'm not going

898
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,060
I can't go

899
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,060
Coach, coach

900
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,060
I have a question

901
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,060
Why is it not learning again?

902
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,060
He likes to play baseball the most

903
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,060
Show him some colors

904
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,060
Seven, eight, nine, nine

905
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,060
Yi Tianyue

906
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,060
You are too shy to be a spectator

907
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,060
Go to the court

908
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,060
Coach, I can't play

909
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,060
I'm too shy, my hands are all red

910
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,060
You are a man

911
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,060
Why are you so silent?

912
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,060
You don't have a chance now

913
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,060
You can only be a

914
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,060
game-hunting man

915
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,060
Me?

916
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,060
Game-hunting man?

917
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,060
Are you kidding?

918
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,060
Go

919
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,060
Change clothes

920
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,060
Go to the court

921
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,060
Hurry up, Yu Zi

922
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,060
Everyone's life

923
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,060
has a chance

924
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,060
There are only a few opportunities

925
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,060
Go

926
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,060
I'm all dressed up

927
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,060
Remember the tactics I taught you

928
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,060
OK, come on

929
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,060
Are you ready?

930
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,060
Yes

931
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,060
Three, two, one

932
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,060
Come on

933
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,060
Come on, come on, come on

934
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,060
Come on, come on, come on

935
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,060
Ball

936
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,060
Go

937
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,060
Go

938
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,060
Go

939
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,060
Go

940
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,060
Ball

941
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,060
Ball

942
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,060
Ball

943
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,060
Ball

944
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,060
Ball

945
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,060
Ball

946
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,060
Ball

947
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,060
Ball

948
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,060
Ball

949
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,060
Ball

950
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,060
Ball

951
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,060
Without me, you will be more brilliant

952
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,060
It's a team

953
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,060
300,000 yuan

954
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,060
You want to buy paper?

955
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,060
I want paper

956
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,060
I love you

957
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,060
You are welcome

958
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,060
The queue in the toilet is too long

959
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,060
The next half has not started yet

960
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,060
Director

961
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,060
Let's go

962
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,060
Is it a bullfrog?

963
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,060
It's a little fat

964
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,060
What's this?

965
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,060
I picked it up on the roadside

966
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,060
I don't know who it is

967
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,060
It's not good to leave it there

968
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,060
I'll put it away for him

969
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,060
Let me find a good place for him

970
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,060
Come on, come on, come on

971
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,060
Really down

972
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,060
This is not good

973
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,060
Shiyu, you are too kind

974
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,060
So he was bullied by Gu Xuejiao since he was a child

975
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,060
He is still showing off in front of Yi Tianyu

976
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,060
Who?

977
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,060
Gu Xuejiao, aren't you

978
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,060
Director

979
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,060
Deputy Director

980
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,060
Sorry, sorry

981
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,060
Senior

982
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,060
Senior

983
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,060
Senior

984
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,060
Are you here to watch the game?

985
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,060
Or are you looking for Xuejiao?

986
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:55,060
She just took Yan and went over there

987
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,060
Yan

988
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,060
Where did you go?

989
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,060
Brother Lu, why are you here?

990
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,060
I'm Yan

991
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,060
You think I smoke?

992
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,060
Open the bag and see

993
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,060
Look again

994
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,060
She is not mine

995
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,060
She

996
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,060
Think about who it will be

997
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,060
Whose is this?

998
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,060
The color of the nail polish

999
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,060
Chen Xiao

1000
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,060
Explain to me

1001
00:41:48,060 --> 00:42:05,200
You are still students in the

1002
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,060
Laugh if you want to laugh

1003
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,060
Go

1004
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,060
You said the deputy director

1005
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:20,060
Will it be the ultimate big shot for Zhou Shiyun?

1006
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,060
Save the parents

1007
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,060
If that is the case

1008
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,060
Zhou Shiyun's family is going to be a mess

1009
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,060
You reminded me

1010
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,060
I

1011
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,060
Where is Xiao Lin?

1012
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,060
Hello, Deputy Director

1013
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,060
Xuejiao wants to ask for a favor from Shiyun

1014
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,060
She said such a small thing

1015
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,060
Never compare to her parents

1016
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,060
Thanks to your reminder this time

1017
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,060
Can it be a small thing to frame a classmate?

1018
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,060
I tell you

1019
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,060
This time must be seriously handled

1020
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,060
Must notify the parents

1021
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,060
Ok, I can only listen to you

1022
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,060
You

1023
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:16,060
You are good at green tea

1024
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,060
What green tea?

1025
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,060
I don't understand

1026
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,060
Yes yes yes

1027
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,060
Although I was framed

1028
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,060
But smoking is harmful to health

1029
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,060
Middle school students can't smoke

1030
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,060
What Li did

1031
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:32,060
It's all because of our care

1032
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,060
By the way

1033
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,060
Why is Li Linan today?

1034
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,060
I'm here to catch people

1035
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:42,060
Catch people

1036
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,060

There is a sound that is very close

I know that it must be you

1087
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:57,560
I try to open my arms

1088
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:01,560
Because love is very certain

1089

I'm listening to the wind waiting for you

The wind is blowing, it doesn't matter
