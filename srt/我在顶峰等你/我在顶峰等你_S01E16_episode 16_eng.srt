00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,260
   

20
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,140
The company's private room is upstairs.

21
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,470
If you drink too much, I can book the room for you.

22
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,520
You can stay here.

23
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,360
Isn't that better than your dorm at school?

24
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,400
It's way better!

25
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:56,400
 SOS. Your boyfriend is trapped in a den of cougars now. 

26
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,450
Hold this for me.

27
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,180
You... Where are you going?

28
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,331
To fight a cougar!

29
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:02,772
- Cheers to you. 
 - Come on...

30
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:05,370
-Drink... 
 - Drink up...

31
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,890
Here, Director Yang. Let's have another one.

32
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,150
Alright. Here, Ms. Zheng.

33
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,420
- Okay.
- Cheers. Come on.

34
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,520
Lin, these people are too much.

35
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,910
- I can't do it anymore.
- You can.

36
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,480
Come on. Eat...

37
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,130
Here.

38
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,550
Lin,

39
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,240
seeing you today, I'm super happy.

40
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,807
I already skipped your round for you.

41
00:02:34,807 --> 00:02:38,307
If you're grateful, finish this one for me.

42
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,240
Thank you.

43
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,080
I'll toast you with tea instead.

44
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,430
Tea instead of wine?

45
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,800
Here.

46
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,480
If you drink this,

47
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,820
you're my baby brother from now on.

48
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,200
Look. You're her baby brother now.

49
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,590
It'd be rude to keep refusing it, right?

50
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,150
Come on, have one. You can't say no now.

51
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,890
- Drink up... Drink...
- Have one!

52
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,050
Drink it...

53
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,640
Hello, Ms. Zheng.
I'm Mr. Lin's assistant, Xue Jiao.

54
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,240
Sorry, I'm late.

55
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,270
I'll drink one to make up.

56
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,830
Didn't expect Lin even has an assistant.

57
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,870
Girl, you're late.

58
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,040
Can you do the circle game?

59
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,110
Yeah. Of course.

60
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,320
Come on, Hu Fei, fill her cup.

61
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,390
That's Gao Rui's job.

62
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,800
Here. This one's for you.

63
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,760
Thanks, Ms. Zheng.

64
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,760
Here, very nice to meet you!

65
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,200
- How should I address you?
- Just call me Wang.

66
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,390
Mr. Wang, hello.

67
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,920
Come on, cheers, everyone.

68
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,270
It's nice meeting you all.

69
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,270
Come on, together.

70
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,550
Ms. Zheng, I have to toast you again.

71
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,480
You're truly my role model.

72
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,550
We totally clicked right away, Ms. Zheng.

73
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,960
If we finish this, we're sworn siblings.

74
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,270
- Let's go...
- Seriously.

75
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,490
- Ms. Zheng.
- Let's go.

76
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,920
- Let's get hammered!
- I've paid the bill.

77
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,800
Why'd you stop drinking? No one's leaving.

78
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,580
- Don't stop.
- The bill's paid.

79
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,080
Don't you stop!

80
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,210
Let's get wasted...

81
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,590
Your role model?

82
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,930
You're pretty good at the drinking games.

83
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,810
Of course, she's my role model.

84
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,150
Leaning right on this cutie's shoulder.

85
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,040
I wanna lean, too.

86
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,200
You're drunk. Sit still.

87
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,000
I already took the first hit for you.

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,460
How's Mr. Lin gonna repay me?

89
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,170
Repay you?

90
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,000
Guess you're not that drunk.

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,910
Are you such a good drinker?

92
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,120
Of course.

93
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,540
Back then, I...

94
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,030
What?

95
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,000
Got a wine glass
at your fortune-telling grab, huh?

96
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,590
That's right.

97
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:24,830
My dad used to dip chopsticks
in booze and gave me a taste.

98
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,680
So growing up, I never feared a drunk.

99
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,560
I could drink with the best of them.

100
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,500
Yeah, right.

101
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:38,930
Who was the one I carried home
from karaoke last time?

102
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,760
That was different.

103
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,680
Different how?

104
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,470
At karaoke,

105
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,290
I wasn't drunk on booze.

106
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:53,560
I was drunk on Mr. Lin's handsome face.

107
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,900
And ever since that night,

108
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,590
I carry hangover pills everywhere.

109
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,270
Gotta be prepared.

110
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:06,170
- In case...
- In case you lose control again.

111
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,160
Dizzy.

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,160
Let me fix that for you.

113
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,660
No, let me fix it for you.

114
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,310
Didn't you just visit here last week?

115
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,200
Why again?

116
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,400
You don't get it.

117
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,080
I came back to recharge my energy.

118
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,890
You have no idea how stressful Series A is.

119
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,680
Why do you reek of alcohol?

120
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,600
Had a work dinner last night.

121
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,770
Still dizzy now.

122
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,910
You still gotta network
even working in your fancy lab?

123
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,570
And today you're networking again?

124
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,640
I saw you ordered a cake,
making a pretty big deal of it.

125
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,400
This isn't networking today.

126
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,870
- Today's...
- I got it!

127
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,110
A job interview, right?

128
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,910
Xue Jiao, you're always one step ahead.

129
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,680
Starting interviews in junior year?

130
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,147
To bribe the interviewer,
you gotta make a killer first impression.

131
00:08:25,147 --> 00:08:26,248
Wait.

132
00:08:26,248 --> 00:08:28,514
Let me, the founder, bake the prettiest cake

133
00:08:28,514 --> 00:08:33,360
for my biggest idea investor.

134
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,090
Hang on.

135
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,156
Look at this cake.

136
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:55,007
The cream, the colors.

137
00:08:55,007 --> 00:08:58,700
I had it custom-made to celebrate your contract-signing.

138
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,451
What a pretty cake.

139
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:04,400
Is it for me or for you?

140
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,020
Both.

141
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,565
Actually, Tian Tian insisted on giving it to me.

142
00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:11,096
But since you didn't look too excited
about signing the contract,

143
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:14,280
I thought I'd give it to you to cheer you up.

144
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,380
Thank you. It's just not
the final victory for me yet.

145
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,940
But that's fine.

146
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,180
We can celebrate early.

147
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,410
What's wrong? You look weighed down.

148
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,160
Don't worry.

149
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,330
It'll work out.

150
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,970
Thank you.

151
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,020
Surprise!

152
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,720
Xue Jiao?

153
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,730
How did you...

154
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,400
I...

155
00:10:05,177 --> 00:10:07,667
Xue Jiao, you're just in time.

156
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,456
You even brought a cake.

157
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:14,480
Let's celebrate the signing together tonight.

158
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,070
Great!

159
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,560
Drink more water.

160
00:10:43,905 --> 00:10:45,610
Alright, I'm leaving.

161
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:50,090
Petal, take her back to campus safe and sound.

162
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,880
Don't worry.

163
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,970
I'll go with you.

164
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,600
Actually, I might get another ride.

165
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,215
I'm not busy these days.

166
00:10:59,215 --> 00:11:00,416
I wanna go home for a bit.

167
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:03,960
Lin, you go back to school with Gao.

168
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,290
I just remembered I need to stop by the office.

169
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,298
It's on the way to your school.

170
00:11:09,298 --> 00:11:13,516
How about I give you a ride?

171
00:11:13,516 --> 00:11:15,246
Me?

172
00:11:16,346 --> 00:11:18,090
- Is that okay?
- Why wouldn't it be?

173
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,450
Get in.

174
00:11:23,297 --> 00:11:25,287
She's all yours.

175
00:11:39,303 --> 00:11:40,994
You didn't notice?

176
00:11:40,994 --> 00:11:42,746
Notice what?

177
00:11:42,746 --> 00:11:44,826
Those two...

178
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,220
If I hadn't pretended to be drunk,

179
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,380
they'd have found another way to send you off.

180
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,330
I might as well help them out.

181
00:11:55,122 --> 00:11:57,973
With my usual tolerance, you three would be down,

182
00:11:57,973 --> 00:12:01,903
and I'd still be sober enough to get you home safe.

183
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,480
Love between two young people...

184
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,760
So tangled yet so sweet.

185
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,231
Such secret ops are exhausting.

186
00:12:29,231 --> 00:12:31,670
Almost got caught by your sister
and Gao Rui today.

187
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,854
What are you scared of?

188
00:12:32,854 --> 00:12:36,640
You can talk your way out of anything.

189
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,970
Easy for you to say.

190
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,070
You swore no one was home.

191
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,830
I didn't know Gao Rui's "something to do"

192
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,550
was giving me a surprise?

193
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,900
That wasn't a surprise.

194
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,300
It was a scare.

195
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,060
My heart almost jumped out.

196
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,915
I thought it was racing because of me.

197
00:12:50,915 --> 00:12:53,905
That's not wrong, though.

198
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,180
Just a shame that the vibe got killed.

199
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,120
So how you gonna make it up to me?

200
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:16,160
Young people these days... Seriously.

201
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,900
If it were my Xue Jiao, I'd break her legs.

202
00:13:26,386 --> 00:13:27,820
Youth. So good.

203
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,690
So good.

204
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:34,380
Why are all our dates a total mess?

205
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,960
Still feel messy now?

206
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,660
What's that smell?

207
00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:47,069
What smell?

208
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,150
Whipped cream.

209
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,968
Here, have some water.

210
00:14:16,968 --> 00:14:18,373
Thanks, Uncle.

211
00:14:18,373 --> 00:14:20,089
Don't mention it.

212
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:21,080
Drink up.

213
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,120
Got more in the car.

214
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,400
Man... Look at me.

215
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,921
I used to work nonstop every day.

216
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:36,712
Now I sit at home bored outta my mind.

217
00:14:36,712 --> 00:14:38,000
Heh.

218
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,480
So I just drive around for fun.

219
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,950
Chat with passengers from everywhere.

220
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,090
Makes me happy.

221
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:47,570
But I did not expect to run into you today.

222
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,670
What a coincidence.

223
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,860
Such a coincidence.

224
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,640
Xue Jiao talks about you all the time. Says you're amazing.

225
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,670
Today I was just thinking I should stay in front of my house.

226
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:05,040
At this hour, this late,
nobody's gonna call a ride.

227
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,630
And then you showed up.

228
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,970
The house? The new one?

229
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:11,480
Yeah... You haven't been there, right?

230
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,400
Guess Xue Jiao didn't tell you.

231
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,040
Come and visit when you have time.

232
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,880
Been busy lately?

233
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,850
Yeah... Just worked till this hour.

234
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,590
Really?

235
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,800
- Gentle...
- Let's start, sir.

236
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,101
Wait, I'll get some water.

237
00:15:32,101 --> 00:15:33,430
Get up!

238
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,260
That's your sister's masseur.

239
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,400
Mom.

240
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,532
Seriously?

241
00:15:37,532 --> 00:15:39,413
Gu Xue Jiao isn't here yet.

242
00:15:39,413 --> 00:15:40,724
She'll be here soon.

243
00:15:40,724 --> 00:15:44,255
She's at home now,
having a Zoom meeting with the lab.

244
00:15:44,255 --> 00:15:46,160
Let her relax when she gets here.

245
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,000
She deserves it.

246
00:15:48,911 --> 00:15:50,912
Besides, you're a designer.

247
00:15:50,912 --> 00:15:52,922
You don't need foot massages.

248
00:15:52,922 --> 00:15:55,193
Hello, give him a massage ball.

249
00:15:55,193 --> 00:15:57,733
Let him roll it in his hand.

250
00:15:59,182 --> 00:16:02,544
There are four of us
and only three massage therapists.

251
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,261
So no one thought of me.

252
00:16:04,261 --> 00:16:05,392
Look at you...

253
00:16:05,392 --> 00:16:08,680
Son, don't even bring up such problems.

254
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,550
It's pointless.

255
00:16:12,794 --> 00:16:14,345
You have no idea.

256
00:16:14,345 --> 00:16:17,090
Guess who I just picked up.

257
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,083
- Celebrity?
- An internet fugitive?

258
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,302
- Don't wanna tell us?
- Whatever.

259
00:16:21,302 --> 00:16:22,720
Wait, I'll tell you.

260
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,465
Seriously, I didn't expect it.

261
00:16:24,465 --> 00:16:27,590
I actually picked up Lin.

262
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:30,540
Several years ago,
he tutored Xue Jiao for a while.

263
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,790
I picked him up near our place.

264
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:39,901
I knew I have seen that guy somewhere.

265
00:16:39,901 --> 00:16:44,781
Lin shows up near our house
more often than you think.

266
00:16:45,643 --> 00:16:48,968
- Are they...
- It's exactly what you think.

267
00:16:48,968 --> 00:16:50,684
- When's Xue Jiao coming? 
 - What...

268
00:16:50,684 --> 00:16:53,774
I'm gonna ask her about that later.

269
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,160
Phone.

270
00:16:59,716 --> 00:17:01,876
She says she's not coming.

271
00:17:02,584 --> 00:17:04,185
Why's she so willful?

272
00:17:04,185 --> 00:17:06,265
We had plans.

273
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,890
Lin's so excellent.

274
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:12,498
How does he even put up with her?

275
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:15,001
Shame. Such a shame.

276
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,852
This kid...

277
00:17:16,852 --> 00:17:18,332
Xue Jiao's amazing, too.

278
00:17:18,332 --> 00:17:19,687
Here.

279
00:17:19,687 --> 00:17:21,787
Shut your mouth!

280
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,240
Lin, the next deal will be done later.

281
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,566
You wanna go celebrate tonight?

282
00:17:27,566 --> 00:17:29,102
Call your sister, too.

283
00:17:29,102 --> 00:17:31,340
It's probably not that easy.

284
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,625
It's a done deal.

285
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,705
What's there to worry about?

286
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:39,900
So that's the situation.

287
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,210
C1 didn't pass our tech department's inspection.

288
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,460
I'm really sorry about that.

289
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,140
Can we see the acceptance report?

290
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:51,171
I guess Ms. Zheng will say it's internal.

291
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:53,161
She doesn't have the authority.

292
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:00,100
Ms. Zheng, C1 is a sophisticated technology

293
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,480
that's been approved many times by our lab.

294
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,760
We already gave full solutions
to the technical issues

295
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,140
you raised last time.

296
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:13,100
Using acceptance failure
as an excuse is ridiculous.

297
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,000
Excuse?

298
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,290
Lin...

299
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,637
Ms. Zheng. How about this?

300
00:18:18,637 --> 00:18:21,310
Could you arrange a meeting
with the technical engineers?

301
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,540
We can discuss this in person.

302
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,466
Even if there's disagreement,
it's probably a misunderstanding.

303
00:18:26,466 --> 00:18:29,371
- We'll work on it.
- I've done my best to fight for you.

304
00:18:29,371 --> 00:18:31,132
But this is the result.

305
00:18:31,132 --> 00:18:33,103
I have to consider the group's interests.

306
00:18:33,103 --> 00:18:34,964
With a decision like that?

307
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:36,235
Yeah, Ms. Zheng.

308
00:18:36,235 --> 00:18:39,255
You can't give up on such a promising project.

309
00:18:40,271 --> 00:18:42,451
I never said I'd give up.

310
00:18:43,993 --> 00:18:46,684
C1 is indeed a promising project.

311
00:18:46,684 --> 00:18:48,617
No doubt about that.

312
00:18:48,617 --> 00:18:51,728
But the problem is,
you breached the contract first.

313
00:18:51,728 --> 00:18:55,580
You didn't pass the technical acceptance
as agreed.

314
00:18:55,580 --> 00:19:00,565
So, B&amp;C Motors will take over
all of your team's patents and technology.

315
00:19:00,565 --> 00:19:04,406
We'll continue the project
with our internal R&amp;D team.

316
00:19:04,406 --> 00:19:06,630
What did you say?

317
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,495
I think I've made it clear.

318
00:19:09,495 --> 00:19:11,350
You can't just claim it
and make the decision for us.

319
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,840
You can't take away the patents
and tech that we worked hard on.

320
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,350
You can keep them if you want.

321
00:19:28,162 --> 00:19:29,480
It's the notice of contract violation.

322
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,230
See if you can accept the amount.

323
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,350
Let's go. The discussion's over.

324
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,860
Wait.

325
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,620
How can we just leave?

326
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,900
Who hasn't been beaten down
by life when they were young?

327
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,290
Get used to it.

328
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,020
Young man.

329
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,460
Let's go, Gao Rui.

330
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,110
They just wanna get something for nothing.

331
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,340
B&amp;C Motors was aiming
for our tech patents from the start.

332
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,894
My boyfriend's at the International Law School.

333
00:20:03,894 --> 00:20:06,140
I'll ask him if there's any way to deal with her.

334
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,040
Where's Lin?

335
00:20:10,897 --> 00:20:12,620
You can't find Lin?

336
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,488
None of us can reach him.

337
00:20:14,488 --> 00:20:16,000
Especially Lin Jia Dong.

338
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,180
He has called over ten times in a row.

339
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,760
And now his precious senior
has turned off the phone.

340
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,910
Where's my phone?

341
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,968
 

342
00:20:25,968 --> 00:20:27,079
 

343
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,240
 

344
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,800
 

345
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:44,050
A man hit hard in his career is the most fragile.

346
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:47,690
Everyone's trying to comfort him now.

347
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,900
No way.

348
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,880
He must be working on a solution.

349
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,460
You know him well.

350
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,800
I...

351
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,241
I've been in the lab for years before you.

352
00:20:58,241 --> 00:21:00,121
You know.

353
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,620
So what can he do?

354
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,130
He...

355
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,200
He...

356
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,420
Honestly, I don't know.

357
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,672
 

358
00:21:21,672 --> 00:21:23,540
 

359
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,179
Every time I see coffee foam poured in,

360
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:33,779
I think of Olympic diving.

361
00:21:34,442 --> 00:21:36,150
Angle, precision, and strength.

362
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,780
They are all important.

363
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:42,662
Only then can a simple sport become an art.

364
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,441
Impressive.

365
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:50,180
So what's your plan now?

366
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,010
How do we artistically fight back against B&amp;C?

367
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:55,270
I don't have a plan, I just will take one step at a time.

368
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:58,730
Yeah. So, what's your next step?

369
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:02,220
Isn't going back to the bookstore
part of your plan?

370
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,020
It's just because they're short-handed today.

371
00:22:09,626 --> 00:22:12,626
Do you really have no plan?

372
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,790
People in the lab are checking the faults

373
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,640
and reaching out to law students for you.

374
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,790
And you're here acting cool.

375
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:25,900
Isn't that a bit inappropriate?

376
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,640
One latte.

377
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,300
Okay.

378
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,320
I'm busy, too.

379
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,600
C1 is your years of hard work.

380
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,340
Failing this acceptance test could waste all your effort.

381
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,970
And worst of all, the morale is low.

382
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:42,290
The whole team could fall apart.

383
00:22:43,146 --> 00:22:46,380
We were all stressed out during R&amp;D.

384
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,430
Now's a good time to rest up, including you.

385
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,640
I don't want to rest.

386
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,350
This is not the time to kick back.

387
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,900
You...

388
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,250
Get back to the lab, okay?

389
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,960
I'll cover here.

390
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,860
Back to the lab. Give me your apron.

391
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,780
Too many customers.

392
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,620
Can't leave.

393
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,560
Hi, Shu Lan?

394
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,780
 

395
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,190
Xue Jiao.

396
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,410
This is Lawyer Zhang.
Also an alumnus of Capital University.

397
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:39,750
My boyfriend says he's got a ton of experience
with cases like this.

398
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,540
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Zhang.
- Nice to meet you, too.

399
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,830
I already filled him in on the basics.

400
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,710
You talk about the rest.

401
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,240
Mr. Zhang, have a seat.

402
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,154
So, based on the current situation,

403
00:23:55,154 --> 00:23:58,060
do we stand a good chance?

404
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:02,480
Sounds like B&amp;C's bet-on agreement
has some nasty clauses.

405
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,750
If we push from that angle, we might have a shot.

406
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,270
Great.

407
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,650
But their legal team is pretty tough.

408
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,410
It could get messy.

409
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,580
And going to court won't be cheap.

410
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,780
I understand.

411
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,300
May I ask, how do you charge?

412
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,391
For corporate commercial disputes,

413
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:23,620
we usually charge
a percentage of the claim amount.

414
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,170
Since my junior referred you,

415
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,960
I'll cut you a little slack.

416
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,750
But probably not under 5%.

417
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,210
5%...

418
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,850
That's fine. You can think it over.

419
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,530
Wait a sec.

420
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,800
 Tian Tian, your idea investor needs cash now. 

421
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,898
No problem. We're taking this to court.

422
00:24:51,898 --> 00:24:57,010
 Last time, Ms. Zheng from B&amp;C took C1 from me. 

423
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:01,140
 This time, I'm fighting back. 

424
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,680
Sorry, Mr. Zhao.

425
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,110
Thank you for waiting.

426
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,590
No worries.

427
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,730
I just invested in a new mobile game.

428
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,620
It's pretty fun.

429
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,000
Level 88 in one swing.

430
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,310
If you're my bro, come slash me.

431
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,400
Kinda entertaining.

432
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,270
Is it?

433
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,210
Interesting.

434
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:26,200
Lin, I heard your C1 project with B&amp;C hasn't been going too smoothly.

435
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,445
Mr. Zhao, do you remember

436
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,246
B&amp;C's very first locally-developed model

437
00:25:32,246 --> 00:25:37,550
when they made a high-profile entry
into the Chinese market 20 years ago?

438
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,350
It's been too long.

439
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,910
Can't really recall. Sorry.

440
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,340
I do.

441
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,060
I remember it because it was developed

442
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,490
by one of our Capital University alumni

443
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:56,000
leading an on-campus R&amp;D team.

444
00:25:57,944 --> 00:25:59,590
You checked my background?

445
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,900
I only just found out.

446
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:08,680
Turns out you're a cautionary tale
for my cooperation with B&amp;C.

447
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,285
Senior Zhao.

448
00:26:10,285 --> 00:26:14,806
Lin, I told you, if it's not about making money,

449
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,087
I'm not interested.

450
00:26:16,087 --> 00:26:18,728
So let's call it a day.

451
00:26:18,728 --> 00:26:20,198
Mr. Zhao,

452
00:26:21,071 --> 00:26:27,635
that model you built
got its funding cut before delivery.

453
00:26:27,635 --> 00:26:29,480
Do you still have dreams?

454
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:34,400
At this age, isn't it kinda corny to have dreams?

455
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,400
But you keep going to automotive
industry investment conferences.

456
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,765
It's pretty obvious.

457
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,955
Otherwise, we wouldn't have met.

458
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:48,710
I was the first one to show interest in your C1 project.

459
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,615
But you?

460
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,510
You turned your back on my Junlian Company

461
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,150
and shook hands with B&amp;C.

462
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:03,311
It's hard to explain my beef with B&amp;C for now.

463
00:27:03,311 --> 00:27:08,450
But C1's failing delivery
was part of my plan all along.

464
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,315
What are you doing?

465
00:27:17,315 --> 00:27:19,476
Who told you to move our lab's equipment?

466
00:27:19,476 --> 00:27:21,466
Hey, I'm talking to you!

467
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,790
Did you hear me?

468
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:27,910
Dude, what are you talking about?

469
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,820
Since when are they yours?

470
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,680
They belong to B&amp;C Motors now.

471
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,110
We can sponsor you.

472
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,270
And we can take it back, too. Right?

473
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,380
Even if B&amp;C Motors sponsored it,

474
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,270
we're just fulfilling the terms of our contract.

475
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,070
Can you at least honor the contract?

476
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,900
You can't just take it back whenever you want.

477
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,310
That contract is off now.

478
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:49,000
Ms. Zheng only recognizes
the notice of contract violation.

479
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,160
Okay. Enough talk.

480
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,350
Sign it.

481
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,860
Hurry.

482
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,620
They...

483
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,180
they basically moved everything.

484
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,760
 

485
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,730
What's your plan against B&amp;C?

486
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:32,890
I want them gone from China for good.

487
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,350
You?

488
00:28:40,121 --> 00:28:41,162
What a surprise.

489
00:28:41,162 --> 00:28:44,830
College kids today are crazier than we used to be.

490
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:50,660
Lin, working with B&amp;C Motors
isn't some kid's play.

491
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,401
This is against investor ethics,

492
00:28:53,401 --> 00:28:55,780
but I gotta remind you.

493
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:01,770
No tech team working with B&amp;C Motors
ever ends well.

494
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:10,340
So I'm here today
to ask for your original contract

495
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,720
and the termination agreement back then.

496
00:29:17,817 --> 00:29:19,747
 On my way home. 

497
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:24,820
 Stop making coffee and just gonna stay in, huh? 

498
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:29,180
 Lin Zhi Hua, wait till I come over and get you. 

499
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:33,220
 

500
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,160
Do you know how long we waited for you today?

501
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,700
Even the lab gear got taken by B&amp;C Motors.

502
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,670
Sit down first. Don't be mad.

503
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,650
I know.

504
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:11,210
I'm just trying to chill a bit.

505
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,780
Mr. Zhao told me about this game.

506
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,690
It's fun. Very addictive. Look.

507
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,980
Are you seriously playing games
at a time like this?

508
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,310
I asked you to meet with the lawyer.

509
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,990
Why didn't you come?

510
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,600
I was gaming.

511
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,400
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

512
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,780
Come with me to see the lawyer.

513
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,170
I already paid the fees.

514
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:37,170
If you don't, you're gonna get it.

515
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,790
Get what?

516
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,210
Stop joking around.

517
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:48,090
First things first.

518
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,347
I know this is tough, but running away won't help.

519
00:30:54,347 --> 00:30:55,540
Don't worry.

520
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,001
No matter how hard it is,

521
00:30:57,001 --> 00:30:59,882
I'll be with you through it all.

522
00:30:59,882 --> 00:31:01,422
Okay.

523
00:31:02,254 --> 00:31:04,094
If you say so.

524
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,210
When?

525
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,570
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

526
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,900
Gao Rui?

527
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,720
What a coincidence. You're off work?

528
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,380
I'm just taking a walk nearby.

529
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,180
Happened to walk by.

530
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,910
Yeah.

531
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,490
You walked here all the way
from Capital University?

532
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,490
That's a long walk.

533
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,550
Right. Are you available later?

534
00:31:56,550 --> 00:32:00,110
Let me buy you dinner.

535
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,800
Do you want one more bottle?

536
00:32:25,921 --> 00:32:27,132
Okay.

537
00:32:27,132 --> 00:32:30,062
Are you still not going to tell me?

538
00:32:32,152 --> 00:32:34,340
You were here to see me, right?

539
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,930
Just say what you want to say.

540
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:45,250
I... I do have something to tell you.

541
00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:52,559
I...

542
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,870
I...

543
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,270
- Excuse me! 
 - Yes?

544
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,860
- Another bottle, please. 
 - Coming right up.

545
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,830
I want you to be my investor.

546
00:33:20,755 --> 00:33:22,080
Here's the thing.

547
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,400
Old Lin and I stopped working with B&amp;C Motors.

548
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,790
But now, we can't find new investors.

549
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:31,199
We've been struggling these last few days.

550
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:34,960
I know it might be better if Old Lin told you this.

551
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,830
But you know how he is.

552
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:39,160
He's too embarrassed to ask you.

553
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,540
But I don't mind.

554
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,100
I've got thick skin.

555
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:47,160
So, with that being said, if you're not okay with it,

556
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,490
just tell me straight.

557
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,500
I can handle it.

558
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:55,834
You just started the business

559
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:58,064
and already encountered such a situation?

560
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,750
Big companies like B&amp;C Motors

561
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:04,980
will never let startups like you get ahead.

562
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,880
Since you came to me, I'll be straight with you.

563
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,260
Okay.

564
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:15,190
If they steal your core patents,

565
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,180
your company will be worthless.

566
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,570
Even if I try to raise funds then,

567
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,010
the chances won't be good.

568
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:27,190
No investor wants to invest in a company that has lost value.

569
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,040
I understand.

570
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,650
Unless...

571
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,400
Unless the big boss insists on investing.

572
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:50,470
But even if that happens, who knows if Lin Zhihua will accept it.

573
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,720
He won't dare say no.

574
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,840
Don't worry.

575
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,146
If you can get your boss onboard,

576
00:34:56,146 --> 00:34:59,240
I'll make sure to drag Old Lin over to thank you.

577
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,610
Hold on to that thought.

578
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:04,765
Get him into Linqi Capital first.

579
00:35:04,765 --> 00:35:06,825
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

580
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,340
Here's a toast to you.

581
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,370
I'll drink first.

582
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,212
- Take it slow. 
 - I'm fine.

583
00:35:21,212 --> 00:35:24,080
The wine tonight tastes good.

584
00:35:39,944 --> 00:35:41,994
Where am I?

585
00:36:19,408 --> 00:36:21,668
What does she take me for?

586
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,690
I'm never letting C1 go to Linqi.

587
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,220
Dad, if B&amp;C takes away C1's core tech,

588
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,110
the company's just a shell.

589
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,450
You can't be blind to that, Dad.

590
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:40,570
Your mom and I want to do this.

591
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:41,710
We are family.

592
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:45,570
We should stick together and support each other, right?

593
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:50,310
Look, your mom and I got both career and love going strong.

594
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,230
Dad, that show doesn't work for me.

595
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:02,930
You haven't divorced yet because you're tied up in too many ways.

596
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,300
I don't want to be tied up.

597
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:09,020
I definitely don't want to keep pretending after taking your money.

598
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:17,610
Also, drink less, Dad.

599
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,360
Get a checkup.

600
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,650
Or your liver will be in trouble soon.

601
00:37:24,002 --> 00:37:26,750
Okay. Got it, son.

602
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,898
What did he say?

603
00:37:51,898 --> 00:37:54,070
I can't stand you.

604
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,220
What?

605
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,340
I just talked to him.

606
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,080
He has his own idea.

607
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,420
Let's drop it. Just let him.

608
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,920
So you're just going to watch him do it on his own?

609
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:11,959
I don't want to argue with you today.

610
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:16,050
What's that attitude?

611
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,390
That's your own son!

612
00:38:19,737 --> 00:38:21,717
You're just a coward.

613
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,510
Am I wrong?

614
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,230
You're just afraid.

615
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:29,480
Afraid you'll lose money and can't shut up the board.

616
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,360
It was your son who shut me up first.

617
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,010
Qi Rui, he's a grown-up.

618
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:37,710
He's figured us out long ago.

619
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,610
It's not that he won't accept investment from Linqi.

620
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:43,810
He just won't watch us keep acting in front of him.

621
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,260
We've been acting all our lives.

622
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,550
Do we have to drag him in, too?

623
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,610
Don't you feel tired?

624
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:59,520
 

625
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,590
Xuejiao, if Lin Zhihua can't make it today,

626
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,360
we can reschedule.

627
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,260
My legal consultations are charged by the hour.

628
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,260
You are wasting my time.

629
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,660
Sorry, Lawyer Zhang, please wait a bit longer.

630
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,690
I'll go out to check.

631
00:39:47,297 --> 00:39:48,329
What took you so long?

632
00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:50,256
Don't you know what time we scheduled?

633
00:39:50,256 --> 00:39:52,376
Something held me up.

634
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,740
I need to give you a heads-up.

635
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,130
B&amp;C is a huge company.

636
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,984
They must have a very professional legal team.

637
00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:03,740
If they dared to screw me over,

638
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,670
they must've got their legal reasons.

639
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,410
So when we go in there, stay calm.

640
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:08,840
Keep a cool head.

641
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,780
But you can't just give up.

642
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,840
I'm not giving up.

643
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,450
Actually, yesterday, I found out

644
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:20,340
about B&amp;C's dirty tricks through my contacts.

645
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:25,090
And I just got some evidence of their unethical business.

646
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:29,560
I'll keep collecting more from other teams they've screwed over.

647
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:37,920
So, you have your own plan?

648
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,300
How long have you known me?

649
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,160
I never give up.

650
00:40:44,754 --> 00:40:47,380
B&amp;C has been acting cocky all these years.

651
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:51,300
They've pissed off way more than just my small startup.

652
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,570
So my plan is to unite all their enemies

653
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:57,220
and work together to take B&amp;C down.

654
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:01,510
It's called "To subdue the enemy without fighting is best."

655
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:04,410
I got inspired by that game yesterday.

656
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,110
How did you come up with a plan while gaming?

657
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:10,220
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

658
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,820
I wasn't 100% sure at first.

659
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:15,970
Plus, B&amp;C sent someone to watch me.

660
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:17,260
If I didn't act the part,

661
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,360
they'd never let their guard down.

662
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:23,632
Then the lawyer...

663
00:41:23,632 --> 00:41:25,570
We can still hire him.

664
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,180
You've been through all that trouble.

665
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,860
We might as well make good use of it.

666
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,500
You two...

667
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,490
Don't you have a watch?

668
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:39,130
Do you know what time it is?

669
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,410
My bad.

670
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:43,980
So sorry. Let's get started.

671
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,300
That pose doesn't look slack enough.

672
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,790
Let me show you how it's done.

673
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,730
Legs like this.

674
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,310
Yes.

675
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,480
That's the spirit.

676
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,370
That's how you slack off right.

677
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:20,180
You know a lot about slack guys, huh?

678
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,190
I've never driven the car,

679
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,041
but I've been in the back seat.

680
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,255
I kinda know the drill.

681
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:28,000
Yeah?

682
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,460
Doesn't your brother act like this a lot?

683
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,880
Yes. My brother.

684
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,530
He likes doing this.

685
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,880
Acting like he doesn't care about anything.

686
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,580
But really, he's just running away from reality.

687
00:42:54,020 --> 00:43:05,900

00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,311
 ♫ In a dark room ♫ 

690
00:43:17,311 --> 00:43:21,350
 ♫ How carefully we light a single lamp ♫ 

691
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:26,960
 ♫ So there won't be an echoing sound ♫ 

692
00:43:27,692 --> 00:43:31,015
 ♫ Flipping through memories ♫ 

693
00:43:31,015 --> 00:43:35,020
 ♫ Every line a trail where our steps entwine ♫ 

694
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:41,277
 ♫ That's us drawing closer to each other ♫ 

695
00:43:41,277 --> 00:43:44,760
 ♫ Let it be fate ♫ 

696
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,820
 ♫ Let us give all our courage ♫ 

697
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:54,160
 ♫ To journey through time with you ♫ 

698
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,540
 ♫ If you can ♫ 

699
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:02,600
 ♫ Read the secret in my gaze ♫ 

700
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:09,260
 ♫ You'll see you've always been in my heart ♫ 

701
00:44:12,259 --> 00:44:19,137
 ♫ I try to open up my arms ♫ 

702
00:44:19,137 --> 00:44:23,120
 ♫ Because I'm certain of this love ♫ 

703
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,945
 ♫ Summit of our youth ♫ 

704
00:44:25,945 --> 00:44:32,800
 ♫ Even if the wind roars, it's okay ♫ 

705
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,880
 ♫ There's a figure approaching ♫ 

706
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:43,700
 ♫ I know it must be you ♫ 

707
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:56,755
 ♫ I try to open up my arms ♫ 

708
00:44:56,755 --> 00:45:00,880
 ♫ Because I'm certain of this love ♫ 

709
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,600
 ♫ Summit of our youth ♫ 

710
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:10,401
 ♫ Even if the wind roars, it's okay ♫ 

711
00:45:10,401 --> 00:45:14,604
 ♫ There's a figure approaching ♫ 

712
00:45:14,604 --> 00:45:21,820
 ♫ I know it must be you ♫
