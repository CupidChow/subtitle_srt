1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,960
I will grow up with all my strength

2
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,200
The flowers in the spring and summer

3
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,200
Now tell the truth about life

4
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,400
It's not complicated to tell the truth

5
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,200
The youth is swaying

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,400
We are getting stronger

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,000
My heart is still hot and boiling

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,800
Follow the rhythm and release it gently

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,600
The night sky is brightening, guiding me to go forward

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,400
I will fly bravely with you

11
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,200
My love is still hot and boiling

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,000
The eyes that shine with smile

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,600
Let us cross the barrier of time

14
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:35,800
The Long Ballad

15
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,800
Episode 16

16
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,200
Why didn't you answer?

17
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,800
The press conference was held in the sky

18
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,200
I was scolded when I answered

19
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,800
You had a press conference in the sky?

20
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,000
It's okay

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,200
It's the same with online publicity and interviews

22
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't like to be busy

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,800
Yes

24
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,600
Actually, I cried not because I had a fight with my mom

25
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,800
I was happy

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
For so many years, I can finally breathe happily

27
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,800
I don't need to look at others' eyes

28
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,000
I can be myself freely

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,200
So I am happy

30
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,000
So I am happy

31
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,400
Okay, I will be with you

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,600
Go back and drink with me

33
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,800
But...

34
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,000
From now on, I won't let anyone change me

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,400
So I hope you will be like me

36
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,600
Okay

37
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,400
I heard that the vice president of BNC is his aunt

38
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,600
It must be a mole

39
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,400
After the game, we re-tried

40
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
We found the code of inspection in a row

41
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,800
The code of inspection was embedded in the sealed code

42
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,800
You are responsible for the code of inspection before the game

43
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,200
You can say it yourself

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,200
Honesty is the most important

45
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,200
Apologize

46
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Apologize first

47
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,600
I am sorry

48
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
I am sorry

49
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
I am sorry

50
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Sleep

51
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,600
What's your last lie?

52
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,200
No

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,800
Listen to me

54
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,400
Lin Jia Dong

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,200
You have to tell us

56
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,800
I did nothing

57
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
Please believe me

58
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,400
How can we believe you?

59
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,600
Lin Jia Dong

60
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
You are a mole

61
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,800
I did nothing

62
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,200
You are a mole

63
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,800
Why don't you believe me?

64
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,600
You...

65
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,400
Sleep

66
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,800
Angry, love to say something

67
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,400
This is just for your boyfriend

68
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,600
You can't take advantage of Lin Jia Dong

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,600
I just believe that I saw it with my own eyes

70
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,800
Find the owner

71
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,000
Get the instruction of the car from the server

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,800
I will go

73
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,800
Okay

74
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
The tension after failure

75
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,200
Slow down

76
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,000
Be careful

77
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,200
The joy after success

78
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,800
I believe everyone understands

79
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,400
And

80
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Such a cunning hidden code

81
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
You can say

82
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
It's written by Lin Jia Dong

83
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,000
I believe it

84
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,200
Lin Jia Dong

85
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Indeed

86
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Thank you

87
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,200
Actually that day

88
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,200
My aunt did let me go to modify the code

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,400
There is a set of parameters

90
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
Before the final

91
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Enter the computer of Jingdao

92
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,000
This is just a set of hidden codes

93
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
It won't affect your own public security program

94
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,600
Just

95
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,200
Modify the communication agreement between the cars

96
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,200
When the result of the competition comes out

97
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,400
I will let people first

98
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,000
Consumer of the car data of the race car

99
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
After the competition

100
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,400
They still let me participate in the competition

101
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,600
They won the competition

102
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,800
What's the point of you

103
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
Where is aunt

104
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,000
Is a passerby

105
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,400
Think about it

106
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,200
If a car never breaks down

107
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,200
Then Xiaoli's new car

108
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,600
Who should I sell it to

109
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
You only let them lose the competition

110
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,800
They will feel

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You are the more reliable person

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
My heart is still with everyone

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,600
I still pressed the withdrawal button

114
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
Probably like this

115
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
He didn't lie

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That code really didn't work

117
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,800
But this matter

118
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,000
More proof of the importance of honesty

119
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,600
Between people

120
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,000
The most important thing is trust

121
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,000
Trust is willing to be honest

122
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
Sometimes

123
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,200
We are afraid of the truth

124
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,400
Will make others unhappy

125
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,400
Just of course

126
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,000
Self-righteous

127
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,400
Hid some thoughts

128
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,000
Things that make others unhappy

129
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,000
But who knows this kind of hiding

130
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,400
Is it unscrupulous

131
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
We have no right to judge each other

132
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,600
I don't know if the other party

133
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,000
Do you want to know

134
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,800
Although it's too late to say this now

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,800
Not late

136
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,800
I'm really wrong

137
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,000
I apologize to everyone

138
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,600
I will correct it in the future

139
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,200
Since you know the most important thing about teammates

140
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Is trust

141
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,800
Then from the beginning

142
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,600
You shouldn't say any good lies

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
If there is a problem

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,400
Can't be honest

145
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,200
How to face it together

146
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,200
How to find a solution together

147
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,600
How to work together

148
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,400
Yes yes yes

149
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,600
Who wants to work together with you

150
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,400
Don't talk about you

151
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,600
Talk to you a little bit

152
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,400
Snow rubber

153
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,000
Since it's all said and done

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,200
Let's just let the other person do it

155
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,000
What to say

156
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,800
I'm just saying something

157
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,720
But that's his head

158
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,000
I saw it

159
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,560
Not yet

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,720
Chen Mu Ken, I'll help you.

161
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,320
No need.

162
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,720
Why are you here again?

163
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,840
I finally returned to China.

164
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,240
I'm here to visit my old classmate.

165
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,360
Why didn't I answer your call?

166
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,000
I've seen your old classmate before.

167
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,640
It's rare for you to return to China.

168
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,760
Spend more time with your dad.

169
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,960
I'll go now.

170
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,440
Chen Mu Ken.

171
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,480
I'm here to see you.

172
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,760
I'm here to see you.

173
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,160
I'm here to see you.

174
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,160
I'm here to see you.

175
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,240
I'm here to see you.

176
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,240
I'm here to see you.

177
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,240
I'm here to see you.

178
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,800
Xue Jiao, I...

179
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,800
Hello, dad.

180
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,480
You said you rarely returned to China.

181
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,280
I asked you to learn accounting in the shop.

182
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,600
Where did you go again?

183
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,480
Your dad just changed his job.

184
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,280
It's the first place.

185
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,600
Can you be more careful?

186
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll teach you later.

187
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,680
No, no, no.

188
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,120
I'm here to see Jingda.

189
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,080
Why did you forget your phone?

190
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,280
I'll get it in the lab.

191
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,280
Jingda has Mount Jin.

192
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,680
There's Mount Yin.

193
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,520
I'm here to see you.

194
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,600
You didn't go to see Xiao Gu again, right?

195
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,040
Son.

196
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,600
I have to say that

197
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,640
I really hope that Xiao Gu

198
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,720
can improve our next generation of IQ.

199
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,440
But Xiao Gu's boyfriend

200
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,800
has been out for years.

201
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,960
Our family

202
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,320
doesn't have the tradition of doing one, two, three.

203
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,040
Dad, what do you mean one, two, three?

204
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,280
I already have a girlfriend.

205
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,480
Stinky boy.

206
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,800
You're still busy with your dad

207
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,960
when you have such a good thing.

208
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,920
You're also Jingda's.

209
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,720
Where is it?

210
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,680
When will you bring it back

211
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,800
and show it to me?

212
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,320
Let's talk about it again.

213
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,280
I won't talk to you now.

214
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,240
I'm hanging up. Bye.

215
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,000
You finally got

216
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,160
a completely different life path.

217
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,480
That's great.

218
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,400
Why are you back again, Xue Jing?

219
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,240
I went back to the lab to get a phone.

220
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,320
That's great.

221
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,120
I went abroad and came back.

222
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,880
I've already had a girlfriend.

223
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:08,920
No, no, no.

224
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,800
Listen to me.

225
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,640
She's jealous.

226
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,400
If you have time, make an order.

227
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,200
Let's get together.

228
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,000
I have an appointment with Tian Tian for dinner today.

229
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,200
I'm going in first.

230
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,680
Today is a good day.

231
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,320
Today is the day.

232
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,000
I'll wait for you.

233
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,680
Xue Qiao, I'll wait for you.

234
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,720
Didn't you go abroad

235
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,080
to be a professional basketball player?

236
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,080
Why do you still look like

237
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,240
an economist?

238
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,920
I want to become a football player.

239
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,440
My dad, he said

240
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,120
there's no future in football.

241
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
So he paid me

242
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,920
a commercial baseball sketchbook.

243
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,400
It's difficult to get along with each other.

244
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,480
Your uncle is right.

245
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,600
But this book...

246
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,640
No problem.

247
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,560
I know what you mean.

248
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,480
Just tell me.

249
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,080
Well,

250
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,240
I mean

251
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,320
it works well

252
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,360
as an economic science textbook.

253
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,160
If you want to make some progress in investment,

254
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,760
it may not be enough.

255
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,480
What should I do?

256
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,120
How about

257
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,360
I teach you?

258
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,680
The knowledge of theory is important.

259
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,560
But the most important thing in investment

260
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,160
is to have a foresight.

261
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,560
What do you mean by having a foresight?

262
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,240
To put it simply,

263
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,720
you should know

264
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,840
which companies and industries

265
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,880
will appear in the current trend

266
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,040
and dare to invest.

267
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,400
How can I know

268
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,800
which companies are like you?

269
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,240
I'm going to teach you step by step.

270
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,360
You're so breaking the rules.

271
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,560
You just look at me.

272
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,360
What did you teach me

273
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,480
in the old classmate's class?

274
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,320
It's not breaking the rules.

275
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,400
That's right.

276
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,000
The second spring of helping the former brother

277
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,320
is a merit.

278
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,040
What's the future?

279
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,480
The future is an era

280
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,680
when open AI

281
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,720
uses digital currency

282
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,120
to help you shop for PIN.

283
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,440
What OCI?

284
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,520
What AI?

285
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,960
I can only order you here.

286
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,240
It's good that the old classmate helped you here.

287
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,880
Next, you can ask yourself.

288
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,480
Wait for me.

289
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,640
Let's talk about this.

290
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,320
Perfect.

291
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,680
Brother Lin Shi, that you are making a move now.

292
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:47,960
Bye-bye.

293
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,920
Nichtzsche,

294
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,440
Ergebnis.

295
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,040
I am leaving now.

296
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,240
Bye, see you next time.

297
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,240
Bye-bye.

298
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,240
See you next time.

299
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,400
This...

300
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,240
Feifei, I'mING a little hungry.

301
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,960
I'm building up an appetite, too.

302
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,760
Really?

303
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,160
Shu An, you're EATING food too.

304
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,240
I'm not.

305
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,440
You're EATING!

306
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:32,880
Let's go.

307
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Xue Qiao, we're leaving.

308
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,320
Bye.

309
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:35,920
Bye.

310
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,440
Bye, Brother Xue.

311
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,200
Bye, Brother Xue.

312
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,320
Xue Qiao.

313
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,800
I can fight with you.

314
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,000
You can hit me or scold me.

315
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,680
But don't ignore me.

316
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,800
If you let those two kids go back,

317
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,200
don't go ahead,

318
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,000
you'll be in trouble.

319
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,960
OSE is other's friend.

320
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,120
Now everything could be solved.

321
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,560
This can't happen.

322
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,360
оз ambitions can't know.

323
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,840
Let's go.

324
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,680
Cut it out.

325
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,160
Cut out?

326
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,080
I'm sorry.

327
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,480
What are you looking for?

328
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,400
The key to the door.

329
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,000
The lab is a secret base.

330
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,640
The door is locked.

331
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,120
I've contacted the security department.

332
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,200
Just wait for them.

333
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,040
I'll be right there.

334
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,440
How long?

335
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,800
I can't wait.

336
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,720
You don't want to be with me?

337
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,960
I'm here.

338
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,000
Okay.

339
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,600
You two can wait for me there.

340
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,480
It will be over soon.

341
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,320
I'm sorry.

342
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,480
I'm not fighting against BNC

343
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,840
to win.

344
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,840
I'm fighting for my loss.

345
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,920
I wanted them to buy my C1

346
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,040
at a high price from the beginning.

347
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,320
Then I used the funds to develop C2.

348
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,320
After three years,

349
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,880
both sides will withdraw from the competition.

350
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,520
Then I can make a precise

351
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,920
downfall to BNC.

352
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,120
Thanks to the champion of the National Championship,

353
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,360
C1 has lost at a high price.

354
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,040
Are you done?

355
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,360
That's not what I want to hear.

356
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,320
I shouldn't have run away.

357
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,760
Xue Jia, I never admitted it.

358
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,640
I hid it from you.

359
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,960
I was running away.

360
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,320
As for C1,

361
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,680
I should have told you

362
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,160
and let you know my plan.

363
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,080
About us,

364
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,200
the next day you got drunk,

365
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,120
I should have told you and told you the truth.

366
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,920
Including the bad thing

367
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,920
that Ling Zhi Hua did to you last time,

368
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,920
it was also me.

369
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,600
I just thought

370
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,800
as long as I didn't think about it,

371
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,600
I would never have to face it.

372
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,840
I was wrong.

373
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,680
I'm sorry.

374
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:22,960
I'm sorry.

375
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,840
Actually, I'm also sorry.

376
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,600
Rather than saying

377
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,600
I hate you from the past,

378
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,520
I'd rather say I hate myself from the past.

379
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,160
But when I see you,

380
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,200
I'll think of it.

381
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,960
No matter how hard I try

382
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,200
to erase the memory of the past,

383
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,280
it can never be erased.

384
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,920
No need to erase it.

385
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,600
Why should it be erased?

386
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,840
You this time,

387
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,800
you last time,

388
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,440
you are not the person

389
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,840
I'm missing now.

390
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,440
If that's what you really think,

391
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,280
why did you keep it from me for so long?

392
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,440
Xu Xiao.

393
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,720
Who...

394
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,360
Who are you?

395
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,120
Xu Xiao.

396
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,980
Xu Xiao.

397
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,720
Xu Xiao,

398
00:18:52,120 --> 00:19:14,560
muffled Wiu Wiu But on

399
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,320
Let's go.

400
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,560
What's wrong?

401
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,200
Hurry up.

402
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,640
Do you still remember this?

403
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,960
This is...

404
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,800
The code you wrote

405
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,400
when you were transferring your work.

406
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,360
There's a very famous bug

407
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,800
in the program you wrote.

408
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,360
Impossible.

409
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,320
I've checked it many times.

410
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,440
It's not that easy.

411
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,560
I've checked it many times.

412
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,760
It's not that easy.

413
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
I've checked it many times.

414
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,760
It's not that easy.

415
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,760
I've checked it many times.

416
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,760
I've checked it many times.

417
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,760
Can you show me the date of the error?

418
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,760
Let me see where the problem is.

419
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,760
Of course I remember.

420
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,760
How can you...

421
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,760
How can I remember?

422
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,760
Do you think I'm wrong?

423
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,760
That's not what I mean.

424
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,760
Then what do you mean?

425
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,760
Miss Gu.

426
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,760
This time, it's Gu's fault.

427
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,760
We're responsible.

428
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,760
No need.

429
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,760
I quit.

430
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,760
So when you were here,

431
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,760
you said you quit,

432
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,760
I followed your code.

433
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,760
So I know your style.

434
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,760
After you took out the unreasonable part,

435
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,760
it's obvious that it's your hand.

436
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,760
Including this time, you gave Lin Jia Dong.

437
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,760
He did it twice in the same place.

438
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,760
Then thank him for me.

439
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
I even dared to rent it out before the new map.

440
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,760
From now on, this is our first-come, first-served company.

441
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,760
Do you remember what you wrote about?

442
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,760
What?

443
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,760
You want to interview me again?

444
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,760
No.

445
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,760
Today is your interview.

446
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
Then I'm welcome.

447
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,760
Your honor.

448
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,760
Today I want to introduce you

449
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,760
a car-saving smart program.

450
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,760
Its inspiration comes from

451
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,760
its father.

452
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,760
My father is a car-saving driver.

453
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,760
He often takes a lot of orders.

454
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,760
He often takes a bath and gets dark.

455
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,760
He has a small problem with his car.

456
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,760
He doesn't have a good memory.

457
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,760
He often goes home and talks about

458
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,760
the car.

459
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
He doesn't know what car he's driving.

460
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,760
He doesn't know what car he's driving.

461
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,760
He doesn't know what car he's driving.

462
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
He doesn't know what car he's driving.

463
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,760
He doesn't know what car he's driving.

464
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,760
Does he have a forget-me-not?

465
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,760
Maybe from a business perspective,

466
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,760
it is possible for a small-scale client

467
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,760
to design a small program.

468
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,760
But?

469
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,760
Small means that it shouldn't be seen.

470
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,760
Small means that it shouldn't be seen.

471
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,760
The CR system we are developing

472
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,760
is considering to be equipped

473
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,760
with multiple self-adjusting programs

474
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
including the senior mode and the special crowd mode.

475
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,760
Gui Xueqiao,

476
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,760
I wonder if your small program

477
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,760
can be used as a bookmark.

478
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,760
I...

479
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,760
Last time,

480
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,760
I didn't have a chance to help you realize the idea.

481
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,760
But I hope you can give me a chance this time.

482
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,760
The same.

483
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,760
The same.

484
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,760
Last time,

485
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,760
I made you miss me.

486
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,760
I also hope you can give me a chance

487
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,760
this time.

488
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,760
Then,

489
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,760
how long is the deadline?

490
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,760
No deadline.

491
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,760
Sit down.

492
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,760
Don't go back on your word.

493
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,760
I'm sorry.

494
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,760
Okay.

495
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,760
One sugar, half a spoon of cocoa powder,

496
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,760
and 85 degree water temperature of milk foam.

497
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,760
I'll also set up a coffee shop

498
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,760
in the place where I'll start my own business.

499
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,760
You've decided to rent that place?

500
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,760
What's wrong?

501
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,760
Because you have bad memories there,

502
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,760
you're scared of the emergency?

503
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,760
It's not necessary to be scared of the emergency.

504
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,760
It's not necessary.

505
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,760
The last time, Lin Zhi Hua

506
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,760
wasn't that bad.

507
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,760
Except that there was

508
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,760
a little bit of a bad thing in the elevator.

509
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,760
Bad.

510
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,760
It's quite bad.

511
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,760
You've been observing me for so long.

512
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,760
What's the plot?

513
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,760
I didn't know that

514
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,760
Mr. Lin secretly went to

515
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,760
transfer my transfer program.

516
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,760
I didn't expect you to

517
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,760
care so much about our foreign media team.

518
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,760
I've always wanted to explain these things to you.

519
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,760
I've always wanted to explain these things to you.

520
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,760
But I didn't find the right time.

521
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,760
This is an excuse.

522
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,760
Opportunities are all for the best.

523
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,760
What Mr. Lin said is right.

524
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,760
That means I'm not strong enough.

525
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,760
From now on, Mr. Lin will use his fingers.

526
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,760
I'll answer him.

527
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,760
Okay?

528
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,760
Okay.

529
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,760
So, Mr. Lin will let you go now.

530
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,760
No.

531
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,760
Why? You're just

532
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,760
listening to what you want to hear.

533
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,760
Okay.

534
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,760
Since you've been observing me for so long,

535
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,760
I know everything.

536
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,760
Now it's my turn to understand you.

537
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,760
You...

538
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,760
How many ex-girlfriends...

539
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,760
I...

540
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,760
You don't know about me?

541
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,760
You're always

542
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,760
Gao Rui, Lin Jia Dong, and Professor Tan.

543
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,760
Not like you.

544
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,760
The ex-boyfriend you had last time

545
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,760
was always with you.

546
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,760
I'm not leaving.

547
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,760
You're just saying it.

548
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,760
How do you know

549
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,760
Yi Tian Yu was my ex-boyfriend last time?

550
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,760
When someone was working,

551
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,760
he didn't work all night.

552
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,760
He wiped the two people's photos.

553
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
When he got off work,

554
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,760
someone was here to check.

555
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,760
Stop. Stop. Stop.

556
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,760
When he got off work, he was here to check.

557
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,760
Stop. Stop. Stop.

558
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
It's all in the past.

559
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,760
This time,

560
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,760
I've always been just an ordinary friend.

561
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,760
Do you think Yi Tian Yu

562
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,760
will be different this time?

563
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,760
What if he changes?

564
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,760
What's wrong?

565
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,760
Are you jealous?

566
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,760
No.

567
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,760
So what if he's different?

568
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,760
We've all

569
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,760
lived through the same thing.

570
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
Why do we only

571
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,760
think about the past?

572
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,760
I feel

573
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,760
very fulfilled every day.

574
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,760
I like the feeling

575
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,760
of living without regrets.

576
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,760
This is the life I want.

577
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,760
Yi Tian Yu is getting better.

578
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,760
Seeing him like this,

579
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,760
I'm happy for him.

580
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,760
That's all.

581
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,760
And now

582
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,760
he has a girlfriend.

583
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,760
They're getting along well.

584
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,760
Don't think too much.

585
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,760
Really?

586
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,760
Yes. Yes. Yes.

587
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,760
Can we

588
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,760
trust each other?

589
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,760
Yes.

590
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
There's a sound.

591
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,760
Why is there someone outside?

592
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,760
What sound?

593
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,760
You lied to me.

594
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,760
The boss wanted to lie to me.

595
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,760
You don't trust me.

596
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,760
I don't.

597
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,760
I don't trust you.

598
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,760
You're a little fox.

599
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,760
You're too cunning.

600
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,760
Mr. Lin,

601
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,760
for your BNC,

602
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,760
we announce that

603
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,760
the unmanned vehicle model is completely withdrawn.

604
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,760
What do you think of the global market?

605
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,760
Actually, I don't have

606
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,760
the same idea.

607
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,760
It's all market choice

608
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,760
and the best of the best.

609
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,760
When the era of BNC ends,

610
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,760
there will be a new brand

611
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,760
to replace it soon.

612
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,760
And then

613
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,760
it will bring us

614
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,760
a new wind of good competition.

615
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,760
Six years ago,

616
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,760
you transferred the C1 unmanned driving technology

617
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,760
to BNC.

618
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,760
Have you predicted

619
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,760
that C1 will eventually appear

620
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,760
and be beaten by Sia

621
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,760
without any advantage?

622
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
New is replaced by old.

623
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,760
This is also a market choice.

624
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,760
But some companies

625
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,760
want to rely on one technology

626
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,760
to maintain their red power.

627
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,760
That's impossible.

628
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,760
The final result

629
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,760
can only be a good place to remove the profit.

630
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,760
This is also where

631
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
our company has been self-sufficient.

632
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,760
Thank you.

633
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,760
Thank you for accepting my interview today.

634
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,760
Thank you.

635
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,760
Gu Xuejiao,

636
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,760
you're really generous.

637
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,760
You directly applied for

638
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,760
the public VQS互联协议.

639
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,760
Do you know that

640
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,760
the VQS can only

641
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,760
give the company a lot of profit?

642
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,760
If we lose the VQS in the middle of the year,

643
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,760
you'll lose the company.

644
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,760
Our private agreement

645
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,760
is the most advanced

646
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,760
in the market for the next few years.

647
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,760
It directly allows other manufacturers

648
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,760
to produce agreement chips.

649
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,760
Instead, it can expand the influence

650
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,760
and occupancy rate

651
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,760
of Huachuan in the market.

652
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,760
Can you stop staring at

653
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,760
your own things?

654
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,760
I've been playing with old things

655
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,760
and talking about things

656
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,760
for 2024 years.

657
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,760
Where are you going?

658
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,760
Jason Ye, the head of

659
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,760
the Blue Mountains Capital Project,

660
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,760
is on his flight to Jinghai today.

661
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,760
I arranged a morning party

662
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,760
to welcome him.

663
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,760
Let Gao receive you.

664
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,760
Aunt, you don't see

665
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,760
such an important person in person?

666
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,760
I have more important things.

667
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,760
This... this view is good.

668
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,760
It's good.

669
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,760
It's beautiful.

670
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,760
It's good.

671
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,760
Lin, make some tea

672
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,760
for your future in-laws.

673
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,760
Yes, yes, yes.

674
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,760
Come, in-laws, have some tea.

675
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,760
Look,

676
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,760
how good their relationship is.

677
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,760
It's really good.

678
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,760
Our family

679
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,760
has no other characteristics.

680
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,760
It's just a family harmony.

681
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,760
The couple is close like a friend.

682
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,760
It's already

683
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,760
a tradition of our family.

684
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,760
It's good.

685
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,760
How to say it?

686
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,760
Parents are

687
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,760
the future of the child.

688
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,760
Look at your

689
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,760
outstanding parents.

690
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,760
That's how you can give

691
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,760
such an outstanding child to Lin.

692
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,760
Yes.

693
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,760
Yes, yes, yes.

694
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,760
Yes, you're right.

695
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,760
I don't know

696
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,760
where the two children

697
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,760
are now.

698
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,760
So I didn't call.

699
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,760
Wait a minute.

700
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,760
Okay.

701
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,760
Just take your time.

702
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,760
I've already

703
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,760
picked the gifts.

704
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,760
I'm waiting for you now.

705
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,760
Okay, I'll be there soon.

706
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,760
But what do

707
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,760
your parents like?

708
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,760
When I arrive,

709
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,760
we'll pick some.

710
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,760
Why are you nervous?

711
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,760
It's not the first time

712
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
you see my parents.

713
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,760
It's not the same.

714
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,760
Don't worry.

715
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,760
My parents are all

716
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,760
very nice.

717
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,760
They will definitely

718
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,760
let your parents

719
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,760
feel like they're back.

720
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,760
That's what I'm worried about.

721
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,760
I think

722
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,760
both of them

723
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,760
are good.

724
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,760
Which one do you think I should pick?

725
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,760
Then you can buy them all.

726
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,760
Yi Tianyue.

727
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,760
What a coincidence.

728
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,760
The lunch that

729
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,760
Guisi arranged for me

730
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,760
is also in this mall.

731
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,760
Jason Ye.

732
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,760
You are the representative

733
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,760
of Lanshan Capital.

734
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,760
Right?

735
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,760
You talk about work

736
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,760
when you meet your old classmates.

737
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,760
Isn't that why

738
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,760
you came back to China?

739
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,760
Of course, there are more important things.

740
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,760
For example,

741
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,760
feelings.

742
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,760
You and your girlfriend

743
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,760
are finally going to fix Chen Zhengguo.

744
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,760
Congratulations.

745
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,760
How about these?

746
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,760
It depends on

747
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,760
whether your girlfriend likes it or not.

748
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,760
I don't think so.

749
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,760
Do you like it?

750
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,760
Welcome.

751
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,760
Senior Ni,

752
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,760
did you prepare this for me?

753
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,760
President Yi.

754
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,760
This flower

755
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,760
is for my future mother-in-law.

756
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,760
Then you have to hurry up.

757
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,760
I think the flowers are about to fall.

758
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,760
I'll go in a minute.

759
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,760
There's still time.

760
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,760
Have you picked up

761
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,760
the gift that your parents prepared?

762
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,760
It's so hard.

763
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,760
Then we'll go first.

764
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,760
See you at the company.

765
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
The company's lunch party

766
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,760
is held by two senior students.

767
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,760
They don't attend.

768
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,760
Business lunch party?

769
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,760
Is it important for both parties to meet their parents?

770
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,760
Let's go.

771
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,760
Then we'll go first.

772
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,760
Take me to say hello to my uncle and aunt.

773
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,760
Sure.

774
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,760
We'll be there soon.

775
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,760
They're on their way.

776
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,760
They're coming.

777
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,760
These two kids are busy every day.

778
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,760
It's not easy to have time today.

779
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,760
When they meet,

780
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,760
our two families

781
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,760
meet face to face.

782
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,760
They're usually busy

783
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,760
but they can't see each other.

784
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,760
Dad,

785
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,760
are Ban Pei and Hua Hua

786
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,760
working together?

787
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,760
Yes.

788
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,760
I'm sorry.

789
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,760
I have to answer a call.

790
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,760
Go ahead.

791
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,760
Actually,

792
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,760
Hua Hua is a workaholic.

793
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,760
She's just like her dad.

794
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,760
That's true.

795
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,760
Of course, she's like me.

796
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,760
I'm sorry.

797
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,760
It's okay.

798
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,760
Okay.

799
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,760
Look at them.

800
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,760
They're both good at

801
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,760
their work and life.

802
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,760
Compared to them,

803
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,760
we're both good at

804
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,760
our work and life.

805
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,760
But our work is...

806
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,760
I'll answer a call too.

807
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,760
Why are you calling me?

808
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,760
Ms. Li,

809
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,760
what are you eating

810
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,760
in the middle of the night?

811
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,760
Stop it.

812
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,760
You're making me laugh.

813
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,760
You're making me laugh.

814
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,760
You're always awkward

815
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,760
when you answer the phone.

816
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,760
Okay, I got it.

817
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,760
Leave it.

818
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,760
Why did you

819
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,760
reject my offer again?

820
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,760
I haven't asked you

821
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,760
about the charges yet.

822
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,760
You're asking me now?

823
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,760
I've been in charge

824
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,760
of the Shen Group project.

825
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,760
Now you've

826
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,760
brought up my people.

827
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,760
What do you mean?

828
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,760
This isn't the first time!

829
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,760
Can you be quiet?

830
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,760
You're not afraid of being heard?

831
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,760
I should be the one

832
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,760
telling you this.

833
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,760
Let me ask you.

834
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,760
Did you leak the news

835
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,760
about our divorce?

836
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,760
Do you know how much I spent

837
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,760
on public relations

838
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,760
to keep this from happening?

839
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,760
Why are you always like this?

840
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,760
Can you shut up?

841
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,760
Don't move.

842
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,760
Stop acting.

843
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,760
Stop acting.

844
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,760
Don't think

845
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,760
that people can't tell

846
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,760
your personality.

847
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,760
When you were eating inside,

848
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,760
you were waiting for me for a long time.

849
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,760
Let me tell you.

850
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,760
I can't stand you.

851
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,760
I can't stand you anymore!

852
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,760
The phone is ringing.

853
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,760
Why is it ringing?

854
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,760
Hello?

855
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,760
I'm not buying a house.

856
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,760
Don't bring money.

857
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,760
Where is your house?

858
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,760
Excuse me.

859
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,760
Excuse me.

860
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,760
Five minutes.

861
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,760
I need to go to the office.

862
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,760
I happen to have something to do.

863
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,760
Don't move.

864
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,760
Talk to him.

865
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,760
Talk to him.

866
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,760
Take your time.

867
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,760
Luckily, my phone is ringing.

868
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,760
Are you tired?

869
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,760
What's wrong?

870
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,760
Li Wenfei,

871
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,760
how did I tell you?

872
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,760
Did you do

873
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,760
such a thing?

874
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,760
I'm telling you.

875
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,760
This is very important.

876
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,760
Very important.

877
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,760
Don't mess it up.

878
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,760
I found you.

879
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,760
Pretend.

880
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,760
When will you pretend?

881
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,760
You cheated

882
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,760
Xue Jiao's family this time.

883
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,760
I can't open it.

884
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,760
You...

885
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,760
You're still

886
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,760
a fake.

887
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,760
I'm a fake.

888
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,760
I'm telling you.

889
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,760
As long as I don't see your face,

890
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,760
I'll be in a good mood every day.

891
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,760
Li Wenfei, look at you.

892
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,760
Wait.

893
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,760
Wait.

894
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,760
Wait.

895
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,760
Wait.

896
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,760
Excuse me.

897
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,760
What's wrong?

898
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,760
Can you hear?

899
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,760
What's wrong?

900
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,760
Hurry up.

901
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,760
I'll do it.

902
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,760
The key.

903
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,760
The key.

904
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,760
The key locked.

905
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,760
The key.

906
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,760
Where's the key?

907
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,760
Look.

908
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,760
The key is in there.

909
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
What should we do?

910
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,760
This is...

911
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,760
Dad, mom.

912
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,760
It's good that you're here.

913
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,760
Xue Jiao is finally here.

914
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,760
Well...

915
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,760
Uncle.

916
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,760
Xue Jiao?

917
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,760
What?

918
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,760
There's a fight inside.

919
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,760
Open the door first.

920
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,760
Open the door.

921
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,760
I...

922
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,760
The key.

923
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,760
The key.

924
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,760
Dad, mom.

925
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,760
The fight is here.

926
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,760
Dad, mom, don't worry.

927
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,760
I know their situation.

928
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,760
Go in first.

929
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,760
Dad, mom.

930
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,760
My dad.

931
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,760
Two of you.

932
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,760
Calm down.

933
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,760
What are you doing

934
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,760
between the couple?

935
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,760
Who's not a couple?

936
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,760
Couple.

937
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,760
They divorced long ago.

938
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,760
Xue, are you clear?

939
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,760
Yes.

940
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,760
I...

941
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,760
I'm clear.

942
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,760
Xue.

943
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,760
Come on.

944
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,760
Why are you doing this?

945
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,760
Why are you doing this?

946
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,760
Your mom is making a fuss

947
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,760
without knowing the situation.

948
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,760
Am I making a fuss

949
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,760
without knowing the situation?

950
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,760
Look at her.

951
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,760
I heard what you two

952
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,760
said at the same time.

953
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,760
Son.

954
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,760
Do you know

955
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,760
who's not coming to our store today?

956
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,760
Dear.

957
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,760
I'm sorry.

958
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,760
It's okay.

959
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,760
It's okay.

960
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,760
Did you buy the flowers?

961
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,760
Yes.

962
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,760
Yes.

963
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,760
Give them to Aunt Li.

964
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,760
Okay.

965
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,760
It's a deal

966
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,760
between our two families.

967
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,760
No, no, no.

968
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,760
It's too late.

969
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,760
What's too late, dad?

970
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,760
What are you talking about?

971
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,760
Let's just go.

972
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,760
Stop it.

973
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,760
Look at you.

974
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,760
You're so good.

975
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,760
You're a good match.

976
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,760
Right?

977
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,760
With such a good family atmosphere,

978
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,760
you can have a good time.

979
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,760
Today, I'm in the mood.

980
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,760
I'll treat you.

981
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,760
I'll buy the flowers.

982
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,760
Okay.

983
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,760
It's okay.

984
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,760
I'll find someone to do the housework.

985
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,760
I'll give you a set.

986
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,760
Be quiet.

987
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,760
Hurry up.

988
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,760
Okay. Thank you.

989
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,760
It's okay.

990
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,760
You two are usually

991
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,760
very good at acting in front of me.

992
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,760
Why can't you hold it back now?

993
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,760
It's all your dad's idea.

994
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,760
He hid it well.

995
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,760
It doesn't involve

996
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,600
any stock market

997
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,760
or information disclosure.

998
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,760
He went to the family

999
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,760
and pretended to be a fox

1000
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,760
and couldn't hide it.

1001
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,760
I said I was going to tell

1002
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,760
the truth to the future family.

1003
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,760
He's not the one who did it.

1004
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,760
He's the one who did it.

1005
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,760
He's the one who did it.

1006
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,760
He's the one who did it.

1007
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,760
He's the one who did it.

1008
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,760
Can't you be honest?

1009
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,760
You're the one who came up with this bad idea.

1010
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,760
How old are you?

1011
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,760
Say something.

1012
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,760
Tell the truth.

1013
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,760
You can be a relative

1014
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,760
if you tell the truth.

1015
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,760
What idea?

1016
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,760
You're right.

1017
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,760
You're right.

1018
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,760
You're right about everything.

1019
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,760
Everything is correct.

1020
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,760
Son.

1021
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,760
Son.

1022
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,760
We're rude to you today.

1023
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,760
Can you ask Qingjia out

1024
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,760
and apologize to her in person?

1025
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,760
No need.

1026
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,760
I'll clean up

1027
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,760
this mess myself.

1028
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,760
I'll cook for you next time.

1029
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,760
I'll treat you to dinner alone.

1030
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,760
I'll treat you to dinner alone.

1031
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,760
It's a big thing for a child to get married.

1032
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,760
It's a fate to be a relative.

1033
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,760
Right?

1034
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,760
Yes.

1035
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
I won't mention

1036
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,760
about the family.

1037
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,760
We're meant to be.

1038
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,760
I can tell it when you came in.

1039
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,760
You're the benefactor of our family.

1040
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,760
I...

1041
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,760
It's my habit to help others.

1042
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,760
But when did I become

1043
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,760
your benefactor?

1044
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,760
If you hadn't

1045
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,760
let me miss the plane

1046
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,760
while driving the car,

1047
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,760
and left my luggage

1048
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,760
on the roadside...

1049
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,760
How could you do

1050
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,760
such a thing?

1051
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,760
I...

1052
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,760
I'm sorry.

1053
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,760
It's my fault.

1054
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,760
You're right.

1055
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,760
Thanks to that mistake,

1056
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,760
I avoided the risk of investment.

1057
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,760
Really?

1058
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,760
It's so fate.

1059
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,760
And you're still

1060
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,760
the father of Gu.

1061
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,760
Do you think we're meant to be?

1062
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,760
No.

1063
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,760
It's true.

1064
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,760
Drink some water.

1065
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,760
Drink some water.

1066
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,760
You're right.

1067
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,760
I'll drink it.

1068
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,760
We're meant to be.

1069
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,760
Right?

1070
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,760
Yes.

1071
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,760
Okay.

1072
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,760
Dad, Mom.

1073
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,760
Ling asked

1074
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,760
when we'll have time.

1075
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,760
We're eating.

1076
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,760
You're still eating?

1077
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,760
Girl,

1078
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,760
I don't know

1079
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,760
if your mom's blood pressure is okay.

1080
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,760
But I can't eat anymore.

1081
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,760
Brother.

1082
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,760
I'll give you another toast.

1083
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,760
Okay.

1084
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,760
My son is in the top of the class.

1085
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,760
Thanks to Gu

1086
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,760
I've been blessed.

1087
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,760
Your son is...

1088
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,760
Uncle, I have something to do.

1089
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,760
I'll leave first.

1090
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,760
Okay.

1091
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,760
Here you are.

1092
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,760
Hello, Uncle.

1093
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,760
Qiao, nice to meet you.

1094
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,760
I'm sorry.

1095
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,760
I'm sorry.

1096
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,760
I'm sorry.

1097
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,760
I'm sorry.

1098
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,760
I'm sorry.

1099
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,760
I'm sorry.

1100
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,760
I'm sorry.

1101
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,760
I'm sorry.

1102
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,760
I'm sorry.

1103
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,760
I'm sorry.

1104
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,760
I'm sorry.

1105
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,760
I'm sorry.

1106
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,760
I'm sorry.

1107
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,760
I'm sorry.

1108
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,760
I'm sorry.

1109
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,760
I'm sorry.

1110
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,760
I'm sorry.

1111
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,760
I'm sorry.

1112
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,760
I'm sorry.

1113
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,760
I'm sorry.

1114
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,760
I'm sorry.

1115
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,760
I'm sorry.

1116
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,760
I'm sorry.

1117
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,760
I'm sorry.

1118
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,760
I'm sorry.

1119
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,760
I'm sorry.

1120
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,760
I'm sorry.

1121
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,760
I'm sorry.

1122
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,760
I'm sorry.

1123
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,760
I'm sorry.

1124
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,760
I'm sorry.

1125
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,760
I'm sorry.

1126
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,760
I'm sorry.

1127
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,760
I'm sorry.

1128
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,760
I'm sorry.

1129
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,760
I'm sorry.

1130
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,760
I'm sorry.

1131
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,760
I'm sorry.

1132
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,760
I'm sorry.

1133
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,760
I'm sorry.

1134
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,760
I'm sorry.

1135
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,760
I'm sorry.

1136
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,760
I'm sorry.

1137
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,760
I'm sorry.

1138
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,760
I'm sorry.

1139
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,760
I'm sorry.

1140
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,760
I'm sorry.

1141
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,760
I'm sorry.

1142
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,760
I'm sorry.

1143
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,760
I'm sorry.

1144
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,760
I'm sorry.

1145
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,760
I'm sorry.

1146
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,760
I'm sorry.

1147
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,760
I'm sorry.

1148
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,760
I'm sorry.

1149
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,760
I'm sorry.

1150
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,760
I'm sorry.

1151
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,760
I'm sorry.

1152
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:48,760
If you read the secret in my eyes,

1153
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:54,760
you'll find that you're always in my heart.

1154
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:05,760
I try to open my arms.

1155
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,760
Because I'm sure of love,

1156
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,760
I'm waiting for you at the top.

1157
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:18,760
It doesn't matter if the wind blows in the big wild.

1158
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,760
There's a sound that's very close.

1159
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,760
I know it must be you.

1160
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:36,760
I try to open my arms.

1161
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:41,760
Because I'm sure of love,

1162
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,760
I'm waiting for you at the top.

1163
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:51,760
It doesn't matter if the wind blows in the big wild.

1164
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:57,760
There's a sound that's very close.

1165
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:03,760
I know it must be you.
