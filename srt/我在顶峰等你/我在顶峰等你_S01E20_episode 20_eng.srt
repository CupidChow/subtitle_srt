00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,600
 ♫ Don't be afraid of the so-called top scorer ♫ 

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,517
 ♫ You're a legend in someone else's story too ♫ 

5
00:00:29,517 --> 00:00:32,240
 ♫ Don't hold back, grow with all your might ♫ 

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,880
 ♫ Flowers bloom at the height of summer ♫ 

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,600
 ♫ Now let's reformat this life anew ♫ 

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,560
 ♫ Physics and math aren't that hard ♫ 

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:49,240
 ♫ In the flaming youth,
we grow stronger together ♫ 

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,320
 ♫ My heart still burns with fiery heat ♫ 

11
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,045
 ♫ Follow the rhythm, let your spirit relieve ♫ 

12
00:00:58,045 --> 00:01:01,710
 ♫ The night sky lights up, guiding my flight ♫ 

13
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,560
 ♫ I'll be brave with you, chasing the height ♫ 

14
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,220
 ♫ My love still burns, glowing so bright ♫ 

15
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,040
 ♫ Shining in eyes that smile with grace ♫ 

16
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,256
 ♫ Let us break through time and space ♫ 

17
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,960
 

18
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,340
Why don't you pick up?

19
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,820
The press conference fell through.

20
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,141
If I pick up, I'll get scolded.

21
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:10,353
Your press conference fell through?

22
00:02:10,353 --> 00:02:13,552
It's alright. For online promos,
they can interview others.

23
00:02:13,552 --> 00:02:15,902
I was never one for crowds anyway.

24
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,710
Shi Yun.

25
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,770
Actually,

26
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:37,390
I cried not because I argued with my Mom,

27
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,500
but because I'm happy.

28
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,320
After so many years,

29
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,652
I can finally breathe.

30
00:02:47,652 --> 00:02:50,609
I no longer have to care about how others see me.

31
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:53,609
I am free to be myself now.

32
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,100
So I'm happy.

33
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,380
Good.

34
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,660
I'll be happy with you.

35
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,020
 

36
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,820
Go back to your work.

37
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,352
But...

38
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:10,150
From now on, I won't let anyone change
who I am.

39
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,840
So,

40
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:15,219
I hope you won't either.

41
00:03:15,935 --> 00:03:17,415
Okay.

42
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,460
 
I heard something.

43
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,842
The VP of B&amp;C Motors is his aunt.

44
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,930
There must've been an insider leak.

45
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,600
After the contest, we went back over everything,

46
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,751
checking the code line by line

47
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:36,999
and found a hidden code
planted in the encapsulation.

48
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:39,040
Didn't you check all the codes before the contest?

49
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,000
You better confess now.

50
00:03:42,107 --> 00:03:44,460
Honesty matters most.

51
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,462
Apologize.

52
00:03:46,462 --> 00:03:48,382
Apologize first.

53
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,160
Xue Jiao.

54
00:03:56,046 --> 00:03:58,830
- Got another white lie for me?
- No.

55
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,800
- Listen to me.
- Lin Jia Dong.

56
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,320
You gotta explain to us.

57
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,720
I didn't do anything. You have to trust me!

58
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,240
How are we supposed to trust you?

59
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,330
Lin Jia Dong, it was you.

60
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,920
I didn't!

61
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,538
So, you are the rat.

62
00:04:12,538 --> 00:04:13,670
Why don't you trust me?

63
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,630
- Explain yourself...
- I trust you.

64
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,380
You...

65
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,770
Xue Jiao, saying the opposite when angry

66
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,450
only works in a relationship.

67
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,300
Can't use it on Lin Jia Dong.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,630
Well, I only believe what I saw with my own eyes.

69
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,950
Go to the organizers.

70
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,040
Pull the in-car command logs from the server side.

71
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,120
I'll go.

72
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,510
Okay.

73
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,480
 The tension after a loss. 

74
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,740
- Slow down.
- Careful.

75
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:44,552
 The joy after a win. 

76
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:46,715
I'm sure you all get it.

77
00:04:46,715 --> 00:04:50,510
Besides, the hidden code was tricky.

78
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,240
If you said

79
00:04:53,854 --> 00:04:56,847
Lin wrote it, I'd believe it.

80
00:04:56,847 --> 00:05:00,887
Lin Jia Dong though... Indeed.

81
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,410
Thank you very much.

82
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:13,000
Actually, that day my aunt
did ask me to change some code.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,480
There's a set of parameters.

84
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,560
Import them into Capital University's computers.

85
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,313
It's just a block of hidden code,

86
00:05:18,313 --> 00:05:20,600
won't affect your own attack-and-defense program.

87
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,840
It just slightly tweaks the communication
protocol between the car systems.

88
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,272
Once the results come out,

89
00:05:26,272 --> 00:05:29,560
I'll have someone destroy
all the car system data immediately.

90
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,820
But after the internal trial, they still let me compete.

91
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,806
How does their victory benefit you?

92
00:05:35,806 --> 00:05:38,856
I've been around the block.

93
00:05:40,653 --> 00:05:41,750
Think about it.

94
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,900
If a car never breaks down,

95
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,480
who would I sell new cars to?

96
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,620
 Only if you make them lose the contest 

97
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,813
 would they start thinking
you're the more reliable one. 

98
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,020
 But my heart is still with all of you. 

99
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,590
 I hit the undo key in the end. 

100
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,360
That's about it.

101
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,950
He wasn't lying.

102
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,900
The code really never ran.

103
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:29,464
But this only proves even more
how important honesty is.

104
00:06:29,464 --> 00:06:32,390
Between people, trust is everything.

105
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,230
And trust comes from honesty.

106
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,270
Sometimes,

107
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,200
we fear the truth might upset someone,

108
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,920
so we justify hiding things

109
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,840
we think they wouldn't want to hear.

110
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,120
But who's to say this concealment is harmless?

111
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,436
We have no right to decide for them,

112
00:06:54,436 --> 00:06:57,920
nor do we know if they'd want to know.

113
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,240
- Though it's too late to say this now...
- No...

114
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,480
It was my fault. I apologize to all of you.

115
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,800
I'll make amends.

116
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,090
Since you know trust is the most important thing,

117
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,040
then you shouldn't have told any white lies
from the beginning.

118
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,870
If there's a problem
and you can't be honest about it,

119
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,630
then how can we face it together?

120
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,720
How can we work
to find a solution and move forward together?

121
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,220
Yes...

122
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,510
- Who said I wanted to move forward with you?
- Not you.

123
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,610
Just take the bone.

124
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,080
Xue Jiao, since everything's been said,

125
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,640
how about just letting it go?

126
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,480
Said what?

127
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,680
I'm just talking about the matter.

128
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:50,656
They haven't made up yet?

129
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,880
Go...

130
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,700
Is it heavy? Let me help you.

131
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,600
No, thanks. Why are you here again?

132
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,900
I don't come back often.

133
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,260
Just wanna visit my old classmate.

134
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,750
Why didn't you pick up my call?

135
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,390
Didn't we just meet last time?

136
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,870
Since you don't come back often,

137
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,320
spend more time with your Dad.

138
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,000
I gotta go.

139
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,930
Xue Jiao, I...

140
00:08:48,135 --> 00:08:50,670
- Hi, Dad?
 - I told you to come to the shop 

141
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,360
and learn the accounting.

142
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,840
Where have you been?

143
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,460
 Your old man just opened
his first store in the service sector. 

144
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,840
 Can you take it seriously? 

145
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,948
 I'm counting on you. 

146
00:08:59,948 --> 00:09:02,018
I came to Capital University.

147
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,320
Forgot my phone again.

148
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,600
Gotta go back to the lab.

149
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,440
 What's at Capital University? 

150
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,900
 Buried treasure? 

151
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,480
Or something more irresistible?

152
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,410
Don't tell me you went to see Xue Jiao again.

153
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,772
 Son, I've got to say, back then 

154
00:09:20,772 --> 00:09:24,870
I really did hope Xue Jiao
could give our gene pool a little boost.

155
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,080
 But she's been dating her boyfriend for years. 

156
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,440
 No one in our family should be a home wrecker. 

157
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,420
Dad, what are you talking about?

158
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,710
I... I have a girlfriend.

159
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:42,200
 Son, how can you hide such good news from me? 

160
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,030
 Is she also from Capital University or what? 

161
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,630
 When will you bring her home?
Let me see her. 

162
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,550
I'll talk to you later.

163
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,730
That's it for now. Gotta go, bye.

164
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,410
 You finally took a completely different life path. 

165
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,420
 Great. 

166
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,550
Why did you come back, Xue Jiao?

167
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,390
I came to get my phone.

168
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,510
Good for you.

169
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,480
Looks like you did well studying abroad.

170
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,320
You even have a girlfriend now.

171
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,080
No... Listen to me.

172
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,330
 Is she jealous? 

173
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,280
We should get Lin...

174
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,670
Let's hang out some time.

175
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,270
I'm meeting Tian Tian for dinner today.

176
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,100
I'll go in now.

177
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,440
No time like the present. How about today?

178
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,000
I'll wait for you. Xue Jiao!

179
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,690
I'll be here!

180
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,550
Didn't you go abroad
to be a pro basketball player?

181
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,180
Why are you reading economics books now?

182
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,910
My Dad said basketball has no future.

183
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:45,320
So he bought me a business bachelor's degree.

184
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,960
More skills, more opportunities.

185
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,320
Your Dad's not wrong.

186
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,234
But this book...

187
00:10:53,234 --> 00:10:54,720
No problem. I can understand it.

188
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,332
Let me tell you, ugh...

189
00:10:57,332 --> 00:10:59,820
I mean,

190
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,030
this book is okay as a general intro to economics.

191
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,850
But if you want to excel in investing,

192
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,820
 

193
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,519
it might not be enough.

194
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,240
Then what should I do?

195
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,390
Do you want

196
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,253
my advice?

197
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,840
Theories are important,
but investing needs foresight.

198
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,720
Needs foresight?

199
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,550
What does that mean?

200
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,900
Simply put, you need to know

201
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,852
which companies and industries will be
at the forefront of the times

202
00:11:37,852 --> 00:11:40,390
and dare to bet on them.

203
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,120
How am I supposed to know
which companies to bet on?

204
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,600
It feels unfair to teach you step by step.

205
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,340
Come on, I'm your old classmate.

206
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,240
What's wrong with that?

207
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,360
It's not cheating.

208
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,970
True.

209
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,860
 Helping my ex get a second chance 

210
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,080
 is kind of a good deed. 

211
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,480
The future is about open AI,
using digital currency,

212
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,910
shopping on Temu.

213
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,440
What O C I?

214
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,390
I what?

215
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,290
I can only tell you this much.

216
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,450
As your old classmate, I've done my best.

217
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,600
You figure out the rest.

218
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,350
Wait up.

219
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,680
The info you asked for.

220
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,150
- Will this do?
- Yeah.

221
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,547
- Lin, we're leaving now.
- Bye.

222
00:12:50,547 --> 00:12:51,600
- Lin.
- Bye.

223
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,720
- Thanks.
- Bye.

224
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,710
- Bye, Xue Jiao.
- Bye.

225
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,220
Bye.

226
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,950
Fei Fei, I'm a bit hungry.

227
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:21,990
Me too.

228
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,740
Right?

229
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,480
Shu Lan, you're hungry too.

230
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,930
- No, I'm not.
- You are!

231
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,270
Hungry.

232
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,240
- Let's go.
- Xue Jiao, we're leaving.

233
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,554
- Bye.
- Bye.

234
00:13:35,554 --> 00:13:36,300
- Bye.
- Bye, Lin.

235
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,020
Bye, Lin.

236
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,493
Xue Jiao.

237
00:13:54,493 --> 00:13:55,856
I'd rather we have a big fight.

238
00:13:55,856 --> 00:13:58,379
You can hit me, yell at me.

239
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,549
Just don't keep ignoring me.

240
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,730
Can you stop being so childish?

241
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,670
The last person who cut the power

242
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,940
got their butt kicked like crazy.

243
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,850
I didn't do this.

244
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,260
The power really went out.

245
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,360
Xue Jiao, what are you looking for?
I'll help you.

246
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,340
A door pry tool.

247
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,180
The lab's a secure facility,

248
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,160
all doors are anti-theft and tamper-proof.

249
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,070
I've called security. They're on their way.

250
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:03,176
How long will that take?

251
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,158
I can't wait.

252
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,190
Do you really not want to be with me?

253
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,550
Let me do it.

254
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,360
Almost done.

255
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:47,760
You already sold C1, but didn't
even upgrade the lab's equipment?

256
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,930
Xue Jiao.

257
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,570
My fight with B&amp;C was never about winning.

258
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,780
I wanted to lose.

259
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:06,090
The goal was always to get them
to buy C1 at a high price.

260
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,940
Then I'd use the money to develop C2.

261
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,904
And when we both launch at the same time in three years,

262
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:15,435
I can deliver a precise targeted strike on B&amp;C.

263
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,360
Thanks to you, the national champion,

264
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,240
C1 got to be sold for a high price.

265
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:28,878
Are you done?

266
00:16:28,878 --> 00:16:31,148
That's not what I wanted to hear.

267
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,200
I shouldn't have run away.

268
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,100
Xue Jiao, I never admitted it,
but I hid it from you because I was avoiding it.

269
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,665
I should've told you about C1 earlier

270
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:51,995
and let you know my plan.

271
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,030
I should've

272
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,280
confessed everything to you
the day after you got drunk.

273
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,758
Be honest.

274
00:16:59,758 --> 00:17:01,979
Also, last time, Lin Zhi Hua
did something bad to you.

275
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,640
It was also my fault.

276
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,480
I thought,
if I don't think about it or mention it,

277
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,430
I won't have to face it.

278
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,640
That was wrong.

279
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,770
I'm sorry.

280
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,030
Honestly, I was running away too.

281
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,910
It's not that I hated the old you.

282
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:39,410
I hated the old me.

283
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,490
But whenever I see you,

284
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,630
I'm reminded of it.

285
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,280
No matter how hard I try to erase that past,

286
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,420
it never goes away.

287
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,520
Don't erase it.

288
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,722
Why would you do that?

289
00:17:54,722 --> 00:17:58,720
The you now and the you back then.

290
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,700
Without either, you wouldn't be who you are today.

291
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,010
If you really think that way,

292
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,220
why did you keep it from me so long?

293
00:18:17,674 --> 00:18:19,454
Xue Jiao.

294
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,800
Xue...

295
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:34,254
 Xue Jiao. 

296
00:18:34,254 --> 00:18:35,860
 Meet me at the company building. 

297
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,680
 The same place where
you were wronged last time. 

298
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,020
 Please, do come over. 

299
00:19:09,193 --> 00:19:11,453
 Safe travels. 

300
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,330
Babe...

301
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,460
What do you wanna say?

302
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,920
Do you remember this?

303
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,260
This is...

304
00:20:03,897 --> 00:20:07,547
The code you wrote to apply for the transfer.

305
00:20:08,093 --> 00:20:11,630
There is a critical bug in the code you wrote.

306
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,040
No way.

307
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,040
I reviewed it many times.

308
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,920
Can you show me the error log?

309
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,940
Let me check where the problem is.

310
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,880
Of course, I remember.

311
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,530
- How would you...
- How would I also remember?

312
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,340
Do you think I made a mistake?

313
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,580
That's not what I meant.

314
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,950
Then what do you mean?

315
00:20:33,219 --> 00:20:35,049
Ms. Gu,

316
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,360
we do take responsibility
for this recruitment mishap.

317
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,720
Forget it.

318
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,660
I quit.

319
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:58,670
Actually, after you said "I quit" here,

320
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,442
I reviewed your code.

321
00:21:01,442 --> 00:21:03,970
So I know your style very well.

322
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,380
After picking out the illogical parts,

323
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,850
it's obvious it was your work.

324
00:21:09,722 --> 00:21:12,302
Also, after you gave it to Lin Jia Dong this time,

325
00:21:12,302 --> 00:21:17,180
he even tampered with the same part again.

326
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:23,250
Well, then, thank him for me.

327
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,220
I managed to rent this place before Xintu did.

328
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,090
This will be our startup from now on.

329
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,820
Do you still remember what your app was about?

330
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,260
What?

331
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,380
You wanna interview me again?

332
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,810
No.

333
00:21:56,954 --> 00:21:59,332
You interview me.

334
00:21:59,332 --> 00:22:01,412
Don't mind if I do.

335
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,330
Hello, everyone.

336
00:22:19,153 --> 00:22:23,943
Today, I'm here to introduce
a new in-car smart app.

337
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:28,310
The inspiration came from her father.

338
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:31,010
My father is a ride-hailing driver.

339
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,660
To pick up a few more rides,

340
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,540
he leaves home early and works late.

341
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,140
It has given him health issues.

342
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,790
His memory's bad too.

343
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:42,830
He wonders if the car is locked
after he gets home.

344
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,364
From a business perspective,

345
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,840
designing an app for a small user group
may feel pointless.

346
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,580
But niche doesn't mean it should be ignored.

347
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,260
Niche doesn't mean it's invisible.

348
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:04,260
Our C2 system in development is looking

349
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:09,940
to include adaptive modes
like senior mode and special needs mode.

350
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,960
 

351
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,840
Miss Gu Xue Jiao,

352
00:23:16,434 --> 00:23:19,684
would you be willing

353
00:23:19,684 --> 00:23:22,183
to license your app idea?

354
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,170
I...

355
00:23:32,827 --> 00:23:35,356
Last time,

356
00:23:35,356 --> 00:23:38,296
I missed the chance
to help you realize your idea.

357
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:44,299
But I hope this time, you can give me that chance.

358
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,240
 

359
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,290
Likewise...

360
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:07,920
 ♫ No more regrets ♫ 

361
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,940
Last time,

362
00:24:12,009 --> 00:24:13,969
I didn't hold on to you.

363
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,930
I also hope this time,

364
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,740
you can give me a chance.

365
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,460
Then

366
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:35,573
what's the time limit?

367
00:24:35,573 --> 00:24:37,767
Unlimited renewal.

368
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:44,100
 ♫ I'll be yours through every turn of time ♫ 

369
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,570
Happy to work with you.

370
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,820
Promise.

371
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,410
Sugar?

372
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,820
One sugar cube, half a spoon of cocoa.

373
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,270
Extra milk foam, 85°C water.

374
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:39,250
I'll have a coffee corner in our startup space.

375
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,980
You're set on renting that place?

376
00:25:43,325 --> 00:25:44,326
What?

377
00:25:44,326 --> 00:25:48,050
Did your bad memories give you PTSD of that place?

378
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,820
Scared?

379
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,650
I wouldn't say it's scary.

380
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:56,450
I agree.

381
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:00,300
The last Lin Zhi Hua wasn't that bad.

382
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:04,290
Except in the elevator, I was kinda harsh.

383
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,150
This is bad.

384
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,220
Very bad.

385
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,860
You've been watching me for this long.

386
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,060
What are you up to?

387
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,050
I didn't even know you secretly checked my code

388
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:20,200
for the transfer interview.

389
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,230
Seems like you cared a lot about our contractors.

390
00:26:25,342 --> 00:26:26,900
I've always wanted to explain about these.

391
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,890
Just that I didn't get a chance.

392
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,860
That's just an excuse.

393
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,483
You need to fight for a chance.

394
00:26:36,483 --> 00:26:38,050
You're right.

395
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:41,630
I guess I didn't try hard enough.

396
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,413
From now on, you just lift your finger.

397
00:26:45,413 --> 00:26:48,913
I'll go where you say. Sound good?

398
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,900
Then I need you to let go of me now.

399
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,500
No can do.

400
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,330
What? You only hear what you wanna hear.

401
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,440
Okay.

402
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:11,660
Well. Since you've been watching me for so long,

403
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,765
and you know all about me,

404
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:16,505
now it's my turn to know you.

405
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,060
How many...

406
00:27:20,225 --> 00:27:23,296
ex-girlfriends?

407
00:27:23,296 --> 00:27:24,896
Me?

408
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,580
You know my circle.

409
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:31,460
Always Gao Rui, Lin Jia Dong, Professor Tan.

410
00:27:32,232 --> 00:27:34,255
Unlike you.

411
00:27:34,255 --> 00:27:38,350
That ex-boyfriend of yours, Yi Tian Yu,
is still hanging around.

412
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:47,190
Past crimes don't count, alright?

413
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:52,870
How do you know he was my ex last time?

414
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,520
Someone was slacking off at work,

415
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,830
cleaning your picture with him.

416
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,498
- After work, he picked you up with snacks.
-Stop!

417
00:28:00,498 --> 00:28:02,570
Stop!

418
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,760
It's in the past now.

419
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:09,411
This time, we are really just friends.

420
00:28:09,411 --> 00:28:15,280
Do you think Yi Tian Yu
will be different this time?

421
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,330
What if he's changed?

422
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,970
What?

423
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,710
Are you jealous?

424
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,130
No.

425
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,380
So what if he's changed this time?

426
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,760
We've both gotten a second chance at life.

427
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,450
Why dwell on the past?

428
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:45,680
For me, every day now feels fulfilling.

429
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,040
I like this feeling of living without regrets.

430
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,100
This is the life I want.

431
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,870
Yi Tian Yu is getting better now.

432
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,720
I am really happy for him.

433
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,800
That's all.

434
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,779
Besides, he has a girlfriend now.

435
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:03,510
They are great together.

436
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,820
Don't overthink it.

437
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,300
Really?

438
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:10,072
Yes!

439
00:29:10,072 --> 00:29:12,010
Can't we have a little trust between us?

440
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,640
Yes.

441
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:22,330
I heard something. Someone's outside.

442
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,090
There's no sound.

443
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,660
No one's there, you're lying.

444
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,110
Trying to trick me?

445
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,280
You don't trust me?

446
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,050
I do.

447
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:34,790
But you, little fox, are too cunning.

448
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,025
 
Mr. Lin, your competitor B&amp;C Motors announced a complete withdrawal

449
00:29:41,025 --> 00:29:42,900
of their autonomous vehicle line
from the global market.

450
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,555
What's your take on that?

451
00:29:44,555 --> 00:29:47,420
I've never really seen them as "competitors".

452
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,550
The market makes its choice.

453
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,870
The fittest survives.

454
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:53,900
With B&amp;C's era ending, another brand will rise
to replace it soon.

455
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,480
And hopefully, they'll set a new, healthy standard

456
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,010
for competition in our industry.

457
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:00,550
Six years ago, you sold your C1
autonomous driving tech to B&amp;C Motors.

458
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,050
Did you foresee that one day,

459
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,860
C1 would be completely outmatched by C2?

460
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,680
The new replaces the old.

461
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,290
It's how the market works.

462
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,100
Some companies cut corners,

463
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,770
hoping to milk one technology forever.

464
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,780
That's impossible.

465
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,401
In the end, good money drives out bad.

466
00:30:16,401 --> 00:30:19,396
That's something our company
always reminds itself of.

467
00:30:19,396 --> 00:30:21,820
Okay, thank you.
Thank you for taking my interview.

468
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,710
Thank you too.

469
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:27,010
Gu Xue Jiao, aren't you just generous?

470
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:29,237
Applying to make the V2X protocol public.

471
00:30:29,237 --> 00:30:30,680
Do you know how much profit

472
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,020
the licensing fees for just the protocol
could bring to the company?

473
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,132
If everyone's year-end bonus gets cut,
are you gonna cover that?

474
00:30:35,132 --> 00:30:38,660
Our private protocol is the most advanced
for the next few years.

475
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,790
By granting free licenses to other manufacturers to produce protocol chips,

476
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:44,760
we can actually expand Huachuang's
market influence and share.

477
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,590
Can you stop focusing on your own little patch?

478
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,290
- My patch?
- Stick to the facts.

479
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:51,360
It's 2024...

480
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,420
Zhi Hua, where are you going?

481
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,540
Project lead at Blue Mountain Capital, Jason Yi, is arriving in Jinghai today.

482
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,820
I've arranged a business lunch to welcome him.

483
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,440
Let Gao handle the reception.

484
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,270
Zhi Hua, aren't you meeting
this important guest yourself?

485
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,640
I have more important matters.

486
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,090
Well, this view is nice.

487
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,700
Beautiful.

488
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,740
Honey, pour some tea for our future in-laws.

489
00:31:34,402 --> 00:31:38,630
Right! Here, have some tea.

490
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,240
Look at them.

491
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,904
What a harmonious couple.

492
00:31:42,904 --> 00:31:44,420
Good.

493
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,900
Our family doesn't have much,
just a harmonious home.

494
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:54,200
Mutual respect has become
a family tradition for us.

495
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,440
How wonderful.

496
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,940
No wonder they say parents
are a reflection of their children's future.

497
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,420
You two are such excellent parents.

498
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,920
That's how you raise an outstanding kid like Lin.

499
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,420
Yes.

500
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,260
Yes... Yes, you're right.

501
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:18,040
I wonder where those two kids are now.

502
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,050
They haven't called either.

503
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:21,090
- Wait a bit longer.
- Okay...

504
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,680
Take your time.

505
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,310
I've already picked some gifts.

506
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,050
I'm waiting for you.

507
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:31,040
Okay, I'll be there soon.

508
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,070
But what do your parents actually like?

509
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:36,195
When I get there, let's pick something good.

510
00:32:36,195 --> 00:32:37,820
Why are you so nervous?

511
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,530
It's not your first time meeting my parents.

512
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,180
This time's different.

513
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,250
Don't worry.

514
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,940
My parents are really nice.

515
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:48,090
They'll make your folks feel right at home.

516
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,100
That's exactly what I'm worried about.

517
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,204
Now, I'm looking at two key chains.

518
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:54,690
I like them both.

519
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,830
Which one do you think I should pick?

520
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,610
Just buy both.

521
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,570
Yi Tian Yu?

522
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,140
Isn't it funny?

523
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:14,270
The lunch your company arranged for me is also in this mall.

524
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,590
Jason Yi?

525
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:20,628
You're with Blue Mountain Capital?

526
00:33:20,628 --> 00:33:23,950
What? Do we only talk about work now?

527
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,480
Isn't that why you came back?

528
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,240
There are more important things.

529
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,610
Like... Relationships.

530
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,192
You and your girlfriend are getting married?

531
00:33:36,192 --> 00:33:38,980
- Congrats.
- How about these?

532
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:42,180
That depends on your girlfriend.

533
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,160
Not up to me.

534
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,230
Do you like it?

535
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,820
Welcome.

536
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,110
Lin.

537
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,260
Is that bouquet for me?

538
00:34:12,694 --> 00:34:14,304
Mr. Yi.

539
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,320
It's actually for my future mother-in-law.

540
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,380
You'd better hurry.

541
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,220
Looks like these flowers are wilting.

542
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,570
We're meeting soon.

543
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,070
I'll make it.

544
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,720
You picked the gifts for my parents?

545
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,500
I'll take them.

546
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,010
We're leaving now. See you.

547
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:39,950
Neither of you two top execs is gonna have lunch with your investor?

548
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:44,400
Is a business lunch more important than meeting our parents?

549
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,920
- Let's go.
- We're off.

550
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,020
Say hi to Uncle and Auntie for me.

551
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,130
Will do.

552
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,920
Be there soon.

553
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,150
They're already on their way.

554
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:04,320
- Almost here.
- These two kids are always so busy.

555
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,951
They finally found time for this lunch.

556
00:35:06,951 --> 00:35:09,550
Our two families can finally meet.

557
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:12,550
They're usually so busy. We don't even see them.

558
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,592
A perfect match.

559
00:35:13,592 --> 00:35:15,323
Two workaholics.

560
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:17,513
- Yes...
- Right...

561
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,190
Sorry, I gotta take this call.

562
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,050
- Go on.
- Go ahead.

563
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,530
Actually, our Petal takes after his Dad.

564
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,490
Just loves to work.

565
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,470
Yeah...

566
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,110
Of course, he takes after me too.

567
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,830
Excuse me.

568
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,490
Okay...

569
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,800
Look at them.

570
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,610
Balancing career and life perfectly.

571
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,360
Doing great on both fronts.

572
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,732
Compared to them, we are just...

573
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,320
We're okay....

574
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,530
But our career...

575
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,280
I have a call too.

576
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,380
Why are you calling me?

577
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:04,480
Ms. Li, could you spare some time
to discuss our dinner menu?

578
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,710
Stop it.

579
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,880
They'll laugh at us.

580
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,400
The phone's been silent forever.

581
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,230
It's awkward.

582
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,420
Okay, I got it.

583
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,070
Just leave it.

584
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,970
Why did you veto everything again?

585
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,650
I haven't even accused you yet,

586
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,050
and you're coming at me first?

587
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:30,550
I've been in charge of this Shen City project,

588
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,196
and now you're kicking my people out?

589
00:36:32,196 --> 00:36:33,320
What does that mean?

590
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,530
It's not your first time!

591
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,740
Can you keep your voice down?

592
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,820
Aren't you afraid they might hear?

593
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,395
I should be the one saying that.

594
00:36:41,395 --> 00:36:46,205
Tell me, are you the one
who leaked our divorce news?

595
00:36:49,646 --> 00:36:53,060
Do you know how much I spent on PR to keep this under wraps?

596
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,900
Why are you always like this?

597
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,760
Why can't you just shut your...

598
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,410
Stop!

599
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,650
Quit acting.

600
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,160
Just stop.

601
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,351
You think they can't see how demanding you are?

602
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:10,622
You kicked me a few times while we were in there.

603
00:37:10,622 --> 00:37:15,090
I'm telling you, I've put up
with you more than enough!

604
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,440
My phone. Who could it be?

605
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,600
Hello?

606
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,400
I'm not buying any house, and I don't want a loan.

607
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,570
Hello? Where is this house at?

608
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,110
Future in-laws.

609
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:26,270
Sorry. Five minutes.

610
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,900
- It's alright.
- Gotta handle some family stuff.

611
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,110
I have something too.

612
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,570
Don't touch me.

613
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,940
Talk nicely.

614
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,670
Take your time.

615
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,920
Good thing the call came through.

616
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,415
Aren't you tired of this yet?

617
00:37:40,415 --> 00:37:41,260
What's going on?

618
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,185
Lin Wen Bin! What did I tell you?

619
00:37:43,185 --> 00:37:45,700
Have you ever done anything properly?

620
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,692
I told you this is very important!

621
00:37:48,692 --> 00:37:50,150
Don't mess it up.

622
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,340
I think you just love to act, to pretend.

623
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,870
When will this come to an end?

624
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,720
This time, you lied to Xue Jiao's family.

625
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,680
I can't open it.

626
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,670
But in the end, you'll be exposed anyway.

627
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,700
I'll be exposed?

628
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,800
I'm telling you. As long as
you're out of my sight, I'm super happy!

629
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,110
You think I wanna see you?

630
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,670
Wait... I'll get the waiter.

631
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,500
Waiter! Waiter!

632
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,630
Help us.

633
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,630
What's going on? Are you meeting in-laws?

634
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,010
Why are you fighting?

635
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,780
Asked for too much dowry?

636
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,650
The key... You got the key?

637
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:19,230
It's locked. The key.

638
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,245
Go grab the key.

639
00:38:21,245 --> 00:38:22,576
What... Look at this.

640
00:38:22,576 --> 00:38:24,352
- They're fighting one-on-one?
- Yeah...

641
00:38:24,352 --> 00:38:26,910
What should we do?

642
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,320
- Dad, Mom.
- Uncle, Auntie.

643
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,570
- Just in time!
- Xue Jiao, you're here!

644
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,440
Uncle?

645
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,630
Xue Jiao?

646
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,520
Wait, they're fighting in here.

647
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,172
- Open the door, quick!
- I...

648
00:38:40,172 --> 00:38:42,320
- Quick, the key!
- They're fighting, quick!

649
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,440
Who are fighting?

650
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,230
His parents.

651
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,220
Mom, Dad, don't worry.

652
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,360
I know their situation.

653
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,178
- Let's go in.
- Okay...

654
00:38:48,178 --> 00:38:51,040
- Dad! Mom!
- I'm telling you...

655
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,940
Please calm down.

656
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,670
Why fight with your spouse?

657
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,820
- I'm not his wife!
- I'm not her husband!

658
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,070
So you're divorced.

659
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,420
Look... Did you know about this?

660
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,660
- Did you know?
- I... Do I?

661
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,090
It's alright.

662
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,880
Come. Does it have to be now?

663
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,050
Does it have to be here?

664
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,924
Your Mom's acting up regardless of the situation.

665
00:39:20,924 --> 00:39:22,900
Am I? I'm acting up?

666
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,163
Look. Look at her now.

667
00:39:24,163 --> 00:39:26,370
You two said it at the same time. I heard you.

668
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:32,540
Son, do you know who came to our restaurant today?

669
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,891
Future in-laws, I'm so sorry.

670
00:39:44,891 --> 00:39:46,692
-It's nothing...
- Yeah...

671
00:39:46,692 --> 00:39:49,400
- Is this bouquet from Petal?
- Yes.

672
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,360
- Yeah!
- Quick, give it to Auntie Li.

673
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,570
So our kids' marriage is settled then.

674
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:56,220
No. Don't. We can't take it.

675
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,400
What do you mean "can't take it", Dad?

676
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,055
- What are you saying?
- We can take it.

677
00:40:00,055 --> 00:40:01,585
Stop talking.

678
00:40:02,507 --> 00:40:03,610
Isn't this great?

679
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,840
Harmony brings wealth, right?

680
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,551
Seeing you all so happy now,
I'm in a good mood too.

681
00:40:08,551 --> 00:40:10,490
Guests come first.

682
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:12,380
Today, your meal's on me.

683
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,235
Forget about all this.
I'll get someone to clean up later.

684
00:40:14,235 --> 00:40:15,450
I'll make sure you're taken care of.

685
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:17,360
Wait a moment. Take a seat.

686
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,850
- Thank you.
- It's alright.

687
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,780
Weren't you two pretty good
at acting in front of me?

688
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:32,170
Why did you lose your cool this time?

689
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:37,740
That was all your Dad's idea.

690
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,300
We were hiding it pretty well.

691
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,400
Nothing about stock shake-ups or info leaks.

692
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,190
Then out of nowhere,
he just couldn't hide it anymore.

693
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:49,530
I clearly said we should be
honest with our future in-laws.

694
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,380
Why can't we just be honest?

695
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,090
It was your dumb idea.

696
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,220
How old are you?

697
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,610
Think before you speak!

698
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:56,860
Honesty?

699
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,800
It'll just drive our in-laws away!

700
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,780
- Seriously...
- You're right.

701
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,360
You're right, okay? You're always right.

702
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,230
Always the right one.

703
00:41:20,341 --> 00:41:21,760
Son.

704
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,400
Son.

705
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,650
Today we messed up.

706
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:30,010
You invite the in-laws out another time.

707
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:32,170
We'll apologize to them in person, okay?

708
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,740
Forget it.

709
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,890
I'll clean up this mess myself.

710
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,260
Let's invite your parents
for dinner next time. I'll cook.

711
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,672
Speaking of the kids' marriage,

712
00:41:49,672 --> 00:41:52,480
meeting the in-laws is all about fate, right?

713
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,320
- Yeah...
- Dad.

714
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,931
Let's not talk about the in-laws. No.

715
00:41:57,931 --> 00:42:01,110
But you and I really hit it off.

716
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,260
I knew it as soon as you walked in.

717
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,336
You're a true savior of my family.

718
00:42:05,336 --> 00:42:07,620
- Me?
- When...

719
00:42:09,352 --> 00:42:11,667
I'm someone who likes to help others.

720
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:14,748
But when did I save you?

721
00:42:14,748 --> 00:42:17,639
You were driving so slowly back then,

722
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:19,312
causing me to miss my flight

723
00:42:19,312 --> 00:42:22,659
and leaving my suitcase by the roadside.

724
00:42:22,659 --> 00:42:24,410
How could you have done that?

725
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,150
- I... How...
- Hurry, say you're sorry.

726
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,630
Sorry. My bad.

727
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,610
Don't be.

728
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:33,030
Thanks to missing that flight, I dodged
an investment trap.

729
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,520
Really?

730
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,090
That's some fate right there.

731
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,610
And you're Xue Jiao's Dad.

732
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:40,320
Are we destined or what?

733
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,320
- Wait, this is...
- Don't drink too much.

734
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,300
- Okay.
- She's right.

735
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,360
You drink less, and I drink up.

736
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,270
That way, our bond keeps going.

737
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:52,070
- Right?
- Keep going.

738
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,152
Good. Dad, Mom.

739
00:42:54,152 --> 00:42:57,950
Lin asked when we'd be available
to have another meal together.

740
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,010
Another meal?

741
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:03,220
Daughter, I don't know
if your Mom can handle this,

742
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,780
but your Dad sure can't.

743
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,360
- Bro, one more toast to you.
- Okay.

744
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:15,581
My son got into UFE thanks to Xue Jiao's
constant help.

745
00:43:15,581 --> 00:43:17,612
Wait. Your son is...

746
00:43:17,612 --> 00:43:19,590
Uncle, I have work to do.

747
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:21,660
So I'll head off first.

748
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,780
- Speaking of my son.
- Hello, Uncle, Auntie.

749
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,100
What a coincidence. We meet again.
