20
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,240
Not this one.

21
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,200
Not this one, either.

22
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,240
Old Lin,

23
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,590
stop being absent-minded.

24
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,570
Hurry up and find the file Professor Tan wants.

25
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,200
Old Lin,

26
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,700
when we leave, will your family... your cousin see you off?

27
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,010
No.

28
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,770
Found it.

29
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,250
She won't?

30
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,120
No wonder you're upset.

31
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,940
At least, I'm your apprentice.

32
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,440
You're going to Germany without even telling me.

33
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,060
You'll be making money in Germany

34
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,154
while I'm cleaning up the lab here.

35
00:02:54,154 --> 00:02:57,224
What on earth is this?

36
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,290
200 watts.

37
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,041
   

38
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:20,147
&gt;i&gt; 

39
00:03:20,762 --> 00:03:22,130
 I need you. 

40
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,260
 Hello, 

41
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,850
 nice to meet you. 

42
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,340
 Senior Brother Lin, don't go. Please help me out! 

43
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,690
 I'm not alone. 

44
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,570
 I've got a buff. 

45
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,290
 Me? 

46
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,660
 Buff. 

47
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,720
 You're going to help me. 

48
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,220
   

49
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,938
Custodian.

50
00:03:46,938 --> 00:03:48,798
Lin

51
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,100
Zhihua.

52
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,490
   

53
00:03:57,943 --> 00:04:00,900
 This is when he first entered the lab in his freshman year. 
   

54
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,730
   

55
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,080
 These are her notes from the last month before the college entrance exam. 

56
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:09,390
Where are you going?

57
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,970
I left something in the lab.

58
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,820
   

59
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,010
 Then give me a reason to stay. 

60
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,780
Coming.

61
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,100
Xuejiao?

62
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,035
Where's Senior Brother Lin?

63
00:04:31,035 --> 00:04:32,100
He went to the lab.

64
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,910
You didn't see him?

65
00:05:15,502 --> 00:05:17,980
 Where did he go? 

66
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,220
Gu Xuejiao.

67
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,130
A guy has been waiting for you outside the dorm for quite a while.

68
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,930
Where is he?

69
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,790
Turn around.

70
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,060
Xuejiao.

71
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,910
I just arrived. Where have you been?

72
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,810
How come it's you?

73
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:39,330
I finished the homework you left me in the last session.

74
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,610
You're quite efficient.

75
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,490
Of course. You assigned me homework, Teacher Gu.

76
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,380
I have to be efficient.

77
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,280
Do you...

78
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,010
Do you think it's correct?

79
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,470
Didn't we cover this last time?

80
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,250
We covered this. Look.

81
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,610
Which one?

82
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,770
This one.

83
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,790
The correct answer is A, isn't it?

84
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,470
   

85
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,520
Shiyun.

86
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,325
What do you want this time?

87
00:06:44,325 --> 00:06:46,170
I have good news.

88
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,220
We've topped the download chart for three consecutive weeks.

89
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,860
How's that? Three consecutive weeks.

90
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,080
Why do I care if you win?

91
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,470
I just wanted to share it with you.

92
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,390
I'm not interested.

93
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,130
Shiyun.

94
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,650
You...

95
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,300
Shiyun?

96
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,500
Why are you following me?

97
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,170
Shiyun,

98
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,730
about the expulsion warning...

99
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,790
So that's what the champion is curious about.

100
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,492
"Student Zhou Shiyun, 
    

101
00:07:57,492 --> 00:07:59,670
due to your repeated unexcused absences,

102
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,730
we hereby issue a formal disciplinary warning.

103
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,910
Your failure to improve attendance

104
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,102
will result in dismissal proceedings."

105
00:08:08,102 --> 00:08:09,840
Happy now? 
    

106
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,510
What? You want me, the poor student,

107
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,350
to congratulate you on topping the list?

108
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,610
Congratulations, then.

109
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,390
No. It's not like that.

110
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,990
Then get out of my sight.

111
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,880
Shiyun,

112
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,370
do you want to grab something to eat?

113
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,330
Let me buy you bubble tea.

114
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,210
Let's sit down and talk.

115
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,920
Maybe you'll feel better. What do you say?

116
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,840
What's there to talk about?

117
00:08:42,637 --> 00:08:44,737
Let me say it for you.

118
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,520
Zhou Shiyun.

119
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,850
I have become the top now.

120
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,330
Why are you letting yourself fall like this?

121
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:55,520
You've been drinking and clubbing all day long, doing nothing serious.

122
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,830
You deserve to be like this.

123
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,090
You deserve to be expelled.

124
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,210
You deserve to be alone.

125
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,010
You should go back to being a good girl.

126
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,560
No, you don't.

127
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,940
I have never thought like this.

128
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,445
As I said, no matter what you do, I'll stand by you.

129
00:09:16,445 --> 00:09:19,060
Whether you're the well-behaved person you once were

130
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,668
or the troublemaker facing expulsion now,

131
00:09:21,668 --> 00:09:23,230
you'll always be yourself.

132
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,440
You have never changed.

133
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,150
What a hypocrite.

134
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,110
I've never changed?

135
00:09:37,572 --> 00:09:39,842
I don't even know who I am now.

136
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,760
I mean it.

137
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:51,261
Hold it back.

138
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,185
Have fun being sentimental here. I'm going back.

139
00:09:58,185 --> 00:10:00,185
Let me finish.

140
00:10:02,245 --> 00:10:03,365
Shiyun,

141
00:10:03,365 --> 00:10:06,435
no matter what you think of yourself now,

142
00:10:06,435 --> 00:10:09,245
you are always who you are.

143
00:10:09,245 --> 00:10:11,395
I like you, no matter what.

144
00:10:21,265 --> 00:10:24,143
   

145
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:30,495
Where is everyone?

146
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:32,332
They're throwing a farewell party for you.

147
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,918
They went to set up the venue.

148
00:10:34,918 --> 00:10:37,020
Seriously, those guys.

149
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,530
Well, let's go there together.

150
00:10:44,215 --> 00:10:45,425
Senior Brother Lin,

151
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:48,615
you dirtied the floor I just mopped.

152
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:54,795
Sorry. Let me do it.

153
00:10:55,485 --> 00:10:57,025
No need. Go ahead.

154
00:10:57,025 --> 00:10:58,975
I can clean it up on my own.

155
00:10:58,975 --> 00:11:00,555
It's good enough.

156
00:11:00,555 --> 00:11:02,305
Let's go.

157
00:11:02,305 --> 00:11:03,575
No thanks, I'll pass.

158
00:11:03,575 --> 00:11:05,875
I don't really know anyone in the lab.

159
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,595
You don't?

160
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:13,785
Don't you know

161
00:11:13,785 --> 00:11:16,155
me and Gao Rui?

162
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:27,615
Cheers.

163
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,065
Come on. Come on.

164
00:11:33,065 --> 00:11:34,765
Gao Rui.

165
00:11:34,765 --> 00:11:36,045
Take over the mic for now.

166
00:11:36,045 --> 00:11:37,555
Okay.

167
00:11:49,185 --> 00:11:50,905
Why are you drinking?

168
00:11:50,905 --> 00:11:53,100
Aren't you afraid of harming your liver?

169
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,820
It's fine to drink once in a while.

170
00:11:56,835 --> 00:11:58,815
Self-deceptive.

171
00:11:59,855 --> 00:12:01,975
Who's self-deceptive?

172
00:12:01,975 --> 00:12:03,895
I thought you weren't coming.

173
00:12:11,335 --> 00:12:12,895
I...

174
00:12:14,555 --> 00:12:16,107
What are you whispering? Secret lectures?

175
00:12:16,107 --> 00:12:17,580
Let's hear it.

176
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,473
Grandmaster, come on. Cheers.

177
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:20,435
Okay.

178
00:12:20,435 --> 00:12:22,575
Once you're abroad, eat regularly and sleep plenty.

179
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,455
Don't let work exhaust you.

180
00:12:24,455 --> 00:12:26,785
Don't worry about the lab.

181
00:12:30,145 --> 00:12:33,025
Senior Brother Lin, I can't figure out the code logic.

182
00:12:33,025 --> 00:12:34,695
Could you explain it to me?

183
00:12:34,695 --> 00:12:37,635
Gu Xuejiao, you're working too hard.

184
00:12:37,635 --> 00:12:39,955
Jiadong, come and sing.

185
00:12:39,955 --> 00:12:41,455
- Come on. 
 - I'm not going.

186
00:12:41,455 --> 00:12:43,265
Let's go.

187
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:50,425
♫  Forgetting the past is easier said than done  ♫

188
00:12:50,425 --> 00:12:52,225
What's the problem?

189

♫  I cannot remove you from my heart  ♫

191
00:13:01,492 --> 00:13:05,662
If I insert a linear function

192
00:13:09,315 --> 00:13:11,455
here...

193
00:13:11,455 --> 00:13:16,695
♫  I'll always recognize your figure  ♫

194
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:22,231
♫  I don't want you to ever be  ♫

195
00:13:22,231 --> 00:13:24,925
This is a linear function.

196
00:13:26,715 --> 00:13:31,500
Which formula should I use to make the variables

197
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,080
quickly return to the starting point?

198
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,760
♫  Searching to the ends of the earth  ♫

199
00:13:42,765 --> 00:13:45,930
There are seven or eight solutions in programming languages.

200
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,780
Which one do you want to hear?

201
00:13:48,405 --> 00:13:49,934
The faster the better,

202
00:13:49,934 --> 00:13:54,681
but don't let data overflow, causing abnormal results.

203
00:13:58,835 --> 00:14:02,780
Then it depends on the code logic,

204
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,991
whether you can fully utilize the CPU's bandwidth

205
00:14:06,991 --> 00:14:13,199
to apply all threads to the linear function regression.

206
00:14:13,795 --> 00:14:16,232
I'll definitely maximize efficiency,

207
00:14:16,232 --> 00:14:21,615
but I don't want the CPU to overheat during computation.

208
00:14:21,615 --> 00:14:26,700
As long as the log results are correct after the linear regression,

209
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,625
it's good enough.

210
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:40,855
Then we'll have to test it hands-on.

211
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,875
You want to test it?

212
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,150
I'll cover the costs if the CPU gets fried.

213
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:55,796
♫  Watching you  ♫

214
00:14:56,905 --> 00:15:00,305
♫  Slowly make your way  ♫

215
00:15:00,305 --> 00:15:01,885
No.

216
00:15:01,885 --> 00:15:04,835
I haven't set up the test environment yet.

217
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:09,585
♫  And come closer again  ♫

218

♫  Who can understand your heart?  ♫

219
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,785
It's okay.

220
00:15:16,785 --> 00:15:20,795
Then let the variables stay in the compiler for a bit longer.

221
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,330
But as long as you want,

222
00:15:28,081 --> 00:15:31,528
we can get the variables quickly returned.

223
00:15:31,528 --> 00:15:35,753

I... I think my CPU is getting fried.

233
00:16:01,145 --> 00:16:03,285
I need a drink to cool off.

234
00:16:05,545 --> 00:16:07,615
Grandmaster, you're leaving tomorrow.

235
00:16:07,615 --> 00:16:09,075
Don't waste your time with her.

236
00:16:09,075 --> 00:16:10,795
Let's drink.

237
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:13,185

Come on, cheers.

241
00:16:21,155 --> 00:16:22,525
Thank you.

242
00:16:22,525 --> 00:16:25,165
- This is to Senior Brother. 
 - Okay, thank you.

243
00:16:27,645 --> 00:16:29,365
The party is still not over?

244
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:31,655
Should I pick you up?

245
00:16:53,525 --> 00:16:55,195
You have a date?

246
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,695
You're clueless. I have a class.

247
00:16:57,695 --> 00:16:59,672
Where? In that outfit?

248
00:16:59,672 --> 00:17:02,126
- In a KTV. 
 - Do you think I'll buy it?

249
00:17:02,126 --> 00:17:03,427
I'm serious.

250
00:17:03,427 --> 00:17:05,015
My tutor is in a KTV.

251
00:17:05,015 --> 00:17:06,925
My goodness. That's new.

252
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:08,005
I also need tutoring.

253
00:17:08,005 --> 00:17:09,715
Can I tag along?

254
00:17:12,245 --> 00:17:14,425
I'm studying for CET-4, bro.

255
00:17:14,425 --> 00:17:15,625
You're a sports student.

256
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,385
Will you even understand?

257
00:17:17,385 --> 00:17:18,905
Aren't you also a sports major?

258
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:21,525
Every college student knows English. Okay?

259
00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:23,975
I know. But without a great tutor,

260
00:17:23,975 --> 00:17:26,365
you still won't pass the exam.

261
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:29,795
Wait.

262
00:17:29,795 --> 00:17:31,955
What about the training tonight?

263
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:36,385
Please check me in, Father.

264
00:17:36,385 --> 00:17:37,585
I'll bring you snacks.

265
00:17:37,585 --> 00:17:40,685
I'll be waiting for the snacks, Father.

266
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,085
We're having crayfish.

267
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:53,025
Cheers.

268
00:18:00,725 --> 00:18:02,575
Senior Brother Lin.

269
00:18:07,055 --> 00:18:10,745
I haven't given you the parting gift.

270
00:18:20,005 --> 00:18:22,325
The emblem of our high school.

271
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,775
I have one, too.

272
00:18:25,485 --> 00:18:26,555
This is different.

273
00:18:26,555 --> 00:18:29,400
It has my name on it.

274
00:18:33,525 --> 00:18:35,185
I never wore it when I was at school.

275
00:18:35,185 --> 00:18:37,735
That's because you don't love your alma mater.

276
00:18:37,735 --> 00:18:39,345
That's because my cousin has OCD

277
00:18:39,345 --> 00:18:41,680
and won't let me make holes in my clothes.

278
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,965
Your cousin?

279
00:18:42,965 --> 00:18:45,365
She's here? Where is she?

280
00:18:47,355 --> 00:18:49,915
No, she's not. Go back to sleep.

281
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:58,045
I just thought about it.

282
00:18:59,945 --> 00:19:05,005
If you want to achieve everything with that code,

283
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:11,185
it's likely going to result in a process deadlock.

284
00:19:14,835 --> 00:19:16,105
Deadlock?

285
00:19:16,105 --> 00:19:18,286
When two processes are both waiting

286
00:19:18,286 --> 00:19:21,686
for each other's computational results to proceed,

287
00:19:22,725 --> 00:19:27,225
they end up in a mutual waiting state and halt completely.

288
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:33,285
This is called a process deadlock.

289
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:35,155
Do you get it?

290
00:19:47,445 --> 00:19:49,335
Do you not don't get it,

291
00:19:50,765 --> 00:19:52,765
or do you refuse to get it?

292
00:20:01,595 --> 00:20:03,615
I think I'm drunk.

293
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,160
   

294
00:20:25,045 --> 00:20:27,715
Do you know how to break a process deadlock?

295
00:20:35,925 --> 00:20:39,305
It requires external intervention to break resource-holding conditions.

296
00:20:46,685 --> 00:20:48,865
Where is everyone?

297
00:20:48,865 --> 00:20:51,045
I want to drink more.

298
00:20:53,245 --> 00:20:54,985
Where are we?

299
00:20:55,765 --> 00:20:58,775
At your favorite Jinghai University.

300
00:21:00,005 --> 00:21:02,595
So what are we doing?

301
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,585
You're so drunk.

302
00:21:04,585 --> 00:21:07,025
I'm taking you back to your dorm.

303
00:21:08,765 --> 00:21:09,795
I can't walk anymore.

304
00:21:09,795 --> 00:21:11,535
I... I'm not going back.

305
00:21:11,535 --> 00:21:13,645
I can't walk anymore.

306
00:21:16,795 --> 00:21:19,225
I thought you said you never get drunk.

307
00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:21,905
But you only had a few glasses.

308
00:21:32,795 --> 00:21:34,915
Where do you want to go?

309
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:42,305
I'll go wherever you're going.

310
00:21:46,945 --> 00:21:49,005
To Germany?

311
00:21:52,635 --> 00:21:54,505
No, thanks.

312
00:21:57,445 --> 00:21:59,675
You're not allowed to go, either.

313
00:22:06,665 --> 00:22:09,745
I thought you'd go wherever I go.

314
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,650
Don't go.

315
00:22:29,105 --> 00:22:31,055
All right, we need to hurry up.

316
00:22:31,055 --> 00:22:34,665
You must get back before the curfew.

317
00:22:40,555 --> 00:22:42,475
Lin Zhihua.

318
00:22:45,005 --> 00:22:47,155
Lin Zhihua.

319
00:22:47,155 --> 00:22:50,565
Actually, I have a secret.

320
00:22:52,725 --> 00:22:54,000
What are you mumbling?

321
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,003
I said, "Actually, I have a secret."

322
00:23:04,315 --> 00:23:06,085
What secret?

323
00:23:39,525 --> 00:23:41,435
Lin Zhihua.

324
00:23:43,205 --> 00:23:45,425
Lin Zhihua.

325
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:46,985
Here.

326
00:23:49,015 --> 00:23:53,825
Actually, I really have a secret.

327
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,875
Trying to sneak a kiss again?

328
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:58,355
Sneak?

329
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:01,825
I kissed you fair and square.

330
00:24:02,813 --> 00:24:04,485
Fine.

331
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,765
You kissed me fair and square.

332
00:24:06,765 --> 00:24:08,345
And I liked it.

333
00:24:08,345 --> 00:24:10,135
Happy now?

334
00:24:12,925 --> 00:24:16,825
You're much cuter this time.

335
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,465
No one has ever said that about me.

336
00:24:28,585 --> 00:24:30,945
What do you mean by "this time"?

337
00:24:33,725 --> 00:24:36,445
Actually,

338
00:24:36,445 --> 00:24:40,985
I came back from ten years in the future.

339
00:24:48,065 --> 00:24:50,905
   
   

340
00:24:58,685 --> 00:25:00,925
 Then can you tell me which of these two shows signs of a big surge? 

341
00:25:00,925 --> 00:25:03,385
 This will be extremely popular. 

342
00:25:03,385 --> 00:25:05,205
 It may even bring honor to the country. 

343
00:25:05,205 --> 00:25:06,875
 How do you know it's been updated? 

344
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:10,045
 You're just a freshman who barely took any courses. 

345
00:25:10,045 --> 00:25:12,075
 I... I was eager to join the lab. 

346
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:13,485
 So I did my homework. 

347
00:25:13,485 --> 00:25:15,205
 What's the point of beefing with a kid? 

348
00:25:15,205 --> 00:25:16,625
 It'll drag me down to her level. 

349
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:18,052
 But since I've got a second... 

350
00:25:18,052 --> 00:25:19,845
 A second what? 

351
00:25:22,285 --> 00:25:25,035
 Second chance to meet you! 

352
00:25:27,685 --> 00:25:32,555
Do you want to know what you'll be like

353
00:25:32,555 --> 00:25:34,465
in ten years?

354
00:25:42,555 --> 00:25:44,455
 I really value this opportunity. 

355
00:25:44,455 --> 00:25:48,535
 I even gave up the offer to become a full-time employee in my original position. 

356
00:25:48,535 --> 00:25:49,965
 Ms. Gu, 

357
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,495
 your past performance has been truly outstanding. 

358
00:25:52,495 --> 00:25:57,425
 But your resume doesn't fit our programming department. 

359
00:25:57,425 --> 00:25:59,335
 I quit. 

360
00:26:00,635 --> 00:26:02,185
 Lin Zhihua, 

361
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,355
 did I somehow offend you? 

362
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:05,195
 Why are you targeting me? 

363
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:07,355
 How is not hiring targeting you? 

364
00:26:07,355 --> 00:26:09,925
 You gave up everything for a guy, turning down promotion chances. 

365
00:26:09,925 --> 00:26:12,145
 After five years, you're still a highly replaceable contractor. 

366
00:26:12,145 --> 00:26:14,975
 You gave up your full-time offer because you failed the transfer. 

367
00:26:14,975 --> 00:26:17,685
 That shows you lack priorities and crack under pressure. 

368
00:26:17,685 --> 00:26:20,015
 You'd be a burden in the programming department anyway. 

369
00:26:20,015 --> 00:26:21,495
 I accept it if I'm not qualified. 

370
00:26:21,495 --> 00:26:24,055
 If the hiring process is unfair, I won't have it. 

371
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,714
No, I don't want to know.

372
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:30,864
I bet it's nothing good.

373
00:26:38,155 --> 00:26:42,472
You... Your face...

374
00:26:42,472 --> 00:26:45,975
gives me nightmares.

375
00:26:45,975 --> 00:26:48,425
You discriminate against us outsourced workers,

376
00:26:48,425 --> 00:26:50,925
and let your lackey change my program

377
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:53,905
to get Zhou Shiyun promoted.

378
00:26:56,775 --> 00:27:03,146
Everything I've worked so hard for and sold my soul for

379
00:27:03,146 --> 00:27:08,135
is worth nothing to you.

380
00:27:11,045 --> 00:27:13,265
If it weren't for you,

381
00:27:14,075 --> 00:27:16,465
I wouldn't have come back.

382
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,940
"Sold your soul"?

383
00:27:22,765 --> 00:27:24,635
Do you have to be so dramatic?

384
00:27:24,635 --> 00:27:27,205
You keep gaslighting me, but I have to sell my soul

385
00:27:27,205 --> 00:27:29,805
and wear a smile at work.

386
00:27:34,245 --> 00:27:36,815
But if I hadn't come back,

387
00:27:38,245 --> 00:27:41,615
I wouldn't have what I have now.

388
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:48,825
Do you know how much I like my current self?

389
00:27:53,245 --> 00:27:55,288
So,

390
00:27:55,288 --> 00:27:58,075
I don't know

391
00:27:58,075 --> 00:28:04,615
if I should hate you or thank you.

392
00:28:08,445 --> 00:28:10,335
Doesn't matter.

393
00:28:11,045 --> 00:28:15,155
Anyway, if you were that guy from ten years later,

394
00:28:15,155 --> 00:28:21,785
there is absolutely, absolutely, absolutely no way I would like you.

395
00:28:31,965 --> 00:28:34,125
Absolutely no way.

396
00:28:39,105 --> 00:28:40,395
It's okay.

397
00:28:40,395 --> 00:28:41,725
It's fine.

398
00:28:41,725 --> 00:28:45,935
Anyway, you're not that guy from ten years later.

399
00:29:51,525 --> 00:29:53,045
Shu Lan!

400
00:29:53,045 --> 00:29:54,115
I can't breathe.

401
00:29:54,115 --> 00:29:55,875
Are you trying to kill me?

402
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:58,245
I was about to be nicer to you, but look at you,

403
00:29:58,245 --> 00:30:01,395
coming back drunk last night, reeking of alcohol.

404
00:30:01,395 --> 00:30:05,475
I got up early in the morning and lined up at the supermarket to get it.

405
00:30:13,155 --> 00:30:15,475
Last night...

406
00:30:27,925 --> 00:30:29,155
We are both adults.

407
00:30:29,155 --> 00:30:31,195
So what if I kissed him?

408
00:30:33,315 --> 00:30:38,435
 Actually, I have a secret. 

409
00:30:41,245 --> 00:30:43,095
What got into you?

410
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,355
 What secret? 

411
00:31:02,355 --> 00:31:04,205
 Did I tell him or not? 

412
00:31:04,205 --> 00:31:05,315
 Did I? 

413
00:31:05,315 --> 00:31:06,525
 I don't think so. 

414
00:31:06,525 --> 00:31:08,115
 Did I? 

415
00:31:08,115 --> 00:31:10,125
 No way. 

416
00:31:15,045 --> 00:31:16,725
What are you doing?

417
00:31:16,725 --> 00:31:18,925
Having a beer during the day?

418
00:31:20,285 --> 00:31:22,005
I got wasted last night.

419
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,595
I'm trying to remember what happened.

420
00:31:24,595 --> 00:31:27,245
You were so good at memorizing vocabulary.

421
00:31:27,245 --> 00:31:29,795
You weren't drinking to boost your memory.

422
00:31:29,795 --> 00:31:32,275
It's not the same.

423
00:31:33,795 --> 00:31:36,645
Do you know what it looks like right now?

424
00:31:37,245 --> 00:31:39,154
Like you just broke up.

425
00:31:39,154 --> 00:31:41,845
- Absolutely not. 
 - Getting nervous, huh?

426
00:31:42,635 --> 00:31:44,835
Let me think.

427
00:31:44,835 --> 00:31:46,896
You went to the party last night

428
00:31:46,896 --> 00:31:49,665
and met an interesting guy.

429
00:31:49,665 --> 00:31:51,685
You got more and more in tune as you talked.

430
00:31:51,685 --> 00:31:54,825
You even thought that you had met the love of my life.

431
00:31:55,485 --> 00:31:59,945
Then he slowly approached you and said,

432
00:31:59,945 --> 00:32:02,075
"Want to learn about our gym courses?"

433
00:32:02,075 --> 00:32:05,205
You woke up this morning, feeling deceived.

434
00:32:05,205 --> 00:32:07,645
It infuriated you. "What a jerk!"

435
00:32:07,645 --> 00:32:10,725
That's why you're drowning your sorrows. Right?

436
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:14,045
I really admire you, Sun Tiantian.

437
00:32:14,045 --> 00:32:16,475
Your entire guess is wrong.

438
00:32:18,925 --> 00:32:22,555
But anyway, drinking only makes you feel worse.

439
00:32:22,555 --> 00:32:25,115
Drinking away your sorrows just makes them worse.

440
00:32:25,115 --> 00:32:27,425
Here. Try my new recipe.

441
00:32:27,425 --> 00:32:29,045
My exclusive secret recipe.

442
00:32:29,045 --> 00:32:31,865
Crazy Good Bubble Tea.

443
00:32:31,865 --> 00:32:36,105
Thanks, Tiantian. But I can't drink anything anymore.

444
00:32:36,105 --> 00:32:37,555
Just take a sip.

445
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:38,965
This is my new recipe.

446
00:32:38,965 --> 00:32:40,115
Refreshing and smooth.

447
00:32:40,115 --> 00:32:44,295
I promise, with one sip, all your troubles will go away.

448
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:49,815
Then I hope I can remember what happened last night.

449
00:32:52,925 --> 00:32:54,715
 What secret? 

450
00:32:57,245 --> 00:32:59,145
 Trying to sneak a kiss again? 

451
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:00,695
 Sneak? 

452
00:33:00,695 --> 00:33:04,065
 I kissed you fair and square. 

453
00:33:08,965 --> 00:33:10,955
 Lin Zhihua. 

454
00:33:13,339 --> 00:33:15,499
 Lin Zhihua. 

455
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,205
You remember now? What is it?

456
00:33:20,205 --> 00:33:21,635
I remember now.

457
00:33:21,635 --> 00:33:23,058
I remember...

458
00:33:23,058 --> 00:33:26,015
Wait. What is this recipe?

459
00:33:26,015 --> 00:33:28,568
How come I don't remember what I should

460
00:33:28,568 --> 00:33:32,275
and remember everything I shouldn't?

461
00:33:35,355 --> 00:33:37,705
I'm going back.

462
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,045
I have to say that your recipe is quite something.

463
00:33:45,045 --> 00:33:46,795
But let me rename it next time.

464
00:33:46,795 --> 00:33:49,555
Don't call it "Crazy Good" and stuff.

465
00:33:49,555 --> 00:33:50,925
It's hard to remember.

466
00:33:50,925 --> 00:33:52,765
See you around.

467
00:33:52,765 --> 00:33:54,355
Your bag, Xuejiao.

468
00:33:54,355 --> 00:33:55,445
Your bag.

469
00:33:55,445 --> 00:33:56,525
- I'm off. 
 - Bye.

470
00:33:56,525 --> 00:33:57,695
Stop drinking.

471
00:33:57,695 --> 00:33:59,265
Bye.

472
00:34:14,365 --> 00:34:16,715
Come on. Old Lin, hurry up.

473
00:34:16,715 --> 00:34:19,985
The Germans are eagerly waiting for us.

474
00:34:22,045 --> 00:34:24,525
Are you so eager to leave?

475
00:34:24,525 --> 00:34:28,135
Don't you have anything that keeps you here?

476
00:34:31,595 --> 00:34:33,075
That's none of your business.

477
00:34:33,075 --> 00:34:34,885
Anyway, you do.

478
00:34:38,005 --> 00:34:39,705
Hurry up.

479
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,345
I can't bear to leave our campus.

480
00:34:44,345 --> 00:34:48,345
How about this? Let's get some gifts to take with us.

481
00:34:48,345 --> 00:34:50,275
Gifts?

482
00:34:52,015 --> 00:34:53,725
Gifts.

483
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,535
Sure. I'll check the store on campus.

484
00:34:57,535 --> 00:34:59,925
Good idea. Go ahead.

485
00:34:59,925 --> 00:35:02,565
Be careful. Get something nice.

486
00:35:03,805 --> 00:35:05,405
Hurry up and load these.

487
00:35:05,405 --> 00:35:07,205
Got it.

488
00:35:08,945 --> 00:35:10,675
Go ahead.

489
00:35:11,965 --> 00:35:14,595
Why is he acting strange today?

490
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:25,490
   

491
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,520
   

492
00:36:05,715 --> 00:36:07,905
Where's Senior Brother Lin?

493
00:36:07,905 --> 00:36:09,455
He left.

494
00:36:09,455 --> 00:36:10,655
He left?

495
00:36:10,655 --> 00:36:12,555
Yeah. He has a flight this afternoon.

496
00:36:12,555 --> 00:36:14,855
So he didn't come to the lab today.

497
00:36:15,885 --> 00:36:17,885
Grandmaster left without a word

498
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:20,345
or anything to remember him with.

499
00:36:23,155 --> 00:36:25,595
Isn't this his hard drive?

500
00:36:25,595 --> 00:36:27,755
Tidy things up. I'll deliver it.

501
00:36:27,755 --> 00:36:29,605
Gu Xuejiao.

502
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:34,130
   

503
00:36:40,885 --> 00:36:43,975
 What made you change your mind and come to my rescue? 

504
00:36:43,975 --> 00:36:45,365
 I couldn't bear it. 

505
00:36:45,365 --> 00:36:50,735
 Those who have a big goal and are pushing forward towards it have a greater chance of success. 

506
00:36:50,735 --> 00:36:53,305
 So, I don't think it's laughable. 

507
00:37:06,405 --> 00:37:08,665
 You got it. 

508
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:19,710
   

509
00:37:22,235 --> 00:37:24,015
All right. I'm done.

510
00:37:24,015 --> 00:37:25,885
Happy now? Let's go.

511
00:37:25,885 --> 00:37:27,485
What did you buy? Let me see.

512
00:37:27,485 --> 00:37:28,785
T-shirts and school emblems.

513
00:37:28,785 --> 00:37:30,275
I bought everything.

514
00:37:30,275 --> 00:37:32,655
Good. Let me see.

515
00:37:33,845 --> 00:37:35,555
A raccoon doll.

516
00:37:35,555 --> 00:37:37,705
T-shirts.

517
00:37:37,705 --> 00:37:39,075
And pink dolls.

518
00:37:39,075 --> 00:37:40,195
That's enough.

519
00:37:40,195 --> 00:37:41,225
I've bought everything.

520
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:42,965
If it's really not enough,

521
00:37:42,965 --> 00:37:45,445
we'll ask the guys at the lab to buy more and send them to us.

522
00:37:45,445 --> 00:37:47,195
Let's get going.

523
00:37:47,195 --> 00:37:48,905
Senior Brother Lin.

524
00:37:51,485 --> 00:37:54,055
- Get in the car. 
 - Lin Zhihua.

525
00:38:00,525 --> 00:38:02,275
Why did you come?

526
00:38:02,275 --> 00:38:03,525
Senior Brother Lin.

527
00:38:03,525 --> 00:38:05,605
Last night, I...

528
00:38:08,115 --> 00:38:10,225
 Lin Zhihua. 

529
00:38:12,805 --> 00:38:16,705
 You're much cuter this time. 

530
00:38:21,155 --> 00:38:23,175
Did you sleep well last night?

531
00:38:26,635 --> 00:38:31,425
Last night, did I say anything weird?

532
00:38:35,755 --> 00:38:37,235
I drank too much last night.

533
00:38:37,235 --> 00:38:40,015
If I said something that sounded unbelievable to you,

534
00:38:40,015 --> 00:38:43,325
- please don't... 
 - About the linear function code, right?

535
00:38:46,755 --> 00:38:49,415
Yeah. We talked about that.

536
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:01,345
I also got drunk.

537
00:39:01,345 --> 00:39:03,405
That's all I remember.

538
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:09,505
It looks like you found a way to break the process deadlock.

539
00:39:09,505 --> 00:39:11,035
No.

540
00:39:13,365 --> 00:39:15,755
It's... Lin Jiadong.

541
00:39:15,755 --> 00:39:17,845
He said you forgot your hard drive.

542
00:39:17,845 --> 00:39:20,175
So I brought it to you.

543
00:39:25,015 --> 00:39:27,585
You came all the way for this?

544
00:39:33,275 --> 00:39:35,305
Thank you, Student Gu.

545
00:39:36,115 --> 00:39:38,345
This is very important to me.

546
00:39:44,445 --> 00:39:47,235
Senior Brother Lin, take care.

547
00:39:49,405 --> 00:39:52,055
I have to go. Go back.

548
00:39:57,845 --> 00:39:59,285
Bye-bye.

549
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,860
 He must be landing soon. 

550
00:40:53,925 --> 00:40:54,905
 Senior Brother Lin. 

551
00:40:54,905 --> 00:40:58,405
 About that secret I mentioned, don't take it seriously. 

552
00:41:03,275 --> 00:41:04,345
 No. 

553
00:41:04,345 --> 00:41:06,825
 What if I didn't tell him? 

554
00:41:15,235 --> 00:41:17,575
 Senior Brother Lin, how was your trip?  

555
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,745
 Let me know once you land. 

556
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,805
 Pretentious greetings. 

557
00:41:24,805 --> 00:41:27,465
 It would be obvious that I'm feeling guilty. 

558
00:41:34,045 --> 00:41:35,675
Xuejiao.

559
00:41:37,555 --> 00:41:39,885
- Yeah? 
 - Have you checked the forum?

560
00:41:39,885 --> 00:41:41,755
- About your... 
 - What?

561
00:41:41,755 --> 00:41:43,635
 My rebirth. 

562
00:41:43,635 --> 00:41:45,675
Everyone knows?

563
00:41:47,925 --> 00:41:49,535
Oh no. Who'd believe that?

564
00:41:49,535 --> 00:41:51,635
They'll think I'm crazy.

565
00:41:52,755 --> 00:41:55,195
- I... 
 - It's not about you.

566
00:41:55,195 --> 00:41:58,375
It's about your high school classmate working in the canteen.

567
00:41:59,005 --> 00:42:01,095
She's serving a new type of bubble tea.

568
00:42:01,095 --> 00:42:03,285
Let's try it tomorrow.

569
00:42:05,595 --> 00:42:07,235
That's it?

570
00:42:07,235 --> 00:42:09,135
You scared me.

571
00:42:09,135 --> 00:42:10,485
Okay, let's try it tomorrow.

572
00:42:10,485 --> 00:42:11,715
So it's a deal.

573
00:42:11,715 --> 00:42:13,925
They say it's amazing.

574
00:42:15,705 --> 00:42:17,455
Good night.

575
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:56,000
