1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Try to grow the flowers in the spring and summer

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now tell the truth about life

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's not complicated to count the flowers

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The youth is swaying

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We are getting stronger

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My heart is still hot and boiling

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Follow the rhythm and release it gently

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The night wind is lighting up the way for me to go

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will fly with you bravely

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My love is still burning

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Shining in the smile

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let us cross the barrier of time

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 2

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Thanks

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Try our new product

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yantian

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You are so easygoing

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
How do you know that I have a lot of sugar in my brain?

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You have already been a public engineer

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Why are you still so hardworking?

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I can't do it

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Everyone is a god

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
People like me can't even get enough points

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I want to enter a lab

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But I was kicked out by the general manager

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I have to think of a way

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
No driver

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Isn't this driver Li's lab?

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What can't you get in?

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Let Li open the back door for you

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Now everyone thinks I'm not good at it

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If I force Li Zhihua to put me in at this time

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
She will look down on me

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And the general manager will always bully me

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't want to be the kind of person I look down on

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Ok

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Keep going

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I will put more sugar in your milk tea next time

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Come on

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Come on

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Bye bye

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Come on

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I can't say it again

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Don't be sad if you fail again

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm so lazy that I have no secret

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Just embrace it

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Thank you

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I heard from Tiantian

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You have been a public engineer

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I came to give you a tip

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Thank you

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You drink it yourself

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Where are you going?

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
To the library

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'll give you a ride

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You don't have to give me a ride

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Give you a ride, go go go

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What did you learn today?

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Let me see

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
No need to send it

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You go back quickly

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I can't even sit on a bus later

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's okay, I actually drove here

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You are here

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Ask quickly

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Ask if I can take you to the wind

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Ask quickly

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Ask quickly

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Be careful of the traffic jam

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's impossible

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Why are you still honest?

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Xue Jiao, I'll find you here later

74
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Programming language

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Not only can you compile software programs

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Even when using

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Software such as database

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
In order to facilitate our work

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You can also compile small programs by yourself

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Support work

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Next, I will show you

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Common database support program

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What's wrong?

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Why is this program with a computer virus?

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This virus is too unusual

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Can you finish Professor Tan's class?

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Professor Tan played a pair of

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Professor Tan played for a lifetime

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The result was eliminated by you

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Which class has a solution

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This is what Ling Zhihua said

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Specialized in new programming topics

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Isn't this

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This is the so-called virus that is compiled into textbooks

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It originated from a high school programming practice

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Entry test

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But in the past ten years, only one person has solved it

98
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Finally, someone has announced its solution this year

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Next, I will explain to you

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Its solution and process

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
wrong

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's on the basis of my last virus

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Updated

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But the underlying logic is still the same

105
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Change the underlying call value of the software

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Let the software collapse in the bug

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I think you shouldn't waste your energy

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Right

109
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What are you doing?

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
This is not the end

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Professor Tan

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Can i use your computer

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
he

114
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What did he write

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
what

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But this is just a little

117
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
A little bit.

118
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,760
I guess this virus

119
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,760
added a piece of data to the database.

120
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,400
It caused the memory to be leaked

121
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,760
and caused the database to collapse.

122
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,760
You're so logical.

123
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,240
This virus

124
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,120
should only start

125
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,920
under specific data.

126
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,560
After understanding this logic,

127
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,200
we will get a algorithm.

128
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,320
The permission data of the system table

129
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,960
is prohibited from being updated and updated.

130
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,840
Avoid the condition of the malicious program.

131
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,640
Professor Tan,

132
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,120
I won't disturb your class.

133
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,000
After class,

134
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,040
I'll scan the computer

135
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,840
with the Sado software.

136
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,520
Good.

137
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,480
I...

138
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,680
I'll keep my book.

139
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,880
Sorry.

140
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,000
Class, let's continue.

141
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,360
Fandao 181.

142
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
Oh my god.

143
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,120
After class,

144
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,320
can you ask the computer

145
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,080
to let me have a look?

146
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,000
This is all

147
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,520
the data of the database.

148
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,880
You can go back and have a look.

149
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,600
Okay.

150
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,640
That's all for today.

151
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,440
Let's go.

152
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:50,960
Okay.

153
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,680
Remember to bring your homework next time.

154
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,680
Okay.

155
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,760
I know.

156
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,880
You're worried about sleep, right?

157
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,560
I know.

158
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,960
Goodbye, professor.

159
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,680
Goodbye.

160
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,520
Are you interested in being my class representative?

161
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,240
Is this a reward for me?

162
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,520
Being a class representative,

163
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,560
you can get a few points

164
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,160
in your daily grades.

165
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,880
Can I get another reward?

166
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,600
Go ahead.

167
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,520
I want to go to your lab class.

168
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,880
Good.

169
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,160
You're brave.

170
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,840
You're the first to test my skills.

171
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,040
You even broke my virus program

172
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,760
and got points.

173
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,440
I think

174
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,800
there's only one person.

175
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,040
Are you testing your junior again?

176
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,720
How many grades did you get?

177
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,520
You failed me

178
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,600
when I was the first.

179
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,800
The safety of the programming environment

180
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,080
is your must-have course.

181
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,160
I'm discovering their potential.

182
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,320
You're upgrading the virus.

183
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,400
You broke the previous virus program.

184
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,880
I'll make it harder this time.

185
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,200
It's time for your schoolminie skill learning session.

186
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:43,580
Define the

187
00:09:43,580 --> 00:10:10,660
Miss Feng's

188
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,660
But,

189
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,660
considering that you are my senior,

190
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,660
I will continue to be your

191
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,660
little colleague in the lab.

192
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,660
Please take care of me.

193
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,660
It sounds like that.

194
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,660
Welcome to my lab.

195
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,660
And,

196
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,660
maybe I'm better than you.

197
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,660
The update of the virus program

198
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,660
has been delayed.

199
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,660
I still have to solve it.

200
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,660
How do you know that the virus has been delayed?

201
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,660
You are just a doctor.

202
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,660
You have been in some professional classes.

203
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,660
I don't want to go into the lab.

204
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,660
I have to do more homework.

205
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,660
Let me see

206
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,660
where the talent of our lab is.

207
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,660
Where is my future position?

208
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,660
Don't be so careless.

209
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,660
You can't get a bonus

210
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,660
if you go into the lab.

211
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,660
How did you get in?

212
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,660
Get out. Get out. Get out.

213
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,660
Can you just enter here?

214
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,660
Hello, Senior.

215
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,660
I'm here to report

216
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,660
the artificial intelligence professional, Gu Xue Jiao.

217
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,660
I successfully selected

218
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,660
Professor Tan's programming practice class.

219
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,660
In the lab,

220
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,660
I will see you in person.

221
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,660
Please take care of me.

222
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,660
Didn't you get

223
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,660
closed by me?

224
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,660
Who made you come in?

225
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,660
Me.

226
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,660
Master.

227
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,660
I called you here because of this.

228
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,660
No one has reported

229
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,660
Professor Tan's choice of class for many years.

230
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,660
He is the only one in this class.

231
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,660
Professor Tan asked you to help him with some procedures.

232
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,660
Okay, I'll do it right away.

233
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,660
Let me tell you.

234
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,660
Our lab is mainly for wide-ranging research.

235
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,660
I don't care what kind of trick you use to get in.

236
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,660
It's not a skill to get in.

237
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,660
It's a way to get out.

238
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,660
Let me make a bet with you.

239
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,660
You can't get 99.999% of this grade.

240
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,660
It's yours.

241
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,660
I can't do it.

242
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,660
You're back.

243
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,660
It's almost autumn.

244
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,660
Why is it so hot?

245
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,660
It won't be hot for a while.

246
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,660
Okay.

247
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,660
Okay.

248
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,660
I'll do it naturally.

249
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,660
It's really hot these days.

250
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,660
I can't help but to pray for the tiger.

251
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,660
It will be hot when Xue Jiao comes back.

252
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,660
Xue Jiao?

253
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,660
You're so weird today.

254
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,660
Didn't you always look down on Xue Jiao?

255
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,660
I just hate stupid people.

256
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,660
But now I think

257
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,660
she's not that stupid.

258
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,660
So we can still be friends.

259
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,660
By the way,

260
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,660
when will Xue Jiao come back?

261
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,660
I also want to ask her

262
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,660
how she got the virus of Professor Tan.

263
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,660
I've been pushing her all day.

264
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,660
Shulan,

265
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,660
don't do this.

266
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,660
It's too scary.

267
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,660
Li,

268
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,660
the office of BNC is too high.

269
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,660
And,

270
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,660
Zhizhi and others

271
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,660
are actively working with us on the drug.

272
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,660
It's so sincere.

273
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,660
You're so shameless.

274
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,660
It's just a red mark.

275
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,660
Sorry, I'm late.

276
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,660
Hello.

277
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,660
Mr. Zheng.

278
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,660
This is Mr. Zheng's business card.

279
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,660
Sit down.

280
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,660
I'll go to the office.

281
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,660
Okay.

282
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,660
I'll go to the office.

283
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,660
Here's your card.

284
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,660
Sit down.

285
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,660
Lin Zhihua

286
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,660
has heard of it long ago.

287
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,660
Professor Tan's favorite student

288
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,660
started his own business in a high school.

289
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,660
He led the student team

290
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,660
to develop the C1 unmanned driving technology.

291
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,660
It's really a good chance to meet him.

292
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,660
You're overpraising me.

293
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,660
I'll make it clear.

294
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,660
We will do everything we can

295
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,660
to promote this cooperation.

296
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,660
Here.

297
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,660
Thank you.

298
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,660
This is the contract of our legal department.

299
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,660
Please have a look.

300
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,660
Oh my god.

301
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,660
It's so sincere.

302
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,660
Mr. Zheng,

303
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,660
why is the proportion of BNC

304
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,660
in this contract so low?

305
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,660
We're working with

306
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,660
more than thirty universities around the world

307
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,660
and the investment in your company is the highest.

308
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,660
But

309
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,660
the amount of funds

310
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,660
is not enough to enter the lab.

311
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,660
So

312
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,660
we invite you two

313
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,660
to work in Germany.

314
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,660
Germany?

315
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,660
Germany.

316
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,660
Germany.

317
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,660
This...

318
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,660
This is obviously empty hand.

319
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,660
It's too insincere.

320
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,660
Here.

321
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,660
How good is this!

322
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,660
The BNC is too successful.

323
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,660
We agreed

324
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:56,520
that we will reach a

325
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,340
And only for us to sign the contract.

326
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,900
This is not a starting point for cooperation.

327
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,860
This is clearly a delivery of overseas labor.

328
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,060
No, we can't sign a contract with them.

329
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,540
If we can't, I'll think of another way to find another company.

330
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,700
I don't believe it.

331
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,780
It has to be them.

332
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,220
No, we have to hurry up and cooperate.

333
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,220
Since they can suppress us,

334
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,740
we can also use them.

335
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,700
Wait.

336
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,980
Do you really think we can play with them?

337
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,180
Forget it.

338
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,700
You'll know when it's time.

339
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,780
Where are you going?

340
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,860
I'm going back to the lab.

341
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,220
Someone is waiting for me.

342
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,620
The lab has been repairing the equipment for the past few days.

343
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,420
Who is waiting for you?

344
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,420
Although our company's capacity is small,

345
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,740
we've invested for many years.

346
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,260
I have a good eye for people in this industry.

347
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,180
No matter how big the project is,

348
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,460
as long as we make money,

349
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,580
I'm willing to work hard.

350
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,620
So, the people in the industry sent me a nickname.

351
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,780
Zhao Qiansun.

352
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,540
I know it.

353
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,380
Yes.

354
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,060
Although I don't know technology,

355
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:17,020
but when I hear that BAC is cooperating with you,

356
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,100
I have to be impressed.

357
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,660
Look at you.

358
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,860
You have a good eye, Mr. Zhao.

359
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,180
By the way,

360
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,500
what are the conditions that BAC has to cooperate with you?

361
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,060
Actually, the other conditions are all temporary.

362
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,420
The most important thing is that they have a top-notch technology team.

363
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,420
The top-notch technology team of Jinhai University is still not enough.

364
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,340
Then we have to always be on the market.

365
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,140
No team can always be top-notch in one area.

366
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,460
Well said.

367
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,300
I'll buy you a car.

368
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,980
Just drive for two days.

369
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,500
Do you really think your dad's money is wasted?

370
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,460
I don't need that car.

371
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,820
And I can eat and sleep for three days.

372
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,540
It's more convenient to take a taxi.

373
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,100
Do you think I bought that car for you to make you feel comfortable?

374
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,340
That's to make you...

375
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,700
And, you know, it's weekend.

376
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,340
People go to play with their classmates.

377
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,660
You let your dad take you home for two days.

378
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,860
What are you doing?

379
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,140
I'm just playing with my classmates.

380
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,980
I'm going to study abroad.

381
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,540
I can't find him in person.

382
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,460
I can only communicate with him in person.

383
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,540
Then you can only play with your male classmates.

384
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,020
You can't find a female classmate.

385
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,540
For example, that Gu or something.

386
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,420
Your Xue Jiao doesn't play with me at all.

387
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,860
He doesn't play with you. You play with him.

388
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,460
I bought you that car just to make you go out with your daughter.

389
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,540
Son, you don't know much about learning.

390
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,860
But I have to teach you about life.

391
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,020
Xue Jiao doesn't know this at all.

392
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,820
He doesn't like to play with people.

393
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,780
Then what does he like to do?

394
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,580
You can study it.

395
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,260
I've already studied it.

396
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:17,140
He likes to read books and study.

397
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,620
And he goes to the stupid lab all day.

398
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,780
This is different from your mom.

399
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,860
Your mom is willing to play with you.

400
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,140
She goes shopping and goes to the flower market.

401
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,220
She goes shopping and goes to the flower market.

402
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,940
You mean my mom is a father?

403
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,500
You said that. I didn't say that.

404
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,380
Anyway, Xue Jiao is different from other girls.

405
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,980
Yes, they are different.

406
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,460
If they are the same, we won't be so sad.

407
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,700
Forget it. I can't lose to you.

408
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,580
By the way,

409
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,220
Can I save my name there?

410
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,940
See you tomorrow.

411
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,500
See you.

412
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,060
OK.

413
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,540
Enjoy the food.

414
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,540
Have you deputy level 4 or level 6 used up?

415
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,780
Why are you talking about learning?

416
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,300
I'm in the fathers.

417
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,300
Fill up your вокруг, OK?

418
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,300
You can prepare for the fourth grade in the fourth grade.

419
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,700
But can the person who can help you study the fourth grade

420
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,700
wait until you are in the fourth grade?

421
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,700
I'm right.

422
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,200
Right.

423
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,700
For this matter, I've been too careless.

424
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,200
Dad, you're still up to something.

425
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,500
Hurry and park your car. There seems to be a book store nearby.

426
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm going to buy the fourth grade right now.

427
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,700
Slowly. Slowly.

428
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,700
Hello, Xue Jiao. Are you free?

429
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,700
Are you in a rush?

430
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,700
I've successfully improved your appearance.

431
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:08,500
I'll leave the task of improving the next generation of IQ to you, son.

432
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,500
You guys are preparing to take the fourth and sixth grade so quickly?

433
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,700
I still have things to do. I'll tell you later.

434
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,100
I want a cup of cappuccino.

435
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,300
I'll ask my colleague to make it for you.

436
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,900
I told you to get this cup.

437
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,500
This cup is not boring.

438
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,300
Why are you here?

439
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,300
Xia Er, eat more.

440
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,000
Let me take some for you.

441
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,500
Ouch.

442
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,980
You are a little fox.

443
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,140
You are cute.

444
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,780
I entered the lab this morning and you were not there.

445
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,300
I asked Gao Rui, he said you came here.

446
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,900
You quit your job very early.

447
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,660
Why you came to work?

448
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,220
When I worked here, I found that

449
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,020
it was better to think about things without thinking too much.

450
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,820
Are you thinking about BNC?

451
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,820
It's good to have a big brother in the industry like BNC.

452
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,340
Big brother in the industry and bad partner in the industry

453
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,740
are only one line.

454
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,580
Learn to grow and sell to the emperor.

455
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,860
I know you are considerate when you do things.

456
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,900
The most considerate at this stage is to sign for BNC.

457
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,260
But who is willing to be a laborer for others?

458
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,140
Not only not willing,

459
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,940
but also not to fall twice in the same place.

460
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:22,460
It's the free economy era, but there is a road to monopoly.

461
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,820
BNC not only reached the top level in technology and development,

462
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,540
but also tried to monopolize top talents like you.

463
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:34,180
Although it can limit its cost of writing,

464
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,060
it also makes you top talents

465
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,380
a screw.

466
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,260
Your own editing skills will be limited.

467
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,220
In the end, they can kick you out

468
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,940
and take the company as their own.

469
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,900
How do you know these?

470
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,180
I...

471
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,620
I...

472
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:00,260
Isn't it the kind of economic public account

473
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,260
that always says these words?

474
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,220
Did I say it wrong?

475
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,860
Not a word is bad.

476
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,940
Then what are your plans now?

477
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:26,780
Facing this kind of business that relies on monopoly,

478
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,220
we can only rely on the way of the rich to pay off the debt.

479
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,740
Yes.

480
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,140
Wait.

481
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,260
Classmate.

482
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,460
Thank you.

483
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,540
You're also a student of Jin Da, right?

484
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,100
Yes.

485
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,020
I told you to take a look. Which college are you from? I'm from Wudian College.

486
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,980
I'm...

487
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,740
Wudian College. It's next to us.

488
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,820
I'm from the inter-referencing school.

489
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,020
Inter-referencing? That's fate.

490
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:59,020
How about this? Let's add each other on WeChat. If you don't understand anything, just ask me.

491
00:24:59,020 --> 00:24:59,980
I...

492
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,820
Let me scan you.

493
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,540
Okay.

494
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,140
You just need to ask me anything.

495
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,380
You too.

496
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,460
Is this your boyfriend?

497
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,180
He...

498
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,220
Why do you care so much?

499
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,700
Dearest sun,

500
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,260
interesting surrounding scenery,

501
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,780
mysterious..

502
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,300
That is not really them.

503
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,180
None of them.

504
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,620
Since you are still happy,

505
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,740
what do you want to say?

506
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,620
What's wrong with you?

507
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,200
You are both from the same school.

508
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,260
How could you not be so crashing

509
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,040
In an Seven E Portland China duo,

510
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,340
to protect fire, roads, me and my senior

511
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,140
What do you say, senior?

512
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,880
Should be

513
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,800
a little wild

514
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:11,940
Hello?

515
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,980
I'll go there now.

516
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,860
I'll ask someone to take you to the reception room.

517
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,940
Her last name is Gao.

518
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,420
The most capable one in the lab.

519
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,140
Do you want to...

520
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,060
I have to go.

521
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,060
I have an appointment...

522
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,260
You have an appointment with a girl?

523
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,100
Why not?

524
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:40,940
I'm leaving.

525
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,540
Don't drink coffee if you have a cold.

526
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:11,140
Isn't this the goddess sister in my dream?

527
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,620
Goddess sister.

528
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,020
Goddess sister.

529
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,380
Is this the legendary dream?

530
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,180
Brother.

531
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,060
Be careful with these things.

532
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,580
Don't touch it.

533
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:27,940
OK.

534
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,620
I'm going to report this to the school leader.

535
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,380
Go.

536
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,660
This machine...

537
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,340
I have to grab the opportunity.

538
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,820
Pay attention to it.

539
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:38,900
I don't know.

540
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,900
Maybe Brother Shi wants to sell it.

541
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:44,340
Brother Shi is really good at finding things in the school.

542
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,700
Hello?

543
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,660
What?

544
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,780
President Li values my thesis.

545
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,660
President Liu wants to see me personally.

546
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,700
I'm going to criticize you, Xiao Ling.

547
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,380
We are doing scientific research.

548
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,220
We have to do research.

549
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,380
How can we have so many social activities?

550
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,740
I'm not angry.

551
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,740
I'm just telling you.

552
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,380
As an assistant,

553
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,500
you must learn to share my worries.

554
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,700
You want me to focus on research.

555
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,220
OK.

556
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:14,780
I won't say it.

557
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,340
Bye.

558
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,540
These young people now...

559
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,420
They are too annoying.

560
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,740
You are waiting for someone here?

561
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,820
Recently, the laboratory equipment has been repaired.

562
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,940
Many people have rested.

563
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,220
Who are you waiting for?

564
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,300
I'll help you find it.

565
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,380
No need.

566
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,100
I'll call myself.

567
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,020
Hello?

568
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,060
Xiao Ling?

569
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,740
I'm your sister.

570
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,620
Hello?

571
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,140
Have you finished your work?

572
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,420
You haven't forgotten about my English level 4 or 6, right?

573
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,020
I...

574
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,940
Of course I haven't forgotten.

575
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,380
When will we meet?

576
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,100
Today.

577
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,780
See you in the cafeteria later.

578
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,620
OK.

579
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,380
I'll be right there.

580
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,660
Bye.

581
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,300
Yes.

582
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,620
By the way,

583
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,220
I've passed the BNC contract for you.

584
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,780
It's a bit hard.

585
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,260
Why don't you just ask us for help?

586
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,140
I don't have that kind of plan.

587
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,020
You think your stall is not as big as BNC, right?

588
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,820
You have to do things for people with money.

589
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,580
I don't want to

590
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,100
work for them in vain.

591
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,820
You're not enough for them alone.

592
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,620
And I'm the one who has to do it.

593
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,260
Don't get along with them in the future.

594
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,420
And BNC just sent me a new contract.

595
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,980
The conditions have improved a lot.

596
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,940
But the price hasn't reached the degree of my satisfaction.

597
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,020
They changed their words?

598
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,740
This is not their style.

599
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:20,060
Once they bite, they won't let go.

600
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,540
They're so arrogant.

601
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,580
Because I've got the news,

602
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,620
Xun Lian is also stealing Xiyi.

603
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,900
Good for you, brother.

604
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,740
You've got the BNC contract.

605
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,780
Congratulations.

606
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,220
But I have other ideas now.

607
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,180
I'll take the company's call.

608
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,180
You help me to get a seat.

609
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:38,900
Okay.

610
00:30:59,100 --> 00:30:59,580
You...

611
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,300
You're not an appointment?

612
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,340
Yes.

613
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,700
Xue Qiao.

614
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,860
Kesan has found you.

615
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,780
Why are you here?

616
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:14,660
Then...

617
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,380
Then...

618
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,540
Let's eat together.

619
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,380
Xue Qiao, try this.

620
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,340
It's really delicious.

621
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:29,740
Enough.

622
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,940
Let's eat.

623
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:34,980
Try it.

624
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,580
Try it. It's delicious.

625
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,100
It's so spicy that I can't breathe.

626
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:47,940
You can't breathe?

627
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,140
Try this.

628
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,260
Spicy fried carrots.

629
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,100
It's specially made for you.

630
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:51,500
Come on.

631
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:51,940
No.

632
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:52,900
Thank you.

633
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,220
You eat it yourself.

634
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,060
Qian Ren.

635
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,420
You're really my sister.

636
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,180
Thank you.

637
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,220
You're right.

638
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,700
My girlfriend is so...

639
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,460
so considerate.

640
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,900
She cooked the dishes well,

641
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,180
bought the chopsticks well,

642
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,980
and even poured the water.

643
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,100
I have to learn from you.

644
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,260
Our Xiao Lin is really considerate.

645
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,740
She's like this to her sister.

646
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,980
She'll be more considerate

647
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,140
when she's with you.

648
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,220
She's like this to her sister.

649
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:34,980
She'll be more considerate

650
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:35,940
when she's with her girlfriend.

651
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:36,700
Right?

652
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:37,980
Yue,

653
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,380
is Brother Lin asking you out?

654
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,460
Sister?

655
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,260
Are you sure

656
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,620
I'm not her girlfriend?

657
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,260
Let me introduce myself.

658
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,100
I'm Lin Zhi Hua's cousin, Lin Zhi Yue.

659
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,020
You're

660
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,060
Xue Qiao's boyfriend?

661
00:32:59,660 --> 00:32:59,980
No.

662
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,780
No.

663
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,980
Not for now.

664
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,020
But in the future.

665
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:13,940
Eat it.

666
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,100
The dishes are cold.

667
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:18,660
Eat it.

668
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,300
You're sick. Eat less spicy food.

669
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,540
You're sick?

670
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,700
Come here.

671
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,580
The food isn't enough for you.

672
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:41,600
I kept فيting two

673
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,500
and it's al Lady primarily.

674
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,180
Do you want me

675
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:44,680
to buy some medicine for you?

676
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,660
The food is donor22

677
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,620
I've just finished buying patients' medical medicine.

678
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,620
I need to change a patient's name.

679
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,380
I...

680
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,660
Did she do the resuscitation?

681
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:55,820
Wipe your tears.

682
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,060
I can learn it.

683
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,980
He's a tough guy.

684
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:00,620
No.

685
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,220
He's so annoying.

686
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,740
He's a waste of energy.

687
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,540
Yeah.

688
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,580
He's too stubborn.

689
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,620
He's too aggressive.

690
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,580
It's unnecessary.

691
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:11,980
He's my opponent.

692
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:15,900
Brother Li.

693
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,860
Sister Yue.

694
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,340
I'll help Yi Tian to fix his English.

695
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,500
See you next time.

696
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,140
Bye.

697
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:22,940
Bye.

698
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:23,980
Give it to me.

699
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:25,900
I'll go.

700
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,740
Bye.

701
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,140
Brother.

702
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,500
You can hide it from others,

703
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,540
but not from me.

704
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,300
Go for it.

705
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,500
Li.

706
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,900
You saw my sister, right?

707
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,820
My sister?

708
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,620
You saw Ling Zhi Yue?

709
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,420
I want to know.

710
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,140
Then help me eat.

711
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,180
Why don't you go together?

712
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,700
Eat?

713
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,700
You two have eaten together?

714
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,180
I...

715
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,180
I said I'd treat you two to dinner.

716
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,700
Not a blind date.

717
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,780
What do you want?

718
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,460
If you don't say, I'll go.

719
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,300
No.

720
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:24,780
You...

721
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,100
Is your sister

722
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,460
having a boyfriend?

723
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,260
No.

724
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,980
Why do you ask?

725
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,900
You're not worried if she's not?

726
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:36,860
No.

727
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,700
In the dictionary of a strong woman,

728
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,980
there's no man.

729
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,740
What kind of dictionary is this?

730
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,980
Take it back to Chong Ying.

731
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,500
The equipment was repaired a few days ago.

732
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,940
I didn't take you to the lab.

733
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,740
Professor Tan and my master

734
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,100
are here to introduce you.

735
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,220
This is Zhao Zhao, Zhi Qiang, Wen Bo.

736
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,500
This is Xue Jiao from Xin Dong School.

737
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:04,620
Hello.

738
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,820
Hello, Brother Shi.

739
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:09,900
Our lab

740
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,260
is divided into two parts.

741
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,620
One is the smart wall-up core group

742
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,900
I'm responsible for.

743
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,100
It's the technical support

744
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,620
for C1's wall-up module.

745
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,660
The work is mainly

746
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,340
carried out in the lab.

747
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,780
The other is

748
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,300
the school's

749
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,500
joint C1 project team.

750
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,620
The work is mainly

751
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,140
carried out in the lab.

752
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:29,820
It's a pity that

753
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,260
he won't appear here again.

754
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,180
Why?

755
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,780
You don't know?

756
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,740
It seems that you're not that close to him.

757
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,060
Master is going to Germany.

758
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,100
He'll take C1 project

759
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,140
to the C headquarters of BNC

760
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,900
to continue the simulation phase of the real car.

761
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,700
What are you doing? Let's go.

762
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:52,940
Okay.

763
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:55,660
Hurry up.

764
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,620
Oh, I forgot to say.

765
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,700
Our lab

766
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,660
will provide AI language robot's

767
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,900
computing support for the school's

768
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,060
school celebration and promotion activities.

769
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:08,940
Take a look.

770
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,020
It's a lot of work.

771
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,860
This is the latest generation

772
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,700
of the new model in our lab.

773
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,620
It's equipped with high-speed DDR4 memory.

774
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,340
You'll be responsible for this machine.

775
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,900
Thank you, Brother Shi.

776
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,300
I'll be responsible for it when I operate it.

777
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,300
You'll be responsible for cleaning up the dust inside.

778
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,060
You have to clean it up everywhere.

779
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,660
You have to be careful when you clean it.

780
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,500
Like these parts,

781
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,220
the mark,

782
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,300
and these useful parameters stickers,

783
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,900
you can't damage them.

784
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,020
After you're done,

785
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,700
you'll wipe the floor of the lab again.

786
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,460
I'll come to clean it up in an hour.

787
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,300
I'll clean it up.

788
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,580
Come in.

789
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,340
Professor Han.

790
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,460
Jialin.

791
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,220
I've sent the new contract to BNC.

792
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,780
It's basically impossible to move its main condition.

793
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,180
But I tried to get some details.

794
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,180
I've read the contract.

795
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,220
The conditions given by BNC are not good.

796
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,460
Have you really decided that?

797
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,500
Okay.

798
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,700
Good.

799
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,500
Since you've decided,

800
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,580
you must have your reasons.

801
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,180
But you left so suddenly.

802
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,100
Shouldn't you stay longer

803
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,580
to say hello to your family and friends?

804
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,780
I believe many people will miss you.

805
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,420
It's almost done.

806
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,300
You can go first.

807
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,340
I'll take a rest.

808
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,140
Okay.

809
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,500
What's wrong with you recently?

810
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,100
You're learning English in a new way.

811
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,140
It's really a lot.

812
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,100
Yeah.

813
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,620
What do you know?

814
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,220
I love studying.

815
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,460
I'm a man who loves to study.

816
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,060
I'm leaving.

817
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,740
My homework is still not done.

818
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,060
Let's go.

819
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,260
Yi Tianyu.

820
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,780
Can you do it?

821
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,380
You're still writing homework in college.

822
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,340
Let's go.

823
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,180
Don't disturb my class.

824
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,180
I'll go practice.

825
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,820
I can't do it.

826
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,420
I've done it all.

827
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,700
Why is the glue not coming out?

828
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,780
Belientlyaccord blender

829
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,780
One right, one wrong,

830
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,020
half right, half wrong.

831
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,460
As long as I'm that well-raised,

832
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,580
I can make my major

833
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,500
look seniority on Facebook.

834
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,060
How smart am I?

835
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,900
On this great journey of shi chang,

836
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,420
please don't talk to Whew from now on.

837
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,420
I'm going to be a god of the inheritance.

838
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,420
I'm going to be a serious and strict officer.

839
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,420
I'm going to be a serious and strict officer.

840
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,420
You're disgusting.

841
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,420
You're disgusting.

842
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,420
What are you dressing up as?

843
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,420
I'm a cleaner.

844
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,420
You're quite like her.

845
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,420
You're a member of the University of Jinghai.

846
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,420
You're a member of the University of Jinghai.

847
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,420
You can't even invite two cleaners?

848
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,420
This is the tradition of the lab.

849
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,420
If you're nervous about the budget,

850
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,420
you can use it for free labor.

851
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,420
You're a little more honest than that

852
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,420
Chief Steward Lin.

853
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,420
He only knows how to PUA me.

854
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,420
Forget it.

855
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,420
I'm not useful to you.

856
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,420
Anyway, you have to go.

857
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,420
Why are you still full of anger

858
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,420
when you first came to the lab?

859
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,420
I'm full of anger now.

860
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,420
I just came to the lab.

861
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,420
I'm going to clean up the equipment.

862
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,420
Not just because of cleaning up the toilet.

863
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,420
Then why?

864
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,420
Are you really going to Germany?

865
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,420
You care about this?

866
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,420
Of course.

867
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,420
You...you left and no one was looking after me.

868
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,420
Just because of this?

869
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,420
I just came out.

870
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,420
No one was looking after me.

871
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,420
How sad I am.

872
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,420
Then give me a reason to stay.

873
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,420
You...

874
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,420
If you leave,

875
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,420
Professor Tan will lose a talent.

876
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,420
I feel sorry for him.

877
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,420
I'm going to the bathroom.

878
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,420
Okay.

879
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,420
The End

880
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,420
The End

881
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,420
Let fate decide

882
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:44,420
Let us give up all courage

883
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:50,420
I'm willing to travel with you through time

884
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:54,420
If you also

885
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:58,420
understand the secrets in my eyes

886
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:04,420
You will find that you are always in my heart

887
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:14,420
I try to open my hands

888
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:18,420
Because of love, I'm sure

889
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,420
I'm listening to the wind

890
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:27,420
The wind is in the big wild

891
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:32,420
There is a sound, very close

892
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:37,420
I know it must be you

893
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:51,420
I try to open my hands

894
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:56,420
Because of love, I'm sure

895
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,420
I'm listening to the wind

896
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:05,420
The wind is in the big wild

897
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:10,420
There is a sound, very close

898
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:16,420
I know it must be you
