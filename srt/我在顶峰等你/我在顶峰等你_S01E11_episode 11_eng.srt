 "Burning Tempo" - Duan Aojuan 

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,920
♫  One, two, three, four  ♫

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,625
♫  Don't be afraid of the so-called star student  ♫

5
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:29,499
♫  You are also someone else's legend  ♫

6
00:00:29,499 --> 00:00:32,224
♫  Don't hold back, grow with all your might  ♫

7
00:00:32,224 --> 00:00:35,564
♫  Midsummer's flowers  ♫

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,596
♫  Now is the time to format your life  ♫

9
00:00:40,596 --> 00:00:43,496
♫  Math and physics are not complicated  ♫

10
00:00:43,496 --> 00:00:49,015
♫  Youth is full of obstacles, but we'll slowly become stronger  ♫

11
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:54,266
♫  My heart still burns passionately  ♫

12
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:58,091
♫  Follow the tempo, set yourself free  ♫

13
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:01,783
♫  The illuminated night sky guides me to success  ♫

14
00:01:01,783 --> 00:01:05,574
♫  I'll accompany you as you bravely take flight  ♫

15
00:01:05,574 --> 00:01:09,264
♫  My love still burns passionately   ♫

16
00:01:09,264 --> 00:01:13,036
♫  Shining in the smiling eyes  ♫

17
00:01:13,036 --> 00:01:19,412
♫  Let us transcend the obstacles of time  ♫

18
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,960
   

19
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,260
   

20
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,930
Then, before classes start,

21
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,540
I should take my student ID out for a spin.

22
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,960
Just the thought makes me happy.

23
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,720
Even better, find a boyfriend to carry your shopping bags!

24
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,230
That...

25
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,420
Word of warning. For first-year girls,

26
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,520
the top three dangers are:

27
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,190
fire, theft, and boys.

28
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:04,710
Date someone you really know, like...

29
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,610
Senior Brother Lin!

30
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,660
Have you seen Senior Brother Lin since you've come to college?

31
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,830
- I... 
 - Weren't we talking about where to hang out to have some fun?

32
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,140
Why bring him up?

33
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,700
After your military training,

34
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,390
I can drive you guys around.

35
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,770
I'll drive my dad's Mercedes-Benz.

36
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,520
Oh, please. What century is this?

37
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,920
Don't do that. It's cringey.

38
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,220
Then, how about going to a bar?

39
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,370
Have you ever been to one?

40
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,700
You?

41
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,720
Neither of you have?

42
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,571
Let me tell you. This guy from JUFE's basketball team told me,

43
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:45,670
bars are crazy fun.

44
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,360
Live music, dancing, disco.

45
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,360
Can we think of something healthier?

46
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,060
Something more classy.

47
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,200
Classy?

48
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,990
How about going to a musical then?

49
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,860
The Grand Theater has a show coming up in a few days.

50
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,060
You know Hamlet?

51
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,990
♪ To be and not to be... ♪

52
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,590
If they act like you, then I'm skipping it.

53
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,010
Let's just go to the beach.

54
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,560
Sun, sand, and waves.

55
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,110
Are you some random loafer or a college student?

56
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,670
Why are you all over the place?

57
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,800
Then you tell me, what is appropriate for a college student?

58
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,540
It's my first year, too.

59
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,520
I don't know either.

60
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,710
You... do you know where Zhou Shiyun ended up going?

61
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,760
She... I heard she didn't get into UST.

62
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,540
But I don't know where she actually went.

63
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,700
I haven't been in touch with her family lately.

64
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,150
She's actually with Yi Tianyu now.

65
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,330
At JUFE (Jinghai University of Finance &amp; Economics).

66
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,170
Bad luck, right?

67
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,760
How can you say that?

68
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,100
What's unlucky about going to the same college as me?

69
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,540
Your getting into JUFE was lucky.

70
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:00,420
But Zhou Shiyun ending up there is a kind of letdown.

71
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,590
Time's up. I have to go.

72
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,860
Second-tier schools are strict about discipline.

73
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,070
Especially our school.

74
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,480
Also, if you ever want to go somewhere, call me.

75
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,580
I'll take you. See you.

76
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,080
Bye-bye.

77
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,690
   

78
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,680
Gu Xuejiao, did you lie to me?

79
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,790
I've asked so many people at JUFE,

80
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,650
but no one's seen Zhou Shiyun.

81
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,710
 Leave me alone! 

82
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,200
 I said leave me alone! 

83
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,560
 But why? 

84
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,390
 How did things just fall apart like that? 

85
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,510
 And in such an awkward way. 

86
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,760
 Do you want to hear the truth? 

87
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,980
How is it that someone you used to see every day

88
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,000
just disappeared like that?

89
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,340
Xuejiao, take a look.

90
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,860
This...

91
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,460
Push a little harder.

92
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,990
You're good!

93
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,170
Master, if Xiao Gao finds out we came to eat lunch together,

94
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,200
will he be mad?

95
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,080
Didn't he insist on checking out the freshmen at the girls' dorm?

96
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,900
- Looks good, huh? 
 - It actually does.

97
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,470
Isn't that Senior Brother Lin?

98
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,790
Lin...

99
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,960
Is there a back door?

100
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,980
No.

101
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,500
We're a bit late.

102
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,740
Want to get some stir-fry?

103
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,390
How about some dessert?

104
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,410
Master, since when do you eat dessert?

105
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,110
Welcome.

106
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,980
You work here?

107
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,563
I do. I'm a pastry apprentice now.

108
00:06:52,563 --> 00:06:55,230
Have you seen Gu Xuejiao today?

109
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,260
Gu Xuejiao?

110
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,370
No.

111
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,900
It's just me and my mentor here today.

112
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,200
I didn't ask about that.

113
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,590
I thought you were here to do a health inspection.

114
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,450
Master, which one do you want to try?

115
00:07:15,063 --> 00:07:16,623
This one.

116
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,270
¥20.

117
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,790
Thanks, you two.

118
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,030
The two of us?

119
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,120
Come again next time.

120
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,350
Grandmaster, do you want to try that one?

121
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,080
How about that stir-fry?

122
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:41,100
Xuejiao, why didn't you say hi to Senior Brother Lin?

123
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,470
Grown-up stuff, stay out of it. Just make your desserts.

124
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,880
Does he have dirt on you or something?

125
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,900
Come on, tell me.

126
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,120
What's wrong?

127
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,640
You... just do your work.

128
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,970
Why can't I know what's going on?

129
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,520
You...

130
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,320
You... if you don't tell me, I'm never making you those delicious little cakes again.

131
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,080
It's... It's nothing.

132
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,770
Really.

133
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,080
   

134
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,221
Heavens. 
    

135
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,680
School just started.

136
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,730
And you're so intense already?

137
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,860
After military training,

138
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,350
we have the entrance test coming up.

139
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,930
Let's go out and look around a little.

140
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,390
By junior year, I'll be in the school's Elite Program and study abroad.

141
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,730
I have to start preparing now.

142
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,810
Wh... What program?

143
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,590
Here. I might as well show it to all of you.

144
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,220
These are the elite overseas universities partnered with our school.

145
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,050
Limited spots.

146
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,300
I only recognize the first three. 
    

147
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,850
Those are world-famous top-tier schools.

148
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,220
Who doesn't know about them?

149
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,610
Still, I'd suggest you get familiar with the ones lower on the list, too.

150
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,010
Look at Zhao Feifei.

151
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,750
She skipped a grade and took the big exam early.

152
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,100
And then there's Si Qi.

153
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,670
She was the top scorer in the whole province.

154
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,560
Feifei, do you want to study abroad, too?

155
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,630
Actually, I'm not really happy with my current major.

156
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:00,370
I'm thinking of switching fields for grad school.

157
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,340
Go into aerospace flight control.

158
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,470
Build rockets someday.

159
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,480
Maybe become an astronaut.

160
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,280
Look at my build.

161
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,660
If I join the Space Station as a payload specialist,

162
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,740
wouldn't I be a lot lighter than everyone else?

163
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,130
Great idea.

164
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,300
No wonder you skipped a grade.

165
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,010
Si Qi.

166
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,440
What textbook are you reading?

167
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,470
Let me in on it, too.

168
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,470
This is civil service exam prep.

169
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,060
You're preparing for that this early?

170
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,100
That's just how Si Qi studies.

171
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,370
Otherwise, how could she be the top scorer?

172
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,220
That's called the Matthew Effect.

173
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,820
The better you are, the better you get.

174
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,010
The biggest highlight of your life is probably just getting into Jinghai University.

175
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,700
You want to enter the real world with only that degree?

176
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,650
 Shu Lan is right. 

177
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,650
 I barely scraped into Jinghai University. 

178
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,650
 Everyone here has a clear goal. 

179
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,100
 But me? 

180
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:59,780
 Was getting in here the endgame for me? 

181
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,630
Let's stop studying for a little while.

182
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,050
Let's break the ice.

183
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,340
   
   

184
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,235
    
 There's a bug in this code.

185
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,380
Double-check it.

186
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,610
   
   

187
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,610
   

188
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,650
Xuejiao's calling.

189
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,609
Hello?

190
00:10:38,609 --> 00:10:39,817
Hello?

191
00:10:39,817 --> 00:10:42,427
This is Gu Xuejiao.

192
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,530
What's up?

193
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:48,860
I just sent you a red packet.

194
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,987
I received it.

195
00:10:51,987 --> 00:10:57,967
So, could you return it?

196
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,890
Return it?

197
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,720
Yes, it wasn't meant for you, actually.

198
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,340
 I'm sorry. 

199
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,590
Okay.

200
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,200
I'll return it.

201
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,710
Thanks.

202
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,600
Wait.

203
00:11:21,282 --> 00:11:24,850
You said it wasn't for me. So who was it supposed to go to?

204
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,620
I...

205
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,032
Hang up. Hang up.

206
00:11:30,032 --> 00:11:33,770
Right, how could I make that mistake?

207
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,500
Gu Xuejiao, listen, once military training is over,

208
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,800
there's the placement test.

209
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,680
Quit messing around.

210
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,640
I'm so sorry to bother you. Don't forget to return it.

211
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,250
Hey!

212
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,410
It's not even a holiday.

213
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,090
Why did she send a red packet?

214
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,370
Hurry up.

215
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,630
The clock is ticking.

216
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,280
Xuejiao just started college, and here you are,

217
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,270
acting like a teacher with me.

218
00:12:13,756 --> 00:12:15,956
You haven't seen her either?

219
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,590
 Why have you been avoiding me lately? 

220
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,640
 I haven't. 

221
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,680
 I really haven't. 

222
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,110
 I'm still adjusting to the new environment. 

223
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,540
 I'll be fine in a little while. 

224
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,680
She just got here.

225
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,370
She's still adjusting.

226
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,040
 As long as you live long enough, the tables will turn. 

227
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,370
 I wish you a long life. 

228
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,969
   

229
00:12:59,969 --> 00:13:01,040
 Mr. Lin, 

230
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,830
 I know a lot of top firms have made you offers. 

231
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:09,510
 But we're coming to you with 110% passion and sincerity. 

232
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:13,590
 So, we really hope you'll give this some serious thought. 

233
00:13:18,568 --> 00:13:20,128
 Babe. 

234
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,502
 You came to pick me up? 

235
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:26,560
 After all, you're more important than work. 

236
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,460
 Great. Listen, let me take you to that amazing place tonight. 

237
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,510
We've been staying up for days.

238
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:39,530
Bro, look. We haven't taken a single day off since then.

239
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,800
- If we keep this up... 
  - I even gave up an offer 

240
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,140
 to become a full-time employee in my original position. 

241
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,440
 Director Lin, I truly value this opportunity. 
   

242
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,200
 Today is 5 September. 

243
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,510
   

244
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,800
Nice one, you guys.

245
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,870
Two rounds of the same insane task?

246
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,400
It's not our fault you picked it twice in a row.

247
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,800
How's that, Si Qi?

248
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,530
Thrilling, huh?

249
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,680
Won't he get the wrong idea?

250
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,040
Something's going on between you...

251
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,470
Stop.

252
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,350
I'm just worried he'll figure out this is a prank.

253
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,830
Next time I see him, it will be so awkward.

254
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,160
Tell us the truth.

255
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,690
Who's this Mr. "Life Is Precious"?

256
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,710
Don't try to trick me.

257
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,560
We're playing "Dare," not "Truth".

258
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,256
I'm not playing.

259
00:14:27,256 --> 00:14:30,080
Hey, Xuejiao, you were the one who suggested an icebreaker.

260
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,440
Right.

261
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,710
Can't handle the heat now?

262
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,480
That's right, I can't.

263
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,200
What are we going to do, Si Qi?

264
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,750
- Tell us! 
 - Okay.

265
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,280
I would have told you if I knew!

266
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,400
Speak up!

267
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,080
- Tell us... 
 - No!

268
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,470
At least, he was right about one thing.

269
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,910
Once military training is over, the placement test is next.

270
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,980
Some people had better start cramming now.

271
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,470
Also, for your information, between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.,

272
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,220
anything over 40 decibels is noise.

273
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,220
Plan your time wisely and don't disturb my studies.

274
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,230
Lame.

275
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,490
Let's call it a night.

276
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,970
Go to sleep.

277
00:15:26,397 --> 00:15:29,487
 That attitude totally reminds me of someone. 

278
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:31,857
 Even their sleep schedule is similar. 

279
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,270
 Didn't you just ask me if I felt nervous? 

280
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:56,157
 Honestly, the moment I saw him in the woods, 

281
00:15:56,157 --> 00:16:01,227
 I was hoping I'd keep seeing him at college. 

282
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,780
Wait, where are you going?

283
00:16:09,795 --> 00:16:11,995
Taking a walk so I don't lose my mind.

284
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:23,090
 Gu Xuejiao, come get the flag for your squad at the playground. 

285
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,040
Making me run errands this late?

286
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,800
Isn't that a little too much?

287
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,420
Is it?

288
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,110
You seemed full of energy just now.

289
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,330
Halt.

290
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,500
Why are you running away?

291
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,050
Feeling guilty?

292
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,360
Why would I?

293
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,580
You're the only one who would know why.

294
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,310
I've got the flag. I'm heading back.

295
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,600
Wait.

296
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,570
You forgot something.

297
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,020
- Happy... 
 - How did you know today was my birthday?

298
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:07,730
I saw your ID when we were checking into the hotel.

299
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,110
On the grad trip.

300
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,120
That grad trip was a total disaster.

301
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,250
Can you not bring that up?

302
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,590
So embarrassing.

303
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,640
Okay, I won't mention it.

304
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,180
 When I was 19 last time, I totally slacked off. 

305
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,500
 This time is my second shot. 

306
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,080
 I can't mess it up again. 

307
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,170
 Gu Xuejiao! 

308
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,650
   

309
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:47,130
Gu Xuejiao.

310
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,330
- Happy... 
 - Xuejiao!

311
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,940
Wait, you...

312
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,560
There's a gate.

313
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,690
Do you have to climb that?

314
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,415
Yes... Hua... Lin Zhihua!

315
00:19:05,415 --> 00:19:06,360
Lin Zhihua!

316
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,591
Bro... quick... give me a hand.

317
00:19:09,591 --> 00:19:11,750
I'm scared of heights! For real!

318
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,850
Hurry, bro.

319
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,260
Please... quick... hurry!

320
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,033
 ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ 

321
00:19:26,033 --> 00:19:29,120
 ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ 

322
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,870
 ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ 

323
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:36,950
 ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ 

324
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,830
Xuejiao, make a wish.

325
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,120
And then we can eat the cake.

326
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,340
I got you a... gift...

327
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,870
I think I left the gift in my dorm.

328
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,830
Why am I not surprised?

329
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,320
That's... not important; doesn't matter.

330
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,360
Make a wish.

331
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,120
I have to head back soon.

332
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,840
There's a dorm check.

333
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:17,520
 I wish I could stay clear of my ex soon. 

334
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,369
 I wish I could get completely over my crush soon. 

335
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,740
Xuejiao, what did you wish for?

336
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,780
I saw you glance at me.

337
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,930
Just eat, will you?

338
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:40,165
Eat the cake and shut up. You think I'd tell you what I wished for?

339
00:20:40,165 --> 00:20:42,205
If I tell you, it wouldn't work.

340
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,840
Tomorrow's the military training showcase.

341
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,820
Dorm check may be earlier.

342
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,560
And our school locks up at midnight.

343
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,510
You won't be able to get in then.

344
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,210
Xuejiao, I have to go.

345
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,590
- I'll go with you. 
 - No, no need. I'll go by myself.

346
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,700
You're an unstable element that raises security risks on campus.

347
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,300
Let's go.

348
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,690
Xuejiao, see you around.

349
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,412
Meet me at the cafeteria... tomorrow...

350
00:21:12,412 --> 00:21:14,550
Meet me there. I'll come and find you.

351
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,790
Cafeteria.

352
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,440
Bye-bye.

353
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,520
She gave me a macaroon.

354
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,280
She gave me a macaroon. Didn't give you one?

355
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,980
- I bought the cake. 
 - So what? She let me have some.

356
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,070
I ate the cake you bought.

357
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,950
Sorry, Brother Security Guard, I didn't mean to...

358
00:21:49,371 --> 00:21:51,101
You...

359
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,040
♫  I'll find you in my memories  ♫

360
00:22:09,473 --> 00:22:14,793
♫  Following every sliver of light  ♫

361
00:22:16,307 --> 00:22:21,627
♫  I'll find you in the storm  ♫

362
00:22:22,877 --> 00:22:24,877
Good thing I made it.

363
00:22:32,068 --> 00:22:33,748
Happy birthday.

364
00:22:36,075 --> 00:22:41,206
♫  Searching to the ends of the earth  ♫

365
00:22:41,206 --> 00:22:46,319
♫  Waiting for the wind to brush past  ♫

366
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:49,380
♫  As we stand together  ♫

367
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:55,620
♫  I'll be yours through every turn of time  ♫

368
00:23:05,478 --> 00:23:08,258
Slow down or you'll choke.

369
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,410
Who would've thought the class schedule could change?

370
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:14,390
I was told early this morning that I had an English class.

371
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,020
I guess this is what they call college life.

372
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,030
Good luck, Xuejiao.

373
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,600
Don't even mention it.

374
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,120
I was completely lost the moment I saw that placement test.

375
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,100
None of it was high school-level material.

376
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,970
I'm running late. I have to go.

377
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,970
- Take the milk tea. 
 - Okay.

378
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,510
Good luck! Good luck!

379
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,370
   

380
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,910
Is this the right classroom.

381
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,290
   

382
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,930
It's time for class.

383
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,860
Where is everyone?

384
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,810
   

385
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,720
Professor.

386
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:51,320
- You are... 
 - I'm here for the English class.

387
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,940
Isn't this the English class?

388
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,840
Why am I the only one here?

389
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,850
   

390
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,790
You are the only student.

391
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:04,550
Miss, freshman English is basically just for show.

392
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:09,590
Anyone who scores over 90 on the placement test can skip it.

393
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,700
- Looks like you... 
 - So,

394
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,250
I'm the only one who doesn't get to skip the class.

395
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,550
It's been years.

396
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:21,300
This is the first time I've seen anyone actually attend this class.

397
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,740
Come on. Come sit up front.

398
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,940
A lecture class has turned into a one-on-one session.

399
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,540
You lucked out.

400
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:45,473
   

401
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,279
Come on!

402
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:07,700
An early toast to our Triple-A masterpiece going live soon!

403
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,040
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

404
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,040
Team Leader, why do you look so down?

405
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,120
Right.

406
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,972
Here, have a strong one to boost...

407
00:26:21,972 --> 00:26:24,430
He doesn't drink. Have you forgotten?

408
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,420
Oh, right.

409
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,210
The project's just getting started.

410
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:30,800
That's the kind of discipline a team leader should have!

411
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,280
My bad. I shouldn't drag him here to drink.

412
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,450
I'll take a punishment shot.

413
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:38,070
Honestly, the problem is your poor arrangement.

414
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:41,180
Who wants to be stuck at an all-dude gathering?

415
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,970
Especially our leader.

416
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,990
Exactly!

417
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,730
Mingze, have a drink.

418
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,670
Zhou Shiyun?

419
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,360
Okay. Do come over later.

420
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,760
Am I drunk? Am I seeing things now?

421
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,740
Come on, this drink's just 3% alcohol.

422
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,120
That's right.

423
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,360
He's drunk.

424
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,890
Who is he looking at?

425
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,600
Mingze.

426
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,800
Does your wife know you're out here hitting on college girls?

427
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,500
Fine, just you wait.

428
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,610
What a coincidence.

429
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,360
Is it a coincidence?

430
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,930
You've been looking for me for days.

431
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,490
Now the whole school knows

432
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,040
someone's been looking for me.

433
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,360
Not so.

434
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,330
I just wanted to know which school you were in.

435
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,560
A second-tier college. Happy now?

436
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,830
I didn't mean it like that.

437
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,400
Shiyun.

438
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,700
Let's go somewhere else.

439
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,110
Shiyun.

440
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,840
Wait.

441
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,040
Wait.

442
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,490
Shiyun.

443
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,000
Wait.

444
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,490
What?

445
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,870
What are you doing in a place like this?

446
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,120
What's wrong with this place?

447
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,210
Who are you? It's none of your business.

448
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,360
- Let's go. 
 - I'm not trying to mess with your business.

449
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,852
I just... I just...

450
00:28:09,852 --> 00:28:11,360
Just what?

451
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,720
You want to say you care about me?

452
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,790
Well, thank you.

453
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,740
Even my mom doesn't care anymore.

454
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,510
You can just save it.

455
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:23,800
Shiyun.

456
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,810
I'm warning you!

457
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,450
Don't follow me.

458
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,770
   

459
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:05,170
 

460
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,370
Done.

461
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,370
   

462
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,610
Done!

463
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,380
Wait.

464
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,250
How is it full already?

465
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,280
Of course.

466
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,120
Three-credit courses are already rare.

467
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,450
Everyone's got their eyes on them.

468
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,780
Not just three-credit ones,

469
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,460
even two-credit classes are basically gone.

470
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,780
Did you guys all succeed?

471
00:29:29,372 --> 00:29:30,430
   

472
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,070
Yes.

473
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,870
No way. I even wrote a code to steal classes.

474
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,940
How could someone beat me to it?

475
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,600
That code you wrote is so amateur.

476
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,410
You think that was going to get you ahead? Save it.

477
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:46,050
Did you notice the asterisks next to the courses you chose?

478
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,260
That means it has grade pre-requisites.

479
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:51,320
With your bottom-tier placement test scores,

480
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,590
you might want to consider dancing or music.

481
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:56,380
Pick up a skill in case you become jobless.

482
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,000
   

483
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,240
   

484
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:13,820
Or just settle for a one-credit course.

485
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,730
   

486
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,110
But I need ten credits.

487
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:26,070
At this rate, I'll be patching together credits forever.

488
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:29,230
My whole semester's going to be filled with electives.

489
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,630
Autonomous Driving Lab?

490
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,940
Programming Practicum.

491
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,880
Instructor, Professor Tan Ze.

492
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,980
Don't even think about it.

493
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,450
Why not?

494
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,692
It's got high credits,

495
00:30:42,692 --> 00:30:44,952
but it's basically a swamp of electives,

496
00:30:44,952 --> 00:30:48,140
a death trap for freshmen.

497
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,690
How so?

498
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:54,650
I heard this lab is ruthless.

499
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,560
A freshman once dared to sign up for it.

500
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,420
Dude failed eight times.

501
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,550
Eight times?

502
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,620
And then he got expelled.

503
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,730
I suggest that if you value your life,

504
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,250
stay away from that course.

505
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:09,310
Anyone who survives that lab isn't human.

506
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,090
At least not normal.

507
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:20,640
Autonomous Driving Lab?

508
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,900
Isn't that...

509
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,600
Your math grades in freshman and sophomore years are okay.

510
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,170
But you're mainly good at spatial geometry.

511
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,760
For our Autonomous Driving Lab,

512
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,630
you'll need algorithmic thinking.

513
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:43,480
Your grades in probability and statistics aren't looking so great.

514
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,590
Next.

515
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:47,600
 I've re-evaluated your code. 

516
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,150
 There is a critical bug. 

517
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,540
 We planted a critical bug in her code. 

518
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:58,120
That guy's like the judge from Hades.

519
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,410
Xuejiao, good luck.

520
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:02,695
Even though I didn't sign up, I'll always cheer for you.

521
00:32:02,695 --> 00:32:04,766
He really is trouble.

522
00:32:04,766 --> 00:32:06,137
A giant lackey.

523
00:32:06,137 --> 00:32:08,117
You know him?

524
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,278
He's like the lab's chief of staff,

525
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:15,260
not a big boss, but totally acts like one.

526
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,650
Likes to oversee every little thing

527
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,830
in the organization, top to bottom.

528
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,940
Playing power games, pulling strings.

529
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,340
Every newbie gets caught in his grip.

530
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,190
You've seen right through him.

531
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:32,180
 I've taken plenty of hits because of him. 

532
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,460
Next.

533
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,090
Your turn.

534
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,700
A freshman?

535
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,120
Why are you making such a bold move?

536
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,170
Hello, Senior!

537
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:45,520
- Even though I'm just a freshman, I'm confident... 
 - Hang on.

538
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,640
Your college entrance score...

539
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,320
is by far the lowest I've ever seen.

540
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,050
How did you even get in?

541
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:54,840
 Still has that foul mouth. 

542
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,800
 Just loves to embarrass people. 

543
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,840
Well, that just means I'm lucky.

544
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,520
Sorry. Your good luck ends here.

545
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,700
Next.

546
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,040
Wait, Senior.

547
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,820
At least give me a reason.

548
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,600
Do I need a reason to reject you?

549
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,500
At Jinghai University, juniors never question seniors.

550
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,520
Since when did this rule pop up?

551
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,920
Starting tomorrow. Next.

552
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:27,310
Lin Jiadong really said that?

553
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,320
Word for word. Really.

554
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,730
That chief of staff of yours is so sarcastic, like some mean old witch.

555
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:37,540
He's got the tiniest little mind, like a pea.

556
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,791
That's kind of true.

557
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:43,930
But you barely even know him.

558
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,560
Don't jump to conclusions.

559
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,730
Give it some time.

560
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,560
 I didn't jump to conclusions at all. 

561
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,890
 I know him way too well. 

562
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,120
I am just stating facts here.

563
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,790
Besides, if this is how your lab recruits,

564
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:59,070
you'll be missing out on a lot of talents like me.

565
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:09,200
Just a few days ago, you were avoiding me.

566
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,750
Why do you want to get into our lab now?

567
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:18,090
That's because I need the credits.

568
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,020
However, I'm not going to give you any special treatment.

569
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,640
If you want to be in the lab, you have to earn it.

570
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,230
I didn't come to ask you for special treatment.

571
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:32,710
Senior Brother Lin, I've got real skills.

572
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:36,200
I didn't get into Jinghai University by luck.

573
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,120
And then, the first thing you did was bomb the English placement test

574
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,710
and become the only freshman who didn't pass.

575
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:44,970
Second, you messed up picking electives

576
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:48,620
and actually had the nerve to sign up for Professor Tan's lab.

577
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:54,230
Do you have to be that harsh?

578
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,400
Stand up.

579
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:00,330
You haven't shown even a little bit

580
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:03,370
of what a Jinghai University student is supposed to be like.

581
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:07,010
I have to wake you up a bit.

582
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,810
Start with the basics.

583
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:11,220
Don't expect to figure everything out overnight.

584
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,420
If you need the credits,

585
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:18,490
wait till someone drops a class and there's a vacancy.

586
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:21,120
The Autonomous Driving Lab, honestly,

587
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,330
is out of your league at the moment.

588
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,770
Lin Jiadong wasn't totally wrong.

589
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,420
I said I don't like that guy.

590
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,330
But he's in the lab.

591
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,120
We'll see.

592
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,200
Give it a month, tops.

593
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,200
You'll see my name on that lab roster.

594
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,770
Maybe sooner.

595
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:40,010
Tomorrow is Professor Tan's first public programming class.

596
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:42,200
He traditionally gives freshmen a problem to solve.

597
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,950
Let's see if you can make it past round one.

598
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,050
I guarantee it!

599
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,890
I'm off to prepare.

600
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:13,910
Sir, what kind of work do you do?

601
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,499
Boring.

602
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,350
Shiyun.

603
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,710
Why are you avoiding me?

604
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,290
Avoiding you?

605
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,640
I'm not. It's not like I care about you.

606
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,530
Why would I hide from you?

607
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:51,890
That's fine then.

608
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,460
You don't care about me, but I care about you.

609
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,490
In that case, say no more.

610
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,070
Let's go.

611
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:02,330
   

612
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,180
You just keep standing there.

613
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,930
Pretty girl, let me buy you a drink.

614
00:37:40,464 --> 00:37:44,287
Shiyun, did you come here just to make your mom angry?

615
00:37:44,287 --> 00:37:45,970
Of course not.

616
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:48,040
That's good.

617
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,680
Whatever you want to do, I'll do it with you.

618
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,572
- Really? 
 - Yes.

619
00:37:54,793 --> 00:37:57,084
So come on, you're in a bar.

620
00:37:57,084 --> 00:37:59,394
You have to drink.

621
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:04,882
Here.

622
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,360
I can't handle alcohol.

623
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,590
Didn't you say you'd do whatever I want to do?

624
00:38:16,402 --> 00:38:18,720
Shiyun! Come here!

625
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,050
 I'm Zhou Shiyun, from Class 1 Grade 12. 

626
00:38:30,712 --> 00:38:34,042
 You, too! Hope you never have to retake the exam! 

627
00:38:35,552 --> 00:38:37,232
 Shiyun. 

628
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:40,363
 Today, I saw a different you again. 

629
00:38:40,363 --> 00:38:43,554
 Even when drinking, you have to be the best. 

630
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:45,800
 Always out to win. 

631
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,031
 Drinking is what makes you happiest now, right? 

632
00:38:50,031 --> 00:38:51,632
 Then I'll drink with you. 

633
00:38:51,632 --> 00:38:53,742
 Be happy with you. 

634
00:38:53,742 --> 00:38:57,167
 Seeing you happy makes me happy. 

635
00:38:57,167 --> 00:38:58,528
 It's true. 

636
00:38:58,528 --> 00:38:59,920
 I'm very happy. 

637
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:07,500
♫  Who can understand your heart?  ♫

638
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:15,880
♫  Who can remember your kindness?  ♫

639
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,780

649
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,585
- Who am I? 
 - You scared me.

650
00:39:50,585 --> 00:39:53,030
Where am I? What happened to me?

651
00:39:55,272 --> 00:39:57,572
- Shiyun. 
 - Get back. Sit tight.

652
00:39:57,572 --> 00:39:59,302
Shiyun.

653
00:39:59,302 --> 00:40:00,802
Don't call my name.

654
00:40:00,802 --> 00:40:02,042
So embarrassing!

655
00:40:02,042 --> 00:40:05,822
Sorry, I embarrassed you.

656
00:40:05,822 --> 00:40:08,672
What you need to do now is sit tight, and I'll get you home.

657
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:10,222
Understand?

658
00:40:10,222 --> 00:40:12,102
You're so nice.

659
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,280
Something's wrong with you.

660
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,752
No.

661
00:40:25,752 --> 00:40:30,452
I just have a tiny little bit of an alcohol allergy.

662
00:40:30,452 --> 00:40:32,442
I meant that something's wrong with your brain.

663
00:40:32,442 --> 00:40:35,802
Do you know how hard it was dragging you out of that bar?

664
00:40:35,802 --> 00:40:37,492
If you can't handle it, don't drink.

665
00:40:37,492 --> 00:40:39,452
Why did you have to act tough?

666
00:40:39,452 --> 00:40:41,652
I didn't.

667
00:40:41,652 --> 00:40:46,192
You told me to drink, so I had to drink.

668
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,562
So you'll do whatever I tell you to do?

669
00:40:52,552 --> 00:40:54,732
What if I told you to jump off a cliff?

670
00:41:00,942 --> 00:41:03,012
Bro, come back here.

671
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,172
Unbelievable.

672
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:06,962
You really would've gone, right?

673
00:41:06,962 --> 00:41:09,329
Are you dumb?

674
00:41:09,329 --> 00:41:11,040
You're smiling.

675
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,232
You look better when you smile.

676
00:41:13,232 --> 00:41:16,592
Back in high school, you smiled all the time.

677
00:41:16,592 --> 00:41:22,342
You were so great back then. Pretty and smart.

678
00:41:23,222 --> 00:41:25,002
Queen of the school.

679
00:41:25,002 --> 00:41:27,604
No one could touch you.

680
00:41:27,604 --> 00:41:30,942
Sometimes I wish I could go back to those high school days, too.

681
00:41:30,942 --> 00:41:34,792
But there's no way I'm repeating one more year.

682
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:41,302
But that version of you... was really... really...

683
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:58,936
   

684
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,822
Why is there a trash can here?

685
00:42:02,822 --> 00:42:04,782
Perfect though.

686
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,622
Mingze?

687
00:42:18,042 --> 00:42:19,982
How much did you drink?

688
00:42:19,982 --> 00:42:21,522
How did you get so drunk?

689
00:42:21,522 --> 00:42:24,712
You... What are you even doing here this early?

690
00:42:24,712 --> 00:42:26,422
You just passed out?

691
00:42:26,422 --> 00:42:28,192
- Where's Shiyun? 
 - What Shiyun?

692
00:42:28,192 --> 00:42:30,292
Shiyun. That's all you ever know.

693
00:42:30,292 --> 00:42:32,957
You almost got hauled away like a dead body.

694
00:42:32,957 --> 00:42:35,437
Get out!

695
00:42:35,437 --> 00:42:36,822
Get out now!

696
00:42:36,822 --> 00:42:38,822
- Come on! 
 - My legs are numb.

697
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:40,272
You stink.

698
00:42:40,272 --> 00:42:43,050
- I'm going to dump you right here. 
 - Stop hitting me!

699
00:42:50,040 --> 00:43:00,000
