1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Try to grow the flowers in the summer

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now tell the truth about life

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's not complicated to count the flowers

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The youth is swaying

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We are getting stronger

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My heart is still hot and boiling

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Follow the rhythm and release it gently

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The night wind is blowing, only the fireflies are in the way

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will fly with you bravely

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My love is still hot and boiling

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The bright and bright eyes

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let us cross the barrier of time

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Gu Xiao Xiao, think about it.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Jing An University's score is more than 690 every year.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
If you don't get enough points, you have to review it.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Don't bother you here.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Xiao Xiao, your brother is right.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Your score is almost as good as the national 985.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You don't have to study at Jing An University.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Right?

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Honey, you tell him.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Leave this to me.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Do you understand?

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
In my opinion, Jing An University is a top.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's almost 50th place in the national ranking.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'll tell you first.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Anyway, you have a student.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You will have a class later.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You will have a class later.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Just eat.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I can eat your meal.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Gu Xiao Xiao hasn't replied to me for a long time.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Is he busy celebrating?

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Keep in touch.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Let me test you.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Do you know how far Jing An University is from Jing An University on the map?

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I can even walk to the end.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Why hasn't he replied to me?

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
He's so happy to know Li Da Jin.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
He wants to have a laugh.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Come here.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's like going to college.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You have to be good at many things.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Get lost.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What are you talking about?

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Don't say it.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Sun Tian Tian recommended this drama.

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's pretty good.

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You said these two people can be together.

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But why?

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Why?

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Why can't Cheng Cheng find a man and woman to play the leading role?

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Are you stupid?

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Or do you think I'm stupid?

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Of course I know the leading role will be together.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I want the bottom-level logic.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I want to know if I talk to others about this,

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
how can there be a common topic?

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Big brother.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Look.

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
They are set in heaven and earth.

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Like this hot pot and this meat.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
This one is the latest scientific research.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Like Gu Xiao Xiao.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The other one is the beautiful leading role.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What beautiful leading role?

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Basketball boy.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay.

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The youthful basketball boy.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I can't tell people that it's like you.

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The key is to practice the core thesis.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Two words.

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Love.

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Love?

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Love.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What do you mean?

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't understand.

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Please speak out.

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Okay.

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Stop eating.

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Okay.

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Tell me.

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Look.

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
They knew each other before.

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The beauty has been following the strong academic people for many years.

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The strong academic people are so unruly.

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
They are so stubborn.

92
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
They are not doing scientific research every day.

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
They are just doing it on the way.

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The beauty appears in her life every day.

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The big action of the short-term.

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The big action of the short-term.

97
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The small action of the not-short-term.

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
She is so obsessed with the sense of existence every day.

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
When she saw the world outside of scientific research,

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
she finally put it into her life.

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
How can I have the sense of existence?

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The key is to have the sense of existence.

103
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's the same as the question of the exam.

104
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Find the topic without the topic.

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Find the positive without the positive.

106
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
For example,

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
we graduate.

108
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We don't need to tutor during the vacation.

109
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Do we have time to do something else?

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Take the girls to do something they haven't done in high school.

111
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Now they can do it.

112
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It can increase the common language.

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll take her to play games.

114
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Don't do that, big brother.

115
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
She is so obsessed with playing games.

116
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
She can't get in touch with us.

117
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
She is so obsessed with playing games.

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
She is so obsessed with playing games.

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
She can't get in touch with us.

120
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't do that.

121
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You have a point.

122
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Brother, you have a point.

123
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Come on.

124
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You are so smart.

125
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Fine.

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Why didn't I think of that?

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What game are they playing?

128
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'll tell them now.

129
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What are you doing?

130
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let go.

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I didn't think about the graduation trip.

132
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Are you going?

133
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What graduation trip?

134
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I posted it in the group chat.

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Didn't you see it?

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's a graduation trip.

137
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I don't want to go.

138
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What's wrong with you?

139
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Shouldn't you be happy with your grades?

140
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You are 300 points higher than me.

141
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's a university entrance exam.

142
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Isn't it a waste to be one point worse?

143
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's just a top grade.

144
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We don't have to go to the police station.

145
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
We can go to the university.

146
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We don't have to go to the university.

147
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Let me think about it.

148
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's go to a little...

149
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Hello, are you listening?

150
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Hello?

151
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What if he doesn't answer?

152
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He hung up.

153
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
He doesn't answer.

154
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
How is that possible?

155
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Stop eating.

156
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Think of something.

157
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Okay.

158
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
There is no difficulty in the world.

159
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
As long as you are willing to give up.

160
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
How many points?

161
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Is this really allowed?

162
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:59,920
Why did you pay for my

163
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
card?

164
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Can you have fun and brain play game?

165
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Just before the one- Goo건

166
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I didn't know太山

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I really want you to go out

168
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,560
I figured it out. Look.

169
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,960
I'll show you.

170
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,920
An equals 2 minus An minus one.

171
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,920
So An plus one equals

172
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,320
2 minus An, right?

173
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,040
Let's eat.

174
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,920
Let's talk.

175
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,640
Don't get too close.

176
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,440
I'm going to bed.

177
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:46,920
I'm leaving.

178
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,520
See you.

179
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:47,960
Bye.

180
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,360
Bye.

181
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:48,840
See you.

182
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,320
What's wrong?

183
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,440
Go to bed.

184
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,480
I'm not going.

185
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,440
Lin,

186
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,200
you're going to adopt me?

187
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,320
I'm so touched.

188
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,680
Go to my room this morning.

189
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,560
You...

190
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,840
You stole the card.

191
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,640
You stole the bank card's value.

192
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:25,840
You...

193
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,480
Go eat.

194
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,920
You'll have a good interest.

195
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,800
Whatever you want.

196
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,320
Alright.

197
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,280
Room key is not included.

198
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,840
That spices isn't too strong at all.

199
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,560
I forgot.

200
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,640
Search from the Internet.

201
00:10:38,400 --> 00:11:01,640
I'll order someone else to make an appointment with

202
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,640
You can't.

203
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,480
Is it this simple?

204
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,800
But don't call it complicated.

205
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,000
No.

206
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,400
I have to call加注 to support her.

207
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,360
Good relationships are in two senses.

208
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,140
But now, I think I do have feelings for Jing Hai University.

209
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,300
I like him.

210
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,580
He may not like me.

211
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,820
You scored 136 points in the first half.

212
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,900
That's your mood.

213
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,780
You're a loser.

214
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,660
I can't get into Jinghai University.

215
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,900
I'm a loser in the first half.

216
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,420
I'm a loser in both.

217
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,940
Your score is

218
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,140
90% higher than the students in the country.

219
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,300
They heard you.

220
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,460
They'll beat you.

221
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,620
But since I've been...

222
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,500
What?

223
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,780
I've met you again.

224
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,620
I thought you're from Jinghai University.

225
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,740
I thought I'd be sorry for you

226
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,220
if I didn't get into Jinghai University.

227
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,300
Do you feel this way too?

228
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,340
Look,

229
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,140
What's down there?

230
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,260
And—

231
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:43,380
—

232
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,780
— Canadation politics

233
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,100
In 2010,

234
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,220
we entered the fourth highest profit.

235
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,620
spectacle.

236
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,620
The past few years,

237
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,620
we've been the only newspaper reporters.

238
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,620
This is the first time

239
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,620
we've been the first newspaper reporter.

240
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,620
A new policy is a new opportunity.

241
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,620
Some people take risks,

242
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,620
and some people back down.

243
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,620
You think you have no chance

244
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,620
to get into Jinghai University.

245
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,620
I think it's possible.

246
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,620
You said you'd get in earlier.

247
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,620
You're here,

248
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,620
so you should do something.

249
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,620
You stay here.

250
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,620
My mom is on the list.

251
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,620
She's on the list.

252
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,620
So you're back this year?

253
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,620
Yes.

254
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,620
Why don't you go to heaven?

255
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,620
Yes.

256
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,620
Yes, yes, yes.

257
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,620
Yes, yes, yes.

258
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,620
I'm so unlucky.

259
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,620
I want to keep a cat.

260
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,620
It can tease me and make me happy.

261
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,620
I'll keep you.

262
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,620
I'll make you a chicken.

263
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,620
Why can't I pull it?

264
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,620
This...

265
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,620
What's going on?

266
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,620
Mom,

267
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,620
there seems to be a cat

268
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,620
taking our socks away.

269
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,620
The little missile on the first floor

270
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,620
is waiting for me to catch it.

271
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,620
My mom is usually like this.

272
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,620
She's so hungry.

273
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,620
I can't wait to take a bite of it.

274
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,620
You are a good cat.

275
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,620
I want a bite, too.

276
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,620
I'll take a bite.

277
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,620
The cat is here, as expected.

278
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,620
Are you trying to poison me?

279
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,620
Gu Shuijiao,

280
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,620
you're so unfair.

281
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,620
I was the only one at home

282
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,620
after the entrance exam.

283
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,620
My parents used up

284
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,620
all their strength to beat me.

285
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,460
What are you doing here?

286
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,380
You're even carrying a computer.

287
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,620
Are you still reviewing here

288
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,980
after the college entrance examination?

289
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,780
We're talking about

290
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,300
the application for the college entrance examination.

291
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,380
Good things don't get to you.

292
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,780
Good things don't get to you.

293
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,660
What are you thinking about?

294
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,020
I was wondering why you

295
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,100
ended up in Jinghai University.

296
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,860
It turns out that you are...

297
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,780
You think I'm you?

298
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,460
We're...

299
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:37,860
Enough.

300
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,540
No need to explain.

301
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,220
I know.

302
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,340
But you two are so close.

303
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,980
You're quite in sync.

304
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,180
But speaking of that,

305
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,660
you'll get a job at Baonei School.

306
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,700
Don't worry.

307
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,100
With your glorious results of 184 points,

308
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,900
you'll definitely get a job at Baonei School

309
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,300
and get a job at the security.

310
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,380
Mr. Li,

311
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,660
just explain it.

312
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,780
What's there to explain?

313
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,820
If you still have doubts about the application,

314
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,780
come to Jinghai University

315
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,580
at 3 p.m. tomorrow.

316
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,340
I thought I had asked you out.

317
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,860
You still said you were fine.

318
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,700
What do you know?

319
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,100
It's useless.

320
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,740
They're all gone.

321
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,820
I'm curious about the new application.

322
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,780
I can order it.

323
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,940
They'll still be in the bleak corner.

324
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,460
If we fail to get the newschool application,

325
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,340
then I'll be in trouble.

326
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,380
It's...

327
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,260
Forget about it.

328
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,180

are all questions.

341
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,260
Professor Tan has a meeting tomorrow afternoon.

342
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,380
The lab is closed for one day.

343
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,180
You don't have to come.

344
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,420
That's great.

345
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,700
Then, tomorrow afternoon,

346
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,740
let's go out for a walk.

347
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,300
I have something to do tomorrow.

348
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,860
You go.

349
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,180
You have a situation.

350
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,820
I think you have a situation.

351
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,820
Is the presentation done?

352
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,380
No need to report tomorrow.

353
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,220
I can't even make it the day after tomorrow.

354
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:38,780
Okay.

355
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:44,900
Okay.

356
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,300
No.

357
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,420
Finish it quickly.

358
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,460
Let's go for supper.

359
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,500
Okay.

360
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,100
Huixi.

361
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,580
Hello?

362
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,380
Hi?

363
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:23,220
A kill or not two miei and a l�.

364
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,540
Just three.

365
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,980
You things.

366
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,100
Somebodygenommen a kill.

367
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,700
Don't leave on this side.

368
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,900
We're fighting for justice.

369
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,380
You're asking for nothing.

370
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,980
You're late. Get up.

371
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,460
Get up.

372
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,820
Aren't you going on a date?

373
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,380
What date?

374
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,900
See you at Qinghai University

375
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,460
at 3 p.m. tomorrow.

376
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,620
Can you see people in this dress?

377
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,740
It's not a date.

378
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,180
Are you really going on a date with me?

379
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,620
It's already the best way to

380
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,980
see people in a girl's dress.

381
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,380
Brother Ling,

382
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,340
your speech on the forum

383
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,020
was a bit too cool, wasn't it?

384
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,380
Did you call me here on purpose?

385
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,020
The industry is developing rapidly today.

386
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,180
There are many meetings.

387
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,740
But the forum

388
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,100
usually doesn't attend this forum.

389
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,820
But the ones in the school

390
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,140
don't know much about it.

391
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,700
As expected,

392
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,180
it's different

393
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,020
when you put on the famous Jin Da.

394
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,260
Come on.

395
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,140
Let me introduce you.

396
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,780
This is the

397
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,220
unmanned driving lab of Qinghai University.

398
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,740
Is it similar to the research lab

399
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,500
of the Xintu Group?

400
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,060
The equipment is so new.

401
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,420
The taste of history

402
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,420
is very strong.

403
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,500
Amazing.

404
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,740
So heavy.

405
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:19,780
I didn't come to you

406
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,820
to have fun.

407
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,340
I want you to be my one-day assistant.

408
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,580
One-day assistant?

409
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:27,940
Look at this lab.

410
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,900
It's so empty.

411
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,620
I can't manage it alone.

412
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,420
I helped you with your class before.

413
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,500
Now you help me

414
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,620
share a day's work.

415
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,300
It's fair.

416
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,220
Mr. Lin.

417
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,460
Do you want to use

418
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,300
the free labor

419
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,540
to be so meaningful?

420
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,180
Go.

421
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,900
According to this format,

422
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,700
make a document

423
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,020
for this book.

424
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,300
If you finish it,

425
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:07,980
it means

426
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,820
I'm a student of Jin University.

427
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,300
Let's see how you do it.

428
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,700
What does it mean?

429
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,500
It's...

430
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,220
Where did you just say?

431
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,900
Then I'll go this way.

432
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,500
Automatic driving system

433
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,980
can recognize light scores

434
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,100
through an ballots breasts radar.

435
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,580
It has two ways.

436
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,820
How do I convince it?

437
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,220
I've already shown it before.

438
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,540
Surgery

439
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,780
You should hold the bringer

440
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,580
so that I can pull you back.

441
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,840
This chair is quite ... vienencian.

442
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,100
Not a big deal.

443
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,300
And I've prepared these notes for you.

444
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,340
Gu Ming Ze is doing troubles and 맞 popularity today.

445
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,860
HisLe biraz pas貴辞.

446
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,580
I have to work extra hours today.

447
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,300
Looks like we don't need to work.

448
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,540
Didn't I ask for a professional assistant then?

449
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,460
Only you can guess.

450
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,100
If their leader

451
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,260
is the leader of PPT,

452
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,220
it's undeniable.

453
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,860
But with the progress

454
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,260
of their current research,

455
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,580
in five years,

456
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,220
in ten years,

457
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,220
they won't be able to achieve

458
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,060
the real human value.

459
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,660
It's all a myth.

460
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,860
You don't have to read it.

461
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,020
I'm sorry.

462
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,740
I'm sorry.

463
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,540
I'm sorry.

464
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,300
I'm sorry.

465
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,060
I'm sorry.

466
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:27,900
I'm sorry.

467
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,660
I'm sorry.

468
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,380
I'm sorry.

469
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,180
I'm sorry.

470
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,220
I'm not

471
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,420
against you.

472
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,260
It's just a myth.

473
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,700
Xu Jiao.

474
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,580
Have you decided

475
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,580
what major you want to study?

476
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:43,940
Not yet.

477
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,180
What about artificial intelligence?

478
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,220
What?

479
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,300
You want me to be

480
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,500
your junior?

481
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,180
Isn't that good?

482
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,100
I think

483
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,300
if you don't have

484
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,500
a major you want to study,

485
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,500
you can consider it.

486
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,340
The lab I took you to just now

487
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,780
has the most advanced

488
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,660
and professional technology

489
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,420
in the country.

490
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,260
You won't regret

491
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:12,780
anything.

492
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:16,620
Of course,

493
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,300
I'm just giving you

494
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,260
a reasonable suggestion.

495
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:20,500
Besides,

496
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,180
artificial intelligence

497
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:21,940
is a rare product.

498
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,260
Help me.

499
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:24,820
No.

500
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,420
Thank you.

501
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:25,940
No.

502
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,580
No.

503
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,220
No.

504
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:27,740
No.

505
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,340
No.

506
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:28,980
No.

507
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,620
No.

508
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,260
No.

509
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:32,980
What are you thinking about?

510
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,260
Help me.

511
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,100
What can't I help you with?

512
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,900
Brother Li.

513
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,100
Why are you here?

514
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:48,740
What a coincidence.

515
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,340
I...

516
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,540
I just dropped by.

517
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:51,740
oo

518
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:01,020
ma

519
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,300
Boss.

520
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,140
One more bottle, please.

521
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,620
When are you going to back me up?

522
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,980
may be able to get to know each other.

523
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,780
But I don't want to get to know your brother too deeply.

524
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,540
Brother Lin,

525
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,980
you are going to be a top-notch

526
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,340
science and engineering student.

527
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,660
Can you be proud of yourself?

528
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,820
Proud again?

529
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,300
Mr. Lin,

530
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,340
I didn't expect

531
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,020
you are the person

532
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,420
who knows me the best in this world.

533
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,180
What did I say?

534
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,020
You also think

535
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,780
I can be proud of myself

536
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,580
and be a top-notch, right?

537
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,340
All the top students

538
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,180
think I have a good future.

539
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,620
That's right.

540
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:08,340
I have to accept the diversity of the world.

541
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,700
Maybe ten years later,

542
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,100
I can also make a name for myself.

543
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,060
Forget it.

544
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,220
Anyway, my parents

545
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,740
won't know me in this life.

546
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,980
Just because I want to learn digital media design,

547
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,220
my dad threw my phone away.

548
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,540
Gu Xuejiao said

549
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,820
I should be a step in the blue sea of industry.

550
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,500
What?

551
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,500
Forget it. It doesn't matter anymore.

552
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,060
Anyway, Gu Xuejiao said

553
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,420
Lin Shi told you.

554
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,220
You must be right.

555
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,060
But sometimes,

556
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,540
it's also a kind of solution.

557
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,620
It's not a good thing.

558
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,500
There are things that can't be said.

559
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,260
For example, you are chasing a girl.

560
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,700
Can you tell her directly?

561
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,940
Impossible.

562
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,340
I'll chase you like this.

563
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,700
If you clap, you'll be slapped to death.

564
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,740
Is it that serious?

565
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,260
Oh my god.

566
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,140
Don't pretend to be innocent.

567
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,900
You must have more experience than me in chasing girls.

568
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,220
To be honest,

569
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,260
how many have you been in love?

570
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,420
Just tell me the number.

571
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,300
I can't take you.

572
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,260
One.

573
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,940
Ten.

574
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,380
One hundred.

575
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,500
One thousand.

576
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,460
No way.

577
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,700
You haven't been in love with anyone, have you?

578
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,860
You are a live streamer.

579
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,180
You haven't been in love with anyone.

580
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,060
Thank you.

581
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,820
I can't take this path anymore.

582
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,740
Thank you for telling me such cruel facts.

583
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,700
Cheers.

584
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,980
Do you have a crush on someone?

585
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,100
I'm not sure.

586
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,020
Not sure?

587
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,580
You are not sure?

588
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,660
If you like someone, you like her.

589
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,020
If you don't like someone, you don't like her.

590
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,100
How can you not be sure?

591
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,580
You are just a kid.

592
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,260
What do you know?

593
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,500
What do you think is like?

594
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,700
I'll give you two tickets.

595
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,780
Tomorrow,

596
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,420
take that girl to my casino.

597
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,820
I'll have a good talk with her.

598
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,660
Gu Mingze.

599
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,540
Gu Mingze.

600
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,300
I know how sorry I am.

601
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,180
How I can give you all a break.

602
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,620
Gu Mingze.

603
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,380
Come over and be friends.

604
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,020
I'm not going home.

605
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,300
I...

606
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,460
I...

607
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:49,980
You...

608
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,340
You two are a great match.

609
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:00,660
I...

610
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,900
I'll wipe it for you.

611
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,300
You're...

612
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,780
White.

613
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,100
What has happened with you?

614
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,060
Can you brush it?

615
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:46,900
I'm sorry.

616
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,500
Wait.

617
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,620
I'll do it myself.

618
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,700
Hold her.

619
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,660
Gu Mingze.

620
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,900
You always talk to me like this.

621
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,540
You're so heavy.

622
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,900
No, no, Lei Zhi Huan.

623
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:04,980
Lei Zhi Huan.

624
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:16,780
Gu Mingze.

625
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,260
Come here.

626
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:28,740
come on.

627
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:32,980
Come to ask her.

628
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,580
Give me a second!

629
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:43,980
Relax.

630
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,220
I definitely come back.

631
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,340
Come on.

632
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,260
How is it possible?

633
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,900
You sleep here.

634
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,020
You'll have to make some noise when you come back.

635
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,700
I'll call him.

636
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,380
Mom.

637
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,500
When did you come back?

638
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,700
Why didn't you tell me?

639
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,140
Why did you call me at home?

640
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,260
I just arrived.

641
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,300
I'm so sleepy.

642
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,140
Go to bed early.

643
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,380
Change your clothes.

644
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:16,740
Go to bed.

645
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,980
Mom, you go to bed early.

646
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,100
Go to bed.

647
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,540
What's so embarrassing?

648
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,700
It's not me.

649
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,700
It's you.

650
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,740
I'm not embarrassing anyone.

651
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,020
I'm just doing my job.

652
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,980
You showed up at my house at night.

653
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,700
Aren't you afraid that my mom will be scared?

654
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,140
Fine.

655
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,140
I'm leaving.

656
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:57,980
What are you doing?

657
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,060
You...

658
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,340
Can you move her back to her room?

659
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,540
I'll move her back.

660
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,580
This is your brother.

661
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,820
This is your home.

662
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,540
Go to sleep early.

663
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,540
I'm so tired.

664
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,580
I'm so tired.

665
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,820
Help me.

666
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:35,860
Your clothes are dirty.

667
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,700
Change another one.

668
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,740
Thank you.

669
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,460
I'm bored.

670
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,980
I'm going to bed.

671
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,660
Me.

672
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,620
Are you okay?

673
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,500
I shall take a sleep.

674
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,180
Thanks.

675
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,380
Anyway,

676
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,060
I'm not that kind of person.

677
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,780
I should've left.

678
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,940
Koo Wu Sa.

679
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,900
I dreamt that you were holding a woman.

680
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,500
Congratulations!

681
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,980
You've finally met your first love.

682
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,420
Fu Xuejiao.

683
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,820
I think I dreamt about you too.

684
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,020
I think you were holding a woman too.

685
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:57,980
Who?

686
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,860
Who dares to break my sister's leg?

687
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,860
I'm not going.

688
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,100
They've been working on it for so long.

689
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,220
Brother Yu,

690
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,620
keep it up!

691
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:14,620
You can make it through the zero-point breakthrough.

692
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,220
Fu Xuejiao,

693
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,860
you can't make it through.

694
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,060
If you make it through,

695
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,940
I'll break your leg.

696
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,260
I'll explain it to her tomorrow.

697
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,420
I'm leaving.

698
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,020
I'll walk you out.

699
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,260
I'm leaving.

700
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,820
Do you miss me?

701
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:01,780
No.

702
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,460
This is my first repeatedly reported cold sign.

703
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,220
A new policy is a new opportunity.

704
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,380
Some people dare to take a risk,

705
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,300
some will withdraw money.

706
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,860
I don't think you'll get a chance since you passed at Jinghai University.

707
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,080
The weather has become too cold,

708
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,660
so I'll change the jacket into Devil stitch.

709
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,380
How about

710
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,280
I blow on privilege

711
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,300
and turn into Devil stitch in a car?

712
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,180
I'm sorry.

713
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,980
No.

714
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,340
What if he doesn't even have a car?

715
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,540
What if he doesn't have a car?

716
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:40,980
Where's the baby?

717
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,860
I'll go call him.

718
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,460
Hurry up.

719
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,500
Xue Jiao.

720
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:45,860
Let's eat.

721
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,860
Mom, I'm not hungry.

722
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,660
You guys eat first.

723
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,140
You don't want to eat?

724
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:54,940
Are you hungry?

725
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,820
I'm not hungry.

726
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,060
Mom, you go ahead.

727
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,900
Mingze is a child.

728
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,100
I heard him coming back last night.

729
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,740
What is he doing now?

730
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,020
He's leaving home.

731
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,260
He left home in the morning.

732
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,020
What about at night?

733
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,540
Doesn't he have to come back to eat and sleep?

734
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,380
You're almost done.

735
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,140
How come you

736
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,700
really kicked the child out of the house?

737
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,740
This 184,

738
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,140
there's no way he's going to come back.

739
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,140
He's not going to come back.

740
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,180
Maybe we can fill in a form

741
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,060
and find him a big brick.

742
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:28,580
Right?

743
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,660
Call him quickly.

744
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,940
Ask him where he is.

745
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,940
Ask him.

746
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,620
Sorry, the number you have dialed is power off.

747
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,420
Sorry.

748
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,780
I really don't understand.

749
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,580
You said he's

750
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,740
he's so ignorant.

751
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,740
Who does he want to be with?

752
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,220
A boy.

753
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,060
Isn't that just a game?

754
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:46,780
Right?

755
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,100
Besides, Mingze is not a bad kid.

756
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,140
He's not a bad kid.

757
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:50,860
He's still playing.

758
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,140
You're protecting him.

759
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,660
You protect him when I say it.

760
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,820
You protect him when I say it.

761
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,780
When we're old

762
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,580
and can't move on the bed,

763
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,780
I'll see how you protect him.

764
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,460
He has no idea

765
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,820
about his future.

766
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,940
What future?

767
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,420
He's not learning anything every day.

768
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,780
He's a loser.

769
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,420
Let me tell you.

770
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,580
I'm going to bring him back today.

771
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,180
If I can't bring him back, I'll marry him.

772
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:08,780
Wait.

773
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,380
You're going to marry him?

774
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,900
What are you doing?

775
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,860
Don't touch his computer.

776
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,180
He's really angry when he comes back.

777
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,100
What if he really runs away from home?

778
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,380
He runs away from home.

779
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,660
When can he get into the exam?

780
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,540
Can he get into it next year?

781
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,660
Look at his performance.

782
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,220
I'm telling you.

783
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,100
He can't get into it next year.

784
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,060
I'm telling you.

785
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,340
He can't get into it

786
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,380
after he graduate from college.

787
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:27,780
No.

788
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,700
Why are you so rude?

789
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,260
Rude?

790
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,540
How many points did he get?

791
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,020
How many points?

792
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,420
He's not as tall as he is.

793
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,260
You can't spoil an educated kid.

794
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,340
You have to be on the same side with me.

795
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,500
We're not hurting him.

796
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,780
This is really helping him.

797
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,780
Dad, mom.

798
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,500
Are you going to

799
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,980
kick Gu Mingze out of the house?

800
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,660
Your dad

801
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,940
has to make your brother

802
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,100
a new person today.

803
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,940
You...

804
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,060
Dad.

805
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,620
You should leave some memories for Gu Mingze.

806
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,660
What memories?

807
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,380
Wait.

808
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:52,900
Dad.

809
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,300
Come back.

810
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:53,900
Dad.

811
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,780
Dad, mom.

812
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,740
I'm back.

813
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,340
Gu Mingze.

814
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,180
You're finally back.

815
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,620
What are you doing?

816
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,540
Why did you take my computer?

817
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,180
Gu Mingze, I'm telling you.

818
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,980
If you can get into college this year,

819
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,100
you'll be useless

820
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,740
to learn something

821
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,740
unrelated to studying.

822
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,300
How can I be useless?

823
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,140
I've spent a lot of time

824
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,420
to save up my notes.

825
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,460
What do you know?

826
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,500
Now I finally know

827
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,460
why you can't get into the exam.

828
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,620
That's the real reason.

829
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,540
Give it to me.

830
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,860
Give it to me.

831
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,740
Give it to me.

832
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,820
Give it to me.

833
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,860
Give it to me.

834
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,660
Give it to me.

835
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,060
You can't give it to me.

836
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,260
Calm down.

837
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,140
Give it to me.

838
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,260
What are you doing?

839
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,900
What are you looking at?

840
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,420
College entrance examination.

841
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,900
You only know that I'm going to college.

842
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,820
You know nothing

843
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,100
except for college entrance examination.

844
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,460
I'm not that smart

845
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,420
when it comes to studying.

846
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,620
Can't you see

847
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,860
how much time I've spent?

848
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,340
I'm not that smart.

849
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,340
I'm not that smart.

850
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,340
I'm not that smart.

851
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,340
I'm not that smart.

852
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,340
I'm not that smart.

853
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,900
I don't have attainment skills

854
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,260
to become the leading character.

855
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,340
That's the only reason.

856
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,100
I wanted to do

857
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,300
the things I wanted to do

858
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,180
and I wanted to do the things I wanted to do.

859
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,040
Dad, mom,

860
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,260
Mr. De programmes you

861
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,140
to take part in the Computer Design Competition,

862
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,580
he has beenưaningfor the competition for that long.

863
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,980
He has a 게nt Cake exceeding the standard.

864
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,100
He hasn't given up.

865
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,380
I'm not as good as Xu Jia.

866
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,980
You think I'm a useless person.

867
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,020
I can't do anything.

868
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,620
My grades are so bad.

869
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,740
It's okay if you look down on me.

870
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,300
But at least I found

871
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,780
something I like and am good at.

872
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:56,220
I hope you can praise me once.

873
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,540
At least stand in front of me and praise me.

874
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,300
Son, you're great.

875
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,380
You're the pride of your parents.

876
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,540
Is it that hard?

877
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,740
Is it that hard?

878
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,540
Mingze.

879
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,260
Son.

880
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,380
Son.

881
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,340
I know you can see it.

882
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,420
Okay?

883
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,300
Gu.

884
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,460
This is the first champion in my life.

885
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:33,100
I told you not to make a fuss.

886
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,260
Happy idea.

887
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,340
My parents agree to give Gu Mingze

888
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,180
one month off.

889
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:10,180
Indeed, everything is possible.

890
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,180
Just like what Senior Brother Li said,

891
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:15,180
if someone retreats, someone will lose.

892
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:18,180
Crab is delicious, but the key is that you dare to eat it.

893
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:22,180
Gu Xue Jiao, do you dare to do it?

894
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:42,180
Gu Xue Jiao

895
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:12,180
The Dark Room

896
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:20,180
The dark room lights up a lamp, how careful must I be

897
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:25,180
so that there won't be a empty voice

898
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:33,180
Separate memories, every line is a wrong path

899
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:38,180
We are thinking of each other

900
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:43,180
Let fate be destined

901
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:47,180
Let us give up all courage

902
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:52,180
I am willing to travel with you through time

903
00:43:53,180 --> 00:44:00,180
If you also understand the secrets in my eyes

904
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:06,180
you will find that you have always been in my heart

905
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:17,180
I try to open my arms

906
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:21,180
Because of love, I am sure

907
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,180
I am waiting for you at the top

908
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:30,180
It doesn't matter if the wind blows

909
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:35,180
There is a sound, very close

910
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:41,180
I know it must be you

911
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:47,180
I try to open my arms

912
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:52,180
Because of love, I am sure

913
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:55,180
I am waiting for you at the top

914
00:44:55,180 --> 00:45:01,180
It doesn't matter if the wind blows

915
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:06,180
There is a sound, very close

916
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:12,180
It doesn't matter if the wind blows

917
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:16,180
There is a sound, very close

918
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:21,180
I know it must be you
