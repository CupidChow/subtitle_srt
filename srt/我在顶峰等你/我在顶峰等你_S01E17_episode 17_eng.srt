♫  Don't be afraid of the so-called star student  ♫

00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,480
♫  You are also someone else's legend  ♫

6

♫  Don't hold back, grow with all your might  ♫

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,080
♫  Midsummer's flowers  ♫

8
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,600
♫  Now is the time to format your life  ♫

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,540
♫  Math and physics are not complicated  ♫

10
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:49,020
♫  Youth is full of obstacles, but we'll slowly become stronger  ♫

11
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,200
♫  My heart still burns passionately  ♫

♫  Let us transcend the obstacles of time  ♫

18
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,000
   

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,960
   

20
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:48,047
That pose doesn't look slack enough.

21
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,250
Let me show you how it's done.

22
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,060
Legs like this.

23
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,790
Yes.

24
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,765
That's the spirit. That's how you slack off right.

25
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,520
You know a lot about slack guys, huh?

26
00:02:10,335 --> 00:02:13,550
I've never driven the car,
but I've been in the back seat.

27
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,800
I kinda know the drill.

28
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,685
Yeah? Doesn't your brother act like this a lot?

29
00:02:20,762 --> 00:02:25,250
Yes. My brother likes doing this.

30
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,385
Acting like he doesn't care about anything.

31
00:02:28,385 --> 00:02:31,935
But in fact, he's just running away from reality.

32
00:03:01,205 --> 00:03:03,200
Look, he's so handsome.

33
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,965
So handsome. Hurry up. Take a photo.

34
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,115
Look.

35
00:03:13,115 --> 00:03:15,560
So handsome when he's asleep.

36
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,475
If only he were my boyfriend.

37
00:03:17,475 --> 00:03:19,495
Wake up.

38
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,500
Excuse me.

39
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,810
   

40
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,430
What's wrong, Shiyun?

41
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,170
Can you stop coming to my university?

42
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,810
It disturbs my studies.

43
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,760
Sit down.

44
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,470
How did it go?

45
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,500
Is this yours?

46
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,770
Why didn't you pass it on to him for me?

47
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,840
Because he has a girlfriend.

48
00:04:18,615 --> 00:04:21,660
But last time, it sounded like he was single.

49
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,495
Please help me. I know you're close to him.

50
00:04:24,495 --> 00:04:26,365
Please.

51
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:28,680
 I'm visiting too often. 

52
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,450
 She doesn't even get
to hang out with her schoolmates. 

53
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,145
 Gu Xue Jiao, companionship
is the earnest declaration of love? 

54
00:04:42,145 --> 00:04:45,135
 You totally misled me. 

55
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,540
Is this also a part of slacking off?

56
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,280
It's the meaningful part.

57
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,665
Young man, you are playing with fire.

58
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,120
Just like that?

59
00:06:08,855 --> 00:06:10,580
Hello, Shu Lan.

60
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,860
I sent you the brochure of the national contest.

61
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,440
Thank you so much. Love you.

62
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,680
Stop. We're not there yet.

63
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,910
Why are you studying that brochure?

64
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,545
To join the contest.

65
00:06:23,545 --> 00:06:25,625
That's it. Talk later.

66
00:06:26,495 --> 00:06:27,680
You're signing up?

67
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,200
Yeah.

68
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,460
Aren't you going to fight
a prolonged battle against the B&amp;C Motors?

69
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,005
I found a way to turn this prolonged battle
into a swift strike.

70
00:06:37,935 --> 00:06:42,044
If I win the national contest
using your patented technology,

71
00:06:42,044 --> 00:06:45,160
it will prove to all the media and experts
in the whole country

72
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,080
that the C1 technology rejected by B&amp;C Motors
is completely viable.

73
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,760
You'll sail against a gale.

74
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,465
Perfect.

75
00:06:53,465 --> 00:06:56,125
I'm a good sailor.

76
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,940
   

77
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,125
Gu Xue Jiao, you got a problem with me?

78
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:11,640
Senior Brother Lin.

79
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,025
Don't bother to explain.

80
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:17,185
I'm the team leader
of this year's national contest.

81
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:19,960
Come to me if you want to sign up for the contest.

82
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,790
Why did you go to Professor Tan?

83
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,760
You want to take my place?

84
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,985
Tell you what. Only one of us
will make it into the team.

85
00:07:25,985 --> 00:07:28,065
I'm not giving in.

86
00:07:29,805 --> 00:07:31,830
Professor Tan didn't guarantee anything.

87
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,295
He wanted us to compete
for the title of team leader.

88
00:07:35,295 --> 00:07:37,085
You...

89
00:07:37,085 --> 00:07:38,590
You're overstepping.

90
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,130
You're challenging my authority.

91
00:07:42,005 --> 00:07:45,590
Is it really so easy to arouse your insecurity?

92
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,705
Lin, your psychological resilience
requires development.

93
00:07:50,445 --> 00:07:52,880
This is a healthy competition.

94
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,200
Competition over friendship.

95
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,700
You...

96
00:07:57,495 --> 00:07:59,350
You really don't know your limits.

97
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,715
Just wait. I'll make you lose badly.

98
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:06,470
Instead of crying out,
you'd better study harder.

99
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,905
I'm going to ask Professor Tan a few questions.

100
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,665
Want to tag along?

101
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,030
You're trying to take my place?

102
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:24,035
Gu Xue Jiao, you don't stand a chance
against me with your tricks.

103
00:08:26,335 --> 00:08:30,360
   

104
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,490
Are you busy?

105
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,100
No.

106
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,300
Are you there?

107
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,310
Is it too old-fashioned?

108
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,160
Where is everyone?

109
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,830
They're training with Lin Jia Dong
for the national contest.

110
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,560
 Although we defected,
our hearts are with you. 

111
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,920
 Second that. Great disparity in strength. 

112
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,400
 I'll bring you something to eat. 

113
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,830
 I'll bring you something, too. 

114
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,480
Actions speak louder.

115
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,130
- Shu Lan.
- Don't get me wrong.

116
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,510
I haven't had the chance to leave.

117
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,960
I'm applying for the postgraduate program.

118
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,230
I don't have the time and energy for this mess.

119
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,480
Of course.

120
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,328
I also don't want
to include the word 'lose' in my dictionary

121
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:25,525
because of you.

122
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:27,145
- Bye. 
 - Shu Lan.

123
00:09:27,145 --> 00:09:28,745
Shu...

124
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,420
Brother Rui.

125
00:09:50,725 --> 00:09:53,060
 Wait. He's a first-year PhD. 

126
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,820
 He can't sign up for my category. 

127
00:09:55,825 --> 00:09:58,555
 Am I really doing it alone? 

128
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,040
Hi.

129
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,520
Is that too casual?

130
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,750
Forget it.

131
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:22,305
Come on. What does she take me for?

132
00:10:22,305 --> 00:10:24,100
As long as you take part in the contest
on behalf of your school,

133
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,740
I'll make sure that you win first place.

134
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,155
That's my dear aunt. Awesome.

135
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:39,830
Have a minute?

136
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,480
Not interested. It's boring.

137
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,990
I want to be like my idol.

138
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,870
I'll head to conquer the stars
and the vast universe.

139
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,040
I get it.

140
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,080
But it won't hinder you.

141
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,960
Your idol builds rockets and Starlink.

142
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,735
Isn't he still making cars?

143
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,935
Don't set up so many limits in life.

144
00:10:56,675 --> 00:10:59,350
 
 

145
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,550
I'm too busy.

146
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,870
These are the hiring stats
of your target government jobs

147
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,920
over the past three years.

148
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,270
A top finish in the national contest
would elevate your profile instantly.

149
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,710
You're both articulate
and strategically precise.

150
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:19,220
The professional term for my behavior
is 'selling dreams'.

151
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,345
But the dream I'm selling
is different from others.

152
00:11:21,345 --> 00:11:23,465
It will come true for sure.

153
00:11:25,255 --> 00:11:28,040
Stop. I won't join you.

154
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,440
You'd better stop trying to win me over.

155
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,800
Who said I was trying to win you over?

156
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,750
I have set up my team.

157
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,490
You are highly capable, but...

158
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,510
It's not like you're indispensable.

159
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,880
Seriously, Gu Xue Jiao?

160
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,695
They're not members of the lab.
Don't you know that they're not allowed in?

161
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,810
I have already obtained permission
from Professor Tan.

162
00:11:51,605 --> 00:11:55,800
You think you'll make it without me?

163
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,830
Our upcoming match against our rival team

164
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,830
is an intelligent cybersecurity
attack-defense battle.

165
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:02,510
We must build our firewall
before the competition kicks off.

166
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:06,280
Then we must penetrate
the opponent's firewall within 30 minutes.

167
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,735
I've dropped the firewall building specs
in our group chat.

168
00:12:09,735 --> 00:12:11,935
Why am I not in the group?

169
00:12:16,295 --> 00:12:18,110
Mark my words.

170
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,920
Without me, you don't stand a chance.

171
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:26,526
Why are you so sure
that we can win with you?

172
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:32,380
Because the word 'lose'
doesn't exist in my dictionary.

173
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,420
 

174
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,740
Well,

175
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,260
can I join you?

176
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,960
I thought only your heart was with us.

177
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,120
I just remembered

178
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,115
how well you did at the Topic Selection Meeting
in your freshman year.

179
00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:00,905
Of course, most importantly,
my heart is always with you.

180
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,470
Shouldn't a team leader
treat her members to a meal?

181
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,280
Makes sense.

182
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,470
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

183
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,825
What about me?

184
00:13:09,825 --> 00:13:11,825
Let's go.

185
00:13:32,725 --> 00:13:33,750
Hello, passenger.

186
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,800
It's a pleasure to serve you.

187
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,870
Last digit 5438?

188
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,830
Stop it.

189
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,080
Have you developed
professional habits as a chauffeur?

190
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,480
Totally.

191
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,080
Tell you what.

192
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,800
I'm always thinking about serving my passengers.

193
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,920
- Take these.
- So many bags.

194
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,320
Come on.

195
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,320
Think about it.

196
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:59,970
Since we're doing better and better,
is it time for me to take a break?

197
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,280
You can't rest.

198
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,020
Haven't you heard?
People fall sick when they are idle.

199
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,320
You have a point.

200
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
The employees make money for the boss.

201
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,920
The money is not yours
unless you spend it today.

202
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,400
Let's go. Let's keep shopping somewhere else.

203
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,985
These are not for me,
but for our daughter.

204
00:14:16,985 --> 00:14:18,585
Look.

205
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,320
The weather and season are about to change.
I rushed to buy her new clothes.

206
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,240
She hasn't been back for quite a while.

207
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,515
Exactly. It's been about three weeks.

208
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,400
Is she...

209
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,615
- Dating someone?
- With whom?

210
00:14:33,615 --> 00:14:35,155
Lin?

211
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,080
They are in the same lab,
so they're together all the time.

212
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,200
Affection grew?

213
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,510
I bumped into them downstairs the other day.

214
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,710
Right on the spot?

215
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,345
If there's nothing between them,

216
00:14:45,345 --> 00:14:47,405
- I'll eat my hat!
- Your hat wouldn't believe it!

217
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,960
Let's find her now.

218
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,035
- Go to her university.
- Let's go.

219
00:15:00,535 --> 00:15:02,110
It locks automatically.

220
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,735
- My shoe almost fell off.
- Fasten your seat belt.

221
00:15:06,485 --> 00:15:08,535
Come on. To our team.

222
00:15:08,535 --> 00:15:10,855
Cheers!

223
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,880
 

224
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,655
I have to take this. Order whatever you like.

225
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,680
Hello.

226
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,585
You're a team of five now? How's it going?

227
00:15:30,585 --> 00:15:32,355
How do you know?

228
00:15:33,205 --> 00:15:35,990
That's why Wen Bo came so coincidentally.

229
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,280
You sent him back to the lab.

230
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,830
You said that you won over two roommates

231
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,630
and would take them to the lab
to give Shu Lan a jolt.

232
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,400
Wen Bo is the only hesitant member
on Lin Jia Dong's side.

233
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,470
If he hadn't seen your team spirit
with his own eyes,

234
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,510
how could he join you?

235
00:15:53,175 --> 00:15:54,830
What an old fox.

236
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,830
I'm having hot pot.

237
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,990
Who is old?

238
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,920
Me. I'm old.

239
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,040
An old fox deserves fresh meat.

240
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,085
That's it. Talk later.

241
00:16:06,605 --> 00:16:09,410
We didn't tell Xue Jiao
we were coming to visit.

242
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,200
Isn't it inappropriate?

243
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,870
We're checking on our daughter.

244
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,035
We did nothing wrong. Why are you feeling guilty?

245
00:16:20,085 --> 00:16:21,320
Uncle, Auntie.

246
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,360
Speak properly. Play it by ear.

247
00:16:24,605 --> 00:16:25,410
Lin.

248
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,870
Lin, what a small world.

249
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,400
You are...

250
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,110
We bought something for Xue Jiao.

251
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,680
I thought her dorm building was in this direction

252
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,985
and ended up at the lab.

253
00:16:36,985 --> 00:16:39,345
She got lost.

254
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:45,015
Xue Jiao is having hot pot with her friends.

255
00:16:45,015 --> 00:16:47,655
Why didn't she invite you?

256
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,820
She...

257
00:16:51,605 --> 00:16:53,280
 I guess it didn't work out. 

258
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,295
 Keep observing. 

259
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,470
It's okay. Let's take the things to her dorm.

260
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,400
You are so busy. We can't trouble you.

261
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,680
It's okay.

262
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,425
- Give it to me.
- You're so busy.

263
00:17:03,425 --> 00:17:04,825
Okay.

264
00:17:06,575 --> 00:17:08,120
Lin.

265
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,880
Have you been busy?

266
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,480
What's that question? Of course, he's busy.

267
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,805
- Right?
- It's been fine.

268
00:17:15,485 --> 00:17:17,810
You're not busy at all?

269
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,545
Yeah. Can't you be busier?

270
00:17:23,655 --> 00:17:26,790
Auntie, are you trying to say something?

271
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,880
- Is it so obvious?
- Absolutely. Just ask him.

272
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,000
Then I'll cut to the chase.

273
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,555
Lin, do you have a girlfriend?

274
00:17:36,725 --> 00:17:41,150
Are you finding me a girlfriend?
Didn't Xue Jiao tell you?

275
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,680
About what?

276
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:48,030
I guess it's not very clear yet.

277
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,240
So you're still pursuing someone?

278
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,000
I guess.

279
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:58,680
I just feel that Xue Jiao
is quite dependent on you.

280
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,970
I'm asking you that for my daughter
because I'm worried.

281
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,490
Of course. An excellent young man like you

282
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,400
wouldn't fall for someone ordinary.

283
00:18:07,401 --> 00:18:09,481
She is extraordinary.

284
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,545
Alright. It's a huge weight off my mind.

285
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:18,660
I'm just not meant to be your mother-in-law.

286
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,720
Auntie.

287
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,100
You're meant to be.

288
00:18:28,765 --> 00:18:32,800
I'm pursuing Xue Jiao.

289
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:38,510
What...

290
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,940
You...

291
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,510
Well, Lin, go about your business.
Leave us the things.

292
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,255
No, I'm not busy. I'll walk you to the dorm.

293
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,510
No need. We can go by ourselves. Go back to work.

294
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,550
How can I do that? Let me do it.

295
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,840
I got this.

296
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,400
Hurry up.

297
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,270
Isn't Xue Jiao having hot pot? Check on her.

298
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,985
Yeah, go ahead.

299
00:19:04,985 --> 00:19:06,615
Go ahead.

300
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,910
Go ahead. Be bold.

301
00:19:10,725 --> 00:19:12,470
Then, I'm leaving.

302
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,495
Go ahead.

303
00:19:13,495 --> 00:19:15,405
Go ahead.

304
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,400
Thank you, Uncle, Auntie.

305
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,905
Don't mention it.

306
00:19:18,905 --> 00:19:21,095
Then I...

307
00:19:21,095 --> 00:19:23,480
- I'll try harder.
- Go for it.

308
00:19:26,525 --> 00:19:28,130
I knew it. You see?

309
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,200
You can rest assured, huh?

310
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,400
Our 'beast' finally found the 'beauty'.

311
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,840
What nonsense.

312
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,960
Our 'beauty' finally found a prince.

313
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,200
Yeah.

314
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,985
I knew it. You didn't even have to come.

315
00:19:41,985 --> 00:19:43,880
I had to come.

316
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,550
Otherwise, how would I
see my wonderful son-in-law?

317
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,840
Yes!

318
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,820
- Slow down.
- Hurry up.

319
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,020
- Okay...
- Hurry...

320
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,170
Lin is such a wonderful child.

321
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,995
So what pot are we having?

322
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:58,425
- Spicy.
- Tomatoes and mushrooms.

323
00:19:58,425 --> 00:20:00,510
You have three-grid pots?

324
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,270
Forget it. Let's get the dishes first.

325
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,295
Duck intestines.

326
00:20:03,295 --> 00:20:05,050
I don't eat intestines.

327
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,840
- Beef tripe. 
 - I don't eat beef tripe. Duck blood.

328
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,500
- I don't eat blood.
- I don't eat blood.

329
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,905
Forget it.

330
00:20:09,905 --> 00:20:12,500
That's enough for now.

331
00:20:13,195 --> 00:20:16,440
Should we talk about the division of labor?

332
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,821
Si Qi. Applied Electronics.

333
00:20:18,821 --> 00:20:21,330
You'll be in charge
of the application guarantee.

334
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,230
Shu Lan. Mathematics.

335
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:26,060
You'll be in charge
of encryption and decoding.

336
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,640
Fei Fei and I major in Software Engineering.

337
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,200
We'll be in charge of the offense.

338
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,582
So the defense...

339
00:20:31,582 --> 00:20:35,545
Math is the foundation of everything. I should be the offender.

340
00:20:35,545 --> 00:20:40,500
Pretty sure I beat you in Firewall
and Intrusion Detection class last semester.

341
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:45,340
But I also took that course.
Didn't I score the highest?

342
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,310
Ladies.

343
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,270
Ladies.

344
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,410
Let's talk over food.

345
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,400
We don't have three-grid pots.
How about a nine-grid one?

346
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,540
Alright.

347
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,015
I don't want to settle.

348
00:20:56,015 --> 00:20:58,045
Wait, Shu Lan.

349
00:20:58,045 --> 00:20:59,920
Wait, Fei Fei.

350
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,580
Si Qi, don't.

351
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,520
Wen Bo.

352
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:15,160
I'd better ask Lin Jia Dong if I can go back.

353
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,985
Wait, Wen Bo.

354
00:21:22,145 --> 00:21:26,000
Excuse me. Can I refund these?

355
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,860
 

356
00:21:34,575 --> 00:21:36,310
Fine, I can do it.

357
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,960
I'll eat.

358
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,390
I can help.

359
00:21:43,865 --> 00:21:45,790
You come with free Flash?

360
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:50,340
Since you dashed away,
I'm flashing to chase.

361
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,400
Your parents came to see you.

362
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,160
I told them everything.

363
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,290
About what?

364
00:22:03,335 --> 00:22:08,510
My parents came to see me.
And you told them everything?

365
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,195
I haven't told them anything yet.

366
00:22:11,195 --> 00:22:15,310
I asked you last month.
Didn't you say that you had told them?

367
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:19,550
I was being evasive and got over it
with some excuses.

368
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,450
You...

369
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:25,070
You misunderstood me...

370
00:22:31,675 --> 00:22:34,120
We've been together for so long.

371
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,090
You still won't make it public?

372
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:39,220
But I think if my parents know,

373
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:43,010
all my relatives and the whole world will know.

374
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:51,205
And I don't want our schoolmates
to think that we're having a lab romance.

375
00:22:57,525 --> 00:23:03,610
What's wrong? Don't tell me
that you're feeling insecure.

376
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,260
I don't mind.

377
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,535
It's up to you when to make it public. I'm okay.

378
00:23:08,535 --> 00:23:13,590
Anyway, I just said that I'm pursuing you,
and you haven't said yes.

379
00:23:16,045 --> 00:23:17,310
Come on.

380
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,230
You're preparing for your defense.

381
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:23,985
After you graduate, I will tell the whole world
that Dr. Lin is my boyfriend.

382
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,615
Okay?

383
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,560
Alright.

384
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,200
It's boiling. What would you like?
I'll cook it for you.

385
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,425
Beef tripe.

386
00:23:40,425 --> 00:23:41,725
Okay.

387
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:02,200
Guys, Si Qi brought us tea.

388
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,435
- Everyone gets a share.
- Thank you.

389
00:24:03,435 --> 00:24:05,470
My hometown is known for tea production.

390
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:09,170
My mom heard about the contest
and sent me a lot of this year's new tea.

391
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,780
Here, try some.

392
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:14,030
Xue Jiao, Lin has been looking out for us.

393
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,185
Should we leave him a few packs?

394
00:24:16,185 --> 00:24:19,575
Let's see if we can use the lab first.

395
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,360
I forgot to tell you.

396
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,540
The lab is ours during the day.

397
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,360
Come after 21:00 if you need to use the lab.

398
00:24:30,145 --> 00:24:31,360
Says who?

399
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,530
Someone went for hot pot when
I was applying

400
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,010
to Professor Tan for lab hours.

401
00:24:41,065 --> 00:24:42,625
Jia Dong, can I come back here?

402
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:45,135
We don't accept traitors.

403
00:24:45,135 --> 00:24:48,130
You can't even fight for the right to use the lab.

404
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,160
What do we need you for?

405
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,960
Let's go.

406
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,060
 

407
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,135
 

408
00:25:09,135 --> 00:25:10,920
 Catfish effect? 

409
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,895
 No. All these brats are catfish. 

410
00:25:25,415 --> 00:25:27,750
 Aronson effect? 

411
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:33,365
 No. The reward and punishment mechanism
couldn't have worked. 

412
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,820
 Bell effect? 

413
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,120
 Only Lin Zhi Hua can make it convincing. 

414
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,280
New product at Tiantian's Tea.

415
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,930
I have no appetite. Can I get a hug?

416
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,350
What's wrong?

417
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,620
Can't lead the team?

418
00:26:13,415 --> 00:26:17,225
I stay up late every day,
and my members are so easily agitated.

419
00:26:17,225 --> 00:26:20,495
It's impossible to lead them.

420
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:23,160
It's because I've never been a leader.

421
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,000
Come on, leader.

422
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,710
Could you teach me the secret to managing a team?

423
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:33,870
My secret is to rule with absolute power.

424
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,480
That's not useful at all.

425
00:26:42,285 --> 00:26:45,680
It's hard to manage smart people.

426
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:51,310
If you want three outstanding students
to appreciate each other and team up,

427
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,900
put them through hardships together.

428
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,860
Makes sense.

429
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:04,812
If you become a boss,

430
00:27:04,812 --> 00:27:06,815
will you manipulate your employees like this?

431
00:27:06,815 --> 00:27:09,315
It's not that easy to share hardships.

432
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,870
I can create hardships for them.

433
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,600
You're so sneaky.

434
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,460
I learned it from you.

435
00:27:20,145 --> 00:27:21,460
I'm a big fox.

436
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,480
You're a little fox.

437
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,260
 

438
00:27:42,525 --> 00:27:43,970
There's a breakthrough?

439
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:44,920
No.

440
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,900
There's a sick joke on the school forum,

441
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,750
saying that our lab is haunted at night.

442
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,310
Guess by what.

443
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,665
By what?

444
00:27:52,665 --> 00:27:54,965
Dead programmers.

445
00:28:00,202 --> 00:28:01,470
Don't you get it?

446
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,945
Dead programmers.

447
00:28:02,945 --> 00:28:05,645
He's 'cursing' us.

448
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:08,070
That's so lame.

449
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,920
If you don't mind, please be quiet.

450
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,270
You may not have noticed
that someone is working here.

451
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,185
Can't we take a break?

452
00:28:15,185 --> 00:28:16,925
Shared hardships.

453
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,630
 We do have a common opponent. 

454
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,790
 Huge breakthrough! 

455
00:28:31,275 --> 00:28:33,270
 Lin Jia Dong, I'm sorry. 

456
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:37,615
 I'm going to inspire my team
with the help of your jealousy. 

457
00:29:06,175 --> 00:29:08,680
I saw another post.

458
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,240
I can't do this anymore.

459
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,055
I stay up late every day.

460
00:29:12,055 --> 00:29:14,505
And my teammates are useless.

461
00:29:17,615 --> 00:29:18,790
Xue Jiao.

462
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,457
I really want to help you,

463
00:29:20,457 --> 00:29:23,765
but I don't get enough sleep
and end up sleepy in class.

464
00:29:23,765 --> 00:29:26,405
My attendance is in jeopardy.

465
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,815
- I'm so sleepy.
- I'm going to sleep.

466
00:29:32,815 --> 00:29:34,407
Wait.

467
00:29:34,407 --> 00:29:37,557
 Is Lin Jia Dong really going to leave me alone? 

468
00:29:42,977 --> 00:29:46,135
Power outage. Time for bed.

469
00:29:49,676 --> 00:29:51,826
Dead programmer!

470
00:29:57,655 --> 00:30:00,160
Who's doing pranks in the middle of the night?

471
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,310
Let's find out.

472
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,130
I don't see well at night. Turn on the flashlight.

473
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,065
Shu Lan, I'll go with you.

474
00:30:05,065 --> 00:30:06,845
Si Qi...

475
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:14,120
What's that?

476
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,790
What is that?

477
00:30:20,765 --> 00:30:22,270
The lab is haunted!

478
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,525
Stop looking.

479
00:30:23,525 --> 00:30:25,945
Hurry up.

480
00:30:25,945 --> 00:30:27,410
I'll protect you.

481
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,790
You were the first to run away.

482
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,505
It's not blood. What is it?

483
00:30:36,655 --> 00:30:39,550
Sodium carbonate solution turns red
with phenolphthalein solution.

484
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,260
Junior high chemistry.

485
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,610
Yeah.

486
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:47,150
Thye're quite something.
Making a huge breakthrough so soon?

487
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:08,095
- Serves you right.
- He deserves it.

488
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:11,625
So lame.

489
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:12,840
Coward.

490
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,905
Let's go.

491
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:16,335
I was scared awake.

492
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,640
 What an easy enemy. 

493
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,580
 What a waste. 

494
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,790
Professor Tan, look at my face.

495
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,360
She did this.

496
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,130
She was scared of losing
and played tricks on me.

497
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,980
Professor Tan, I didn't do anything.

498
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,960
Professor Tan, all power was down,
except for equipment electricity.

499
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,230
Even the security cameras went dark.

500
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,990
She did it to beat me up.

501
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:44,020
She had planned to eliminate the evidence.

502
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,750
 Even my high school classmates
can pull better tricks than you. 

503
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,985
There is no footage,
so I'm given the benefit of the doubt.

504
00:31:50,985 --> 00:31:53,270
Right, Professor Tan?

505
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,970
Then how did I get these wounds?

506
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:58,990
Professor, punish me if you want to.

507
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,030
You've always been
my academic role model.

508
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:04,120
I applied to this university because of you.

509
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:09,400
But honestly, I'm very disappointed
at what Lin has done.

510
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,090
What did I do?

511
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,960
Professor, I'm quitting, too.

512
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,510
I wanted to win a reward and drop out.

513
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,510
But I didn't win any rewards
and might even be punished.

514
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,520
It's not worth it.

515
00:32:24,515 --> 00:32:29,100
You kids are quite honest.

516
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:37,840
Professor, the power suddenly went out last night.

517
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,840
Lin, why did you try to scare us?

518
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,560
I was so scared.

519
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,720
It's alright, Fei Fei.

520
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,730
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

521
00:32:53,135 --> 00:32:54,700
Professor Tan.

522
00:32:54,700 --> 00:33:00,280
Professor Tan, I'll take the punishment
with all of them.

523
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,360
Gu Xuejiao.

524
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,340
Step outside first.

525
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,585
When will the meeting end?

526
00:33:43,585 --> 00:33:44,990
It's hard to say.

527
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,055
Ms. Zheng is extremely busy.

528
00:33:47,055 --> 00:33:49,475
You can leave her a message.

529
00:33:49,475 --> 00:33:51,490
What happened to your face?

530
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,736
I came here because of this.

531
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,425
Alright.

532
00:34:00,425 --> 00:34:02,275
That's it.

533
00:34:03,785 --> 00:34:04,920
Where is Jia Dong?

534
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,240
He just left.

535
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,990
I asked Jia Dong what Lin Zhi Hua has been up to.

536
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:13,000
He said he wanted...

537
00:34:15,855 --> 00:34:20,600
He is at the end of his rope
and is going for the prize money.

538
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:27,310
Okay. Let him know that
I won't even spare him this petty money.

539
00:34:29,085 --> 00:34:30,880
Isn't Jia Dong busy with the contest?

540
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,050
Why did he come here?

541
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,030
You don't need to worry about that.

542
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,050
Someone will take care of it.

543
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:58,470
I'm done. The lab is yours now.

544
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:01,210
How is your team spirit burning?

545
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,960
What a group of passionate young people.

546
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,280
Just find the ignition point,
and there is no limit.

547
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,190
Congratulations.

548
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,990
It seems that I can't have hot pot with you.

549
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,170
But I miss you very much.

550
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,320
Okay, that's it.

551
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,055
We'll work late in the lab today. Come and visit.

552
00:35:16,055 --> 00:35:17,725
Okay.

553
00:35:20,935 --> 00:35:23,670
So we're all good on who's doing what, right?

554
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,800
Let me repeat it.

555
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,575
- Shu Lan...
- Stop.

556
00:35:26,575 --> 00:35:30,125
It's about to boil.

557
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:33,400
Come on, ladies. Cheers.

558
00:35:35,775 --> 00:35:39,630
I mean, go, leaders!

559
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,150
- Come on!
- Cheers!

560
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,200
It's still raw.

561
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,360
- What did you get? Beef tripe?
- Yeah.

562
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,590
Not bad, Wen Bo. You're pretty reliable.

563
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:51,190
Having been here for so many years,
I've never known about this small path.

564
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:55,960
Rest assured, leaders.
I'll get us back to school in record time.

565
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,050
I'll give you credit first.

566
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:01,360
Shall we come up with a group name?

567
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,090
I think an ordinary and unremarkable name

568
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:06,960
will highlight our rich connotations.

569
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,920
"Am I right?"

570
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,960
Is it good?

571
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,535
You have to tell us a name first.

572
00:36:12,535 --> 00:36:14,980
'Am I Right' will be the name.

573
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,140
So not funny.

574
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:21,840
Gu Xue Jiao, what kind of members did you recruit?

575
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:27,110
We should be grateful as
long as we don't rank last.

576
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:31,470
How about 'Last-ranked Ace'?

577
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,110
- I like it.
- Me too.

578
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,290
"Last-ranked Ace."

579
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:38,110
It feels like an ant trying to shake a giant tree.

580
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,520
I like it.

581
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,695
- So that's the name.
- Okay.

582
00:36:48,335 --> 00:36:49,470
Hello.

583
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,920
Are you back?

584
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,920
We're on the way.

585
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,510
Wen Bo showed us a shortcut outside the back gate.

586
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:59,885
You know what? We almost
sorted out the code over dinner.

587
00:37:01,225 --> 00:37:02,880
I've been curious.

588
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,690
Do you have a boyfriend?

589
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:07,960
You vanish sometimes
and call him behind our backs.

590
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,525
Gu Xue Jiao, you're very fishy.

591
00:37:10,525 --> 00:37:12,525
I...

592
00:37:12,525 --> 00:37:13,980
It's my brother.

593
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,440
Ming Ze.

594
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,840
Ming Ze, can you hear me?

595
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,400
My WeChat signature
is what you said in the interview.

596
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,360
"Don't let others define your life."

597
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,065
Did you hear that? He adores you.

598
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,940
What are you doing?

599
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:44,770
Hand over everything you have.

600
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:47,000
Call the police.

601
00:37:58,335 --> 00:38:00,460
Bro, you have your gangster rules.

602
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,240
It's just for the money, right?

603
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,575
Guys, give them the money.

604
00:38:04,575 --> 00:38:06,795
Let him take it.

605
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,215
Bro, why don't you show me your QR code?

606
00:38:17,215 --> 00:38:19,385
I'll transfer money to you.

607
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,650
Are you kidding me?

608
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,870
The guy on the back.

609
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,230
Yeah, you.

610
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,900
You're carrying a laptop, huh?

611
00:38:33,735 --> 00:38:35,030
Don't even think about it.

612
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:35,990
Alright.

613
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,840
You have quite a backbone.

614
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,320
Let's see what breaks first, your bones or my bat.

615
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,670
Get them!

616
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,220
No! Don't!

617
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,295
No!

618
00:38:45,295 --> 00:38:47,325
Don't take his bag!

619
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,470
Smash it!

620
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,940
Go!

621
00:38:56,045 --> 00:38:57,970
My laptop.

622
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:58,865
You...

623
00:38:58,865 --> 00:39:01,015
Xue Jiao!

624
00:39:01,015 --> 00:39:02,760
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

625
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,470
The laptop.

626
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,670
Wait.

627
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,240
Wait.

628
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,190
What's your problem?

629
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,430
Huh?

630
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,160
   

631
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:24,700
Get him!

632
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,400
The laptop!

633
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,460
Watch out!

634
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,650
Sorry.

635
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,040
Be careful.

636
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:22,870
I dare you to come back. I know kung fu. I'll...

637
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,260
 

638
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,020
I told you I'm fine.

639
00:40:33,846 --> 00:40:36,426
How is this fine? Let me see.

640
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,800
Does it hurt?

641
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,940
Does it hurt?

642
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,055
Don't move.

643
00:40:46,055 --> 00:40:47,875
Does it hurt?

644
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:50,900
 Didn't they say they failed? 

645
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:56,505
How is your head? Is it okay?

646
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,900
Jia Dong.

647
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,840
Zhi Hua.

648
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,630
How come you're so fast?
Gao Rui hasn't arrived yet.

649
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:09,350
I was nearby, so I came fast.

650
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,340
How did you get hurt so badly?

651
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:19,300
Tell him.

652
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,630
Ask Wen Bo.

653
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:26,600
Your trousers are dirty...

654
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,470
Auntie!

655
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,670
- Auntie!
- Jia Dong.

656
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,110
Jia Dong, wait.

657
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,440
Let me in. Let me see her.

658
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,400
I'm not stopping you.
But Ms. Zheng is out for business.

659
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,770
I asked you to vent my anger.
Why did you hurt Zhi Hua?

660
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,070
No, we didn't.

661
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:44,110
Minor bruises are enough.
Why did you hurt his face?

662
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,360
We wanted to teach him a lesson.

663
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,470
Okay, calm down.

664
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,340
We just taught him a lesson.

665
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:53,960
Do you think Lin Jia Dong
asked someone to do this?

666
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,110
Let me do it.

667
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:57,600
It's okay. I got this.

668
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,400
Do you remember Ms. Zheng from B&amp;C Motors?

669
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,430
The one who tried to grope you
at the dinner meeting. Right?

670
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:08,720
She exploits the team's creativity
and damages the industry.

671
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,750
A cancer in the industry.

672
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:16,110
She is Lin Jia Dong's aunt.

673
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,370
They have such similar taste.

674
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,990
You knew about it all along.
Why are you keeping Lin Jia Dong?

675
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:30,690
Aren't you scared that he'd sell you out?

676
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:36,440
Lin Jia Dong may like to play tricks,
but I don't think he's behind this.

677
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,550
He's just easily swayed
and gets manipulated.

678
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,980
Doting on your fans, huh?

679
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:05,960
