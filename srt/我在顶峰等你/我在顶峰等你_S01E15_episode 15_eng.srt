20
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,640
Hey there. Have you seen Yi Tianyu?

21
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,160
He got hurt. He's not playing today.

22
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,350
- Thanks. 
 - No problem. Bye.

23
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,380
 Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is currently unavailable. 

24
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,330
 Please try again later. 

25
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,450
   

26
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,716
 Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is currently unavailable. 

27
00:02:32,716 --> 00:02:33,740
 Please try again later. 

28
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,880
 Sorry, the subsriber you dialed... 

29
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,170
Hey, Yi Tianyu! Where the heck are you?

30
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,390
You're not answering your phone or replying to my messages!

31
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,590
 You must be Xiao Gu, right? 

32
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,720
 I'm Tianyu's father. 

33
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,540
Uncle, sorry.

34
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,040
I-I thought it was Yi Tianyu.

35
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,980
 It's all right. 

36
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,600
You've called Tianyu so many times.

37
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,020
I thought it'd be better to call you back.

38
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,270
Maybe it's something urgent.

39
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,710
I heard he got hurt.

40
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,860
 I'm a bit worried. 

41
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,080
Is it bad?

42
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,380
   

43
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,460
You're really a decent and caring kid.

44
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,429
I knew you'd be a good daughter...

45
00:03:12,429 --> 00:03:14,180
a good kid.

46
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,610
The thing is, he already got picked by a basketball league overseas.

47
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,030
 He's gone abroad for training now. 

48
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,090
 He forgot his phone back home. 

49
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,390
So suddenly?

50
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,080
 Well, not really. 

51
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,992
 He applied a while ago 

52
00:03:29,992 --> 00:03:33,040
 but just never got the chance to tell you. 

53
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,420
That's good news then.

54
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,080
Based on what I know about Tianyu,

55
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,860
he shouldn't have been able to keep it a secret.

56
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,060
It's impressive he has kept it quiet this long.

57
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,460
He really stuck to his plan.

58
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,610
Once he's settled over there, I'll have him call you.

59
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,190
Okay.

60
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,130
Uncle,

61
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,393
it was his teammates who told me he got hurt.

62
00:03:54,393 --> 00:03:55,800
Is he okay?

63
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,050
Don't worry, it's nothing.

64
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,700
Okay. Bye, Uncle.

65
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,090
Okay, see you when I return.

66
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,170
Why did you get out of bed?

67
00:04:10,724 --> 00:04:15,234
 This time, we'll definitely all become better. 

68
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,340
   

69
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,180
   

70
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,820
Come on.

71
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:29,120
The doctor said lying down for too long will weaken the muscles.

72
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,620
Fine. It's my fault.

73
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,860
I cleaned the floor too well because I was worried you'd slip.

74
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,820
What if you can't play ball or even walk properly again?

75
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,830
What am I supposed to do?

76
00:04:43,847 --> 00:04:45,917
I'm fine.

77
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,900
Was she mad at me?

78
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,140
She was actually happy.

79
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,209
Xiao Gu heard that you're training abroad.

80
00:04:58,209 --> 00:05:01,579
She's admiring you like crazy.

81
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,790
Dad, you lied to make me look good.

82
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,130
Thanks.

83
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,160
That's nonsense.

84
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,920
You are my biggest pride.

85
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,900
Well, I've already arranged for a rehab place overseas.

86
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,040
Once you're there, listen to what the therapist says.

87
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,505
But don't rush it.

88
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,195
Stay calm. There's no rush.

89
00:05:42,195 --> 00:05:44,265
Even if you can't play ball now,

90
00:05:44,265 --> 00:05:46,535
your brain is still sharp.

91
00:05:47,235 --> 00:05:49,065
Let's train your brain well.

92
00:05:49,065 --> 00:05:51,235
No matter what, you're my son.

93
00:05:51,235 --> 00:05:55,705
When you come back, you come back strong. Got it?

94
00:05:58,575 --> 00:06:00,485
I will, Dad.

95
00:06:03,825 --> 00:06:06,885
I've got work to do. I have to go now.

96
00:06:06,885 --> 00:06:09,315
Take care of yourself.

97
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:04,400
 It seems like life is split into stages before you even notice. 

98
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,862
 Tiantian, Yi Tianyu, and my brother. 

99
00:07:07,862 --> 00:07:12,435
 Those who once stood with me, even my old rivals, 

100
00:07:12,435 --> 00:07:17,175
 we are all walking different paths at this moment. 

101
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:34,555
 Everyone is embracing their new stages and goals. 

102
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:36,605
 But what about me? 

103
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,855
Come on, tell me about your ideas.

104
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:31,185
 Custom apps haven't quite managed to... 

105
00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:36,245
 Consumers nowadays still have some worries about autonomous driving. 

106
00:08:36,245 --> 00:08:40,040
 And they always want to get the most optimal route. 

107
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,495
 During this process, we still need to...  
   

108
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:44,055
 Autonomous driving is mainly for people 

109
00:08:44,055 --> 00:08:46,492
 who might not be great drivers... 

110
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:50,112
 It actually still needs some human involvement... 

111
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:54,535
 There are certain challenges when it comes to road restructuring. 

112
00:08:57,695 --> 00:08:59,825
 Let's talk about the next topic. 

113
00:09:02,955 --> 00:09:05,425
 We may also need to cover... 

114
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,648
   

115
00:09:10,648 --> 00:09:12,875
You are dismissed.

116
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,920
- Bye. 
 - Thanks.

117
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,370
- Thanks, Brother Qi. 
 - Let's go and grab some food.

118
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,580
I'm so exhausted.

119
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,060
We just had the topic selection meeting.

120
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,690
Every year, the chosen topics

121
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,130
get a chance to become key projects for industry-academia collaboration.

122
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,490
Why didn't you attend?

123
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:33,954
Actually, I didn't get the notice about the meeting.

124
00:09:33,954 --> 00:09:35,080
You didn't?

125
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,376
Grandmaster.

126
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,980
Lin Jiadong, perfect timing.

127
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,580
Did you not inform every lab member about today's meeting?

128
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,180
Her?

129
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,100
She's a freshman. I didn't think she needed to attend.

130
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,370
Why not?

131
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,410
I joined when I was a freshman.

132
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,060
Sitting in on the meeting is also a good way to learn.

133
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,830
But she's not going to come up

134
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:57,000
with a C1 project from the meeting like you did.

135
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,440
I'm sorry.

136
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,890
You're a freshman. You should work on the basics for now.

137
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,320
Wait until your sophomore or junior year.

138
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,010
It won't be too late to attend then.

139
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,220
I'll be going first, Grandmaster.

140
00:10:15,326 --> 00:10:18,305
 My life has already restarted.  
    

141
00:10:18,305 --> 00:10:20,700
 Why should I wait any more? 

142
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,959
It's okay.

143
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,690
My sister's coming. Let's eat together.

144
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,940
No, you go ahead. I've already met Sister Yue.

145
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,790
I'll head in now.

146
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,410
Your dishes are all here. Enjoy your meal.

147
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,940
Thank you.

148
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:56,650
   

149
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,000
   

150
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,420
   

151
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,130
It's been a while since our last meal.

152
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,830
Yet you're just zoning out, looking at your phone.

153
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,650
You're here because of your contract,

154
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,250
not to have lunch with me.

155
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,320
Tell me about your roommate.

156
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,180
Yes, my roommate.

157
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,510
My roommate

158
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,980
and that girl I mentioned are kind of together.

159
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,550
- But... 
 - There's a "but?"

160
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,400
Okay, go on. Go on.

161
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,080
But lately, the girl's been disappearing a lot.

162
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,750
She's all secretive and never says where she's going.

163
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,560
That's normal. She's already got him,

164
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,110
so she doesn't care as much anymore.

165
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,220
Are all strong women like that now?

166
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:25,110
Maybe she has some other reasons.

167
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,890
Could it be that I...

168
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,350
my roommate.

169
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,390
Could it be that he's too clingy?

170
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:52,830
Wait. So, your roommate and this girl are kind of together?

171
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,010
What do you mean by "kind of?"

172
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,910
They are together.

173
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,660
It's just that no one's said it out loud. They're just naturally together.

174
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,620
So you mean he didn't confess to her?

175
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,990
That's where the problem is.

176
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,560
No girl wants to be in a vague relationship.

177
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,050
Even strong women don't want that.

178
00:13:24,381 --> 00:13:26,960
I have to go back to the lab.

179
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,040
You're leaving?

180
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,990
I have to run some algorithms.

181
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,440
Thanks, Sister.

182
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,994
Wait. What about our lunch?

183
00:13:33,994 --> 00:13:36,684
Then are you coming home this weekend?

184
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,070
Look at all this food.

185
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,110
Your control skills still need work.

186
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,230
You can't even get the direction right.

187
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,780
I've been studying this for ages.

188
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,830
Grandmaster.

189
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,700
- Senior Brother. 
 - Senior Brother.

190
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,400
Where's Gu Xuejiao?

191
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,460
Her?

192
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,280
She took a day off.

193
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,200
I told you.

194
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,340
She's just here to get by and earn credits.

195
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,080
She's not actually passionate about this.

196
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,510
She hasn't shown up for days.

197
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,620
Her true colors are showing.

198
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,160
   

199
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,920
Linear regression, logistic regression,

200
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,990
linear discriminant analysis, decision trees,

201
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,060
support vector machines...

202
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,950
Go away, leave me alone.

203
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,706
Are you that busy?

204
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,830
Recently, a wise person made me realize

205
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,160
that a career is only a small part of life.

206
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,280
Family is what matters most.

207
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:10,680
What are you studying? English?

208
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,370
Let me guess. Is that wise person Zhou Shiyun?

209
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,080
Is that for me?

210
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,320
It belongs to the wise person.

211
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,831
Seriously? Are you that out of touch?

212
00:15:23,831 --> 00:15:27,921
Don't you know what it means to give a guy a hair tie?

213
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,800
I really do wish I didn't know.

214
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,600
I would never do something so childish.

215
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,020
You must've stolen that hair tie yourself.

216
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,600
Gu Mingze, you have to control yourself a bit.

217
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,796
I don't want to see you on the legal television channel.

218
00:15:42,796 --> 00:15:44,557
Who said that?

219
00:15:44,557 --> 00:15:47,247
She went along with me taking it.

220
00:15:50,251 --> 00:15:52,490
Okay, fine.

221
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,242
In the future, I'll visit you every few months.

222
00:15:55,242 --> 00:15:56,883
But I can't promise I'll do that long-term.

223
00:15:56,883 --> 00:15:59,573
The prison's pretty far from school.

224
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,440
I'm off.

225
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,830
It looks like every possible topic has been covered.

226
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,510
I'm really going.

227
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,710
Okay.

228
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,250
I'll tell Mom not to buy beef brisket tonight.

229
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,340
We're having beef brisket tonight?

230
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,300
I guess it won't hurt if I eat and then leave.

231
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,960
 I can't go back to the lab to look for materials. 

232
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,720
 If Lin Jiadong finds out I jumped the line for topic selection, 

233
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,800
 he'll mess with me again. 

234
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,040
   

235
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:51,260
   

236
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,160
   

237
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,719
I'm...

238
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:09,589
clingy?

239
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,520
You're working so hard.

240
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,900
Why are you here?

241
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,900
I should be the one asking you.

242
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,492
You...

243
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,660
No... No.

244
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:04,250
Thesis topics from previous years?

245
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,770
You...

246
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,420
You're just a freshman.

247
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,590
Why are you pushing yourself to jump the line?

248
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,870
There'll be plenty of chances later.

249
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,100
No, there won't be.

250
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,900
Chances don't come often.

251
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,050
Someone like you, who's been miles ahead since day one,

252
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:28,770
won't get what it feels like for underdogs like me.

253
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,940
I don't want to be held down by Lin Jiadong for three years.

254
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,171
Speak of the devil.

255
00:18:38,171 --> 00:18:39,480
He's been bullying you, right?

256
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,620
- Let's go. 
 - Wait, no.

257
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,330
It's not that.

258
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,740
Grandmaster?

259
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:46,450
Grandmaster.

260
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,870
If Lin Jiadong finds out I'm hiding here with his precious senior,

261
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:53,670
it will be way worse than me sneaking around here to steal topics.

262
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,450
I heard from Senior Brother Gao that you came to fix the equipment.

263
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:03,010
So, I brought you the latest trendy milk tea from Tiantian's Tea.

264
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,900
Tiantian's tea?

265
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,530
Where is he?

266
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,020
Hush money.

267
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,500
What money?

268
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,340
Hush money.

269
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,700
   

270
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,350
What kind of model fits which algorithm?

271
00:20:17,762 --> 00:20:21,100
To build a data model, you first have to determine

272
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,532
if you're optimizing an existing model

273
00:20:24,532 --> 00:20:28,400
or creating a new one.

274
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,575
I'd rather stand on the shoulders of those who came before me, then.

275
00:20:33,575 --> 00:20:35,895
Do you have any model recommendations?

276
00:20:36,728 --> 00:20:39,309
Let's do this. I'll send you some developer websites.

277
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:42,871
There are lots of open-source tools and shared databases on there.

278
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:45,900
I've saved a few cool data models myself.

279
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,770
I'll send those, too.

280
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,650
Thank you, my precious senior brother.

281
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,270
I wish there were an AI just like you that could answer everything.

282
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,460
Then who'd even worry about exams or topic selections?

283
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,780
 AI... 

284
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,630
 Dialogue... 

285
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,410
 Tool... 

286
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,530
 Isn't that... 

287
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:18,180
 Deepseek, which will be developed in ten years? 

288
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,770
 But people spent a long time building Deepseek 

289
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,900
 from a technological concept to actual release. 

290
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,300
 I'm just a newbie. 

291
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:50,150
 I'm not even sure if I can build the basic underlying architecture. 

292
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:53,970
Maybe this time, I should just...

293
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,220
It isn't too late to quit now.

294
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,560
Don't try to provoke me again.

295
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,650
There's no way I'm going to quit.

296
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,939
You got me.

297
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,860
You're getting smarter.

298
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,420
You won't fall for the same trick twice.

299
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,680
What's wrong, Senior Brother Gao?

300
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,480
Did you have breakfast? Let's go and get some.

301
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,794
Wait, Senior Brother Gao. How did you...

302
00:22:39,794 --> 00:22:42,780
Then... I'll help you with it.

303
00:22:43,389 --> 00:22:44,530
Forget it.

304
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,620
You do your own thing.

305
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,130
I can manage. I'm very independent.

306
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,490
Good luck.

307
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,990
Good luck.

308
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,518
Sir, there are plates and bowls in here.

309
00:23:03,518 --> 00:23:05,186
Don't break them. Take it easy.

310
00:23:05,186 --> 00:23:08,660
- Okay, don't worry. 
 - Watch your step.

311
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,150
Don't stand here. Be careful.

312
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,630
Watch your step. There's a step there.

313
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,550
- There's a step. 
 - Okay.

314
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,920
- Okay. 
 - Thank you.

315
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,610
It's all right.

316
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,940
You know what?

317
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,871
We're moving to a new place now.

318
00:23:22,871 --> 00:23:25,902
You should just replace all the old tableware.

319
00:23:25,902 --> 00:23:27,010
- All of them? 
 - Yes.

320
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,780
How much is that going to cost?

321
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,630
Do you have any idea how expensive moving is?

322
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,580
Besides, the old bowls are still usable.

323
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,530
Don't waste money.

324
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:39,870
I love how you manage our finances.

325
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:43,290
Look at us, we've been saving up for decades,

326
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,530
but we still don't have a house to show for it.

327
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,450
Xuejiao's great.

328
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,200
She has a keen eye on the market.

329
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,933
Let's have her manage the family budget from now on.

330
00:23:51,933 --> 00:23:54,210
Whatever she says, I will do it.

331
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,480
You'll do as she says?

332
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,200
So I no longer have any say?

333
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,790
No, you do. You control me.

334
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,150
If you lift a finger, I will jump.

335
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,290
You're just all about your daughter, aren't you?

336
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,730
You favor her way too much.

337
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:09,730
If your son heard, he'd be jealous.

338
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,452
Him? Jealous?

339
00:24:11,452 --> 00:24:14,040
He's not going to be jealous.

340
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:19,290
Our son only thinks about value balancing and 3D modeling.

341
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,000
If you ask me, there's no way he'd be jealous.

342
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,285
He does chicken. Be careful.

343
00:24:23,285 --> 00:24:24,380
Does what?

344
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,070
It's a game about eating chicken.

345
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,900
Basically, a squad fights over one virtual chicken.

346
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,870
What's the fun in that?

347
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,675
I have no idea.

348
00:24:32,675 --> 00:24:34,160
I'll go check inside again.

349
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,850
I think everything has been taken out already.

350
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,720
   

351
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,670
You're not going to text me back?

352
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:48,810
Brilliant. I won't talk to you again.

353
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,420
Classmate, this seat's taken.

354
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,910
Didn't you see the backpack here?

355
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,060
Good morning.

356
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,360
You...

357
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:13,050
Wait, how did you sneak in?

358
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,980
It's okay.

359
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:29,280
We all know that most objects 
    

360
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,760
can only deform to a certain extent.

361
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,450
That is, their elasticity all works within a certain range.

362
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,926
And once the external force is gone...

363
00:25:38,926 --> 00:25:41,080
Wait, don't just stare at me. Look at the board.

364
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,465
I don't understand a single word on the board.

365
00:25:43,465 --> 00:25:46,100
Then, why are you even here for a lecture you don't understand?

366
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,272
It's called elastic deformation...

367
00:25:47,272 --> 00:25:48,960
I can start learning now.

368
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,180
- Are you— 
 - You two in the back.

369
00:25:55,907 --> 00:25:57,970
I just talked about elastic materials.

370
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:01,230
Can you give me an example?

371
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,460
Don't hide. You two.

372
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,663
   

373
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:16,236
For example, rubber.

374
00:26:18,128 --> 00:26:22,575
Rubber is indeed the most typical kind of elastic material.

375
00:26:22,575 --> 00:26:24,598
Good. You can sit down.

376
00:26:24,598 --> 00:26:26,450
The boy next to you.

377
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,460
Give another example.

378
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,515
What are you laughing at?

379
00:26:36,515 --> 00:26:38,490
Have you been listening carefully?

380
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,680
I have.

381
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,870
I just can't think of an example right away.

382
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,760
Oh, right, Professor. Can I be considered an elastic material?

383
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,010
You see, Professor,

384
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,720
ever since I was little, my mom's been saying that I'm like a rubber ball.

385
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,970
I only move when someone bounces me.

386
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:56,020
When she puts pressure on me, I have no choice but to become deformed.

387
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,730
But when they leave me alone, I go back to my original shape.

388
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:02,890
So would you say that I can be considered an elastic material?

389
00:27:04,942 --> 00:27:06,040
He's hilarious.

390
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,390
So now you're personifying it?

391
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,290
Your example is quite vivid.

392
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,740
Are you from our department?

393
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,780
Let's move on.

394
00:27:22,585 --> 00:27:25,866
Just now, you all learned that...

395
00:27:25,866 --> 00:27:28,747
 I've gone through all the topics everyone submitted.  
    

396
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:32,870
This time, for topics of the same type, we'll keep only the best ones.

397
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:35,580
I've picked a few good ones.

398
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,741
The students whose names I call next,

399
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:39,860
get ready to present your topic.

400
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,670
We'll discuss them in today's meeting.

401
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,816
- Chang Shuo. 
 - Here.

402
00:27:44,816 --> 00:27:45,970
Wenbo.

403
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,790
Here.

404
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,070
- Wang Zhiqiang. 
 - Here.

405
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:53,305
The last one doesn't have a name.

406
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:55,075
Whose is it?

407
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,980
I didn't put my name on it?

408
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,800
That's impossible.

409
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,920
   

410
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,670
Professor,

411
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,700
it's mine.

412
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,300
Gu Xuejiao?

413
00:28:23,976 --> 00:28:25,587
Did you really write this?

414
00:28:25,587 --> 00:28:27,057
Yes.

415
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,480
Good. Very good.

416
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,811
For a freshman to propose such a forward-looking topic,

417
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:35,440
that's truly impressive.

418
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,430
Then, Gu Xuejiao, let's start today's discussion with your topic.

419
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:42,980
Wait, Professor Tan, what about my topic?

420
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:46,380
Yours is still discussing old technology.

421
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:50,100
Gu Xuejiao's topic is already talking about technology iteration.

422
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,660
So, for now, don't start your project just yet.

423
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,621
Work with your junior to complete her project.

424
00:28:54,621 --> 00:28:59,360
And take this time to sort out your ideas.

425
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,765
Okay.

426
00:29:00,765 --> 00:29:03,186
Gu Xuejiao, get started.

427
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,590
Gu Mingze!

428
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,760
You're Gu Mingze, right?

429
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,600
I saw your...

430
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:27,610
You're here to be with your girlfriend?

431
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,420
We're... just friends.

432
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,880
Then, can I take a picture with you?

433
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,482
Let's take one more.

434
00:29:49,482 --> 00:29:51,712
Okay, that's enough.

435
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,320
Shiyun.

436
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,820
Why do you have my hair tie?

437
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,410
Remember when I came to school to see you?

438
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,450
 You put your hair down 

439
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:08,360
 and forgot to take it afterward. 

440
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,770
And then I also forgot to return it to you.

441
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,630
Give it back now, then.

442
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:30,030
Professor and Seniors, hello.

443
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,860
The topic I'm presenting 
    

444
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,680
is an AI language processing program

445
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,340
based on a neural network architecture built on top of the Transformer model.

446
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,520
It can learn and understand 
    

447
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,660
human conversation and interact with people. 
    

448
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,620
It can also communicate according to the context of the chat,

449
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,720
and chat and communicate like a real human being.

450
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,060
It can even complete tasks such as writing video scripts, copywriting,

451
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,900
writing emails, translating, and coding.

452
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,700
Did you put this on my desk this morning?

453
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,110
I have good news for you.

454
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,140
Your topic has been selected

455
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,790
to be one of the key projects of this year's industry-academia collaboration.

456
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:08,900
If you have any ideas or needs, feel free to bring them up.

457
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,310
Would it be possible to integrate my AI framework

458
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:15,090
into the C1 in-car system?

459
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,970
That's a good idea.

460
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,110
That would be a great complement.

461
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,934
Talk to Xiao Lin about it.

462
00:31:19,934 --> 00:31:26,000
♫  Youth is full of obstacles, but we'll slowly become stronger  ♫

463
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:32,105
Professor Tan, although my inspiration did come from others,

464
00:31:32,105 --> 00:31:35,820
the core architecture was developed by me alone.

465
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,800
Like you said, Jinghai University is full of hidden talents.

466
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:52,010
I agree to add the AI model to the C1 system.

467
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,740
Since when did you get into the habit of eavesdropping?

468
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,320
So you're one of the hidden talents, aren't you?

469
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,100
I'm proud of you.

470
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,280
Come on, let's go celebrate.

471
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,910
Let's go.

472
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,770
- Hello? 
  - Gu Xuejiao! 

473
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,070
What's wrong, Gao Rui?

474
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:35,840
I borrowed Sister Yue's car from Lao Lin and tested your model in a real vehicle.

475
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,180
But your voice AI led the car straight into a ditch in just half an hour.

476
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,250
What?

477
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,730
What do you mean? I didn't get it.

478
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,580
Say it again.

479
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,630
The positioning error is 300%.

480
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,530
 Go check it yourself. 

481
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:01,040
How did the GPS drift off into the middle of nowhere?

482
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,250
AI made a mistake, and the person just followed suit?

483
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,870
How did they even get here?

484
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,058
Where is he?

485
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,380
What do you...

486
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:09,090
I want to make it official.

487
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:14,764
Will you be my girlfriend?

488
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,650
We've already confirmed that.

489
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,900
Why are you asking me again?

490
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,810
We've confirmed it already?

491
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:27,100
Then consider this as double-checking...

492
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:34,580
because I'm not sure if I'm doing a good job pursuing a girl.

493
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,700
If numbers are uncertain, I can double-check them over and over again.

494
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,990
But with you,

495
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,012
I...

496
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:49,100
I can't be that confident.

497
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:56,940
I'm afraid you might stop liking me one day,

498
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:01,400
you might suddenly like someone else,

499
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:07,262
or you might decide you no longer like

500
00:35:07,262 --> 00:35:12,340
tech guys with glasses, but prefer muscular men instead.

501
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:17,420
I don't know... I don't know why I'm like this.

502
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,980
Then ask me again.

503
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,080
Gu Xuejiao,

504
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,520
- will you be my girlfriend? 
 - Yes!

505
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:38,090
♫  I try to open my arms  ♫

506
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,730
So...

507
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,840
Can I kiss my girlfriend now?

508
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,600
♫  I'll wait for you at the summit  ♫

509
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:53,420
♫  Even if the wind's harsh, it's all right  ♫

510
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:57,560
♫  There's a figure approaching  ♫

511
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:04,043
♫  I know it must be you  ♫

512
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:17,460
♫  I try to open my arms  ♫

513
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:21,468
♫  Because I'm certain of this love  ♫

514
00:36:21,468 --> 00:36:24,280
♫  I'll wait for you at the summit  ♫

515
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:31,100
♫  Even if the wind's harsh, it's all right  ♫

516
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:35,181
♫  There's a figure approaching  ♫

517
00:36:35,181 --> 00:36:41,931
♫  I know it must be you  ♫

518
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,490
So you tricked me into coming here

519
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:57,330
just to make me admit that I'm your girlfriend?

520
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,120
I'm really stuck here.

521
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,790
The car won't move?

522
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,740
 The system has detected that your vehicle hasn't moved for a period of time. 

523
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,400
 Please confirm. 

524
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,750
Isn't that my voice?

525
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,860
I recorded your voice into our C1 ecosystem.

526
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,060
So when C1 hits the market,

527
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:26,340
everyone in our cars will hear your voice.

528
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,380
I like this gift.

529
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:33,320
I'm glad you like it.

530
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,880
What do you think about your boyfriend then?

531
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,850
This isn't a rushed job.

532
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:44,050
There needs to be a probationary period.

533
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,900
As such an excellent employee,

534
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,190
I should get a lifetime contract.

535
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,320
There's still a probationary period?

536
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:56,220
Of course. It's a must.

537
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,690
It's to see if you can make me happy.

538
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,040
Are you happy yet?

539
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,720
Yes.

540
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,860
   

541
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,540
   

542
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:35,620
   

543
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,812
- Good morning. 
 - Good morning.

544
00:38:42,812 --> 00:38:45,210
- Good morning. 
 - Can you take a look for me?

545
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,820
   

546
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,480
That's pretty much it.

547
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,320
Awesome!

548
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,801
Come here, let me introduce our new lab member.

549
00:39:06,801 --> 00:39:10,283
Hello, everyone. I'm Shu Lan, a junior from the Mechanical Engineering department.

550
00:39:10,283 --> 00:39:15,953
I look forward to learning from all my seniors and classmates.

551
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:18,653
- Welcome. 
 - Welcome.

552
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,090
And we have some good news to share with everyone.

553
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:26,660
Our second-generation autonomous driving model has been successfully delivered.

554
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,620
If the performance targets are met,

555
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:32,180
we'll all be a step closer to financial freedom.

556
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:37,340
Starting now, C1 is officially on track.

557
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:41,260
In the future, it will bring more valuable projects to the school.

558
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,320
Let's work hard together!

559
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,212
- Yes! 
 - Let's go!

560
00:39:45,212 --> 00:39:47,940
- We've figured it out with B&amp;C Motors? 
 - With your boy...

561
00:39:50,858 --> 00:39:55,078
With your brilliant Senior Brother Lin, of course, we have it figured out.

562
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,519
All right.

563
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:00,939
Get back to work.

564
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,050
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

565
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:13,550
Vice President Zheng is stuck in traffic.

566
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,380
All right, have some tea first.

567
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,950
- Thank you. 
 - Okay.

568
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:21,380
Vice President Zheng is here. I'll go and get her.

569
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,060
Okay.

570
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,420
Old Lin, this place looks pretty expensive.

571
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,050
They're not making us pay, right?

572
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,090
Drink your tea.

573
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,420
 Gu Xuejiao: Has the dear client arrived? 

574
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,780
 It's better if they don't come. 

575
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,260
 I don't want to deal with them. 

576
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,970
 Be a professional vendor, okay? 

577
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:46,260
 Key phrases for meeting the client: 

578
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,320
 welcome, goodbye, we have no complaints, 

579
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,430
 you're right, we'll fix it, and we're happy to.  
 - Here.

580
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:53,700
Our geniuses from Jinghai University.

581
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,130
Long time no see.

582
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:56,830
Vice President Zheng.

583
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,490
Please have a seat.

584
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,650
Come on. Let's have a seat.

585
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,460
Xiao Lin, sit next to me.

586
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,700
Okay.

587
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,670
Snow chaser, wind rider, and my dashing white knight.

588
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,740
Let's skip the formalities today.

589
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:28,841
We're all alumni from Jinghai University.

590
00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:31,592
Since the baijiu has been poured, we might as well drink it.

591
00:41:31,592 --> 00:41:32,760
- Okay. 
 - Sure.

592
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,960
Come on, serve the liquor.

593
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,530
Okay.

594
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:38,740
Here. Allow me.

595
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,570
- Okay. 
 - He doesn't drink.

596
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,420
I'll drink for him.

597
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,530
What's wrong?

598
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:46,570
Did drinking with the guys before scare you off?

599
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:47,610
Don't worry. Relax.

600
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:48,780
I'm here today.

601
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,490
- No one's going to mess with you. 
 - That's right.

602
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:52,380
Here. Let's fill it up.

603
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,200
Vice President Zheng...

604
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,610
Senior Sister.

605
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:58,550
I don't drink when I'm working.

606
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,920
How much you drink is about your tolerance,

607
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,110
but not drinking at all is a matter of attitude.

608
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,520
Exactly.

609
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,130
- Drinking's about bonding, right? 
 - Yes.

610
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:16,110
When we bond over drinks, we can become a true family at B&amp;C Motors.

611
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:22,590
Come on, give me that. The company's private room is upstairs.

612
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:25,960
If you drink too much, I can book the room for you.

613
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,900
You can stay here.

614
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,740
Isn't that better than your dorm at school?

615
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,780
It's way better!

616
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,280
 Gao Rui: SOS. 

617
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,750
 Your boyfriend is trapped in a den of cougars now. 

618
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:38,840
Hold this for me.

619
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,570
You... Where are you going?

620
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:42,530
To fight a cougar!

621
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:06,950
