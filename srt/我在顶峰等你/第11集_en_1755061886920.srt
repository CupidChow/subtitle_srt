1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Try to grow the flowers in the spring and summer

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now tell the truth about life

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's not complicated to tell the truth

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The youth is swaying

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We are getting stronger

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My heart is still hot and boiling

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Follow the rhythm and release it gently

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The night wind is brightening, guiding me to go forward

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will accompany you to fly bravely

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My love is still hot and boiling

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Shining and smiling eyes

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let us cross the barrier of time

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I have to take advantage of the fact that the university hasn't started yet

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and take the student ID card to show off.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I will be happy to think about it.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's better to find a boyfriend to give you a bag.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I have to remind you

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
the most important three points of a woman and a man

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
is to keep the fire from burning and to keep the south from burning.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You have to find someone who knows the truth.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
For example

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Brother Lin

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Have you seen Brother Lin after you went to college?

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Didn't we say where to go and play?

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Why are you talking about him?

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
After you finish your military training in a few days

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll drive you out

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I drove my dad back

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Come on, what era is it?

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Don't treat him, it's too embarrassing.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Then should we go to the bar?

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Have you been there?

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
How about you?

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You haven't been there.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I tell you

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Our talent basketball team members told me

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's so cool to play in the bar.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Bingo, disco

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Can you stop playing this kind of nonsense?

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Come to a high-end place

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
High-end

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Do you want to go to the music area?

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The university will have a performance in a few days.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Hamlet, you know

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't want to watch this concert

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Then go to the beach to play

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Sunshine beach waves

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Are you a social member or a college student?

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Why do you think about it?

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Then what do you think college students are not suitable for?

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This is the first time we went to college

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We don't know

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Do you know where Zhou Shiyun went?

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I heard he wasn't admitted by Li Da

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But I don't know where he went

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I haven't contacted his family recently

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He is now meeting his alumni with Yi Tianyu

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
In the elite university

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Bad luck

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
How do you talk?

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
How can I be unlucky in a university like me?

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You got into the elite university, that's luck

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Zhou Shiyun got into the elite university

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's really a little bit unkind

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's time, I have to leave

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Second-class college investigation rate

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Our college is particularly hard

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
By the way

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Where do you want to go?

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Give me a call, I'll take you there

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
gone

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Bye bye

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Gu Xuejiao, are you reporting military intelligence?

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Why did I work so many people in the elite university?

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
They all said they had never seen Zhou Shiyun

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Don't care about me

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I told you not to care about me

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But why

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Why do you say it's a mess?

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's so embarrassing

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Do you want to hear the truth?

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Why did the people you used to see every day disappear suddenly?

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Zhou Shiyun

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Gu Xuejiao

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Go to the true place

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Zhou Shiyun

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Gu Xuejiao

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Including Infцу

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Look Xuejiao

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,200
This...

96
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,160
You have to be more strong.

97
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,160
You're quite good.

98
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,360
God, I'm going out to eat with you.

99
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,360
Brother Gao will be angry if he knows.

100
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,080
Isn't he going to the door of the women's room

101
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,280
to see the new students?

102
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,760
Does it look good?

103
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,720
It's really pretty.

104
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,240
Isn't that a hunter?

105
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
Hunter...

106
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,720
Are you going to be confused?

107
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,840
No.

108
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,480
We're a little late.

109
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,840
How about I treat you to a fried food?

110
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,440
Let's eat some desserts.

111
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,360
God, when have you ever eaten dessert?

112
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,200
Welcome.

113
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,240
You work here?

114
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,960
Yes, I'm a dessert apprentice.

115
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,120
You didn't see Gu Xuejiao today?

116
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,920
Gu Xuejiao?

117
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,560
No.

118
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,240
There are only me and my master in this store.

119
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,120
I didn't ask how many people are in your store.

120
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,840
I thought you were here to check the hygiene.

121
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,320
God, which one do you want to eat?

122
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,120
This one.

123
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
20.

124
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,360
Thank you.

125
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,840
We...

126
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,560
Welcome to come again.

127
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,520
Master, do you want to eat that?

128
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
That's a little bit too much.

129
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,240
Xuejiao, why didn't you say hello to Brother Lin earlier?

130
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,640
Don't mind the elders' business.

131
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,520
I'm your dessert.

132
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,120
Do you have any tricks on him?

133
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,720
You just left the school. What's wrong?

134
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,760
Sit down.

135
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,840
What's the matter that I can't know?

136
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,680
You...

137
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,440
You...

138
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,960
If you don't tell me, I won't make you delicious cakes anymore.

139
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,080
It's okay.

140
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,080
Really.

141
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,040
Oh my god.

142
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,720
It's only a few days after school.

143
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,840
Do you want to work so hard?

144
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,000
After a few days of training,

145
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,480
we still have the entrance exam.

146
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,000
Let's go out and have a look.

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,640
I'm leaving the country with the school's

148
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,400
training plan for the third year of junior high school.

149
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,800
I have to get ready now.

150
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
What plan?

151
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,680
Come on.

152
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,880
I'll show you all.

153
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,960
This is the school's training plan.

154
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,320
The most famous school in the country.

155
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,320
It's a little bit famous.

156
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,400
I only know the top three.

157
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,360
These world-famous top schools.

158
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
Who doesn't know them?

159
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,760
But I still advise you

160
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,000
to get to know the top schools.

161
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,080
Look at Zhao Feifei.

162
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,720
She's in the top three.

163
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,200
And then Siqi.

164
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,760
She's a serious provincial athlete.

165
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,080
Feifei.

166
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,600
Are you going abroad, too?

167
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,640
Actually, I'm not very satisfied with my major.

168
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,440
I want to get a degree in cross-professional studies.

169
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,400
I want to specialize in aerospace flight control.

170
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,560
I want to build rockets and be a little space man.

171
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,280
Look at our body.

172
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,600
Entering space station as a equipment expert.

173
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,560
Is it less than others?

174
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,760
The time is limited.

175
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,240
Great idea.

176
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,440
You're not a picky person.

177
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,240
Siqi.

178
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,440
What are you reading?

179
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,480
Take me with you.

180
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,480
I'm a test subject.

181
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,160
I've been in the test so early.

182
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,240
Siqi is used to studying here.

183
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,440
Otherwise, how can she be a provincial athlete?

184
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,360
This is called Ma Tai Effect.

185
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,920
The better person is getting better.

186
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,200
Your life is bright.

187
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,120
You just borrowed the major.

188
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,000
When you graduate and get the major,

189
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,840
you want to go out and enter society.

190
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,800
Shu Lan is right.

191
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,760
I did get into the major by car.

192
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,800
Everyone has their own goal.

193
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,240
What about me?

194
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,440
I got into the major.

195
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,320
Is it my goal?

196
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,680
I think we should stop studying.

197
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,200
Let's break the ice.

198
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,920
There's a bug in this program.

199
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,600
Let's check it again.

200
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,840
It's Xue.

201
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,840
Hello.

202
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,640
Hello.

203
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,440
I'm Gu Xuejiao.

204
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,160
What's wrong?

205
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,040
I just sent you a red envelope.

206
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,440
I received it.

207
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,240
Can you return it to me?

208
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,560
I'm sorry.

209
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,560
I'm sorry.

210
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,560
I'm sorry.

211
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,560
I'm sorry.

212
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,560
I'm sorry.

213
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,560
I'm sorry.

214
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,320
My mistake.

215
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,160
Return it.

216
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,760
Yes.

217
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,160
I accidentally sent a wrong one.

218
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,160
I'm sorry.

219
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,760
Okay.

220
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,360
I'll return it to you.

221
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,360
Thank you.

222
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
Wait.

223
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,560
You said you sent it wrong.

224
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,560
It's off.

225
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
It's off.

226
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,560
It's off.

227
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,560
Oh, yeah.

228
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,560
How can I send the red envelope wrong?

229
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,560
Gu Shui, let me tell you.

230
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,560
After the training,

231
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
it will be the final exam.

232
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,560
Don't mess around.

233
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,560
I'm sorry to bother you.

234
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,560
Remember to return it to me.

235
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,560
It's not the New Year.

236
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,560
Why do you send the red envelope?

237
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,560
I'm sorry.

238
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
Hurry up.

239
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,560
Time is running out.

240
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,560
The school is starting.

241
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,560
You won the race.

242
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,560
You didn't see him either?

243
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,560
Why are you hiding from me recently?

244
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,560
No.

245
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,560
I'm not.

246
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,560
I'm just not used to the new environment.

247
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,560
I'll be fine after a few days.

248
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,560
He just entered the school.

249
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
He hasn't fully recovered yet.

250
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,560
As long as you live long,

251
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,560
there will always be a chance to turn the tables.

252
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,560
I wish you a long life.

253
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,560
Mr. Ye,

254
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
I know that many big companies

255
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,560
have sent you the red envelope.

256
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,560
But we definitely

257
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,560
have 10,000% of enthusiasm

258
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,560
and sincerity to invite you.

259
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,560
So I hope you can

260
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,560
consider it carefully.

261
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,560
Dad.

262
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,560
You're here to pick me up?

263
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,560
After all, work is not important.

264
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,560
That's great.

265
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,560
I told you to eat the delicious food

266
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,560
I taught you tonight.

267
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,560
I've been working for days.

268
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,560
Look,

269
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,560
I haven't had a day off

270
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
since today.

271
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,560
In order to transfer to the technical school,

272
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,560
I even gave up the opportunity

273
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,560
to transfer to the original school.

274
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,560
Mr. Lin,

275
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,560
I really cherish this opportunity.

276
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,560
Today is September 5th.

277
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,560
I'm so happy.

278
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,560
You guys are so good.

279
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,560
Such a tricky question.

280
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,560
You even got two rounds.

281
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,560
Who let the second-rate

282
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,560
get two rounds in a row?

283
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,560
How is Siqi?

284
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,560
It's so exciting.

285
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,560
He won't misunderstand, right?

286
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,560
Something is going on.

287
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,560
Go away.

288
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,560
I'm afraid he'll guess that I'm messing with him.

289
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,560
If we meet again,

290
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,560
I'll be in trouble.

291
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,560
Tell me the truth.

292
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,560
Who is this Xi Mingbo?

293
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,560
Don't try to fool me.

294
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,560
We're just playing for fun,

295
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,560
not for real.

296
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,560
I'm not playing.

297
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,560
Xue Jiang,

298
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,560
you suggested this.

299
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,560
You're right.

300
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,560
I can't play anymore.

301
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,560
You can't play anymore.

302
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,560
What should we do, Siqi?

303
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,560
You said you'd play with me.

304
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,560
I know.

305
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,560
I know.

306
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,560
I know.

307
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,560
I'll help you.

308
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,560
I'll help you.

309
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,560
I'll help you.

310
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,560
I'll help you.

311
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,560
I'll help you.

312
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,560
At least one sentence is right.

313
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,560
After the military training,

314
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,560
it's the final exam.

315
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,560
I advise some people

316
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,560
to keep their feet on the ground.

317
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,560
By the way,

318
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,560
from 22 p.m. to 46 p.m.,

319
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,560
it's more than 40 times the number of people.

320
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,560
You can arrange the time by yourself.

321
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,560
Don't bother me to rest.

322
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,560
I...

323
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,560
Let's rest early.

324
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,560
Okay.

325
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,560
He's so annoying.

326
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,560
He's like someone before.

327
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,560
He's almost like a playboy.

328
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,560
Didn't you ask me

329
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,560
if I was nervous?

330
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,560
Actually,

331
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,560
the moment I saw him in the woods,

332
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,560
I wanted to see him

333
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,560
during the college days.

334
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,560
Where are you going?

335
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,560
I'm going to the country.

336
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,560
Sorry.

337
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,560
Don't teach.

338
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,560
Tomorrow, your team will play the chess

339
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
and go to the country to practice.

340
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,560
She also kicks people in the evening.

341
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,560
Isn't it a bit too much?

342
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,560
Too much?

343
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,560
I just saw you

344
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,560
being so wild.

345
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,560
Li Zheng.

346
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,560
What are you running?

347
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,560
I'm running to the city.

348
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,560
Okay.

349
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,560
Bye, Li Zheng.

350
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,560
Bye, Li Zheng.

351
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,560
Bye, Li Zheng.

352
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,560
Bye.

353
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,560
I'm not nervous.

354
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,560
I'm not nervous.

355
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,560
Then you're the only one who knows.

356
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,560
I got the flag. I'll go first.

357
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,560
Wait.

358
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,560
You left something behind.

359
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,560
No, I don't think so.

360
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
It's just that...

361
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,560
I don't know if I'm a good person or not.

362
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,560
It's...

363
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,560
How did you know it was my birthday?

364
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,560
When I moved in to the hotel,

365
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,560
I'm so embarrassed.

366
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,360
Okay, I won't mention it.

367
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,800
The last time I was 19 years old,

368
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,240
I was so carefree.

369
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,720
This time, I finally restarted my life.

370
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,400
I'm so embarrassed.

371
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
I'm so embarrassed.

372
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
I'm so embarrassed.

373
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
I'm so embarrassed.

374
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
I'm so embarrassed.

375
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,400
To restart a life,

376
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,920
you can't repeat the same mistake.

377
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,920
Gu Xue Jiao.

378
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,440
Gu Xue Jiao.

379
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,480
You win.

380
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,480
Xue Jiao.

381
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,440
You...

382
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,560
There's a door there.

383
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,680
Do you have to climb the wall?

384
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,680
Yes, yes.

385
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,680
Huang...

386
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,360
Don't be so noisy.

387
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,680
Huang.

388
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,480
Hurry up.

389
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,680
Fly the horse.

390
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,280
I'm afraid of heights.

391
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,280
You...

392
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,120
Hurry up, Huang.

393
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,120
I'm begging you.

394
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,440
Hurry up.

395
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,440
Hurry up.

396
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,240
Happy birthday to you.

397
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,600
Happy birthday to you.

398
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,360
Happy birthday to you.

399
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,320
Happy birthday to you.

400
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,920
Xue Jiao, make a wish.

401
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,120
After that, we'll have cake.

402
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,520
I've prepared...

403
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,480
A gift.

404
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,200
A gift?

405
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,000
I think I forgot to send it to the dorm.

406
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,720
You're so unexpected.

407
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,280
It's not important.

408
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,400
Make a wish first.

409
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,120
I have to go back early.

410
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,120
I have to check the money.

411
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,680
I'm going to the dorm.

412
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,680
I'll be back soon.

413
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,680
Bye.

414
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,680
Bye.

415
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,680
Bye.

416
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,680
Bye.

417
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,680
Bye.

418
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,680
Bye.

419
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,680
Bye.

420
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,680
Bye.

421
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
Bye.

422
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,680
Bye.

423
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
Bye.

424
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:24,680
Wish I could make an alliance with Qian Ren earlier.

425
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:29,680
Wish I could fall in love with Crash earlier.

426
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,680
You even looked at me.

427
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,680
You're so stubborn.

428
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,680
You can't even read your lips.

429
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,680
How can you know what to make a wish?

430
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,680
It's not working if you say it.

431
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,680
The school's meeting is tomorrow.

432
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,680
The check-in will be in advance.

433
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,680
And our school will close at 12 o'clock.

434
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,680
You won't be able to eat then.

435
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,680
Xue Jiao, I'm leaving first.

436
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,680
I'll send you off.

437
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,680
No need.

438
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,680
I'll go by myself.

439
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,680
You're an insecure person.

440
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,680
You'll add an insecurity factor to the school meeting.

441
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,680
Let's go.

442
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,680
Xue Jiao, I'm leaving first.

443
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,680
The cafeteria will be waiting for you tomorrow.

444
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,680
The cafeteria.

445
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,680
The cafeteria is waiting for me.

446
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,680
I'm going to find you.

447
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,680
The cafeteria.

448
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,680
Bye.

449
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,680
Did you give me a macaron?

450
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,680
Did he give me a macaron?

451
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,680
I didn't give it to you.

452
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,680
I'll buy the cake.

453
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,680
So what?

454
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,680
He gave it to me.

455
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,680
You don't need to buy the cake for me.

456
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,680
I'm sorry, Brother An.

457
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,680
I didn't mean to...

458
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
You...

459
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:06,680
I'm looking for you in my memory

460
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:13,680
I'm looking for you in the wind and rain

461
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,680
I'm lucky to catch up.

462
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
I'm going to find you.

463
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,680
Happy birthday.

464
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,680
Even if the weather is bad

465
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:49,680
When the wind brushes past the close two corners again

466
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:54,680
I'll take you through the four seasons

467
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,680
Slow down. Don't choke.

468
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,680
The schedule of the school meeting has not changed yet.

469
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,680
You have to inform me in the morning that I have an English class.

470
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,680
This is the legendary college life.

471
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,680
Come on, Xue Zhao.

472
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,680
Don't mention it.

473
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,680
I was stunned when I saw the final exam paper.

474
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,680
It's not high school content at all.

475
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,680
I'm late. I'm not going to sleep.

476
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,680
Take it.

477
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,680
Come on. Come on.

478
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
I didn't hear it wrong.

479
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,680
It's time for class.

480
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,680
Why is there no one?

481
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,680
Teacher

482
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,680
You are

483
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,680
I'm here for an English class.

484
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,680
Isn't this an English class?

485
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,680
Why is there only one person?

486
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,680
You are the only student.

487
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
Classmate

488
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,680
Our first English class is a set-up.

489
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,680
Every new student who scores more than 90 points in the final exam

490
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,680
Can be exempted

491
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,680
It seems that you

492
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,680
So only I didn't get the right to be exempted.

493
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,680
It's been a few years.

494
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,680
I still saw someone for the first time.

495
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,680
Come to the first English class

496
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,680
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

497
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,680
This class is one-on-one.

498
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,680
You are also making money.

499
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,680
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

500
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,680
Celebrate in advance

501
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,680
Our 3A masterpiece

502
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,680
Steal the winning ticket

503
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,680
Cheers

504
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:04,680
Cheers

505
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,680
Team leader

506
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,680
How can you be so poor?

507
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,680
I don't know.

508
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,680
I don't know.

509
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,680
I don't know.

510
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,680
I don't know.

511
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,680
I don't know.

512
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,680
Why do you look so tired?

513
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
Exactly.

514
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,680
Let's have a drink.

515
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
Come on.

516
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,680
You forgot that you don't drink.

517
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,680
Right.

518
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,680
The project has just started.

519
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,680
You're so energetic.

520
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,680
That's your style.

521
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,680
It's my fault.

522
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,680
I forced you to drink.

523
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,680
I'll punish myself.

524
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,680
I think

525
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,680
you're the one who's wrong.

526
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,680
Who would want to join the team

527
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,680
if they come out to drink?

528
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,680
Especially you.

529
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,680
Exactly.

530
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,680
Right.

531
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,680
Team leader, let's drink.

532
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,680
I'm so unlucky.

533
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,680
Okay, remember to come later.

534
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,680
What are you looking at?

535
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,680
Brother,

536
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,680
you're changing your team.

537
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,680
You're so naughty.

538
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,680
This is just a third of the alcohol.

539
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,680
Right.

540
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,680
Team leader is drunk.

541
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,680
Who are you looking at?

542
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,680
Team leader.

543
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,680
Does your wife know

544
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,680
that you're harassing your college students here?

545
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,680
Okay, wait for me.

546
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,680
Okay.

547
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,680
What a coincidence.

548
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,680
It's not a coincidence.

549
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,680
You've been looking for me for days.

550
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,680
Now the entire college knows

551
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,680
that someone is reading the door.

552
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,680
No.

553
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,680
I just want to know

554
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,680
where you're going to study.

555
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,680
Second-grade college, are you satisfied?

556
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,680
That's not what I mean.

557
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,680
I mean the college.

558
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,680
Let's go.

559
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,680
Let's go.

560
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,680
Shi Yue, wait.

561
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,680
Wait.

562
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,680
Shi Yue, wait.

563
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,680
What?

564
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,680
Why are you here?

565
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,680
What's wrong with this place?

566
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,680
Who are you?

567
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,680
Can you handle it?

568
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,680
Let's go.

569
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,680
I'm not trying to control you.

570
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,680
I'm just...

571
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,680
I'm just...

572
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,680
What are you?

573
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,680
Are you saying that you care about me?

574
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,680
Thank you.

575
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,680
My mom doesn't care about me anymore.

576
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,680
Save it.

577
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,680
Shi Yue.

578
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,680
I'm warning you.

579
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,680
Don't follow me.

580
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,680
Itís okay.

581
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,680
Checked.

582
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,680
Yes.

583
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,680
I'll get it done.

584
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,480
Wait.

585
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,440
Why is it so fast?

586
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,960
That's right.

587
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,760
There aren't many classes for third grade.

588
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,040
Everyone is saving money.

589
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,440
Don't talk about third grade.

590
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,360
The classes for second grade

591
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,560
are not going to be in the top class.

592
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,760
You all got it?

593
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,760
Yes.

594
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,120
Impossible.

595
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,440
I even wrote the code for the class.

596
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,000
How can someone be faster than me?

597
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,000
Just your initial code

598
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,200
for the first few classes?

599
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,080
You're still trying to be slow.

600
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,440
Save it.

601
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,600
Did you see the signal

602
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,800
before the class you chose?

603
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,680
Those are all required for grades.

604
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,320
You're just so slow

605
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,600
at the final exam.

606
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,680
You should focus on dancing and music.

607
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,560
Learn some skills.

608
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,720
You'll starve to death.

609
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,880

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,640
Hey,

615
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,600
how many points do we need?

616
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:12,920
Hey.

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,760

620
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,400

621
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:17,720
I think I need ten Ö

622
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,200
And write it down.

623
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,480
If you want ten...

624
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,860
I'll study myself.

625
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,360
I need to apply for ten students instead of one.

626
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,200
In fact, so many of them.

627
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,400
When can I choose the time?

628
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,360
Let's do nothing in the semester,

629
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,680
let's focus on choosing graduates now.

630
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,960
Why?

631
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,760
Don't tell him it's your textbook.

632
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,160
It's fɳç acquirements,

633

00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,560
Straight up frauds of!"

635
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,760
What did he say?

636
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,280
I heard that he fed the mosquitoes

637
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,720
with no Lieutenant from the lab.

638
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,000
There was a failed

639
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,600
rutey student teacher

640
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,120
who got internet cells on him.

641
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,440
Car Officer?

642
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,120
And he was kicked out eventually.

643
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,800
I urge you to cherish your life

644
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,760
and stay away from the frauds.

645
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,080
You're still able to live there,

646
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,000
but not in a man's place.

647
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,200
is not a normal person.

648
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,680
A unmanned driving lab?

649
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,960
Isn't that...

650
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,080
Your high-speed performance is not bad.

651
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,760
But it's more prominent in space integration.

652
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,360
Our unmanned driving lab

653
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,000
needs to have a code thinking.

654
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,600
Your probability and statistics are not good.

655
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,040
Next.

656
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,720
But after my review,

657
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,720
there's a very famous bug in your program.

658
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,520
We bought a fatal bug in his program.

659
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,840
Brother,

660
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,480
isn't he a space explorer?

661
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,840
Who taught you to work hard?

662
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,920
Although we're not that famous,

663
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,800
we're still famous.

664
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
This is really...

665
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,240
It's really troublesome to have him here.

666
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,600
He's a dog on a dog's back.

667
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,880
You know him?

668
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,000
He's a big boss in the lab.

669
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,360
He's not a big boss,

670
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,640
but he's a big boss.

671
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,000
He's in charge of everything

672
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
from top to bottom in the unit.

673
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,480
He's a master of tricks.

674
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,520
Everyone who comes in must be taken by him.

675
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,400
I still don't understand.

676
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,320
I've suffered a lot from him.

677
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,840
Next.

678
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,080
It's your turn.

679
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,880
You're a freshman.

680
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,840
How dare you come to this school?

681
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,960
Hello, Brother.

682
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,040
Although I'm a freshman,

683
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,120
I'm confident...

684
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,880
Wait.

685
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,840
Your score in the college entrance examination

686
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,920
is the lowest I've ever seen.

687
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,280
How did you get in?

688
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,680
You're still so ugly.

689
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,120
You like to pick up people.

690
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,760
It means I'm lucky.

691
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,640
I'm sorry.

692
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,160
Your good luck ends here.

693
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,160
Next.

694
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,640
Wait, Brother.

695
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,000
You have to give me a reason.

696
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,960
Renny is new here.

697
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,080
It's not like he's boss.

698
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,760
Let me show you a round of respect.

699
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,920
I don't need a reason either.

700
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,080
It's a big rule.

701
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,240
As the deputy,

702
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,640
you must never question seniors.

703
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,160
When will we get back raised from this rule?

704
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,880
Ready for tomorrow.

705
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,640
Next.

706
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,920
Did adelante Lin really say that?

707
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,320
I'm not worried at all.

708
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:33,960
It's true.

709
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,040
The Co-uthan Löwe,

710
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,960
Today...

711
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,040
He's not that smart.

712
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,400
But you never talked to him.

713
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,280
Don't make a hasty conclusion

714
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,480
and get in touch with him.

715
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,360
He's not hasty at all.

716
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,800
I know him too well.

717
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,720
I'm just being reasonable.

718
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,440
And people like you in the lab

719
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,000
will miss out on many people like me.

720
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,720
You were avoiding me a while ago.

721
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,440
Why are you getting up now

722
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,080
and trying to enter our lab?

723
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,360
I'm just trying to get a good grade.

724
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,320
Although...

725
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,760
But I won't let you get in.

726
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,400
You have to get in through your real skills.

727
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,720
I'm not here to beg you to let me in.

728
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,680
Brother Li.

729
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,520
I definitely have real skills.

730
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,680
I got into Jinghai University

731
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,000
after I got into the college.

732
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,800
The first thing you did

733
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,000
was to become the only freshman

734
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,240
who didn't pass the English final exam.

735
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,160
The second thing is that

736
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,800
you didn't choose the course you wanted to study.

737
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,120
You chose Professor Tan's lab

738
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,880
without thinking about it.

739
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,760
Don't be so mean.

740
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,720
Zhang Hao.

741
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,200
You haven't found any students

742
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,600
who are in the same state as you.

743
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,680
So I have to be careful with you.

744
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,800
Just do the most basic thing.

745
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,040
Don't think about getting fat.

746
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,440
You don't have enough knowledge.

747
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,440
Just wait for the people who quit other classes

748
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,840
to come out of the list and then you can choose.

749
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,800
It's not something you should think about

750
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,600
at this stage of driving the lab.

751
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,200
Lin Jiao Dong is not completely wrong.

752
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,880
I said I don't like that Lin.

753
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,320
But he entered the lab.

754
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,400
Let's wait and see.

755
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,000
I'll be the only one who can

756
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,040
appear in the list of members

757
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,880
of the lab for at least a month.

758
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,080
No need to wait a month.

759
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,720
Tomorrow is Professor Tan's first public programming class.

760
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,720
It's his tradition to give freshmen a new subject.

761
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,120
See if you can pass the first level.

762
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,200
I will definitely pass.

763
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

764
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,840
Master,

765
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,240
what kind of work are you doing?

766
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,640
Boring.

767
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,840
Shi Yuan,

768
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,360
why are you avoiding me?

769
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,480
I'm avoiding you?

770
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,280
No.

771
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,920
You're not the one I care about.

772
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,920
Why should I avoid you?

773
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,960
It doesn't matter.

774
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,800
You don't care about me.

775
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,960
I shouldn't care about you.

776
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,360
Since that's the case,

777
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,480
let's not talk about it.

778
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,320
Let's go.

779
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,680
This is to queen you.

780
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,080
Where did that person come from?

781
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,480
You are here, right?

782
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,200
I'll buy you a drink.

783
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,000
Shi Yue,

784
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,840
are you here to get angry with your mom?

785
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,920
Of course not.

786
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,400
That's good.

787
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,600
I'll do whatever you want.

788
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,640
Really?

789
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,560
Yes.

790
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,000
You're here.

791
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,200
Why don't you drink?

792
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,720
Drink.

793
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,120
I can't drink.

794
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,680
Didn't you say you'd do whatever I like?

795
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,800
Shi Yue, come here.

796
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,480
I'm Zhou Shi Yue, the representative of Class Three, Class One.

797
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,440
Zhou Shi Yue.

798
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,560
You too!

799
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,160
I hope you don't fail the exam!

800
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,360
Shi Yue,

801
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,760
I've seen a different you today.

802
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,600
Even if you're drinking,

803
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,000
you have to compete with others.

804
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,400
Drinking is the happiest thing for you, right?

805
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,400
I'll drink with you.

806
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,080
I'll be happy with you.

807
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,600
I'll be happy when I see you happy.

808
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,240
It's true.

809
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,040
I'm very happy.

810
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,120
Going home

811
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,600
Shi Yue?

812
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,360
Where are you going?

813
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,000
What if I forget you?

814
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,400
I'm exhausted.

815
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,560
Let me apply For losers to lose all my glory.

816
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,200
You're stupid.

817
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,440
Don't cover me up.

818
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,640
Hey, don't call me by my name.

819
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,040
I'm sorry.

820
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,840
I'm sorry. I embarrassed you.

821
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,840
What you need to do now is to sit properly.

822
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,240
Then I'll take you home. Understand?

823
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,040
You're so nice.

824
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,640
You're sick.

825
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,840
What?

826
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,640
Not me.

827
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:30,440
I have a little alcohol allergy.

828
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,440
I mean you're sick.

829
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,840
Do you know how hard it was for me to get you back from the bar?

830
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,440
Don't drink if you can't drink.

831
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,440
Who gives me a chance to get a bonus?

832
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,640
I didn't force you.

833
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,240
If you didn't ask me to drink,

834
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,240
I would have to drink more.

835
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,640
Then why did you do what I asked you to do?

836
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,840
What if I ask you to die?

837
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,240
I'm not going to die.

838
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,840
I'm going to die.

839
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,640
I'm going to die.

840
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,240
Brother, come back.

841
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,440
I'm impressed with you.

842
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,240
You really went when I asked you to go.

843
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,240
Are you stupid?

844
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,240
You're laughing.

845
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,440
You're laughing at me.

846
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,040
You were always laughing when I was in high school.

847
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,240
You were so nice back then.

848
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:27,640
You were the best in school.

849
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,240
Sometimes I wanted to go back to high school.

850
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,640
But I really didn't want to go back to school.

851
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,040
But the girls back then were really...

852
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,040
really...

853
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,840
Why is the trash can here?

854
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,840
It's perfect.

855
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,440
Lin Ze?

856
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,240
How much did you drink?

857
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,240
How many dishes did you drink?

858
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,240
You...

859
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,240
You're a big drinker.

860
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,240
You're a big drinker.

861
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,240
You...

862
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,040
Why did you lie down here?

863
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,040
I was just trying to get some rest.

864
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,040
What rest?

865
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,840
You just know to rest.

866
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,640
You almost got knocked out by the body.

867
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,640
Get up.

868
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,440
Get up.

869
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,440
Hurry up.

870
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,440
My legs.

871
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,040
It stinks.

872
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:40,840
Don't.

873
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,640
Don't fall.

874
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,440
Bei establishing company withnie

875
00:42:54,440 --> 00:43:10,840
for refrains from suing

876
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,240
Öz struck by an unpacked academic

877
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,640
Ar OS

878
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,260
person, the ab非常的

879
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,260
How careful I am

880
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:26,500
There will be no empty voices

881
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,220
Separate memories

882
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:34,860
Every line is wrong

883
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:40,740
We are thinking of each other

884
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,020
Let fate be destined

885
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:48,820
Let us give all courage

886
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:54,220
I am willing to travel with you through time

887
00:43:55,620 --> 00:44:02,260
If you also understand the secrets in my eyes

888
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:08,500
You will find that you have always been in my heart

889
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:18,860
I try to open my arms

890
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:23,020
Because of the love

891
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,060
I am listening to the wind

892
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:32,380
The wind is blowing, it doesn't matter

893
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:36,700
There is a sound very close

894
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:42,380
I know it must be you

895
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:56,060
I try to open my arms

896
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:00,700
Because of the love

897
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,660
I am listening to the wind

898
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:10,220
The wind is blowing, it doesn't matter

899
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:14,460
There is a sound very close

900
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:20,620
I know it must be you
