1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Try to grow the flowers in the summer

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now tell the truth about life

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's not complicated to count the flowers

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The youth is swaying

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We are getting stronger

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My heart is still hot and boiling

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I will be brave to fly with you

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
My love is still hot and boiling

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The bright and smiling eyes

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Let us cross the barrier of time

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I am not good at fighting

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I can't see the enemy

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I didn't even fight back

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I am not weak, I am just stupid

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Expl Alicia

16
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This doesn't seem like even a bathroom

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's raining.

18
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,520
I have to go back and meet them.

19
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,160
Do you think

20
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,840
the weather suddenly got colder?

21
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,400
Yes.

22
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
The weather in the mountains changes so quickly.

23
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,800
Look at you.

24
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,240
It's so comfortable to sleep in the wind.

25
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,160
It's so cold.

26
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,160
It's so cold.

27
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,160
It's so cold.

28
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,160
It's so cold.

29
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
It's so cold.

30
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,160
It's so cold.

31
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,160
It's so cold.

32
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,200
I think...

33
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,200
Brother Li.

34
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:21,040
Why haven't you returned yet? It's raining.

35
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,920
Can you stay there tonight?

36
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,480
It's so cool that you could hear聊音。

37
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,480
You don't need to make a fuss.

38
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,240
Call her.

39
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,760
Sorry, the number you dialed is currently unavailable.

40
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,440
Please try again later.

41
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,240
No one answered.

42
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,240
Sorry, the number you dialed is currently unavailable.

43
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,600
Her phone is here.

44
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,040
That's not good.

45
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,560
She's a big-time worker.

46
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,120
She can't be lost.

47
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,800
Go find her.

48
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,720
I'll go over there.

49
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,400
I'll go over there.

50
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,960
I'm not going anywhere.

51
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,400
Hurry up.

52
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:45,920
Don't panic.

53
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,800
When will you stop being panic?

54
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,920
The camp is so big.

55
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,360
What if we get lost in the forest?

56
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,640
I'll give you a hand.

57
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,000
Gu Mingze,

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,240
go find her over there.

59
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,920
I'll go over there.

60
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,960
The rest of the boys will send the girls to the hotel.

61
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,680
I'm not going to the hotel.

62
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,520
I'm going to find someone.

63
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,200
Okay.

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Gu Mingze, you're old.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,640
Watch her.

66
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,400
But call the police if you can't find her in half an hour.

67
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,520
Zhou Shiyue and I can help.

68
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,440
I can help too.

69
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,880
Xue Qiao didn't bring her phone.

70
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,440
She might find it herself.

71
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:14,800
How about this?

72
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,840
Qianli, you wait here.

73
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,160
The girls will wait in the car.

74
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,920
But in half an hour,

75
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,160
you can go to the hotel

76
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,440
if you can't find her.

77
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,120
Okay.

78
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,200
Did you really not see her?

79
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,600
I'm not sure

80
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,040
if she was the one.

81
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,560
I think I saw her.

82
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,120
Emergency broadcast.

83
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,520
The road is blocked.

84
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
Stop.

85
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,520
Stop.

86
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
Stop.

87
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,520
Stop.

88
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,520
Stop.

89
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,520
Stop.

90
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,520
Stop.

91
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,520
Stop.

92
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,520
Stop.

93
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,120
Xue Qiao.

94
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,120
Xue Qiao.

95
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,720
Brother, can we split up?

96
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,520
No.

97
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,520
It's getting heavier.

98
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,920
What if it's full of blood?

99
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,920
Let's go over there.

100
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Okay.

101
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,320
Xue Qiao.

102
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,520
Why am I so unlucky?

103
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
Stop.

104
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
Stop.

105
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,520
Stop.

106
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,520
Gu Xue Qiao.

107
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,520
Gu Xue Qiao.

108
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,280
Where are you?

109
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,400
What is happening here?

110
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,560
What is this?

111
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,360
Yeah, this is the Purple Phoenix Capture.

112
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,820
Where is the Purple Phoenix Capture?

113
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,120
Don't jump!

114
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,120
It's not easy for me to come back to life.

115
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,520
I can't lose important people again.

116
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,320
It's not easy for me to come back to life.

117
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,120
Don't let me be the one to explain it.

118
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,520
Don't jump!

119
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,120
It's not easy for me to come back to life.

120
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,120
Don't jump!

121
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,120
Don't jump!

122
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,120
Even if I have to go to heaven

123
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:05,120
When the wind passes by my close eyes again

124
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,120
I will take you through the four seasons

125
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,120
I will take you through the four seasons

126
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,120
How is it? Did you find it?

127
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,120
How is it?

128
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,120
There is no news from the temporary residence.

129
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,120
I don't know where I went for a day.

130
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,120
There is no news from the temporary residence.

131
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,120
I'm so anxious.

132
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,120
You put on your clothes first.

133
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,120
When you were looking for it, I took it in your bag.

134
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,120
It's clean. Don't catch a cold.

135
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,120
Thank you for your help.

136
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,120
I don't know where the temporary residence is now.

137
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,120
Yu Zi, have you found it?

138
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,120
Have you found it?

139
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,120
I'll find it for you.

140
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
Don't fight.

141
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,120
Did you hear what your brother said?

142
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,120
We called the police.

143
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,120
It's the temporary residence.

144
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,120
It's the temporary residence.

145
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
Be careful.

146
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,120
Xue Xiao, where did you go?

147
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,120
Xue Xiao, I...

148
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,120
I got lost in the woods.

149
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,120
Why did you go to the woods?

150
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,120
Are you hurt?

151
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,120
Where did you get hurt?

152
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,120
Are you okay?

153
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,120
I fell down.

154
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,120
Are you hurt?

155
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,120
No, no, no.

156
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,120
Are you cold?

157
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,120
Who took you to the temporary residence?

158
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,120
You know that Xue Xiao got lost and went into the woods.

159
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
But you didn't tell me.

160
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,120
Right?

161
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
Hello, dad.

162
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,120
Did you find your sister?

163
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,120
Don't worry. I found her.

164
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,120
That's good.

165
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,120
I'll go with you to the school to get some money.

166
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,120
I don't need it.

167
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,120
You don't have to give me a step.

168
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
You can change your clothes first.

169
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,120
When you were looking for it,

170
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,120
I took it for you.

171
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,120
It's clean.

172
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,120
Don't catch a cold.

173
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
Why is it so big?

174
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,120
It's okay.

175
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,120
Sir, you're so cold.

176
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,120
It's okay.

177
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
You're so clumsy.

178
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,120
Let me do it.

179
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,120
You're so clumsy.

180
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
I'm sorry.

181
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,120
I'm sorry.

182
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,120
I'm sorry.

183
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,120
I'm sorry.

184
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,120
I'm sorry.

185
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,120
Xue Xiao, you're so unlucky.

186
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
It's raining and you're lost.

187
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,120
When you come back, the rain stops.

188
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,120
It's a pity that Brother Lin is fighting.

189
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,120
Here.

190
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,120
I've made the room for you.

191
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,120
Go take a bath.

192
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
Thank you, Brother Lin.

193
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,120
How about I open it for everyone?

194
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,120
Open a better one.

195
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,120
We'll talk about it when you get up.

196
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,120
Hello, Dr. Cai.

197
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,120
You're still a student.

198
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,120
Will you catch a cold?

199
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,120
I'm leaving.

200
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
Shi Yue.

201
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,120
Shi Yue.

202
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,120
Let's go back.

203
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,120
Didn't you ask me to leave?

204
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,120
Stop it.

205
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,120
It's dark and slippery.

206
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
What if you're in danger?

207
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
Leave me alone.

208
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,120
I told you to leave me alone.

209
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,120
Let go of him.

210
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,120
Gu Mingze.

211
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,120
Gu Mingze.

212
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,120
You're crazy.

213
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,120
You let go of him.

214
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,120
You're crazy.

215
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,120
Guess who?

216
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,120
You're crazy.

217
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,120
THEEEEE...

218
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
rorale

219
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
The weather has been good.

220
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,120
I can take a shower anytime I want.

221
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
Great.

222
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,120
You're living with boyfriend.

223
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,120
And you're trying to refuse.

224
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,120
Bye.

225
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,120
Is it perfect?

226
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,120
Thank you, Dr. Cui.

227
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,120
Thank you.

228
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,120
I'm sorry, sir.

229
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,720
Unless there's a fire,

230
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,120
or a lock inside,

231
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,520
we have no right to open it.

232
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,320
Then...

233
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,120
Forget it. I'll open a new room.

234
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,320
I'll take a shower.

235
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,720
Then, please provide me with your ID card.

236
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,720
I'll handle it for you.

237
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,320
My ID card is in that room.

238
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,920
Mr. Lin.

239
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,520
Mr. Lin.

240
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,520
Thank you.

241
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,520
This room is not a private room.

242
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,920
Take a shower in his room

243
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,120
and have a rest.

244
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,920
Thank you.

245
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,520
This is for you.

246
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,920
This...

247
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120
Don't be shy.

248
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,920
You got the glue.

249
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
You deserve it.

250
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,520
I'll take this with me

251
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,720
to comfort the injured glue.

252
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,120
Thank you.

253
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,320
Shi Yuan.

254
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,520
It's getting late.

255
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,520
Why don't we go back first?

256
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,920
I'd rather go home.

257
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,920
Okay.

258
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
You don't have to go back.

259
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,120
I'll go with you wherever you want to go.

260
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,120
How about I send you back?

261
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,920
Go home?

262
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,520
Okay.

263
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,120
I don't want to go home.

264
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,320
I'd rather sit here quietly.

265
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,320
Actually,

266
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,120
Xue Xiao has told everyone

267
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,720
that you didn't do it on purpose.

268
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,120
Shi Yuan.

269
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,320
People have to make mistakes

270
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,120
in their whole life.

271
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
Why don't you

272
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,520
apologize to Xue Xiao?

273
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,920
He'll forgive you.

274
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,720
No.

275
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,920
I don't want him to be an old man.

276
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,320
I don't want him to be an old man.

277
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,920
I did it on purpose.

278
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,720
I saw him walk in the wrong direction.

279
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,520
I did it on purpose.

280
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
I'm a bad person.

281
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,120
But...

282
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,320
But why?

283
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,120
You and Xue Xiao used to be so close.

284
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,120
You wanted to wear the same pants.

285
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,720
Why did you break up?

286
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,520
You made it...

287
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,520
You made it so embarrassing.

288
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,520
Do you want to hear the truth?

289
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:54,920
I...

290
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,120
I'm jealous of him.

291
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,920
I've always been

292
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,320
very jealous of him.

293
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,720
I'm so jealous that I'm going crazy.

294
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,920
You...

295
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,520
Jealous of him?

296
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,720
Is it because of me?

297
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,320
Is it because of me?

298
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
Why?

299
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,920
Who is it because of me?

300
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,920
No.

301
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,720
Gu Ming Zi, are you crazy?

302
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,320
Why do I think it's you?

303
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
I'm done.

304
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,320
Why didn't you answer it?

305
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,720
I thought a good girl

306
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,720
wouldn't not answer her mother's call.

307
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,720
I can only be a good girl.

308
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,320
Are you hungry?

309
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,920
I'll get you something to eat.

310
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,120
It's you.

311
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,320
I'm hungry.

312
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,520
I'm hungry.

313
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
I'm hungry.

314
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,920
I'm hungry.

315
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,120
I'm hungry.

316
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,320
I'm hungry.

317
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,520
I'm hungry.

318
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
I'm hungry.

319
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,120
I'm hungry.

320
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,120
Gu Ming Zi, where did you get the bread?

321
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,720
I ate it before.

322
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,920
Wait a minute.

323
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
I'm hungry.

324
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,920
I'm hungry.

325
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
I'm hungry.

326
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,320
I'm hungry.

327
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,520
I'm hungry.

328
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
I'm hungry.

329
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,920
I'm hungry.

330
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,120
I'm hungry.

331
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,320
I'm hungry.

332
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,920
I'm hungry.

333
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,120
I'm hungry.

334
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,120
I'm hungry.

335
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,320
What did you draw?

336
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,720
Why is it a crying face?

337
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,320
It's just like a smiling face.

338
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,920
It's so ugly.

339
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,120
I don't want it.

340
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,520
That's right.

341
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,920
From now on, if you hate someone,

342
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,760
You're so annoying.

343
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,320
You like someone,

344
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,000
and you just like him.

345
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,560
It's like what you said.

346
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,600
You're just like that.

347
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,200
Accept it if you can.

348
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,080
If you can't, just let him go.

349
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,760
Anyway,

350
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,240
someone will like you.

351
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,440
What's wrong?

352
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,640
Nothing.

353
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,960
I just suddenly feel

354
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,200
that you're not as silly as I thought.

355
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,720
No.

356
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,040
How silly was I in your eyes?

357
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,800
Zhou Shui, tell me.

358
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,480
No.

359
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,160
Just tell me.

360
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm not saying that. I'm just...

361
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,560
It's just...

362
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,600
It's not that silly.

363
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
Just a little.

364
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,000
I can't do it even if I try.

365
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,800
I'm so smart.

366
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,480
You try first.

367
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,920
I'm a genius.

368
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,560
No.

369
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,360
No.

370
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:15,800
I don't want it.

371
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,360
I just made it for you.

372
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,000
Okay.

373
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,160
Didn't you say that you want to make up for me?

374
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,360
Let's make up for it with instant noodles.

375
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,440
Do you want to make up for it?

376
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,760
There's hot water, vegetables, meat, and bread.

377
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,280
It's all in here. It's nutritious.

378
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,720
This meat is not enough for me to weigh.

379
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,440
Just say if it's good or not.

380
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,680
It's really good.

381
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,840
It's so good.

382
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,520
It's so good.

383
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,560
It's so good.

384
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,040
It's great.

385
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,880
I feel like my body is warming up.

386
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,960
I almost froze to death.

387
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,440
That's what I'm thinking about.

388
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,720
I know you better.

389
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,720
Is this Ms. Gu Xuejiao?

390
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,640
Yes.

391
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,880
This is the medicine Mr. Ling bought for you.

392
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,280
Oh!

393
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,200
plugin online shopping.

394
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,000
You're really perverted.

395
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,720
You just send them medicine and you know how to send chocolates too.

396
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,480
You're not like that partridge.

397
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,280
Very determined to sell you and make you wear an ice tape.

398
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,440
Brother Li Shou was very harsh on you today.

399
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,000
Are you nervous?

400
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,360
Why should I be nervous?

401
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,800
I'm just trying to hug you.

402
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,760
I'm not nervous.

403
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,720
Be sincere.

404
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,720
Answer me.

405
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,520
Who is it?

406
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,640
You sent so many messages.

407
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,880
Is there something urgent?

408
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,720
Qi Lei said in the group that

409
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,000
he had got the university's score line.

410
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,360
Where is Junhai University?

411
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,120
What's the college's name?

412
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,680
Junhai University?

413
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,800
Not yet.

414
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,240
Why didn't the school

415
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,800
give the scores in unison?

416
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,040
It makes me nervous.

417
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,680
I'm waiting here every day.

418
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,520
No.

419
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,120
I'm waiting now.

420
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,160
My throat is a little dry.

421
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,720
Tian Tian, I want to drink some ice coke.

422
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,800
Let's go to buy a bottle.

423
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,240
Let's talk about the coke later.

424
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,280
I'm in a bit of a sudden situation now.

425
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,880
I have to go back to the room to solve it.

426
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,160
This one.

427
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,880
A copy for Gu Mingze.

428
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,760
And a copy for Zhou Shiqing.

429
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,480
Give them later.

430
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,920
And then one for each of us.

431
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,960
I'm going up first.

432
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,320
Okay.

433
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:44,800
Go.

434
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,000
Hello, mom.

435
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,040
Xue Jiao.

436
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,360
The score line of Junhai University is out.

437
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,600
Sun Tian, Tian Teng.

438
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
You actually hid

439
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,560
such a big bag of snacks.

440
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,360
You only let me eat instant noodles.

441
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,400
Are you taking a shower?

442
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,160
I really wasn't full just now.

443
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,600
How is your shower?

444
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,000
Can I come in and wash my hands?

445
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,360
I want to eat more.

446
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,560
Eat.

447
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,160
Why did you close the door?

448
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,160
I'm going to take a shower.

449
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,120
Why did you lock the door?

450
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,720
You're so annoying.

451
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,440
I'm so happy.

452
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,880
I can't hold it anymore.

453
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,240
I'll tell you first.

454
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,560
I wanted to be the first one to tell Brother Lin.

455
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,560
I finally got into Junhai University

456
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,400
as I wished.

457
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,320
I don't want to do anything now.

458
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,760
I just want to drink a cold coke.

459
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,840
Hurry up and wash your hands.

460
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,040
Let's go shopping together.

461
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,280
Forget it.

462
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,040
I'll call Brother Lin first

463
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,360
and tell him the good news.

464
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,480
Sorry, the number you dialed is power off.

465
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,400
Sorry, the number you dialed is power off.

466
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,520
He might be busy.

467
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,200
Tian Tian.

468
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,520
Didn't you just ask me

469
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,880
if I felt nervous?

470
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,560
Actually,

471
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,960
the moment I saw him in the woods,

472
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,200
I wanted to see him

473
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,080
during the college days.

474
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,000
Tian Tian.

475
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,240
Why don't you say anything?

476
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,360
Tian Tian.

477
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,480
Are you okay, Tian Tian?

478
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,680
Tian Tian.

479
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,600
Are you dizzy?

480
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,120
If you don't say anything,

481
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,200
I'll knock on the door.

482
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,280
Tian Tian.

483
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,840
Why are you here?

484
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,680
This is Gu Mingze's room.

485
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,680
You seem to be lost.

486
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,480
Take your time. I'll go first.

487
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,400
Tian Tian.

488
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,920
I really didn't expect

489
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,160
that Yushu Li was Brother Lin.

490
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,120
Brother Lin.

491
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,560
Come on.

492
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,440
It's my fault for leaving so quickly

493
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,400
and didn't tell you to celebrate.

494
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,280
I even treated you as the first person

495
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,200
who shared the good news in the world.

496
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,200
You just poked me.

497
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,760
How is Brother Lin's figure?

498
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,120
This is Gu Mingze's room.

499
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,600
You seem to be lost.

500
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,240
I didn't see it.

501
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,160
You must have seen it.

502
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,400
But I didn't see it.

503
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,360
You must have seen it.

504
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:33,880
You didn't see it.

505
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,880
It can't be this expression.

506
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,320
I know.

507
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,520
I didn't know it.

508
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,600
I really didn't see it.

509
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,320
Let's go.

510
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,080
Let's go.

511
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,840
I really didn't see it.

512
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,320
You didn't see it, right?

513
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,120
Yishu.

514
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,240
It's impossible.

515
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,360
It's really not true.

516
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,360
You think you saw it?

517
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,320
Xue Qiao.

518
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,160
First, I'm sorry for

519
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,360
what happened to Wulong today.

520
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,680
Secondly, because of the incident of Wulong,

521
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,840
I accidentally became the first person

522
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,280
who was shared the good news of you getting into Jinghai University.

523
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,760
Dr. Cai, please...

524
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,360
So this bottle of ice coke

525
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,240
will be given to you by me.

526
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,840
Lastly,

527
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,040
I wish you a successful study at Jinghai University.

528
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,240
Lin Zhi Hua.

529
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,320
Gu Xue Qiao can get into Jinghai University.

530
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,560
Why can't you?

531
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,920
You're really useless.

532
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,360
You're in high school for three years.

533
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:28,960
Tell me.

534
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,760
How much effort and money did I spend on you?

535
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,960
Tell me.

536
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,880
Is this how you make me feel proud?

537
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,760
My child

538
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,560
lost to Li Si Tong's child.

539
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,600
How can I face you?

540
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,080
How can I face you?

541
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,160
I'm so sorry.

542
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,160
I'm so sorry.

543
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,160
I'm so sorry.

544
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,160
I'm so sorry.

545
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,160
I'm so sorry.

546
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,160
I'm so sorry.

547
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
I'm so sorry.

548
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,160
I'm so sorry.

549
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,680
How can I face you?

550
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,960
You useless thing.

551
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,560
You only know to embarrass me in front of others.

552
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,960
Say something.

553
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,240
What's wrong?

554
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,520
Do you want me to teach you how to shout?

555
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,160
You're so shameless.

556
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,200
I won't do it.

557
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,920
She's your daughter.

558
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,920
She's not a tool to fight with others.

559
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,120
Are you a pervert?

560
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,400
You're a pervert.

561
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,080
Who are you?

562
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,040
Why do you talk to me like that?

563
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,560
Let Zhou Shi Yin answer the phone.

564
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,800
I'm just a passer-by who can't stand it.

565
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,800
Where is he?

566
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,280
It's you.

567
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,720
So your mother

568
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,680
has always been against you.

569
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,160
After that day,

570
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,680
we all haven't seen Zhou Shi Yin.

571
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,160
It's said that she was caught

572
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,960
and was kidnapped by Li Da.

573
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,360
I don't know how many people

574
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,360
helped her get in.

575
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,920
This should be the biggest

576
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,920
misunderstanding in Wan Jun's eyes.

577
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,640
And Yi Tian Yu

578
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,760
successfully entered the financial department

579
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,760
as a special student.

580
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,800
Yi Tian Yu

581
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,000
successfully entered the financial department as a special student.

582
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,240
Sun Tiantian

583
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,760
didn't go to the university

584
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,440
under the support of his parents.

585
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,440
He went to the dessert shop to be a student.

586
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,440
Gu Ming Ze

587
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,640
was also very confident.

588
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,800
During the summer vacation,

589
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,200
he met a group of friends who were in the same class.

590
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,720
They decided to develop a 3A masterpiece together.

591
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,400
They took a different path from the others.

592
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,200
Qi Lei

593
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,040
went to the foreign country to study.

594
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,960
And I, Gu Xue Jiao,

595
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,760
I want to go to the top!

596
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,880
Two.

597
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,600
One.

598
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
Two.

599
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
Stop.

600
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,400
Everyone, look left.

601
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,400
Hurry up.

602
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,960
Hurry up.

603
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,560
What are you doing?

604
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,280
Sorry, sorry.

605
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,400
I didn't get in the car.

606
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,400
Who is not good at acting?

607
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,960
You still have the energy to argue?

608
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,560
Those who spoke just now,

609
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,560
get out of here.

610
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,360
I advise you not to let me say it again.

611
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,360
Otherwise, everyone will be with you.

612
00:30:46,760 --> 00:31:08,440
He

613
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,480
wants to hear what is my beauty.

614
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,240
My beauty is not mine.

615
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:10,920
It's you.

616
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,640
It's your problem.

617
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,240
What?

618
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,280
Still want to keep pretending?

619
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,480
Attention!

620
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,480
I'm leaving.

621
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,000
Bye.

622
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,560
Bye.

623
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,240
It's so hot.

624
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,600
I'm coming back.

625
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,360
Do you think this is the first time

626
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,760
we have a meal together in our dorm?

627
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,320
Of course not.

628
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,320
After the military training,

629
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,520
shall we have a good meal?

630
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,040
Sure.

631
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,480
Why do you eat so little?

632
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,560
Aren't you afraid of low blood sugar?

633
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,280
Come on.

634
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:57,920
Have a chicken leg.

635
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,520
No.

636
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,440
Thank you.

637
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,840
What are you eating?

638
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,920
Homemade noodles.

639
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,080
I'm sorry.

640
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,080
Don't get so close to me.

641
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,080
I don't like such a big dish.

642
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,080
Don't come into the dorm.

643
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,240
What are you looking at?

644
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,400
Why are you looking at the window?

645
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,400
Brother.

646
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,200
It's so hot.

647
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,400
Don't turn off the air conditioner.

648
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,400
I'm so sorry.

649
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,480
Don't get so close to me.

650
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,480
I don't like such a big dish.

651
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,480
Don't come into the dorm.

652
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,240
Brother.

653
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,960
It's so hot.

654
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,360
Don't turn off the air conditioner.

655
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,360
Aren't you afraid of cold?

656
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,080
It's 36 degrees today.

657
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,280
Are you sure you're cold?

658
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,080
Air conditioning can harm your health.

659
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,280
It can cause air condition.

660
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,680
It can also cause body cold.

661
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,920
I'm a little bit common.

662
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,600
All right.

663
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,800
I'm not hot.

664
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,720
Don't you think

665
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,600
the dorm is like a big steamer now?

666
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,560
We are like a big bag of cooked meat.

667
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,400
When the time comes,

668
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,720
you will be so hot

669
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,200
that you will make us all hot.

670
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,200
Today,

671
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,960
I really

672
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,520
have to eat for once.

673
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,880
You don't believe it, right?

674
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,440
Then I'll tell you with the data.

675
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,480
As for the sample of each city,

676
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,040
the data of the air conditioner

677
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,880
is obviously higher than the body temperature.

678
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,160
What else can I say?

679
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,040
Data won't lie.

680
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,000
The air conditioner

681
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,040
can't be turned on today.

682
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,520
Don't record it yourself.

683
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,360
Don't record it yourself.

684
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,200
I'm the first prize in the second-place competition.

685
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,920
The average score of the mid-high test is double.

686
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,520
I can't even count with you.

687
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,680
As you said,

688
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,680
the data won't lie.

689
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,720
In each city,

690
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,560
the data on the left is smaller than the one on the right.

691
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,000
But the overall statistics are higher than the one on the right.

692
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,280
Does this mean

693
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,320
the conclusion that the air conditioner

694
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,640
can easily cause body cold

695
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,720
is completely wrong?

696
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,840
Really, Shulan.

697
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,640
Did we make a mistake?

698
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,280
You're good at math.

699
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,400
Why don't you calculate it again?

700
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,200
Besides,

701
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,600
the sample of the table is completely different.

702
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,440
We don't know if there's any control variable.

703
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,840
The data can't be used at all.

704
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,880
Shulan,

705
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,200
no matter how good you are at math,

706
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,200
you can't fool us.

707
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,720
Besides,

708
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,160
who can be worse at math

709
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,720
if they can pass the college entrance examination?

710
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,680
Forget it.

711
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,120
You can turn on the air conditioner if you want.

712
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,680
When you get the air conditioner disease,

713
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,240
don't blame me for not reminding you.

714
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,680
No need. Thank you.

715
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,360
How about...

716
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,360
How about we open a little gap in the window

717
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,840
and let the fresh air in?

718
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,320
It can prevent the air from circulating.

719
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,120
It will make you feel more comfortable.

720
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,840
I agree.

721
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,200
I agree, too.

722
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,280
Whatever.

723
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,680
Let's go.

724
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,480
Let's go.

725
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,920
It seems that the Internet is right.

726
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,920
Smoking is a common habit in university dorms.

727
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,040
This is the beginning.

728
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,920
The first stop of the college entrance examination.

729
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,000
We should cooperate with each other.

730
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Come on.

731
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,640
I always think your name is familiar.

732
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,360
Are you the talented girl

733
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,840
who took the high school entrance examination

734
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,040
in the seventh grade of Jinghai?

735
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,240
How do you know?

736
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,320
We are schoolmates.

737
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,320
I'm the one who said

738
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,200
I wanted to go to the college entrance examination in front of the whole school.

739
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,120
I know you.

740
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,400
You are the one who has a lot of achievements

741
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,040
and is the most talented student in the year.

742
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,560
Am I so famous in the world?

743
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,240
It's all rumours. Don't believe it.

744
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,160
I don't believe it when I saw you just now.

745
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,160
Please give me more advice.

746
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,080
I will remember to teach you when I have good knowledge.

747
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,080
Okay.

748
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,080
I'm so tired.

749
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,240
Why do I have to train before I go to bed?

750
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,440
It's the first day. How can you work?

751
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,120
You will be tired after a toothache.

752
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,840
You will break your teeth.

753
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,600
Miss Xiao Yan, it's her.

754
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,880
Where did we go just now?

755
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,680
I asked the director to give me a gift.

756
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,680
You...

757
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,440
Okay, go to train first.

758
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,720
I will understand the situation.

759
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,680
I...

760
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,040
Go.

761
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,640
I'm leaving.

762
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,640
You stay.

763
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,920
Okay.

764
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,640
How come you kept fixing me up lately?

765
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,640
No.

766
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,400
Thank you.

767
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,640
No empty voices

768
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,360
Separate memories

769
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,160
Every step we take

770
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:38,680
Xiao Jiu.

771
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:39,800
Hello.

772
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,160
Mom.

773
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,120
The invitation is ready.

774
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,280
I'll be back soon.

775
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,880
I'm so busy.

776
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,080
I just got the military uniform.

777
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,200
Yes.

778
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:50,840
Yes.

779
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,280
Okay?

780
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,160
I'm in trouble.

781
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,160
No courage

782
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,360
I'm willing to travel with you

783
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,360
through the years

784
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,920
If you also...

785
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,920
No.

786
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:04,760
I just

787
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,400
can't get used to the new environment.

788
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,760
It'll be fine in a few days.

789
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:13,640
...will find you always in my heart.

790
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,880
The difference between university and high school

791
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,480
is that there is no

792
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,800
teacher and parents' encouragement.

793
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,200
Why do you have a conflict

794
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,200
after the military training?

795
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,080
Use it to watch Etiquette.

796
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:46,000
Holding hands

797
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,600
You're an instructor?

798
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,120
Who are you?

799
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,120
Let's go!

800
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,520
I'm fine.

801
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,400
I didn't explain it clearly in the daytime.

802
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,040
Why are you hiding from me?

803
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:38,020
I have to kill all the

804
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,300
people who are in the

805
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,020
university.

806
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,020
Why are you here?

807
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,900
Go to the school canteen to eat early.

808
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,100
Eat early and go home early.

809
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,820
I'm so tired.

810
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,900
I don't want to eat anymore.

811
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,340
Xue Qing.

812
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,460
From now on,

813
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,580
can't we eat in the dormitory?

814
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,500
Sure.

815
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,140
Then you're like Siqi.

816
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,580
You're not talented.

817
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,260
She's a leader of the university.

818
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,020
No.

819
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:14,860
I'd rather not go to the university

820
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,180
after eating.

821
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,020
I think Shulan is definitely a word.

822
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,580
I'm afraid that she will be thin in the dormitory.

823
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,340
This is simple.

824
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,540
Just drink ice.

825
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,940
Play some games.

826
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:26,580
What?

827
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,500
True love adventure.

828
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,340
This sounds fun.

829
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,140
Do you think Shulan will be praised?

830
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,460
I'll kidnap her.

831
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,700
Do you want to try my red bean paste?

832
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,460
No, thanks.

833
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,620
Let me tell you.

834
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,620
After entering the university,

835
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,060
everyone is a genius.

836
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,380
So what if she's full of math?

837
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,620
She must have a better place than her.

838
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,180
We said no.

839
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:43,700
Why are you...

840
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,540
Tian Tian.

841
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,220
Why are you here?

842
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,180
The dessert shop I went to as a student

843
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,580
is in Jingdao canteen.

844
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,420
Let me introduce you.

845
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,900
She's my best friend in high school.

846
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,660
My old friend.

847
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,260
Hello.

848
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:54,860
Hi.

849
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,100
I'm Wang Su.

850
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,420
Thank you.

851
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,020
It's delicious.

852
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,220
How can you be so stingy

853
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,220
and do things in vain?

854
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,020
You just say it to the customer.

855
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,660
You have to scan the code

856
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,860
and add a e-mail address.

857
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,460
This is called

858
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,500
product-improving customer resources.

859
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,620
You have to speak slowly.

860
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,260
Otherwise, Tian Tian will definitely not be able to react.

861
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,500
Why are you here?

862
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,140
Look.

863
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,580
Our school uniform is exactly the same.

864
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,420
I came in directly.

865
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,140
No one stopped me.

866
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,740
You know each other, right?

867
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,500
You two.

868
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:23,900
I'm going back to the dorm.

869
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,420
I'll say whatever I want to say.

870
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,140
I don't care.

871
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:26,580
Bye.

872
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,180
Bye.

873
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:27,980
Bye.

874
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,420
Come to eat dessert when you're free.

875
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,660
It's delicious.

876
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,020
Is it delicious?

877
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:32,740
Let's go.

878
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,580
Take care of her.

879
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,220
Let's eat.

880
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,180
Is it for you?

881
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:35,900
Is it for you?

882
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,180
Here it comes.

883
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,820
Enough.

884
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,260
There's more.

885
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:44,660
Okay.

886
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,500
I know you like this.

887
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,300
Today is the first day

888
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,460
that I came to your school

889
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,300
to be a student

890
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,780
for the exam.

891
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,740
To show off my skills,

892
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,460
I made all the desserts.

893
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,460
I heard that

894
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,620
your school has a security guard

895
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,500
who can go to college.

896
00:41:59,140 --> 00:41:59,860
Sun Tian Tian.

897
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,300
Are you going to learn this way?

898
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,100
I'm not that easy.

899
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,860
I just want to be a dessert chef.

900
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,980
Not bad.

901
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:08,660
You have a goal.

902
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,380
You have a goal.

903
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,420
Do you have a goal?

904
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,180
Please.

905
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,540
When we were in the senior year of our school,

906
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,700
we wanted to go to Jing Da.

907
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,180
Now we have a full staff.

908
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:20,940
Okay?

909
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,420
Calm down.

910
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,740
Be high-profile.

911
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,860
I told my parents

912
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,420
that I wanted to be a student in Jing Da.

913
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,580
They agreed without saying anything.

914
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,620
Jing Da.

915
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,860
It's the signature of gold all over the country.

916
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,140
When the student card is out of the box,

917
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,420
everyone will get three points.

918
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:38,500
Really?

919
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,620
Then I have to take advantage of the fact

920
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,340
that the university hasn't started yet

921
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,700
to take the student card

922
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,940
and show off.

923
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,300
I'm so happy.

924
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,300
It's better to find a boyfriend

925
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,100
to give you a bag.

926
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,940
I have to remind you.

927
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,260
The most important three points of a girl is

928
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,820
to be on guard against fire, road and man.

929
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,620
You have to find someone who knows you well.

930
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,620
For example...

931
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,260
Senior Lin.

932
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,620
The Black Room

933
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,740
The black room

934
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,500
lights up a lamp

935
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,780
Be careful

936
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:52,380
There will be no empty voices

937
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:56,100
Separate memories

938
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:01,460
Every line is wrong

939
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:06,540
We are getting closer to each other

940
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,740
Let fate

941
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:14,620
give us all the courage

942
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:19,980
I'm willing to travel with you through time

943
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,420
If you also

944
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,100
understand the secrets in my eyes

945
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:34,580
I will find you in my heart

946
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:44,860
I try to open my arms

947
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:49,060
Because of love, I'm sure

948
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:52,180
I'm listening to the wind

949
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:58,180
It doesn't matter if the wind blows

950
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:02,580
If the sound is very close

951
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:08,180
I know it must be you

952
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:21,860
I try to open my arms

953
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:26,660
Because of love, I'm sure

954
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,540
I'm listening to the wind

955
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:36,180
It doesn't matter if the wind blows

956
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:40,380
If the sound is very close

957
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:46,780
I know it must be you
