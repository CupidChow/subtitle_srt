1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'll try to grow the flowers in the summer

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now I'll tell you the truth about my life

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's not complicated to tell the truth

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The youth is swaying

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We're getting stronger

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My heart is still hot and boiling

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm following the rhythm and releasing it gently

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The night is brightening, guiding me through the waves

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'll fly with you bravely

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My love is still hot and boiling

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Shining bright and smiling eyes

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let us cross the barrier of time

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Siqi

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Sit down and talk

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Sit down

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Why didn't you tell Professor Xue about your mom's condition?

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We'll help you

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'll take care of myself

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll take care of you

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Mom's condition is a tachycardia

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You can help me once or twice

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You can't help me all my life

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And I've been a burden on her for so many years

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't want to be a burden on you

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,640
Wait.

28
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,960
The cloud data and the surveillance video of the company's server

29
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,240
have been covered by the data.

30
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,080
You're in charge of the data department.

31
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,120
If you're after my job,

32
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,560
please contact me through the legal department.

33
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,320
What if the police contact you?

34
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,680
The source of your mother's medical expenses

35
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,240
should be easy for the police to trace.

36
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,920
You're also a technical person.

37
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,120
Numbers won't lie.

38
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,000
As long as you've done it,

39
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,480
no matter how clean it is,

40
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,560
it will leave a trace.

41
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,120
It's just a matter of time before it's found out.

42
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,000
Siqi.

43
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,160
You've known Xue Jiao for so long.

44
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,520
I want to give you a chance.

45
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,840
But you have to tell me

46
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,360
the truth of Yi Tianyu's car accident.

47
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,000
Really?

48
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,640
I know you're depressed.

49
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,760
But I'm not.

50
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:20,360
If you stay calm,

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,400
It's too late to say anything now.

52
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,400
Everything is closed.

53
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,600
Mom.

54
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,120
Mom, what's wrong?

55
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,760
What's wrong, mom?

56
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,000
What's wrong?

57
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:39,840
What's wrong?

58
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,400
I fell into the water just now.

59
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,320
Suddenly my eyes are swollen.

60
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,880
I have a terrible headache.

61
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,840
It's okay.

62
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,800
Let me rub it for you.

63
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,520
Lianrong.

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,960
Why are you here?

65
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,560
Aunt.

66
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,880
Have you had a headache recently?

67
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,920
Let me see.

68
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,280
If you keep doing this, I'll call the security.

69
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,440
You should call the doctor.

70
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,000
Aunt may be in the wrong.

71
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,440
Come in.

72
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,200
Mr. Yi.

73
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,960
The explanation meeting will start in ten minutes.

74
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,800
You can start now.

75
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,600
Is Zihua here now?

76
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,000
Not yet.

77
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,320
She's not willing to meet you, right?

78
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,320
I really outcome high gratitude.

79
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,600
The high-рав is just like this.

80
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,040
Raising one tablet front,

81
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,080
humiliating one square note good view.

82
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,440
By the way, Mr. Yi,

83
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,720
your promotion is too high,

84
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,560
every media wants toki you

85
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,320
about your start-up and career experience.

86
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,520
They want to extend a survey.

87
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:48,920
Ms. Ye.

88
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,800
to the press conference.

89
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,040
Go.

90
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,560
It will take 15 minutes.

91
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,880
Ask them whatever you want.

92
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,800
The media may have more questions.

93
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,200
20 minutes, is that okay?

94
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,440
10 minutes.

95
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,560
Your mother has been admitted to the operating room.

96
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,320
The hemorrhoid is bleeding.

97
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,160
It should be a fall of the upper jaw.

98
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,880
The doctor said

99
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,960
if it wasn't found in time,

100
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,600
maybe...

101
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,880
maybe my mother couldn't make it through the operation.

102
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,520
Don't worry. She will be fine.

103
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,480
Thank you.

104
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,360
The core of the Blue Mountains Capitalism is honesty.

105
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,360
In the future, Huashuang will not let you down.

106
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,600
Ten years ago, we were classmates.

107
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,000
We studied in the same room.

108
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,760
We had meals together.

109
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,040
Look at us now.

110
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,080
Yu is an entrepreneur.

111
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,440
He is always the same to us.

112
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,160
Always the same.

113
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,800
You are his best friend.

114
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,200
Look at him now.

115
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,480
Are you happy?

116
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,800
I don't know

117
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,920
how much you know about what he did.

118
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,680
But I know

119
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,960
if you let him go,

120
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,960
he will go to a path of self-destruction sooner or later.

121
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,400
Snow Kong?

122
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,640
You are not only his best friend,

123
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,120
but also a king.

124
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,640
He also loved me!

125
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:54,920
How can you say freedom

126
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,760
what he loved the most?

127
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:58,800
I really

128
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,720
gotta say no to him.

129
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,080
He should just let me be

130
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,560
an independent man.

131
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,840
Let him go.

132
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,240
I don't want my mom.

133
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,720
You don't love her?

134
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,800
You even

135
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,040
politicians?

136
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,160
which is what is called the doubling blisterng

137
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:46,080
that brings a complete enhanced

138
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,440
Thank you all for all those you've done for Yi and the others.

139
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,500
Yi and the others.

140
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,280
I'm really good at it.

141
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,300
Don't worry.

142
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,540
As long as you can help me,

143
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,720
I will III no more,

144
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,780
ok?

145
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,620
Thank you for your support.

146
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,620
Same to you.

147
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,920
I'm sorry.

148
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,360
When you helped Yi Tianyu

149
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:19,560
modify the C2

150
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,640
to remove the machine

151
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,760
and delete the program,

152
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,400
did you leave any evidence?

153
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,560
But now the accident

154
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,080
has begun.

155
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,120
Even if you go now,

156
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,640
it's too late.

157
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,440
As long as there is a chance,

158
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,360
it's too late.

159
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,880
But some opportunities are missed.

160
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,160
Maybe there is no way to get them back.

161
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:44,920
Yes.

162
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,560
I'll wait for you.

163
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm the person who reported

164
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,040
the accident of Huachuang C2

165
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,440
and Lan Shan Capital...

166
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,880
Mr. Lin, the conference has begun.

167
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,000
Can you still make it?

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,920
For Lan Shan and Huachuang,

169
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,640
to the public, to the society,

170
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,000
to the consumers,

171
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,680
Mr. Lin Zhihua,

172
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,360
the former CEO of Huachuang

173
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,360
has been in a state of

174
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,880
being unable to comply with company regulations

175
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,560
and neglecting the rules of the process.

176
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,000
This has caused a very bad

177
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,160
negative event.

178
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,560
The board of directors has decided

179
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,760
to be completely famous

180
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,680
and never cooperate with it.

181
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,800
I'm sorry, everyone.

182
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,360
I have some other arrangements later.

183
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,880
I can only open

184
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,400
two questions to my friends.

185
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,360
Please take the opportunity.

186
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,680
Mr. Yi.

187
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,120
Mr. Yi, do you think

188
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,680
your Lan Shan's business concept

189
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,240
you just mentioned

190
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,240
is true?

191
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,800
This is a very interesting question.

192
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,040
Since you're here,

193
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,520
please sit down.

194
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,760
There's one last question.

195
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,120
Mr. Yi.

196
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,560
You just mentioned

197
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,920
the former CEO, Lin Zhihua,

198
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,480
will be punished by law?

199
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,760
It's not possible.

200
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,600
Xiao Meng.

201
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,920
You can be here soon.

202
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,260
It is no one's fault.

203
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,320
I know.

204
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,680
Let's see if the dimples are bad.

205
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,480
The sooner the better.

206
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,780
No億沒取悟了

207
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
I have a right-hand drive.

208
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
What a coincidence.

209
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
I have one too.

210
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,920
It's not a problem vehicle's information.

211
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,920
It's Yunnan Control Center.

212
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,920
We need to connect the service system to unlock the control center.

213
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,920
Go check on Li Zhi Hua.

214
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,920
The control center of the problem vehicle has been unlocked. You don't have a bottom card.

215
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,920
You don't have a bottom card.

216
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,920
He doesn't have one.

217
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920
I have one.

218
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,920
Hurry, go to the emergency room.

219
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,920
I'm not serving you.

220
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,920
Why is Chief Steward Lin so angry?

221
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,920
I don't know.

222
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,920
Right.

223
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
You forgot your book when you became the boss.

224
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,920
Who was with you when you started your business?

225
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
People around you have gone through a lot.

226
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
You are so over-the-top.

227
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
You are so over-the-top.

228
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,920
You are so over-the-top.

229
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,920
Who are you?

230
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,920
I need to get the signal from the emergency room.

231
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,920
Copy that, Chief Steward.

232
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,920
Isn't this...

233
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,920
What's going on?

234
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
What's going on?

235
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
What's going on?

236
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,920
What's going on?

237
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,920
Li Tian Yu, you are suspected of deliberately creating traffic accidents,

238
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,920
deliberately destroying financial resources,

239
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
and harming public safety.

240
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,920
You are falsely accusing us of important evidence,

241
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,920
and falsely accusing us of important evidence,

242
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,920
and false information.

243
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,920
Please come with us to the scene.

244
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,920
Please take the investigation.

245
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,920
What are you doing?

246
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,920
Xu Jiang!

247
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
Why are you so determined that I won't change?

248
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,920
I won't become better.

249
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,920
I will become more sincere.

250
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,920
I will become more sincere.

251
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,920
It doesn't matter whether you believe it or not.

252
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:38,280
But I think the odds of it

253
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,680
has only been eroded.

254
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,440
Your name will only remain weak with him every time you see him.

255
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,240
The problem of the emergency's red here

256
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:55,240
has then been isolated into an insolent gag.

257
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,600
I want it to be Państ妹 markings.

258
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:20,300
The dynamics of the

259
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,740
I believe we can get through this together.

260
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,220
Of course.

261
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,460
It will be the same every time.

262
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,540
Only if we are together,

263
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,980
can we find the flaws in him.

264
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,700
Read the secrets in my eyes.

265
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:59,060
I will find you are always in my heart.

266
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,180
Hello.

267
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,580
Yes.

268
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,980
What document is so urgent?

269
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,300
Wait a minute.

270
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,700
I mean, my weirdo.

271
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,060
Wait a minute.

272
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,060
I know.

273
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,940
That is, the brake failed.

274
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,380
After repeated check,

275
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,180
we announce that the CR accident

276
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,540
is not a technical cause,

277
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,060
but a human-made accident.

278
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,340
Hey.

279
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,380
I haven't finished reading it.

280
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,860
You said you two didn't work in the world.

281
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,220
I'm not working.

282
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,020
I'm watching the handsome guy.

283
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,220
The real man is here.

284
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,100
What are you looking at?

285
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,580
The clothes you are wearing today

286
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,660
is not as handsome as the day you wore the suit.

287
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,020
Come on.

288
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,020
You are the only one I see these days.

289
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,420
Hello, Shi.

290
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,500
The encryption method of the CR plan

291
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,180
must be done according to my plan.

292
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,100
Your plan is too easy to be broken.

293
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,460
I'm on vacation.

294
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,580
Then I won't talk to you.

295
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,700
Remember to do it according to my plan.

296
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,220
I won't talk to you.

297
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:26,740
Be good.

298
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,300
Bye.

299
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,140
I'm angry.

300
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,780
How about we make a rule?

301
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,420
In the future, whoever looks at the work first,

302
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,620
the other person can deal with each other at will.

303
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,260
Okay.

304
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,820
Think about it.

305
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,860
Sounds sincere.

306
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,340
Then I'll think about it again.

307
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:53,940
Okay.

308
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,380
I've thought about it. I agree.

309
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,580
You've thought about it for three seconds.

310
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,860
How long does girlfriend's will take?

311
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,100
Well?

312
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,700
Just tell the person.

313
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,060
What are you looking at?

314
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,500
Haven't you met a beauty before?

315
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,260
I was worried about death

316
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,100
before you were absent.

317
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,660
So I'm going to report you

318
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:45,660
I'm just worried that you, a little love brain,

319
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,660
will be anxious and can't take care of Hua Chuang.

320
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,660
I know you hate love brain.

321
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,660
Hua Chuang, I can create ten thousand words.

322
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,660
You really only have one.

323
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,660
I know.

324
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,660
If I were you,

325
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,660
I would do everything.

326
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,660
You can't do anything so dangerous again.

327
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,660
I'm not afraid of you.

328
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,660
I'm just worried about you.

329
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,660
I'm worried about you.

330
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,660
I'm worried about you.

331
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,660
I won't lose you again.

332
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,660
Then you have to look at me.

333
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,660
Is that enough?

334
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,660
Lin.

335
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,660
Lin.

336
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,660
People who haven't had a vacation for 800 years suddenly have a vacation.

337
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,660
I'm really not used to it.

338
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,660
Hello.

339
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,660
Hello.

340
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,660
I'm afraid I have to work overtime today.

341
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,660
What's the situation?

342
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,660
Is Lin Zhi Hua so oppressive to his employees now?

343
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,660
Your cute little brother and your future little sister,

344
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,660
they both took advantage of the holiday.

345
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,660
We are not fighting.

346
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,660
Xue...

347
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,660
I wish he had a vacation.

348
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,660
I'm really worried about this.

349
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,660
Hello.

350
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,660
Hello, baby.

351
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,660
I'm taking the team back to Jing Hai.

352
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,660
What time do you get off work?

353
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,660
I'll pick you up.

354
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,660
I'm working overtime.

355
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,660
Who is so bold to not let you go?

356
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,660
I'll teach him a lesson.

357
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,660
Who else can it be?

358
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,660
Your sister and your future brother-in-law.

359
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,660
Okay.

360
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,660
Okay. I'll go find you after I finish my work.

361
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,660
Bye.

362
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,660
He's going to have a problem with his back.

363
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,660
Did you see it in advance?

364
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,660
No.

365
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,660
What's wrong?

366
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,660
Aren't you afraid?

367
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,660
I'm afraid, right?

368
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,660
I'm afraid.

369
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,660
I'm afraid.

370
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,660
Forget it.

371
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,660
Let's play a love movie.

372
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,660
Xue Jiao, this is the V2X互联协议方案

373
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,660
of the next generation of Chinese-made cars.

374
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,660
Check it out.

375
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,660
I found it.

376
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,660
What's the rule of this?

377
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,660
The loser...

378
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,660
Fortunately, Mr. Ling reminded me.

379
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,660
Otherwise, I would have lost.

380
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,660
Bai Da Zi.

381
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,660
You're unqualified.

382
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,660
But...

383
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,660
there must be one more person organization

384
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,660
like you is missing.

385
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,660
One person?

386
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,660
You have to keep your hands.

387
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,020
The best way is to take a photo of another one.

388
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,300
I won't take a photo of anything else.

389
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,900
Let me see.

390
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,540
What about these?

391
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,500
I think they're okay.

392
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,500
What day did Leng Yanzi title with Lina want?

393
00:24:54,740 --> 00:25:11,840
According to the

394
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,840
The childhood of my elder sister too.

395
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,480
Right?

396
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,720
Catch it.

397
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,280
Sorry.

398
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,680
We didn't mean to do that.

399
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,200
Teacher, senior.

400
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:24,960
Sorry.

401
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,160
It's senior.

402
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,520
Senior, sorry.

403
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,080
Give them back.

404
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,880
Senior, can I add your WeChat?

405
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:49,880
Okay.

406
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,600
Okay.

407
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,760
You hate basketball the most.

408
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,880
I'm...

409
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,400
Right.

410
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,240
Let's go, senior.

411
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,680
Okay, teacher.

412
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,640
Wait.

413
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,280
Wait.

414
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,760
It's too difficult.

415
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,000
It's dangerous.

416
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:16,880
Let's go.

417
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,160
Go somewhere else.

418
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:19,880
Go.

419
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,240
It's all sky.

420
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,080
What are you doing?

421
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,000
Have a good time.

422
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,880
I'll be back soon.

423
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,320
Bye.

424
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,200
Goodbye.

425
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,200
I want to work at a children's hospital in Beijing again.

426
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,400
The system detected

427
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,360
that your vehicle hasn't been ready for a long time.

428
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,040
Little Panda is actually quite loving.

429
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,800
Do you have a secret

430
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,920
that you didn't tell me?

431
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,160
What secret?

432
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,000
It's the day I got drunk.

433
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,600
What did you say?

434
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,960
Ning Zheng Hua.

435
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,760
Ning Zheng Hua.

436
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,480
But this time,

437
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,320
you're cuter.

438
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,680
Yes.

439
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,320
What did I say?

440
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,760
The way you're acting

441
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,440
is too obvious, right?

442
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,600
Did you find that

443
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,480
when you met me ten years ago,

444
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,080
I was reborn?

445
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,760
Am I that smart?

446
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,600
I don't think so.

447
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,640
What is it?

448
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,720
You really don't remember?

449
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,360
Do you remember?

450
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,040
No.

451
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,360
You just want me to kiss you again.

452
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,480
That night,

453
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,240
I said

454
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,440
Gu Xuejiao

455
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,320
has been in love with you for ten years.

456
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,880
I've been in love with you for ten years.

457
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,760
What?

458
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,640
Lin Zhihua

459
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,720
has been in love with Gu Xuejiao

460
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,520
for ten years.

461
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,400
Ten years.

462
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,640
Ten years.

463
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,920
Our Lin Dasha

464
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,640
is not good at math.

465
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,360
We've known each other for only a few years.

466
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,960
Let me remind you.

467
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,560
Fine.

468
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,760
You took a bad picture of me.

469
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,400
How is it ugly? How cute.

470
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,800
Only a few.

471
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,040
Don't cover up your bad act

472
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,400
with sweet jokes

473
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,280
as well as clickingeration.

474
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,000
I'll be mad in the photo.

475
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,520
I caught him.

476
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,520
You lost.

477
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,520
What's the rule?

478
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,520
What's the rule?

479
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,520
You have to judge the other person.

480
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,520
Are you waiting for me to lose?

481
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,520
What else?

482
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,520
Fine.

483
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,520
Tell me. What's the punishment?

484
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,520
Open it.

485
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,520
Jia Liu.

486
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,520
Jia Liu.

487
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,520
I...

488
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,520
I'll let the other person decide.

489
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,520
If I don't lose,

490
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,520
you won't take it out.

491
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,520
When do you plan to say it?

492
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,520
Just...

493
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,520
Just wait.

494
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,520
How long?

495
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,520
The next ten years?

496
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,520
No matter how many ten years,

497
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,520
I'll give you a year.

498
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,520
Will you?

499
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,520
Then...

500
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,520
I'll...

501
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,520
I'll agree.

502
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,520
I'll wait for you.

503
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,520
Gu Xue Jiao.

504
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,520
Jia Liu.

505
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,520
I've liked you for ten years.

506
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,520
I've liked you for ten years.

507
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,520
No matter how many ten years,

508
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,520
marry me.

509
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,520
Marry me.

510
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,520
Ling Zhi Hua.

511
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,520
Ling Zhi Hua.

512
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,520
Ling Zhi Hua.

513
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,520
Ling Zhi Hua.

514
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,520
Ling Zhi Hua.

515
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,520
Ling...

516
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,520
Ling Zhi Hua.

517
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,520
Doctor, she's awake.

518
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,520
How did I end up here?

519
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,520
Where's Ling Zhi Hua?

520
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,520
Ling Zhi Hua?

521
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,520
She's still stable.

522
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,520
She's been

523
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,520
mentioning a name I don't know.

524
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,520
She's talking nonsense.

525
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,520
The electric elevator fall

526
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,520
may cause

527
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,520
a memory error.

528
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,520
Don't worry.

529
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,520
It'll be recovered.

530
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,520
I'll go and check on her.

531
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,520
Call me if anything happens.

532
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,520
Electric elevator fall?

533
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,520
Me?

534
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,520
You don't remember?

535
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,520
You were with another person

536
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,520
in the company.

537
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,520
You're still unconscious.

538
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,520
It's been ten days.

539
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,520
What's going on?

540
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,520
Isn't this the same thing I did last time?

541
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,520
Senior.

542
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,520
Why do I feel like

543
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,520
you've changed your color?

544
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,520
Gu Mingze.

545
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,520
What are you doing now?

546
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,520
Where's your team?

547
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,520
Team?

548
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,520
I've been working at a web cafe.

549
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,520
Where's your phone? Give it to me.

550
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,520
My phone!

551
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,520
I'm sorry.

552
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,520
The number you've dialed is unavailable.

553
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,520
Please try again later.

554
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,520
Sorry, the number you dialed is not available.

555
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,520
What's wrong?

556
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,520
I want to get out of the hospital.

557
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,520
I want to leave the hospital.

558
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,520
What's going on?

559
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,520
Through the gaps in the crowd

560
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,520
I've become a regretful past

561
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,520
Believe that we are the same as before

562
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,520
The stadium is big, isn't it?

563
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,520
It's good to see

564
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,520
To set a big goal

565
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,520
is equivalent to half of the goal

566
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,520
People with big goals

567
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,520
are more likely to succeed

568
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,520
while pursuing their goals

569
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,520
Happy birthday

570
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,520
Don't worry, I'll be fine

571
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,520
I missed you last time

572
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,520
I also hope that this time you

573
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,520
can give me a chance

574
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,520
I'm late

575
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,520
I'm sorry

576
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,520
And me

577
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,520
I can sing the Chinese song

578
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,520
ten thousand times

579
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,520
You are really the best

580
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,520
Do you have a sense of security?

581
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,520
Go to sleep

582
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,520
Be my girlfriend, okay?

583
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,520
Why do you still

584
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,520
ask about the Chinese thing?

585
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,520
Then wait for me to double check

586
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,520
I can tell you when to release

587
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,520
Marry me

588
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,520
I'm from this moment

589
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,520
Ten years ago

590
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,520
The memory of these ten years

591
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,520
stopped at the same moment

592
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,520
Time is here

593
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,520
I'm back to this world

594
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,520
Ten years

595
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,520
Dream

596
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,520
I'm back

597
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,520
This is for the third month

598
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,520
I want this month

599
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,520
I can't wait

600
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,520
I can't wait

601
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,520
You can't wait

602
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,520
I can't wait

603
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,520
I can't wait

604
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,520
Did you say that

605
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,520
all the work reports were released?

606
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,520
Here

607
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,520
I need to see all the work reports

608
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,520
since I entered this year

609
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,520
I have to see them all

610
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,520
I'll find them immediately

611
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,520
How did you get in?

612
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,520
Pan Meichang is not here

613
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,520
Other people have a lot of work

614
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,520
The salary of Mr. Lin

615
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,520
is not enough

616
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,520
We need to see all of them

617
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,520
Mr. Lin, we just feel

618
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,520
that you have been pushing Mr. Lin

619
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,520
to resign all of a sudden

620
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,520
Hurry up, guys

621
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,520
We are waiting for you

622
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,520
We are in a mess

623
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,520
Mr. Lin's resignation

624
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,520
is too childish

625
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,520
I don't know

626
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,520
how to deal with it

627
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,520
The elevator incident

628
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,520
is too serious

629
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,520
Where is Zhao Huanren?

630
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,520
He just left

631
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,520
I'm back

632
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,520
I'm back

633
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,520
I'm back

634
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,520
Li

635
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,520
Li

636
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,520
Let me do it

637
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,520
I'll do it

638
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,520
How long will it take?

639
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,520
The next ten years

640
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,520
No matter how many ten years

641
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:39,520
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

642
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:45,020
Lala Lala la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

643
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,640
I caught a cold

644
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,040
The hotels are out of food

645
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,640
Come down and talk

646
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,760
Don't scare me

647
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,360
Are you OK?

648
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,240
I'm all right

649
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,520
Gu Mingze!

650
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,120
Is that you?

651
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,520
You're awake.

652
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,520
You're awake.

653
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,520
You're awake.

00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,520
You're awake.
