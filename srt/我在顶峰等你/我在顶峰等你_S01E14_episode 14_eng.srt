 "Burning Tempo" - Duan Aojuan 

3
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,880
♫  One, two, three, four  ♫

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,680
♫  Don't be afraid of the so-called star student  ♫

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,480
♫  You are also someone else's legend  ♫

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,220
♫  Don't hold back, grow with all your might  ♫

7
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,475
♫  Midsummer's flowers  ♫

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,640
♫  Now is the time to format your life  ♫

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,500
♫  Math and physics are not complicated  ♫

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,125
♫  Youth is full of obstacles, but we'll slowly become stronger  ♫

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,280
♫  My heart still burns passionately  ♫

00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,800
♫  The illuminated night sky guides me to success  ♫

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,560
♫  I'll accompany you as you bravely take flight  ♫

15
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,160
♫  My love still burns passionately   ♫

16
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,080
♫  Shining in the smiling eyes  ♫

17

♫  Let us transcend the obstacles of time  ♫

18
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,000
   

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,080
   

20
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,520
Have you checked the school forum?

21
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,390
- About you... 
 - What?

22
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,360
 About my rebirth... 

23
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,170
Everyone knows?

24
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,190
Oh no. Who'd believe that?

25
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,250
They'll think I'm crazy.

26
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,800
- I... 
 - It's not about you!

27
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,140
It's about your high school classmate working in the canteen.

28
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,800
She's serving a new type of bubble tea.

29
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,730
Let's try it tomorrow.

30
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,880
That's it?

31
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,960
You scared me.

32
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,110
Okay, let's try it tomorrow.

33
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,360
So it's a deal.

34
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,430
They say it's amazing.

35
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:16,150
 How many cups? 

36
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,320
 - One. 
 - Got it. 

37
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,150
 Crazy Good Bubble Tea! 

38
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,220
 Fall in love at first sip! 

39
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,890
 Sun Tiantian's exclusive recipe! 

40
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,320
 Crazy Good Bubble Tea! 

41
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,650
 Fall in love at first sip! 

42
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,260
 - Hey, you!  
 - The card goes here.

43
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,040
That's ¥24 altogether.

44
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,800
All right. Here you go.

45
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,200
Thanks!

46
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,550
- How many cups? 
 - One for me.

47
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,600
That's ¥12. Let's settle up first.

48
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,660
Good. Thanks!

49
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,960
 Crazy Good Bubble Tea! 

50
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,670
 Fall in love at first sip! 

51
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,590
- Thanks! 
 - Come back anytime!

52
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,090
Cutting in line is pretty rude.

53
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,460
Shu Lan!

54
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,640
Lining up solo without us?

55
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,670
I was just passing by!

56
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,920
This sugary stuff's not really my thing.

57
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,490
I'm just getting it for someone else.

58
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,820
You heard the slogan, didn't you?

59
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,360
"Fall in love at first sip!"

60
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,920
Such an unscientific slogan.

61
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,460
Of course, our Ms. By-the-book Shu Lan had to come to conduct her own experiment!

62
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,620
Whatever you say.

63
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,660
Keep chatting about your lowbrow topics while you wait.

64
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,850
You know, with the current crowd and how slow they pour,

65
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,600
it'll be gone by the time you get there.

66
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:39,915
What?

67
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:43,110
Was that really necessary?

68
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,680
But look at this line, it really is going to take forever.

69
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,420
Might as well bring a book.

70
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,460
We want five cups, please.

71
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,740
So, five cups total, right?

72
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,240
Okay, okay.

73
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,160
What, couldn't get enough yesterday, huh?

74
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,770
How many?

75
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:01,923
Three. We'll take one for Si Qi.

76
00:04:01,923 --> 00:04:04,694
Wait, make it three per person for all four of us!

77
00:04:04,694 --> 00:04:08,984
Three per person... So that's one, two...

78
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,340
Hang on a second.

79
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,140
With her math levels, can she even count that far?

80
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,440
   

81
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,760
Sorry, everyone!

82
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,350
We're all out of bubble tea for today.

83
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,030
Come earlier tomorrow!

84
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,440
So sorry about this.

85
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,030
So sorry! So sorry!

86
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,590
We waited forever... Let's go.

87
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,320
Sorry!

88
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,640
Hold on, Tiantian!

89
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,010
We've been waiting forever, too!

90
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,790
Don't worry!

91
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,750
Of course, I've saved some for my friends!

92
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,960
   

93
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,539
Crazy Good Bubble Tea, here we come!

94
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:54,150
One per person! No exceptions.

95
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,440
A bucket-sized cup!

96
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,440
Anything for my girl Xuejiao!

97
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,840
Consider this my friendship discount.

98
00:05:04,135 --> 00:05:06,150
Is it good?

99
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,520
- Awesome! 
 - It's good, right?

100
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,560
Girl, if you sold this off-campus,

101
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,690
you'd crush every bubble tea shop out there.

102
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,030
No kidding.

103
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,230
Today, some guy in line said he's an investor

104
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,998
and wants to invest in me.

105
00:05:17,998 --> 00:05:20,528
That's great! What did you say?

106
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:28,090
He said he was choosing between me and a shop called "HiTea" shop...

107
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,320
But he really liked mine.

108
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,960
So, what did you say?

109
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,560
I answered him very directly.

110
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,470
I told him, if you want milk tea, you're welcome here.

111
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,230
If you are trying to scam me, dream on.

112
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,640
There are so many scammers out there.

113
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,720
Like I'm going to fall for that! You have to be kidding.

114
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,880
Thanks to what I learned from your drunk kiss disaster; I appreciate it!

115
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,360
Totally, right?

116
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,240
Right?  There are so many con artists these days.

117
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,010
My goodness.

118
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,060
Let me say, Sister,

119
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,860
we're way too sharp for that nonsense.

120
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,881
 With 90% of the votes in, the results show... 

121
00:06:11,881 --> 00:06:13,897
 I wonder what Xuejiao's doing. 

122
00:06:13,897 --> 00:06:15,810
 What's on her mind? 

123
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,010
 Maybe she's remembering what she said? 

124
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,430
 In her previous life, I was her boss, and she hated me. 

125
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,860
 This time, I'm the senior she looks up to. 

126
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,398
 So, I'll stay in this role to get along with her. 

127
00:06:30,398 --> 00:06:34,078
 It's better this way, for both of us. 

128
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,560
   

129
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,490
   

130
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,370
 Ever since Senior Brother Lin left, the lab's felt too quiet. 

131
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,540
 I wonder what he's doing now. 

132
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,370
 Is his work going well? 

133
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,310
 We barely talk anymore. 

134
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,740
 He keeps his distance, too. 

135
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,080
 Grown-ups, you know. 

136
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,620
 We move on. 

137
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,760
 Whatever happened that farewell night 

138
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,870
 has gone with the wind. 

139
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,500
Is this the attitude you want to have

140
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,950
as part of the Jinghai University lab?

141
00:07:18,811 --> 00:07:20,541
You...

142
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,580
What's going on?

143
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,290
Lin Zhihua, what's going on?

144
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,400
Why are you guys back so soon?

145
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,090
Did the B&amp;C Motors deal fall apart?

146
00:07:37,538 --> 00:07:40,003
Actually,

147
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,978
quite the opposite.

148
00:07:42,978 --> 00:07:46,260
This trip to Germany wasn't about securing an offer.

149
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:50,161
We wanted B&amp;C Motors to invest in our C1 project.

150
00:07:50,161 --> 00:07:52,862
At first, they acted all high and mighty, saying there was no precedent.

151
00:07:52,862 --> 00:07:54,930
Now they've compromised.

152
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:59,321
I'm telling you, kid, that was a huge gamble.

153
00:07:59,321 --> 00:08:00,532
What if they didn't agree?

154
00:08:00,532 --> 00:08:04,895
Professor Tan, Old Lin went all in this time, and it paid off.

155
00:08:04,895 --> 00:08:07,960
Even I was almost fooled.

156
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,870
Honestly, I never wanted to work for them.

157
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,400
Even if it didn't work out,

158
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,839
we had funding from Junlian and Director Zhao as backup.

159
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:18,640
Now B&amp;C is feeling the heat, and they're scrambling.

160
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,420
They caved in on a bunch of our terms.

161
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,040
We don't need to go overseas to work for them.

162
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:30,290
We can stay right here and build our own startup team here in China.

163
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,640
You always take the riskiest path!

164
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,670
Feint east, strike west, you fool everyone!

165
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:40,279
Even pulled off that crowd-funded farewell party?

166
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:42,010
Once B&amp;C Motors' funding arrives,

167
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,281
we'll pay it back ten times over.

168
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:44,376
Is ten times enough?

169
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:46,291
You have to leave the school with a decent investment share.

170
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,172
Don't worry, Professor Tan.

171
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:50,983
I'll stay on to lead the lab.

172
00:08:50,983 --> 00:08:54,420
But besides the original C1 crew,

173
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,570
I'll need an assistant.

174
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,160
An assistant?

175
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,790
Professor Tan! How about me?

176
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,000
Professor, I can do it!

177
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,610
- Professor, I'm your guy! 
 - All of you, shut up!

178
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:08,387
More excited to work for Xiao Lin than for me, huh?

179
00:09:08,387 --> 00:09:09,340
   

180
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,950
- Grandmaster... 
 - Get back to work.

181
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,590
I've already got someone in mind.

182
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,190
What?

183
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:19,206
I'm just a freshman!

184
00:09:19,206 --> 00:09:20,420
How can I be your assistant?

185
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,990
You're the only one besides me who cracked Professor Tan's virus code.

186
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,000
Who else could it be?

187
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,480
Okay, fine.

188
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,590
Give me something to do.

189
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,330
Gao Rui and I just wrapped up the C1 code.

190
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,340
We need you to proofread it.

191
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,870
- How many lines? 
 - Over 10,000.

192
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,900
Are you and Senior Gao even human?

193
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,140
You just need to be efficient.

194
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,480
Your face is bad news, day or night.

195
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,250
What was that?

196
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,100
Nothing.

197
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:16,160
You sure you don't remember anything from the day we saw you off?

198
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,031
I do.

199
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:21,512
- You didn't want me to leave and... 
 - Stop!

200
00:10:21,512 --> 00:10:24,480
Right now, I officially deny everything from that night.

201
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,910
Pure drunk talk.

202
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,070
Anyway, once you're done proofreading,

203
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,040
load it into the simulator.

204
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,960
We're testing tomorrow.

205
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,193
Got it. I'll go and get an external drive.

206
00:10:39,193 --> 00:10:40,973
No need.

207
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,850
Use this.

208
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,640
 Old Lin, since I was Xuejiao's first tutor, 

209
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,060
 that makes me your senior. Right? 

210
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,790
 Got any tips for me? 

211
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,300
 She's not interested in you. 

212
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,830
 If she were really into you, 

213
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,520
 how could she drop this drive off and leave without a word? 

214
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,660
Thanks.

215
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,140
   

216
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,660
Senior Brother Lin, maybe you should get back to work?

217
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,500
I can't concentrate with you staring like that.

218
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,240
My assistant is really bold.

219
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,950
I'm leaving.

220
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,140
So this is the project you dragged me here to check out?

221
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,450
I have to say, Jinghai University's got some serious talent.

222
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:36,290
Even the cafeteria's bubble tea went viral.

223
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,300
Crazy Good Bubble Tea.

224
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,970
What kind of name is that?

225
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,360
It could be rebranded to "Tiantian's Tea".

226
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,820
Tiantian's Tea?

227
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,260
   

228
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,135
- Isn't that... 
 - That's right.

229
00:12:56,135 --> 00:13:00,490
It is Gu Xuejiao's high school friend, Sun Tiantian.

230
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,670
Such a clever play on words. 
  ("Tian" is a homophone for sweet) 

231
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,520
What's the deal?

232
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,800
So, a while back, I got this email.

233
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,190
It's this proposal. 
    

234
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,640
I loved it the moment I read it.

235
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,000
   

236
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,040
So, are you going to invest?

237
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,020
Highly likely.

238
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,890
But when I visited just now,

239
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:49,260
the girl running it didn't seem all that sharp.

240
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,120
Now I'm not so sure.

241
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,660
Who do you think sent me that proposal?

242
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,380
Could someone be trying to scam me?

243
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,430
No way. I have to get to the bottom of this.

244
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,440
Hey, don't be so hasty.

245
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,810
Let's do this. Forward me the sender's email.

246
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,980
I'll handle it.

247
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,810
Finally acting like a grown-up

248
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,400
and looking out for your big sis. Right?

249
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,610
See, this proposal is so detailed and exactly right about Gen Z consumer preferences.

250
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:21,070
Not just that, it even forecasts upcoming market trends.

251
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:25,310
My own research team wouldn't dare to be this confident.

252
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,660
Honestly, I started wondering if the writer's a time traveler.

253
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,900
We're educated, don't go full sci-fi.

254
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,330
You don't get it.

255
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:40,990
A good investor has to consider every possibility.

256
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,252
But, Sister, start saying "time travel" around Jinghai University

257
00:14:44,252 --> 00:14:46,750
and they'll think you're crazy.

258
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,860
Well, I guess my reputation is more important after all.

259
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,570
How have you been lately?

260
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,430
Do you want to give me an update on what's going on with you?

261
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,370
I'm good.

262
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,040
Something's bothering you.

263
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,380
You can tell?

264
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,020
Come on, speak up.

265
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:16,560
I haven't seen you look this lost in years.

266
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,420
So there's this girl. She kissed one of my roommates.

267
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,310
Now, my roommate has a thing for her.

268
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,920
But...

269
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,760
But?

270
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,690
But this girl, because of circumstances in her past,

271
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:34,020
she doesn't want to start any new romance.

272
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,780
What kind of girl is she?

273
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,690
Exactly like you.

274
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:45,910
Career-first, laser-focused, no time for guys.

275
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,850
A career-driven ice queen?

276
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,830
Once someone shuts out romance like that,

277
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:55,280
it's really tough to open up again.

278
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,840
So for you career-driven girls,

279
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,045
are all guys just like throwaway rags, totally not worth your time?

280
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,445
Besides,

281
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,220
my career isn't too bad either!

282
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,550
Let me tell you. To girls who are all about love,

283
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,060
every guy starts at a perfect score.

284
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,210
Mess up, and the score drops; it can drop down to zero.

285
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,760
But career-driven girls?

286
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,570
Looking at a guy, you start at zero.

287
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,520
But if you impress her, points go up;

288
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,570
it can go all the way up to 100.

289
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,460
Only then will she say yes.

290
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:30,850
So if I hit 100, I've got a chance?

291
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,520
Harder than flying to the moon.

292
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,210
But humans did make it to the moon in the end.

293
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm leaving. Enjoy your drink.

294
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,360
Hey, wait. So you're done with younger girls

295
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,780
and into older women now?

296
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,790
What about Xuejiao?

297
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,300
Don't twist it.

298
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,730
She's the only one.

299
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,050
Weird...

300
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,470
Xiao Gao.

301
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,230
You've got the wrong person.

302
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,330
Why are you running away?

303
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,040
Am I really that scary?

304
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,980
Boys these days, huh?

305
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,040
All right, that's it for today.

306
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,990
- Dismissed! 
 - Thanks, Coach!

307
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,370
- Goodbye. 
 - Bye-bye!

308
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,350
Let's go. Let's get some BBQ tonight?

309
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,390
I'll pass. I've got stuff to do.

310
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,580
So committed?

311
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,010
Intercollegiate games are starting soon.

312
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,730
I have to train more. You guys go ahead.

313
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,090
- See you. 
 - Bye-bye.

314
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,380
Anyone here?

315
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,640
Xuejiao.

316
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:40,080
I... I...

317
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,550
Wow, am I that pathetic?

318
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,020
How hard can "I like you" be?

319
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,230
Xuejiao, I like you.

320
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,430
Ugh, too cheesy, dude.

321
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,310
Xuejiao, I like you.

322
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,150
Be my girlfriend.

323
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,090
Is that too pushy?

324
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,440
That won't work.

325
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,930
I have to go all out.

326
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,110
Jiao Jiao, we made it to the city college league finals!

327
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,590
I'm in the starting lineup!

328
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,210
I'm inviting you to watch... No!

329
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,850
You have to come cheer for me!

330
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,280
What's this?

331
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,230
- Give them back. 
 - Tickets for the final?

332
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,790
   

333
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,210
These are for me and Xuejiao, right?

334
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,420
- Thanks. 
 - I'll deliver them myself. Give them back!

335
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,070
She's buried in lab work. You won't even find her.

336
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,440
Give them back!

337
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,660
No take-backs! I'm delivering now.

338
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,110
I'm heading to the kitchen.

339
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,200
Just tell her, okay?

340
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,600
Bye-bye.

341
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,200
Then, remember to give one to her!

342
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,760
Bye-bye.

343
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:39,161
For self-driving, besides replacing preset routes with AI,

344
00:20:39,161 --> 00:20:43,210
it's vital to have real-time monitoring of unexpected situations.

345
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,450
For example, a driver passes out.

346
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:48,830
In that case, the AI has to take over,

347
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,730
pull the car over safely,

348
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,390
call their family and emergency services.

349
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:55,010
I can really relate to that scenario.

350
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:58,426
Even further, let's say the driver is drunk,

351
00:20:58,426 --> 00:21:03,193
we should prevent the car from starting so they don't break the law.

352
00:21:03,193 --> 00:21:08,480
To make that happen, we need real-time heart rate monitoring.

353
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,530
That means every driver would have to wear a heart rate tracker.

354
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,450
But that isn't exactly practical.

355
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,790
So at C1, we worked with medical companies

356
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:20,980
to build heart rate sensors into the seat belt.

357
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,550
You're probably wondering how it can be worn over clothes.

358
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,280
Since drivers are bound to adjust their seating positions,

359
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,840
how could it get an accurate reading?

360
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,500
Senior Brother Gao, you two sound like you're selling something on TV.

361
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,630
This monitoring program is designed to detect

362
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:44,630
a heart rate change of up to 5% in less than 20 seconds.

363
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,940
So for today's test, we've got these two seats and two testers.

364
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,310
I'll take this one.

365
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,840
And that one... Gu Xuejiao.

366
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,550
Why?

367
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,070
Senior Brother Gao, aren't you the testing expert?

368
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,350
It's a lab rule.

369
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,420
Whoever built the part tests it first.

370
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,240
Plus, you're Old Lin's assistant.

371
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,140
So... go ahead.

372
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,860
Whatever. It's not like it's an electric chair.

373
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,830
Here, one for each of you.

374
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,080
Let's simulate a real-life situation.

375
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,560
Start the test.

376
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,630
Do you think that strap is reliable?

377
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,100
It is.

378
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,600
Xuejiao's heart rate is already going up.

379
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,070
If I were sitting across from Zhihua,

380
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:19,660
mine would spike, too.

381
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,411
 This is just a heart rate monitor. 

382
00:23:29,411 --> 00:23:31,581
 Piece of cake. 

383
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,950
 Anyway, just don't make eye contact. 

384
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,170
Wait.

385
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,730
Why's it rising that fast?

386
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,630
 Stay calm! 

387
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:14,620
 If I were to insert a linear function here... 

388
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,210
 Have you really forgotten what happened that night? 

389
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:21,380
 I really don't want Lin Zhihua to leave, but... 

390
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,190
 Now that I'm back, why are you dodging me again? 

391
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:31,750
 Gu Xuejiao, you've got to keep that lovesick brain in check. 

392
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,450
 It's off-limits even in college. 

393
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:36,050
 You couldn't have deduced that I'm from the future too, could you? 

394
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,770
 You discriminate against us contract workers! 

395
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,310
 You had your lackey sabotage my code 

396
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,590
 to fast-track Zhou Shiyun! 

397
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:48,920
 All my effort, all the sleepless nights, 

398
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,520
 it's all worthless to you! 

399
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,809
 What do I have to do to make up for the pain you've been through? 

400
00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:00,660
 I want to break down this wall between us. 

401
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,880
 Can I break through? 

402
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,380
 I'm not a kid anymore. 

403
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,980
 I know what I want. 

404
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,720
 Nothing should take over your entire life. 

405
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,200
 No matter what happens, 

406
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,610
 it's not worth giving up your life for. 

407
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:37,210
 Do you know that it was in that moment, 

408
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,370
 I knew I could never forget you. 

409
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,520
 - Gu Xuejiao. 
 - Lin Zhihua. 

410
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,980
 Do what you're supposed to do. 

411
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,920
This heart rate...

412
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,290
Are you sure you didn't spike their drinks?

413
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,850
The test's over.

414
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,400
Xuejiao, where are you going?

415
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,900
I...

416
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,100
That strap's too tight.

417
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,430
I need to go outside for some air.

418
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,480
I told you, there's definitely a bug.

419
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,000
- Hey, Grandmaster? 
 - Senior Brother.

420
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,670
Senior Brother!

421
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:25,820
 Is it my fate to be doomed by lovesickness? 

422
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,769
 Cured one day, relapse the next. 

423
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:28,730
 This is no good. 

424
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,630
 Absolutely not. 

425
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,330
Not testing anymore?

426
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,490
The test is over.

427
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,530
Could the code have a bug?

428
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:46,430
 - Let's check it again. 
 - The code's fine. 

429
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,720
The problem is the person.

430
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,010
Not me.

431
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,872
I'm not...

432
00:26:53,872 --> 00:26:56,600
- I just don't want to... 
 - I know.

433
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,920
You don't want to date anyone.

434
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,000
I absolutely don't think there's anything wrong with you.

435
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,900
I know.

436
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:17,150
You're afraid that dating will change things for the worse.

437
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,460
I don't know what you've been through before.

438
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:35,200
But if becoming your better self is the goal,

439
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,730
I won't hold you back.

440
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,820
Of course, if you think I'm not helping you grow into a better person,

441
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,860
you can say so. It's okay.

442
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:56,390
We can find another way to get along with one another.

443
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,040
I've lived an uncertain life.

444
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,510
That isn't good.

445
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:09,140
In no way good.

446
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,940
So, right now,

447
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:17,050
I need my life structured, like a math equation,

448
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:21,850
verified step-by-step, zero margin for error.

449
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,800
But didn't you already find your answer that night?

450
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,460
What if it wasn't wrong?

451
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,470
What if the current me...

452
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,120
is the right answer?

453
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,920
What answer?

454
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,880
Let me remind you.

455
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:55,754
♫  I try to open my arms  ♫

456
00:28:55,754 --> 00:28:59,869
♫  Because I'm certain of this love  ♫

457
00:28:59,869 --> 00:29:02,480
♫  I'll wait for you at the summit  ♫

458
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,160
♫  Even if the wind's harsh, it's all right  ♫

459
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,340
That's not what I forgot.

460
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:14,287
♫  There's a figure approaching  ♫

461
00:29:14,287 --> 00:29:16,640
Forget it. Whatever.

462
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:33,425
♫  I try to open my arms  ♫

463
00:29:33,425 --> 00:29:37,446
♫  Because I'm certain of this love  ♫

464
00:29:37,446 --> 00:29:40,240
♫  I'll wait for you at the summit  ♫

465
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:47,069
♫  Even if the wind's harsh, it's all right  ♫

466
00:29:47,069 --> 00:29:51,600
♫  There's a figure approaching  ♫

467
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,280
Director, some of our prop petals went that way.

468
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,520
Will that mess up our campus promo shoot?

469
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,389
Shut up. Could that compare with this much better shot?

470
00:30:00,389 --> 00:30:04,460
Roll everything, give me a 360 orbit shot of those two!

471
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,800
Keep it up!

472
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,440
Seriously, this does look great on camera.

473
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,480
Exactly. Where else can you find this kind of chemistry?

474
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,660
So true. Such a good-looking couple.

475
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:20,255
Remember to freeze this frame for our promo cover.

476
00:30:20,255 --> 00:30:22,025
Works for me.

477
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,720
 What's this? 

478
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,310
 - What is it? 
 - Such a huge box! 

479
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,830
 - Come help me out. 
 - No idea. 

480
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,200
What is this?

481
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,330
For Yi Tianyu?

482
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,550
Let's open it up and see.

483
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,150
- Sure! 
 - Let's do it together.

484
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:52,700
Three, two, one.

485
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,210
   

486
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,520
   

487
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,730
   

488
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:18,310
They look kind of familiar.

489
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,680
- True. 
 - Right?

490
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,480
Yes. Don't they look familiar?

491
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,920
Senior Brothers. Senior Sister. Good morning.

492
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,390
Good morning.

493
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,040
What are you looking at?

494
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,550
What hot gossip do you have here?

495
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,680
Campus TV caught students making out!

496
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,940
It's too pixelated, though.

497
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,630
A couple were kissing under a tree,

498
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,450
and they got filmed.

499
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,590
But it's all blurred out.

500
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,630
So annoying!

501
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,290
Why bother blurring it?

502
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,620
Exactly.

503
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,390
 I think someone filmed us and it went viral. 

504
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,640
   

505
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,841
A clearer video has been posted on the forum!

506
00:32:08,841 --> 00:32:10,881
Show us!

507
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,110
What the heck! 
    

508
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,240
No way...

509
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,850
What's so interesting?

510
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,630
You hacked the forum?

511
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,570
Can't you bring it back?

512
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,490
 No wonder the department forum is so lively today. 

513
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,840
 Seems everyone's dishing the tea! 

514
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,031
 Thank goodness your admin buddy was on duty. 

515
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:48,382
 I've deleted the video just now. 

516
00:32:48,382 --> 00:32:51,150
 Otherwise, what would we do if some of this 

517
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,590
 18 and over material got us shut down? 

518
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,960
 It wouldn't be that bad. 

519
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,720
 But good job deleting it. 

520
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,070
 We have to keep the internet clean. 

521
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:03,660
 No way, that 18 and over wild guy was you? 

522
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,350
It's gone! Do you know what you're doing?

523
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,850
Do something, man!

524
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,330
It's gone?

525
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:22,360
Lame!

526
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:29,960
 Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is currently unavailable. 

527
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,000
 Please try again later. 

528
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,370
   

529
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,642
   

530
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,290
Hello?

531
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,970
 Where are you? We're waiting for you at the beta testing meeting. 

532
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:03,220
Okay. I'm coming.

533
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:17,420
How did you know I had a meeting here?

534
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,110
I didn't really want to know either.

535
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,220
But you're trending right now,

536
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,350
all over my social media feeds.

537
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,400
Why did you call me?

538
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,168
I... just wanted to say...

539
00:34:35,168 --> 00:34:37,048
I...

540
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,170
I...

541
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,700
Are you smiling?

542
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,120
I finally saw you smile.

543
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:58,360
About last time... Thanks.

544
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,010
Last time...

545
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:06,890
I'm sorry.

546
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,480
- I overreacted. 
 - I overreacted.

547
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,780
Honestly, it doesn't really matter if you were a good student or not.

548
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,590
Look at me. I was a total slacker,

549
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,890
but I'm doing pretty okay.

550
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,330
"Pretty okay"?

551
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,610
You've figured it out.

552
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:40,630
Everyone has their own strengths.

553
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:47,470
"Good" student, "bad" student, those are just labels from other people.

554
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,490
They can't define who we are.

555
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,610
Those words are so inspiring!

556
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,480
Hold on a sec. I need a notebook to jot them down.

557
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,610
Where's my notebook?

558
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,630
- Wait, no. 
 - Enough. Quit pretending.

559
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,300
You never bring a notebook to class.

560
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,260
But seriously, what you said was super insightful,

561
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,420
totally another level!

562
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,840
It's like...

563
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,070
You know? Like one of those quotes from books.

564
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,090
What do you call them?

565
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,000
- Motto! Yes, that's it! Life motto.

566
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,940
Actually, these thoughts...

567
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,440
were things you told me.

568
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:42,150
By the way, I'm planning to go back to school.

569
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,590
Wait a minute.

570
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:48,230
I didn't say all that to force you back to school.

571
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:52,110
I just meant, you know...

572
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,980
You know what I mean, right? I...

573
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,750
What else, then? You want me to stick with you,

574
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,360
hanging out off-campus all the time?

575
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,940
That's not a bad idea.

576
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,190
Sorry, that's not what I meant.

577
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,110
Forgive me. I have foot-in-mouth disease.

578
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,110
I'm sorry.

579
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,140
Stop following me.

580
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,170
Don't you have that beta testing meeting?

581
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:12,720
Can we meet after that, then?

582
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,890
Whatever.

583
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:44,780
Xuejiao, I've decided these big-shot mogul types are not my thing.

584
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,150
Small and steady is more my vibe.

585
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,300
Why are you panicking?

586
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,670
You hold the golden recipe!

587
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:54,220
We're picking investors, not the other way around.

588
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:57,270
But there's only one investor.

589
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:00,230
It's a mutual vetting. What if they don't pick us?

590
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,740
That won't happen.

591
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,900
Leave it to me.

592
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,960
I'll show you the ultimate three boss moves!

593
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,480
Let's go.

594
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,120
Come on.

595
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,140
Stand tall.

596
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,750
Director Zhang.

597
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,590
- Hello. 
 - Pleasure to meet you.

598
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,530
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

599
00:38:28,252 --> 00:38:29,600
Please, sit.

600
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,506
Have a seat.

601
00:38:30,506 --> 00:38:32,320
 First, fake it till you make it. 

602
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,880
 If you project enough confidence, 

603
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,070
 they won't see through you; at least not to your face. 

604
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,170
Director Zhang, let me make the introductions.

605
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:41,090
This is Ms. Sun Tiantian,

606
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:44,637
theh founder and chief dessert innovator of Tiantian's Tea.

607
00:38:44,637 --> 00:38:46,517
Hello.

608
00:38:46,517 --> 00:38:48,922
Here's the contract.

609
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,570
It's an old habit of hers.

610
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,010
She'll zone out every now and then,

611
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,740
thinking up new dessert ideas.

612
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,680
A lot of our recent bestsellers were born this way.

613
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,610
   

614
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,550
Langhuan Capi...

615
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,630
- What's wrong? 
 - Nothing.

616
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,030
She's calling the waiter. Waiter!

617
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,371
Don't show that you don't understand.

618
00:39:15,371 --> 00:39:17,701
Follow my lead.

619
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,530
 Step two, overwhelm them with your aura, 

620
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:23,630
 and break down their defenses. 

621
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:27,370
 Remember, act like you've seen it all. 

622
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:33,520
Actually, we've been approached by a lot of investors recently,

623
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,820
including some pretty big players.

624
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,400
Hot startups, you know, never lack investors.

625
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,000
Excuse me.

626
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,920
   

627
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,340
- Hello? 
  - Xuejiao, are you free today? 

628
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,940
 - Want to get together...?   
 - I'm busy right now.

629
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,530
We'll have to talk another day.

630
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,410
Busy doing what?

631
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,380
Grandmaster, the lab's annual project pitch meeting is about to start.

632
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,090
I've compiled these reference materials.

633
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:10,340
- Do you want to preview them? 
 - Just notify everyone.

634
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,000
Okay.

635
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,520
Sorry about that.

636
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,710
We've been fielding so many investor offers lately.

637
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,530
I understand. I've read your proposal.

638
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,830
It is indeed a promising project.

639
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:32,710
But before coming here, we did our homework.

640
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:35,260
It appears that, at this time, we are the only one

641
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,730
showing any real interest in investing.

642
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:41,230
We propose a full acquisition.

643
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:45,780
Of course, we'll save you a position on the team.

644
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,550
I'm understanding it now.

645
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,780
He wants to kick us out?

646
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:55,450
 So, is it time for the last resort? 

647
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:59,230
 Stoop to conquer! 

648
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,330
Director Zhang,

649
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:04,140
who said you're their only option?

650
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,632
Whatever you're offering, 
    

651
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:10,600
I'll add 20% more to the investment.

652
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,670
Here we go again.

653
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:16,050
Every time Huanhui targets a project, your Linqi swoops in?

654
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,260
Have you ever thought about

655
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,270
how many good projects your company has destroyed?

656
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,170
Leave this one alone.

657
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,460
Fine, you win.

658
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,900
All settled.

659
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:38,420
Well then, shall we finalize the terms?

660
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,560
So that's it, deal's done?

661
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:51,400
Sheer power trumps all schemes. 
    

662
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,920
Xuejiao, thank you.

663
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,320
I really mean it!

664
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,960
I never could have pulled this off without you.

665
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,681
I totally forgot about the basketball tickets Yi Tianyu gave me.

666
00:42:03,681 --> 00:42:06,221
I think it's supposed to be today.

667
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:32,090
Hey there. Have you seen Yi Tianyu?

668
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:34,650
He got hurt. He's not playing today.

669
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,900
- Thanks. 
 - No problem. Bye.

676
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,880
Hey, Yi Tianyu! Where the heck are you?

677
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,900
You're not answering your phone or replying to my messages!

678
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,090
 You must be Xiao Gu, right? 

679
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:21,210
 I'm Tianyu's father.
