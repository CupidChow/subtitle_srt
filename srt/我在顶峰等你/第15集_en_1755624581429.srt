1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Try to grow the flowers in the summer

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now tell the truth about life

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's not complicated to tell the truth

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The youth is swaying

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We are getting stronger

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My heart is still hot and boiling

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Follow the rhythm and release the love

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The night wind is brightening, guiding me to go forward

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will accompany you to fly bravely

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My love is still hot and boiling

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The bright and smiling eyes

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let us cross the barrier of time

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hello, sir

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Where is Yi Tianyu?

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He is injured

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He didn't come to the game today

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Thank you

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's ok, let's go

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Sorry

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The number you have dialed is busy

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Please redial later

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The number you have dialed is busy

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Please redial later

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Please redial later

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Hello, Yi Tianyu

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Where is he?

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He didn't answer the phone

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
He is Gu's classmate

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I am Tianyu's dad

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Uncle

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Sorry, I thought you were Yi Tianyu

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's ok

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I saw you called Tianyu many times

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I am fine

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I am afraid I will be in trouble

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I heard he was injured

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I am a little worried

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Is he seriously injured?

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
He is a good boy

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He is a good boy

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Well

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
He has been selected by the international basketball league

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Now he is training abroad

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
He forgot to bring his phone

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So suddenly

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Not suddenly

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He has applied for it

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
He didn't tell you

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That's good

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
According to Yi Tianyu's character

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He should be able to hide something

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He can't hold it for so long

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Good idea

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I will let him contact you

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
When he is settled

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Ok

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Uncle

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I heard his teammates said he was injured

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Is he ok?

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
He is fine

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's ok

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Ok

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Bye

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Ok, see you in China

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Who told you to go abroad?

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This time

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We can all become better

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Ok

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This day

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The doctor said

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The pain will be reduced easily

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Well

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's my fault

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I cleaned the floor

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I am afraid you will be injured again

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Not only playing

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I can't even walk

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What can I do?

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I am fine

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Did he scold me?

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I am so happy

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I heard on the phone

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You are going abroad

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I am so happy

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Dad

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You are old

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You still lie to me

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Thank you

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Thank you

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't be so formal

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You are my dad's biggest honor

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I have contacted

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The overseas service organization

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
After you go abroad

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Cooperate with the nurse

98
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Don't worry

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Calm down

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This is not an emergency

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Although the ball can't be hit now

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Isn't his brain still there?

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Then practice your brain

104
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
No matter what

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I am a big fan

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
When I go back to China

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Can't be in the head

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Ok

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I will try my best dad

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Ok

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm here

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I am leaving now

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Hurry up and tell yourself

114
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Hello

115
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Hello

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I am sorry

117
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Life

118
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Seems to be divided into several stages

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Tiantian

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yi Tianyu

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Old brother

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,840
and my former partners

123
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,240
and even my former enemy

124
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,720
all walked to different crossroads

125
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,400
at this moment.

126
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,920
Everyone has a new stage

127
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,040
and a new goal.

128
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,680
What about mine?

129
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,280
I'm not afraid of anything.

130
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,600
I'm not afraid of anything.

131
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

132
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
I'm not afraid of anything.

133
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

134
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,520
I'm not afraid of anything.

135
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
I'm not afraid of anything.

136
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

137
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,120
I'm not afraid of anything.

138
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

139
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,520
I'm not afraid of anything.

140
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
I'm not afraid of anything.

141
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

142
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,120
I'm not afraid of anything.

143
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

144
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,520
I'm not afraid of anything.

145
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
I'm not afraid of anything.

146
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

147
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,120
I'm not afraid of anything.

148
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

149
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,520
I'm not afraid of anything.

150
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
I'm not afraid of anything.

151
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

152
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,120
I'm not afraid of anything.

153
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,640
Thank you.

154
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840
Let me tell you what I think.

155
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,680
I think it's very interesting.

156
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,880
I think it's very interesting.

157
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,080
Thank you.

158
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,280
I think it's very interesting.

159
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
Thank you.

160
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
The first one is that

161
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,120
they didn't say that

162
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,680
the current market consumers

163
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,280
are using the Wuren family technology

164
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,480
for a single purpose.

165
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,480
They can't find the most

166
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,680
attractive things in the world.

167
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,880
But we can't let them do that.

168
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,080
Actually, because of the family technology,

169
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,560
the most important thing is to provide

170
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,760
family technology to the people.

171
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
In fact, it's still about

172
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,160
the participation of the people.

173
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,000
There is a certain sense of

174
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,160
barrier to the sense of morality.

175
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,360
Next,

176
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,040
we also have to

177
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,040
have a meeting.

178
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
Let's have a meeting.

179
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,040
Thank you.

180
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,240
Thank you.

181
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,440
Let's have a meeting.

182
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,440
We are just having a meeting.

183
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,640
The topics chosen every year

184
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,440
have the opportunity to become

185
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,040
the main focus of the school-school cooperation.

186
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,440
Why don't you participate?

187
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,840
Actually,

188
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,640
I didn't receive

189
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,440
the notice to have a meeting today.

190
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
You didn't receive it?

191
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,240
God,

192
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,840
Lin Xiaodong is just right.

193
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,440
Didn't you inform the lab

194
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,240
about the members'

195
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,640
selection meeting?

196
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,840
He?

197
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,840
He doesn't need to participate

198
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
in the first round, right?

199
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,240
What's wrong with the first round?

200
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,040
I also participated in the first round.

201
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,040
It's good to get experience

202
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,640
after listening to it.

203
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,640
He wouldn't want you, God,

204
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
to work directly on the CE project

205
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,440
from the selection meeting.

206
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,240
I'm sorry.

207
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,040
You should

208
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,640
have a good foundation

209
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,640
in the first round.

210
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,640
You didn't participate

211
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,040
in the first round

212
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,640
after the second round.

213
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,240
I'll go first, God.

214
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,240
Since my life

215
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,040
has been restarted once,

216
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,840
why should I wait?

217
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
It's okay.

218
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,640
My sister will come later.

219
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,040
Let's go to have dinner together.

220
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,840
No, you guys eat.

221
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,840
I've seen Sister Yuan.

222
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,040
I'll go in first.

223
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,640
Hello, your dishes are ready.

224
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,440
Please enjoy.

225
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,440
Thank you.

226
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,640
It's been a long time since we had dinner together.

227
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,440
You're still not looking at your phone?

228
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,240
You came here for your contract,

229
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,040
not to have dinner with me.

230
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,240
Tell me about your roommate.

231
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,640
Yes, my roommate.

232
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,240
My roommate

233
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,840
is dating

234
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,040
the girl

235
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,840
I mentioned recently.

236
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,840
But...

237
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,840
You're together,

238
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,840
but you can't say no.

239
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,840
Okay, okay, okay.

240
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,840
Go on.

241
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,640
Go on.

242
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,440
Go on.

243
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,240
Go on.

244
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,040
Go on.

245
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,840
Go on.

246
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,640
Go on.

247
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,440
Go on.

248
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,240
Go on.

249
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,640
But this girl

250
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
can't find anyone recently.

251
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,640
She doesn't tell me where she's been.

252
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,440
Really?

253
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,440
You've got her.

254
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,040
Of course she doesn't care.

255
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,440
Now all women are like this.

256
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,640
Maybe she has other hidden feelings.

257
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,240
Maybe she has other hidden feelings.

258
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,640
Maybe she's just a friend.

259
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,040
Could it be that my...

260
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,840
my roommate

261
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,840
is too clingy?

262
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,240
No,

263
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,440
you mean

264
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,640
your roommate

265
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,840
is with this girl.

266
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,840
What do you mean by that?

267
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,840
No one can break the promise.

268
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,440
Naturally, they're together.

269
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,640
You mean

270
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,440
they didn't confess at all?

271
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,240
We've found the answer to the question.

272
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,640
No girl

273
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,040
is willing to be with someone who doesn't know.

274
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,840
The girl is not an exception.

275
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,640
I have to go back to the lab.

276
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,440
You're leaving now?

277
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,840
I have to go back to the math.

278
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
Thank you.

279
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,040
It's okay.

280
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,440
We finally have a meal together.

281
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,640
Are you going home after you finish your homework?

282
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,440
You're a fool.

283
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,440
You're so accurate.

284
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,840
Your control technology is still improving.

285
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,240
You don't even know the direction.

286
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,240
I've been learning it for a long time.

287
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,240
God.

288
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,040
Brother Shi.

289
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,040
Where's Gu Xue Jiang?

290
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,040
She?

291
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
She's on leave.

292
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,040
I knew it.

293
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,240
She must have come in for the mixed-school score.

294
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,440
She's not sincere at all.

295
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,640
She hasn't been here for days.

296
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,640
She's so stubborn.

297
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,440
I'll go back to the lab.

298
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,840
I'll go back to the analysis.

299
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,440
The decision-making.

300
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,440
Two support boxes.

301
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,040
Go.

302
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,040
Go play.

303
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,840
Are you that busy?

304
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,620
Good work.

305
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,640
Good job.

306
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,640
Recently, an intelligent man Shelley constructs his garage.

307
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,040
He realises his job is only a small part of his life.

308
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,160
I'm not going to leave you.

309
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,320
Really?

310
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,920
You're not that arrogant, are you?

311
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,720
You don't even know

312
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,360
what it means to give a gift to a guy?

313
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,800
I really hope I don't know.

314
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,240
I've never done

315
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,840
such a childish thing in my life.

316
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,520
You took the gift, didn't you?

317
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,000
Gu Mingze,

318
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,600
you have to control yourself.

319
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,760
I don't want to see you on the legal channel.

320
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,160
Who said that?

321
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,760
I didn't take it.

322
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,520
Fine.

323
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,040
I'll visit you

324
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,160
once every few months.

325
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,640
It's hard to say when I have time.

326
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,720
After all, the prison is too far away from the school.

327
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,280
I'm leaving.

328
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,320
I feel like you're going to write me every week.

329
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,840
I'm really leaving.

330
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,320
Fine.

331
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,560
I'll tell mom

332
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,680
not to buy milk tonight.

333
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,160
You're eating milk tonight?

334
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,440
Then let's go back to Qinan

335
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,480
after we finish eating.

336
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,880
I can't go back to the lab to transfer the information.

337
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,200
If the chief executive of the Lingda

338
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,000
finds out that I passed the election,

339
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,280
I'll be in trouble again.

340
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,640
Let's go.

341
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,480
Well...

342
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,360
Did you say me?

343
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,380
Aарon?

344
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,040
I do.

345
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,740
Sure.

346
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,640
I'll bring her over Первon.

347
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,440
Why are you here?

348
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
I should be asking you.

349
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,440
You chose the topic for a year.

350
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,440
You're the first.

351
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,440
Why do you force yourself to participate?

352
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,440
You'll have more chances in the future.

353
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,440
I don't have many chances.

354
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,840
The chance is just a little.

355
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,840
People like you who have been stubborn since you were a child

356
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,840
won't be able to get the chance to turn over.

357
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,840
I don't want to be a third-year sweeper under the supervision of Chief Steward Lin.

358
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,840
You're saying Cao Cao is a thief?

359
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,840
She's the one who bullied you?

360
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,840
No, no.

361
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,840
Auntie!

362
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,840
Auntie!

363
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,240
If Chief Steward Lin finds out that I'm having a deep relationship with her,

364
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,240
she'll be more serious than me.

365
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,240
I heard from Senior Gao that you came back to collect the equipment.

366
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,240
So I brought you some very popular tea and milk tea.

367
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
Tea?

368
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,240
Where is she?

369
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,240
Is she with you?

370
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,240
She's with me.

371
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,240
What?

372
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,240
She's with me.

373
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,160
Be quick.

374
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:53,200
Oh, oh!

375
00:19:53,200 --> 00:20:12,080
Oh, oh!

376
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,520
What kind of model is suitable for what kind of algorithm?

377
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,200
First, you need to be sure about the data model.

378
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,120
Are you going to optimize the original model

379
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,560
or create a new data model?

380
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,840
I'll try to stand on my ex's shoulder.

381
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,080
Do you have any model recommendations?

382
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,120
How about this?

383
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,120
I'll send you some developer websites.

384
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,960
There are many open source technical tools

385
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,120
and data storage.

386
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,880
I've collected some

387
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,440
interesting data models myself.

388
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,480
I'll send them to you.

389
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,760
Thank you, my treasured brother.

390
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
If only there was an AI like you.

391
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,920
You must answer the question.

392
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,640
Who cares about the exam and the topic?

393
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,000
AI.

394
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,680
Chatting?

395
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,840
Tools?

396
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,160
That's

397
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,840
a deep sick ten years afterwards.

398
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,800
But Deep Six has been working on it

399
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,400
from the technical part to the model release.

400
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,720
Their team has spent a long time to make it.

401
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,400
I'm just a little white.

402
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,640
I don't even know

403
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,560
if I can make the initial infrastructure.

404
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,720
If I don't choose the topic meeting this time,

405
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,400
I'll still...

406
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,080
Now it's not too late to give up.

407
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,560
You want to kick me again?

408
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,760
I can't give up.

409
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,120
You've been found out.

410
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,400
You're getting smarter and smarter.

411
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,440
You don't need to use the kick-and-jump technique twice.

412
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,400
What's wrong with Senior Gao?

413
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,240
You haven't had breakfast yet?

414
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,480
Let's go and have a meal.

415
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,880
I'm not hungry.

416
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,080
I'll go and have breakfast.

417
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,040
I'll go and have breakfast.

418
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,120
I'll go and have breakfast.

419
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,120
I'll go and have breakfast.

420
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,960
Go and have breakfast.

421
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,160
No.

422
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,880
Senior Gao,

423
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,840
what did you do?

424
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,240
I'll help you figure out a way.

425
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,240
Forget it.

426
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,800
You can do it yourself.

427
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,480
I can do it.

428
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,520
I'm independent.

429
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,040
Come on.

430
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,360
Come on.

431
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,560
Master, there are plates and bowls inside.

432
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,560
Don't break them.

433
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,360
Slow down.

434
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:05,880
Okay.

435
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,520
Don't worry.

436
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,160
Be careful.

437
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,760
Be careful.

438
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,360
Be careful.

439
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,960
Be careful.

440
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,160
Be careful.

441
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,800
Be careful.

442
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:14,960
Okay.

443
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,840
Thank you.

444
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,240
Okay.

445
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,000
Come on.

446
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
I think

447
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,000
we're going to change the new house.

448
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,680
You have to change the plates and bowls.

449
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,800
Change them all?

450
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,080
Of course.

451
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,040
How much will it cost?

452
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,280
Don't you know how much the house costs?

453
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,240
Besides, you can't use the old bowls.

454
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,280
You have to save money.

455
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,080
I especially appreciate your idea of saving money.

456
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,800
Look at us.

457
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,640
We've saved for decades.

458
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,080
But we didn't save a house.

459
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,960
This is a great idea.

460
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,720
Accurate control.

461
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,960
I'll teach you the financial power of our family.

462
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,320
I'll hit wherever he points.

463
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,560
You'll hit wherever he points?

464
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,920
Then I don't need to point.

465
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,800
No.

466
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,760
You point.

467
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,840
You point at me.

468
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,400
I'll jump when you point at me.

469
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,000
You're a girl slave.

470
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,560
Right?

471
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,800
You're biased.

472
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,920
When your son hears it,

473
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,440
he'll be jealous.

474
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:10,960
Well,

475
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,040
he won't be jealous.

476
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,240
Our son

477
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,800
is thinking about

478
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,720
tree balance and 3D modeling.

479
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,000
I think he won't be jealous.

480
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,720
He'll be jealous.

481
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,720
Be careful.

482
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,040
What?

483
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,880
A game of eating chicken.

484
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,080
It's said that

485
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,800
a team member will eat a chicken.

486
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,360
What can he eat?

487
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,600
I don't know.

488
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,880
I'll go inside to check it.

489
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,080
I think I've got it.

490
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,080
I have news.

491
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,360
Great.

492
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,720
I'll find it.

493
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,920
Classmate,

494
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,360
someone is here.

495
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,840
Did you see the book?

496
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,760
Morning.

497
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:10,880
No.

498
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,160
How did you get in?

499
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,000
It's okay.

500
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,520
As we all know,

501
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,880
most of the physical transformation

502
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,160
has a limit.

503
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,480
That is,

504
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,760
their elasticity

505
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,800
is within a certain range.

506
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,000
But when the external force disappears...

507
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,920
Why do you look at me

508
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,960
instead of the blackboard?

509
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,080
I can't understand

510
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,960
what's written on the blackboard.

511
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,240
So,

512
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,120
why do you listen to

513
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,120
this class?

514
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,040
It's called

515
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,440
The Uncertainty of Efficiency.

516
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,480
I found that...

517
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,040
The last row.

518
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,400
You two.

519
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,440
I just talked about elasticity.

520
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,880
You

521
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,240
can give me an example.

522
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,160
Okay.

523
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,280
Stop hiding.

524
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,120
Just you two.

525
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,440
For example,

526
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,280
rubber.

527
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,800
Rubber

528
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,640
is indeed the most representative

529
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,360
of elasticity.

530
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,200
Great.

531
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,000
Sit down.

532
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,480
The guy next to you.

533
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,520
Give me another example.

534
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,600
Why are you laughing?

535
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,160
Did you listen carefully?

536
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,600
I did.

537
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,440
I just didn't think of

538
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,480
an example.

539
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,280
By the way, teacher,

540
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,200
can I be considered a elastic?

541
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,120
Teacher, look.

542
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,680
My mom said that

543
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,800
I looked like a ball

544
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,400
when I was a kid.

545
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,240
She patted me and moved.

546
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,520
When she pressured me,

547
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,120
I couldn't help it.

548
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,040
I could only transform.

549
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,680
But when they ignored me,

550
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,880
I recovered.

551
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,040
Do you think

552
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,080
this is the elasticity

553
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,400
you mentioned?

554
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,600
I'm not a elastic.

555
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
I'm a elastic.

556
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
I'm a elastic.

557
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
I'm a elastic.

558
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
I'm a elastic.

559
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,600
I'm a elastic.

560
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,600
I'm a elastic.

561
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,600
You're still

562
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,600
trying to fool me, right?

563
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
You're laughing at me.

564
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,600
Are you from our department?

565
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
Let's continue.

566
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,600
We've just

567
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,600
learned about it.

568
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,600
I've read

569
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,600
the questions you asked.

570
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,600
This time,

571
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,600
the same type of question

572
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,600
is kept in principle.

573
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
I picked

574
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,600
some good ones from here.

575
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,600
The students who read the names

576
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,600
should prepare their questions.

577
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
We'll discuss it in a meeting today.

578
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,600
Changshu.

579
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
Yes.

580
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,600
Wenbo.

581
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
Yes.

582
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
Wang Zhiqiang.

583
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,600
Yes.

584
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,600
Who didn't write

585
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
the last question?

586
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
Didn't write the name?

587
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,600
You should.

588
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,600
Report!

589
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,600
It's me.

590
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,600
Gu Xuejiang.

591
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,600
Did you really write this?

592
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,600
Yes.

593
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,600
Good.

594
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
Very good.

595
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
You are very good.

596
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,600
Good.

597
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,600
Very good.

598
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,600
A freshman

599
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
can make such a

600
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
comprehensive choice.

601
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,600
It's amazing.

602
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,600
Gu Xuejiang.

603
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,600
Let's start

604
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,600
with your choice today.

605
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,600
Professor Tan.

606
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
What about my choice?

607
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,600
Your choice this time

608
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,600
is still about old technology.

609
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,600
Gu Xuejiang's choice

610
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,600
is already about

611
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,600
technological change.

612
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,600
So this time,

613
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,600
don't open the question in time

614
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,600
and cooperate with Little Ten to complete his project.

615
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,600
You should take this time

616
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,600
to sort out

617
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,600
your own selection idea.

618
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
Okay.

619
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,600
Gu Xuejiang, start.

620
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,600
Gu Mingze!

621
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,600
You are Gu Mingze, right?

622
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
I'm online.

623
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,600
Are you here

624
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,600
to accompany your girlfriend to class?

625
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,600
Yes.

626
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
I'm her friend.

627
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,600
Can I take a picture with you?

628
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,600
Let's take another one.

629
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,600
Okay, that's enough.

630
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,600
Xue...

631
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
Why is my headband with you?

632
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
I came to school

633
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,600
to find you before.

634
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,600
I forgot to take it

635
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,600
after I put down my hair.

636
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,600
And then

637
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,600
I forgot to return it to you.

638
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,600
Then return it to me.

639
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
Teacher,

640
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,600
senior and senior,

641
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
hello.

642
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,600
My topic this time

643
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,600
is an artificial intelligence language processing program

644
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,600
based on the transformer's

645
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,600
neural network structure.

646
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,600
It can interact through

647
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,600
learning and understanding

648
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,600
human conversations.

649
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,600
It can also communicate

650
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
according to the chat's upper and lower languages,

651
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,600
and communicate like a real human being.

652
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
It can even complete

653
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,600
the work of writing video scripts,

654
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,600
documents, emails, translations,

655
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
codes and so on.

656
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
I'm going to work.

657
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
You set this up

658
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
for me this morning, right?

659
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,600
I have good news to tell you.

660
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
Your selection

661
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
has been selected as

662
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
one of the main projects

663
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,600
of this year's school's cooperation.

664
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,600
If you have any ideas

665
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
or needs,

666
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,600
you can ask me.

667
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
Is it possible

668
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,600
to put my AI framework

669
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,600
into CE's car system?

670
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
Good idea.

671
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
It's very effective.

672
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,600
You can talk to Xiaoli.

673
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
Professor Tan,

674
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
although my design inspiration

675
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
is indeed popular,

676
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,600
but I did

677
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,600
complete the underlying structure

678
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,600
by myself.

679
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,600
Just like you said,

680
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,600
I'm the tiger hiding in the golden age.

681
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,600
I agree.

682
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,600
Add the AI model

683
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
into the CE's car system.

684
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,600
What are you talking about?

685
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,600
I'm not talking about you.

686
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,600
I'm talking about you.

687
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
I'm talking about you.

688
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,600
When did you get used to

689
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,600
eavesdropping on

690
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,600
the eight-door style?

691
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,600
Are you a dragon or a tiger?

692
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,600
I'm the tiger hiding in the golden age.

693
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,600
I'm proud of you.

694
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
Let's go inside.

695
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,600
Hello?

696
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,600
Gu Xuejiang.

697
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,600
What's wrong, Gao Rui?

698
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,600
I borrowed the car from Lin

699
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
from Yue.

700
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,600
I tested your smart model

701
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
with the real car.

702
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,600
But your voice AI

703
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,600
took the car

704
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,600
into the ditch in half an hour.

705
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,600
What?

706
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,600
What do you mean?

707
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,600
I don't understand.

708
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,600
Say it again.

709
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,600
The position deviation is only 300%.

710
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
You can check it yourself.

711
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,600
I'm sorry.

712
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,600
I'm sorry.

713
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,600
I'm sorry.

714
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,600
I'm sorry.

715
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,600
I'm sorry.

716
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,600
How will you pay me back?

717
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,600
I'm sorry.

718
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
I'm sorry.

719
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,600
I'm sorry.

720
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
I'm sorry.

721
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
I'm sorry.

722
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,600
I'm sorry.

723
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,600
I'm sorry.

724
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,600
Why is the engagement

725
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,600
drifting beyond

726
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,600
public roads?

727
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,600
You winged me.

728
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,640
Why are there NEWS TV Nemo?

729
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,080
Why have they been driving until here?

730
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,840
Where are them?

731
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,560
Didn't you say what happened in the restaurant last time?

732
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,720
I just wanted to ask you

733
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,800
if it was true.

734
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,400
No, I didn't pull anyっ

735
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,120
unique prisoner.

736
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,920
If I had played a great role in this police procedure,

737
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,600
there would likely be a big party gathered.

738
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,840
But I didn't think about my développement.

739
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,880
Try to understand me,agree?

740
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,640
Okay.

741
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,640
If Chang Qi Chu dates someone,

742
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,800
let it be tactilely.

743
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,320
I just wanted someone to know

744
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,200
most of the meaning of love,

745
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,200
especially your mother.

746
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,520
Then let her know

747
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,840
you are willing to do anything.

748
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:18,760
Okay.

749
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,600
I've checked.

750
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,600
Then I'll double-check it.

751
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,600
Because I'm not sure

752
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,600
if I'm good at

753
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,600
chasing girls.

754
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,600
I can double-check

755
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,600
and check again and again

756
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,600
for the numbers I'm not sure.

757
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,600
But when I face you,

758
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,600
I...

759
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,600
I'm not that confident.

760
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,600
I'm not that confident.

761
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
I'm afraid

762
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,600
that you might not like me one day.

763
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,600
That you might

764
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,600
like someone else one day.

765
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,600
That you might

766
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,600
not like wearing glasses,

767
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
doing technology,

768
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,600
or doing sports.

769
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,600
I don't know.

770
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,600
I don't know why.

771
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,600
Then ask me again.

772
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,600
Gu Xue Jiao.

773
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,600
Be my girlfriend.

774
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,600
Okay.

775
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,600
Then...

776
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,600
I'll kiss you now.

777
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
I'll kiss you now.

778
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,600
I'll kiss you now.

779
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
I'll kiss you now.

780
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,600
I'll kiss you now.

781
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,600
I'll kiss you now.

782
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,600
I'll kiss you now.

783
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,600
I'll kiss you now.

784
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,600
I'll kiss you now.

785
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,600
I'll kiss you now.

786
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,600
I'll kiss you now.

787
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,600
I'll kiss you now.

788
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,600
I'll kiss you now.

789
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,600
I'll kiss you now.

790
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,600
I'll kiss you now.

791
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,600
I'll kiss you now.

792
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,600
I'll kiss you now.

793
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,600
I'll kiss you now.

794
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,600
I'll kiss you now.

795
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
I'll kiss you now.

796
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,600
I'll kiss you now.

797
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,600
I'll kiss you now.

798
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,600
I'll kiss you now.

799
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,600
I'll kiss you now.

800
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,600
I'll kiss you now.

801
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,600
I'll kiss you now.

802
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,600
I'll kiss you now.

803
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,600
I'll kiss you now.

804
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,600
I'll kiss you now.

805
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,600
I'll kiss you now.

806
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,600
I'll kiss you now.

807
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,600
I'll kiss you now.

808
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,600
So you lied to me to come here

809
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,600
and let me admit

810
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,600
I was your girlfriend.

811
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,600
I was trapped here too.

812
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
The car can't move.

813
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
System detected that

814
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,600
your vehicle has not been moved long enough.

815
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,600
Please confirm.

816
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,600
Isn't this my voice?

817
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,600
I've put your voice into our system's ecosystem.

818
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,600
So that when Xiyi enters the market,

819
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,600
everyone who rents our car

820
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,600
can hear your voice.

821
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,600
I like this gift.

822
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,600
It's good that you like it.

823
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,600
How about your boyfriend?

824
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,600
This is not a haste.

825
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,600
We have to have a period.

826
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,600
I'm such an outstanding employee.

827
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,600
I have to sign a lifetime contract and a probation period.

828
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,600
You definitely have to have a probation period.

829
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,600
See if you can make me satisfied.

830
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,600
Satisfied?

831
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,600
I'm sorry.

832
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,600
Morning.

833
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
Morning.

834
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,600
Morning.

835
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,600
That's it.

836
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,600
Amazing.

837
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,600
Let me introduce you to our new staff.

838
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,600
Hello, I'm Shu Lan from Mechanical Engineering.

839
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,600
I'm a junior in the third year.

840
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,600
I'm Shu Lan.

841
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,600
Please show your support to our senior colleagues.

842
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
Hello.

843
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,600
I have good news.

844
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,600
Our second generation unmanned driving model has been established.

845
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,600
If the gambling agreement is successful,

846
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,600
everyone's wealth and freedom will be expected.

847
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,600
From now on, Xiyi is officially on the track.

848
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,520
We will bring more valuable projects to the school in the future.

849
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,600
Let's all work hard together.

850
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,760
Okay.

851
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,360
Let's work hard.

852
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,360
The BNC is done.

853
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,080
With you guys...

854
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,120
It's rare to meet a genius senior.

855
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,120
What can't we do?

856
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,680
Enough.

857
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,680
Get back to work.

858
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,680
Let's go.

859
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,080
I'm so sorry.

860
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,960
Mr. Zheng has a car on the way.

861
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,400
Have some tea.

862
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,400
Thank you.

863
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Mr. Zheng is here.

864
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,440
I'll go get him.

865
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
Okay.

866
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,800
Lin.

867
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,440
This place doesn't look cheap.

868
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,480
Are you going to ask us to buy it?

869
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,160
It's different from yours.

870
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,520
Is your dear father here?

871
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,880
He didn't want to come.

872
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,360
He didn't want to deal with them.

873
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,080
Please show some self-awareness.

874
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,360
Face to face, father and father.

875
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,120
You're here.

876
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:47,840
You're leaving.

877
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,440
No problem.

878
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,160
You're right.

879
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:49,760
That's right.

880
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,640
It's what I should do.

881
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:55,240
It's been a long time since we've seen a genius senior.

882
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,240
Mr. Zheng.

883
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,120
Please have a seat.

884
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:03,920
Come on.

885
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,920
Please sit.

886
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,760
Lin.

887
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,760
Sit next to me.

888
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,120
Okay.

889
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,600
A young man who's afraid of the wind and the snow.

890
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,800
We're not going to be too formal today.

891
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,800
We're going to be senior and junior.

892
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,040
Since we've poured the wine,

893
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,640
let's have a toast.

894
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,800
Okay.

895
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,960
Pour the wine.

896
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,600
Okay.

897
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,800
Fill it up.

898
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,560
Okay.

899
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,640
He can't drink.

900
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,520
I'll drink for him.

901
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,600
What's wrong?

902
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,640
Were you afraid of the boys drinking?

903
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,200
It's okay.

904
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:47,640
Don't worry.

905
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,840
Since senior is here,

906
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,920
no one dares to bully you.

907
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,600
Right.

908
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,600
Come on.

909
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,480
Fill it up.

910
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,320
Mr. Zheng.

911
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,720
Senior.

912
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,720
I don't drink when I work.

913
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,800
Drinking is a matter of alcohol tolerance.

914
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,080
There are too many questions about whether you drink or not.

915
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,560
Right.

916
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,720
Drinking is about feelings, right?

917
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,160
Right.

918
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,760
Only when you have feelings

919
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,160
can you be our BNC.

920
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,680
Give me the wine.

921
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,600
The company's long-term room is upstairs.

922
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,320
If you drink too much,

923
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,920
I'll book a room for you.

924
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,920
You can live here.

925
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,760
It's much more comfortable than the dormitory in Beijing University.

926
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,320
That's too long.

927
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,200
SOS.

928
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,760
Tang Sen is in the plate hole now.

929
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,440
Help me hold it.

930
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,600
Where are you going?

931
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,760
Save Tang Sen.

932
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,200
The room is dark.

933
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,200
Light a lamp.

934
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,200
Be careful.

935
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,200
There won't be any empty voices.

936
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,200
The room is dark.

937
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,200
Light a lamp.

938
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,200
Be careful.

939
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:20,200
There won't be any empty voices.

940
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,200
The room is dark.

941
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,200
Light a lamp.

942
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,200
Be careful.

943
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,640
Light a lamp.

944
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,640
Be careful.

945
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,640
Light a lamp.

946
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,640
Be careful.

947
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,640
Light a lamp.

948
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,640
Be careful.

949
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,640
Light a lamp.

950
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,640
Be careful.

951
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,640
Light a lamp.

952
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,640
Be careful.

953
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,640
Light a lamp.

954
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,640
Be careful.

955
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,640
Light a lamp.

956
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,640
Be careful.

957
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,080
Light a lamp.

958
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,080
Be careful.

959
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,080
Light a lamp.

960
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,080
