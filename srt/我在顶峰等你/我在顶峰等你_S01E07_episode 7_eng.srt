 "Burning Tempo" - Duan Aojuan 

3
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,900
♫  One, two, three, four  ♫

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,740
♫  Don't be afraid of the so-called star student  ♫

5
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,480
♫  You are also someone else's legend  ♫

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,240
♫  Don't hold back, grow with all your might  ♫

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,980
♫  Midsummer's flowers  ♫

8
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,600
♫  Now is the time to format your life  ♫

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,540
♫  Youth is full of obstacles,  ♫

10
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:49,320
♫  But we'll slowly become stronger  ♫

11
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,100
♫  My heart still burns passionately  ♫

12
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,920
♫  Follow the tempo, set yourself free  ♫

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,620
♫  The illuminated night sky guides me to success  ♫

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,480
♫  I'll accompany you as you bravely take flight  ♫

15
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,300
♫  My love still burns passionately   ♫

16
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,960
♫  Shining in the smiling eyes  ♫

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,640
♫  Let us transcend the obstacles of time  ♫

18
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,960
   

19
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,930
   

20
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,600
You've learned to be shady quickly. You're talented.

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,310
What are you talking about? I don't understand.

22
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,190
Of course!

23
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,985
Though I was framed, it's a fact that smoking's bad for health,

24
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:53,225
especially for high school students.

25
00:01:53,975 --> 00:01:58,630
You were just looking out for us.

26
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,520
By the way, why did you drop by today?

27
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,640
I'm here to catch someone, too.

28
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,670
Catch someone...

29
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,810
You go ahead. I'll leave.

30
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,550
You don't have time for tutoring, but you have time for the basketball game.

31
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,535
Gu Xuejiao, don't get cocky.

32
00:02:27,845 --> 00:02:31,640
But, look, a great man can study on a busy street.

33
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,990
I memorized English vocabulary by the basketball court.

34
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:38,830
Only hardened willpower can fight a heavy study load.

35
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,390
There's something more harmful than study load.

36
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,200
What?

37
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,150
I saw it just now.

38
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,990
When your male tablemate went on the court,

39
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,150
you cheered the loudest.

40
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,150
That's not right, Senior Brother Lin.

41
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,080
Just because Yi Tianyu is my tablemate, I have to like him?

42
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,415
What bizarre logic is that?

43
00:02:56,415 --> 00:02:58,965
Greed comes from what's seen daily.

44
00:02:59,565 --> 00:03:02,000
Who said that? That's pretty good.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,470
I'll write it down. Maybe I can use it in a Chinese test.

46
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:11,320
Today is already the 15th?

47
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,360
You can't keep up with studying, right?

48
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,785
 We almost missed the chance to get the demolition money. 

49
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,480
No matter what, no one can stop me from moving forward,

50
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,160
from drawing my sword or from earning money.

51
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,680
I've suffered before; I can't let it happen again.

52
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:32,765
Starting now, the nickname "Abbess Miejue" will be the greatest praise for me. 
  (Wuxia character) 

53
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:41,510
 Including you, Senior Brother Lin. 

54
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,420
Bye, see you.

55
00:03:54,055 --> 00:03:57,430
 Go! Yi Tianyu! Go! 

56
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,518
 No. 7! No. 7! No. 8's nemesis! 

57
00:04:01,518 --> 00:04:03,548
 No. 7! No. 7! 

58
00:04:07,685 --> 00:04:09,253
Game over.

59
00:04:09,253 --> 00:04:12,600
   

60
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,740
   
   

61
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,630
You said you were studying English and told me not to disturb you.

62
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,570
So, it was all a lie?

63
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:52,750
No.

64
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,260
Mom, sorry, it's my fault.

65
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,730
Today, there was a basketball game at school, so I went...

66
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,820
Basketball game?

67
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,620
It's your third year. You still have that luxury?

68
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,305
I was only there for two hours. I came home right after. I didn't...

69
00:05:03,305 --> 00:05:06,865
You could've done a full practice test in two hours.

70
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,380
If you keep slacking like this, Gu Xuejiao will surpass you.

71
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,840
Her mom has been very happy these days.

72
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,090
Humming while cleaning, so annoying.

73
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,455
And you? You're still not trying hard enough.

74
00:05:19,455 --> 00:05:21,575
You should know better.

75
00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:24,890
But this time, I ranked ninth in the grade.

76
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,900
Gu Xuejiao only got lucky and ranked 99th.

77
00:05:28,765 --> 00:05:30,650
She simply can't compare to me.

78
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,760
And she was there at the game today, too. Why couldn't I go?

79
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,575
Why are you yelling? Are you talking back?

80
00:05:43,695 --> 00:05:45,290
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,210
Think about it.

82
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,680
The placement test is coming soon.

83
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,175
If you don't get into the top five this time, don't bother coming home.

84
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,180
Why!

85
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:20,060
 Who is it? 

86
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,565
 Yes. I'm her parent. 

87
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,980
Mom.

88
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,660
Old Gu,

89
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,770
you've rented my place for many years now.

90
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:09,520
Yeah.

91
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,405
The new door frame has turned into an old door frame.

92
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,760
The new furniture has become old furniture.

93
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,585
- That's right. 
 - The new key...

94
00:07:22,585 --> 00:07:26,025
Old Gu, a new car key?

95
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:28,310
You bought a new car?

96
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,920
It's the company's.

97
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,420
The company's.

98
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,210
So, you found a new job already?

99
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,415
Looks like you must be doing pretty well lately.

100
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,590
- Here. Have some water. 
 - Okay.

101
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,660
Here is the thing.

102
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,795
Old Liu, I was hoping to talk to you.

103
00:07:44,795 --> 00:07:49,790
You see, we usually pay the next quarter's rent in this quarter.

104
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,730
Yeah.

105
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,165
Do you think we can delay it?

106
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:54,055
I'll pay next quarter's rent then.

107
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,180
Old Gu, what do you mean?

108
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,690
Are you saying I'm being unreasonable?

109
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,430
- No, not at all! 
 - No, not at all!

110
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,460
We didn't mean that.

111
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,620
To be honest, I'm a bit short on cash.

112
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,190
We're old colleagues from the factory.

113
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,530
Don't worry.

114
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:15,875
I'm not here to collect rent today.

115
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,795
I'm here to return it.

116
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:23,360
I want to sell this place.

117
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,555
Sell it?

118
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:27,655
We'll buy it.

119
00:08:31,555 --> 00:08:35,180
Look, this is where we live now.

120
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,580
Due to the increasing urbanization rate

121
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,460
and the spatial spillover effects of urban planning,

122
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,820
this is the best site for a new embassy district.

123
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,320
And here is the best junction for the ring and subway lines.

124
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,980
If we buy this house now,

125
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,040
it'll get demolished in less than a year.

126
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,420
She doesn't have a fever.

127
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,560
But why is she talking nonsense?

128
00:09:00,555 --> 00:09:01,660
I'm not making this up.

129
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,060
Senior Brother Lin told me that.

130
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:08,490
He has an algorithm model that can analyze market trends.

131
00:09:09,526 --> 00:09:11,646
All kinds of trends?

132
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,090
The truth is often in the hands of a few.

133
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,970
Dad, look what happened to your factory.

134
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:24,230
If Senior Brother Lin hadn't figured out the future trend of the telecom market

135
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,580
and given me a heads-up,

136
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,805
with your old-school way of thinking, we might've...

137
00:09:28,805 --> 00:09:31,125
Yeah...

138
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:35,440
Oh, right! Can Xiao Lin's model predict stock trends, too?

139
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,730
- Of course! 
 - Really?

140
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,540
Look! He recommended a stock before.

141
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,235
6003134.

142
00:09:42,235 --> 00:09:44,275
Look how fast it's skyrocketed.

143
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,730
It's gone up this much?

144
00:09:49,275 --> 00:09:51,060
   

145
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,960
Buy the house!

146
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:55,820
Let's listen to Xiao Lin's advice.

147
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,300
Remember the severance issue last time?

148
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,490
Xiao Lin saved our whole family.

149
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,150
So, this time, we go with what he says.

150
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,110
Yes!

151
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,900
Your mom's got a good point.

152
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:09,360
Wait, Honey, actually, I lost some money on my stocks.

153
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,900
It might not be enough.

154
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,275
Please, go easy on me.

155
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:13,775
Get up.

156
00:10:14,795 --> 00:10:16,520
Everything will turn out all right.

157
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,851
- We'll figure something out. 
 - Okay.

158
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,451
Buy it!

159
00:10:23,515 --> 00:10:25,460
Abandon...

160
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,150
Abandon...

161
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,210
Abandon...

162
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,090
Abandon... Abandon.

163
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,310
A-B-A-N-D-O-N.

164
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,705
Abandon...

165
00:10:35,705 --> 00:10:37,206
Abandon.

166
00:10:37,206 --> 00:10:38,785
Go...

167
00:10:39,825 --> 00:10:41,660
Xiao Tian, move it!

168
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,880
Then get in here yourself!

169
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,580
I'll pass. I'm studying.

170
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,555
A-B-A-N-D-O-N. Abandon...

171
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:50,905
Abandon...

172
00:10:50,905 --> 00:10:52,060
You missed that shot?

173
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,560
If you think you're better, get in.

174
00:10:57,426 --> 00:10:59,126
Nice shot!

175
00:11:07,055 --> 00:11:08,330
Hey, I'm looking for someone.

176
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,150
The one wearing the No. 10 jersey in the recent basketball league.

177
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,820
Has he stopped coming to practice?

178
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,320
Yi Tianyu quit.

179
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,940
He's...

180
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,970
You look familiar.

181
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,805
You're the creep that's been spying on our practices.

182
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,885
It's you?

183
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,610
Students, you misunderstood.

184
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,800
Who are you?

185
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,585
Hi, I'm a coach from the PE department of Jinghai University of Finance and Economics.

186
00:11:31,585 --> 00:11:34,335
JUFE?

187
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,870
I...

188
00:11:47,475 --> 00:11:48,460
 You came to pick me up? 

189
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,717
 You matter more than work. 

190
00:11:49,717 --> 00:11:51,060
 Great, listen, 

191
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,370
 let me take you to that amazing place tonight. 

192
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:56,130
 I was so focused on creating this "I love Xuejiao" thing. 

193
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,560
 I'm pitiful. 

194
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,905
- Xuejiao, I... 
  -  Accept him! 

195
00:11:58,905 --> 00:12:00,605
- No! 
  - Accept him! 

196
00:12:03,985 --> 00:12:05,610
I haven't even said anything yet.

197
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,220
A teacher from JUFE came to me.

198
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,100
He saw our game against No. 8 High and thought I had potential.

199
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,510
   

200
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:15,110
If I can score 300 points, I can get into their school.

201
00:12:18,435 --> 00:12:21,820
That's great news. Good for you.

202
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,520
Then why did you kneel? You scared me to death.

203
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,720
You can't die. If you die, who's going to tutor me in academics?

204
00:12:28,935 --> 00:12:30,150
I?

205
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,110
Tutor you?

206
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,385
- In academics? 
 - Yeah.

207
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,185
Very funny.

208
00:12:38,115 --> 00:12:41,080
Xuejiao, I'm going all in now. You have to help me.

209
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,345
Get in line. Let me ask my own brother to go all in for once.

210
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:50,960
What do you want?

211
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,460
Actually, I think you can help him.

212
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,100
Only if you help me, too.

213
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,740
I tutor both of you?

214
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,910
Are you asking to be ruined?

215
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,665
Look! What's this?

216
00:13:11,335 --> 00:13:13,090
If anything ever happens to Senior Brother Lin,

217
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,505
the cops could use this photo to pin you as the suspect.

218
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,370
If you tutor me,

219
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,270
I'd be like Little Uncle's grand-student.

220
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:24,275
That basically means I'm taught by the Study God himself.

221
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:26,915
It's better than worshipping his picture.

222
00:13:26,915 --> 00:13:29,685
Give me a break. It's the third mock exam.

223
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,780
Please.

224
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,680
Please.

225
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,180
- Please. 
 - Please.

226
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,375
- Xuejiao, you're the best. 
 - Please, Xuejiao.

227
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,330
- You're the best. 
 - Please.

228
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,530
Stop!

229
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,615
 Guess I'll have to use the first lesson Senior Brother Lin taught me, 

230
00:13:45,615 --> 00:13:48,185
 the forcing of the Art of Tactical Retreat. 

231
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,910
Finish these before school ends today.

232
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,060
Then, I'll help you two.

233
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,560
- Really? 
 - Really?

234
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,260
Okay!

235
00:14:27,795 --> 00:14:31,010
Sister Li, buying a house is a good thing.

236
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,705
It's so hot today.

237
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,075
Here, have a drink.

238
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,900
    

239
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,820
Actually,

240
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,780
it's all my husband's fault.

241
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,705
If he hadn't lost money in the stock market,

242
00:14:45,705 --> 00:14:48,025
we'd have enough for the down payment.

243
00:14:48,985 --> 00:14:50,330
No wonder.

244
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,940
It's Monday. You should be off.

245
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,635
Yet you still came here.

246
00:14:54,635 --> 00:14:56,915
So that's what this is for?

247
00:14:56,915 --> 00:14:59,010
Don't worry, Sister Li.

248
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,900
We're family after all.

249
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,560
I'll help you when you need it.

250
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,490
Thank you so much.

251
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,580
It's not that much.

252
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,030
- Just short by five... 
 - Five hundred?

253
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:15,010
I'll give it to you now. No big deal.

254
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,125
- Here. 
 - Wait...

255
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,825
Take this.

256
00:15:18,705 --> 00:15:21,490
Solve your problem first.

257
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,860
You can pay me back whenever. No rush.

258
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,180
Wait, this might not be enough.

259
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,490
- It's five... 
 - Why not enough? It's plenty.

260
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,250
Let me tell you! There are agencies that help you haggle.

261
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,090
You pay them 500 yuan,

262
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:38,490
and they can talk prices down by tens of thousands.

263
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,060
That sounds unlikely...

264
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,840
We actually know the landlord pretty well.

265
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,370
We've been friends for years. He won't...

266
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,540
How much do they even want?

267
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,060
That place isn't worth much.

268
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,480
It's dark and rundown.

269
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,945
Even if it were free, others may not want it.

270
00:15:58,275 --> 00:15:59,660
Think about it again.

271
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,540
These days, when buying a place,

272
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,250
it's not about money but about negotiation skills.

273
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,105
Don't let your landlord fool you.

274
00:16:07,105 --> 00:16:08,805
Coming.

275
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,820
Hi, Mingze. Come on in...

276
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,940
Auntie.

277
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,180
Haven't heard from you for a while. How are you?

278
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,820
Are you still prepping for the exam?

279
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,310
Yes, that's right. I'm still prepping.

280
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,085
Look at this poor boy.

281
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:30,215
How many years has it been?

282
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,680
Honestly, you might as well get a job.

283
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,820
If it's hard to find one, just tell me.

284
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,990
My husband can help set you up.

285
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,370
That won't be necessary.

286
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,660
This kid's grown up and has ambition.

287
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,000
He doesn't come home right away after school.

288
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,980
Keeps crashing his sister's tutoring sessions.

289
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,210
- Right? 
 - Yeah...

290
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,500
It's only four. Why did you come here? Shouldn't you be in the tutoring session?

291
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,275
Gu Xuejiao asked me to drop this off for you.

292
00:16:58,275 --> 00:17:00,030
For me?

293
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,590
That's a lot of cash. Where'd you get it?

294
00:17:09,055 --> 00:17:11,250
Actually, Xuejiao and I...

295
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:17,000
It's Dad, he bought the dip after tracking the recent moving average.

296
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,970
 Gu Xuejiao, these words are way too hard to memorize. 

297
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,040
Yeah. That's roughly it.

298
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,870
Dad told me I must sell today and bring you the cash.

299
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:30,570
Oh, the rest of the compensation money is also here.

300
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,010
These two bags of cash are so heavy.

301
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,585
Perfect. Let me drink that.

302
00:17:35,585 --> 00:17:37,285
That...

303
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,990
Why does it taste so bad?

304
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:44,266
It's expired.

305
00:17:45,085 --> 00:17:47,080
How much money have you got there?

306
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,665
You made it all from stocks?

307
00:17:52,645 --> 00:17:54,150
Anyway, it's enough.

308
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,390
Wanjun, thank you so much.

309
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,935
I have to go buy the house now.

310
00:17:58,935 --> 00:18:01,075
We'll be off then.

311
00:18:01,785 --> 00:18:03,490
Let's go.

312
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,590
Bye-bye, Auntie.

313
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,300
You brat!

314
00:18:08,495 --> 00:18:10,700
Hold it.

315
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,050
What are you showing off for? Mock me with all that cash?

316
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,780
A bunch of stupid, broke relatives.

317
00:18:20,706 --> 00:18:22,556
Hurry up.

318
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:31,010
Mom, I only skipped one college prep rally.

319
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:34,560
But I swear I've been through that every year.

320
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,105
I've even memorized every line the teacher says.

321
00:18:39,505 --> 00:18:41,660
You sold all our stocks?

322
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,415
But that's our golden goose!

323
00:18:46,215 --> 00:18:48,050
You're mad about that?

324
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,210
Xuejiao said it was Senior Brother Lin's idea.

325
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:53,010
 Senior Brother Lin ran his algorithm model 

326
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,900
 and found that a market crash is highly likely next year. 

327
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,585
 Thousands of stocks will hit limit down. 

328
00:18:57,585 --> 00:19:00,175
 We can't be the last bag holders. 

329
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:04,050
So, it's science?

330
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,020
Then we'd better follow.

331
00:19:07,785 --> 00:19:09,530
What's a "bag holder"?

332
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:13,435
No idea. Some Jinghai University science term?

333
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,500
Right, where's your sister?

334
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,400
The mock exam's soon.

335
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,235
She rushed off after class to study with Senior Brother Lin.

336
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,080
The tutoring money is really well spent.

337
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:29,280
What are you laughing at?

338
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,985
Shouldn't you be studying, too? Why are you still here?

339
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,560
Special case today.

340
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,105
This big bag of...

341
00:19:37,105 --> 00:19:39,105
Keep it down.

342
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,370
I have to carry it back home safely.

343
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,200
Fine.

344
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:47,530
But it's safer with me. Don't swing it around. Give it to me.

345
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,550
Go, study with your sister.

346
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,660
All right.

347
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,995
Get going already.

348
00:19:52,995 --> 00:19:55,195
I'm going.

349
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,150
This brat.

350
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,050
Yes, that's the one.

351
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:06,425
Once the market opens tomorrow, buy up as much stock as possible.

352
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,730
That bumpkin family can make money.

353
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:13,080
I don't believe I'd do worse.

354
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,680
 My company has tens of millions in liquidity. 

355
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,820
 I can make ten of your shabby apartments in minutes. 

356
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,540
   

357
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:32,520
   

358
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,620
Whose test papers are these?

359
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:51,435
Sun Tiantian's and Yi Tianyu's.

360
00:20:51,435 --> 00:20:53,190
Got this one right.

361
00:20:54,055 --> 00:20:56,210
You've got time to worry about others?

362
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:59,140
Pretty confident about the third mock, huh?

363
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,600
They forced me.

364
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,730
Look at their papers.

365
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,100
They left so many blanks.

366
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,240
It's basically three days of homework for me.

367
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,570
I have to teach them how to solve the major questions tomorrow.

368
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,460
Teach them?

369
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,150
Although learning by teaching

370
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,520
is very much in line with the Feynman Learning Method,

371
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,215
you yourself are also in need of help.

372
00:21:21,215 --> 00:21:25,540
Aren't you afraid of... misleading them?

373
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:32,820
So, you don't think I should teach them. Right?

374
00:21:39,938 --> 00:21:43,110
To be a better role model for others,

375
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:46,590
you should be stricter with yourself.

376
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,230
Finish this.

377
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,870
- That's a lot. 
 - Yes.

378
00:22:10,315 --> 00:22:11,201
   

379
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:11,980
   

380
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,158
Your high school life is coming to an end.

381
00:22:14,158 --> 00:22:16,770
The college entrance exam is also imminent.

382
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:21,160
Now, it's up to you to race against time.

383
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,800
Make every second count!

384
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,720
Make the most of your time.

385
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,220
Don't waste a single moment of your lives.

386
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,560
Stay grounded.

387
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,605
Don't miss a single opportunity in the final sprint.

388
00:22:36,115 --> 00:22:39,100
To succeed, you have to work hard.

389
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,070
 Don't look back, stay on track. 

390
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,900
No perm, no wave.

391
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,350
 Until college is saved. 

392
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,485
 Left foot to Tsinghua, right to Jinghai. 

393
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,100
The sword of destiny is in your own hands.

394
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,340
Let's go!

395
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:13,240
Draw your swords of victory and fight bravely!

396
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,795
Go, college entrance exam!

397
00:23:14,795 --> 00:23:18,315
 Go! Go! Go! 

398
00:23:19,355 --> 00:23:21,660
   

399
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,380
- Have you heard? 
 - You've heard it, too?

400
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,420
Yeah.

401
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,900
What have you heard?

402
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,180
- You tell him. 
 - No, you.

403
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,040
You.

404
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,280
Wait, anyone is fine. Just tell me.

405
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,180
Hurry.

406
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,235
 Xuejiao! 

407
00:23:32,235 --> 00:23:34,235
 Xuejiao! 

408
00:23:34,235 --> 00:23:35,670
Have you heard?

409
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,530
Yes!

410
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,730
Wait, you've all heard? Why am I left out?

411
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,325
Tell me now. What is it?

412
00:23:42,075 --> 00:23:44,140
We've heard...

413
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,885
- Teacher Yin's here. 
 - Teacher Yin's here.

414
00:23:53,745 --> 00:23:54,950
Class begins.

415
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,400
Stand up.

416
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,380
 Good morning, Teacher. 

417
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,795
Good morning, everyone. Sit down.

418
00:24:00,795 --> 00:24:02,795
Sorry!

419
00:24:02,795 --> 00:24:06,210
Teacher Yin. Sorry, I'm late.

420
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,305
Hold on.

421
00:24:07,305 --> 00:24:09,345
Who let you go to your seat?

422
00:24:10,535 --> 00:24:11,950
Stand there.

423
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,550
Come on.

424
00:24:15,735 --> 00:24:19,730
Do you hear my sigh? Why did I sigh?

425
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:24,365
Your results this time were generally not very good.

426
00:24:24,365 --> 00:24:25,860
In such a terrible situation,

427
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,220
some of you are still not focused on your studies.

428
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,840
Some were already at the bottom of our class,

429
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,380
and their results have dropped even further by many points.

430
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,900
I won't name your names.

431
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,770
Reflect on it yourselves.

432
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:41,360
Don't just lower your head. Do take it to heart.

433
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,970
I hope you can do some serious thinking.

434
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:51,340
But there are some students who did make progress.

435
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,240
Come up here.

436
00:24:54,685 --> 00:24:56,100
 No way. 

437
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,765
 This is my only time being late this semester. 

438
00:24:57,765 --> 00:25:00,285
 And I'm going to be made an example? 

439
00:25:05,185 --> 00:25:07,110
 You ungrateful bastards. 

440
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,950
 I worked so hard helping with your studies. 

441
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,700
 Now I'm in trouble, and you all just laugh at me. 

442
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:18,050
In this mock exam, all students in our class have significantly improved.

443
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,360
Some raised their score by a dozen points,

444
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,670
some even a hundred!

445
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,430
I am very, very happy for you.

446
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,140
In contrast,

447
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:32,880
some students who had previously performed well were overtaken.

448
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:40,070
This time, a dark horse charged into the top ten in the grade.

449
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,370
Guess who it is.

450
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,360
Gu Xuejiao.

451
00:25:46,355 --> 00:25:47,820
Tell me.

452
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:53,460
How did you manage to rank tenth in the entire grade without a word?

453
00:26:02,216 --> 00:26:04,316
Hear the cheers?

454
00:26:04,316 --> 00:26:08,085
That is Gu Xuejiao from Class 8.

455
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,215
Guys, that's Class 8.

456
00:26:11,215 --> 00:26:13,525
You are Class 1.

457
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,690
I'll save the harsh words. You know how you've done.

458
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:25,115
All right, that's all I'm going to say.

459
00:26:25,115 --> 00:26:27,190
Now, I'll read out the results.

460
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,280
Okay.

461
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,535
No. 11 in the grade, Zhou Shiyun.

462
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,840
   

463
00:26:44,856 --> 00:26:46,956
Keep up the good work.

464
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,170
Yes, sir.

465
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:55,080
Huang Xiaojia. No. 149.

466
00:26:56,395 --> 00:26:57,895
What happened?

467
00:26:57,895 --> 00:27:01,115
Skipped a major question?

468
00:27:01,925 --> 00:27:04,660
Xue Chenyu, No. 231.

469
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,620
An elite class student falls out of the first 200.

470
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,860
What rank were you last time?

471
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,210
I mean, guys, honestly, I really don't want to read it.

472
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,075
Why? Because I just...

473
00:27:13,075 --> 00:27:16,678
Your results are so worrying, it's giving me ulcers.

474
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,010
Xuejiao.

475
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,460
Once classmates, lifelong friends.

476
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,940
What's your secret? Share with us.

477
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,870
Yeah, Xuejiao.

478
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:27,810
In just a few weeks, your scores have skyrocketed.

479
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,250
So impressive.

480
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,380
Xuejiao really is our savior.

481
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,265
Yu'zi, tell them how much you scored.

482
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,770
Not much. Just 369.

483
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,280
Scram!

484
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,020
But I can get into JUFE now.

485
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,390
Yes...

486
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,025
Boss, can you tutor me a bit?

487
00:27:45,025 --> 00:27:46,730
- Please? 
 - I want in, too.

488
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,340
- And me. 
 - And me.

489
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,240
Then let's start from where we left off last time.

490
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,560
- It was... 
 - Twenty-one.

491
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,025
Yes, question 21.

492
00:27:54,025 --> 00:27:55,325
Okay.

493
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,710
The key to solving this question is examining the topic.

494
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,420
Look.

495
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:04,180
The function f  is equal to e to the power of x,

496
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:07,990
minus one, minus x, minus a times x squared.

497
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,420
Let's look at the first question.

498
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:13,960
If a equals zero, find the monotonic interval of f .

499
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,020
What is a monotonic interval, Yi Tianyu?

500
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:23,210
Well, in this question, x is the open interval from negative infinity to zero.

501
00:28:33,335 --> 00:28:35,290
Shiyun!

502
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:37,090
Shiyun!

503
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:42,200
Why did you come here?

504
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,870
The repeaters' classroom isn't here.

505
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:47,680
You didn't text me back today.

506
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,520
Did the mock exam results come out today?

507
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,820
   

508
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,270
I have to go home now.

509
00:29:14,025 --> 00:29:15,190
Shiyun!

510
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,940
No matter how much you scored, you're the best!

511
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,660
Good luck!

512
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:23,070
 Where are you? Why aren't you back yet? 

513
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:25,570
 I've already spoken with your head teacher. 

514
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:29,100
 He told me your mock exam result. 

515
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,415
 You didn't even outscore Sister Li's daughter. 

516
00:29:32,415 --> 00:29:35,235
 Why are you still wandering out there? 

517
00:29:43,535 --> 00:29:48,825
 Listen up! If you don't surpass her in the college entrance exam, 

518
00:29:48,825 --> 00:29:51,085
 I'll be so embarrassed... 

519
00:29:53,155 --> 00:29:56,310
You too! I hope you never have to retake the exam!

520
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,710
I won't!

521
00:30:03,056 --> 00:30:05,336
Take it out.

522
00:30:06,185 --> 00:30:07,940
Take what?

523
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,320
Final sprint questions for the big exam.

524
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,060
They were very effective for the 100-day sprint.

525
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:16,405
It's the final stage now. Shouldn't we enhance the effect?

526
00:30:19,845 --> 00:30:21,350
How about this?

527
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:25,030
Today, you'll come up with questions for me.

528
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:27,100
I used to make them for you.

529
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,630
Let's see if I can score well on what you throw at me.

530
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:33,010
That doesn't seem right.

531
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:36,835
No peeking at references. Come up with the questions on your own.

532
00:30:40,225 --> 00:30:41,570
Start.

533
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:44,030
You used it yourself.

534
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,240
Excuse me.

535
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,410
Interesting.

536
00:32:19,265 --> 00:32:22,130
Here, Teacher Gu.

537
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:53,250
You only lost five points.

538
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,120
It wasn't even hard for you.

539
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,900
Do you know what those five points mean?

540
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,590
What?

541
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,340
You made these without references,

542
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,940
and all of them were ones you knew the answers to.

543
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,140
You can get full marks, but I couldn't.

544
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,840
What does it mean?

545
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,430
I've surpassed my master?

546
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,460
I...

547
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,855
This is a bookstore. Keep it down.

548
00:33:21,855 --> 00:33:23,455
Sit down.

549
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,900
When I was writing you questions,

550
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,970
what were you doing on the computer?

551
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:34,340
Were you preparing a gift for this incoming Jinghai University student?

552
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,205
Let me take a look.

553
00:33:36,205 --> 00:33:38,205
   

554
00:33:41,945 --> 00:33:44,220
Today's my last day at this part-time job.

555
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,875
Also, it's our last tutoring session.

556
00:33:51,075 --> 00:33:54,420
No way. You're my backbone.

557
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:57,520
There's less than a month left before the college entrance exam.

558
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,510
What you need now isn't more practice questions,

559
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,410
but faith.

560
00:34:22,035 --> 00:34:25,760
   
   

561
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,185
   

562
00:34:27,185 --> 00:34:29,705
   
   

563
00:34:37,835 --> 00:34:39,030
Let me check again.

564
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,550
ID, examination pass.

565
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,720
Good.

566
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,030
Remember, don't be nervous.

567
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,290
Take it easy.

568
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,410
Dad.

569
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,190
Stop shaking. You're going to break it.

570
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,800
I'm a bit nervous.

571
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,920
The college entrance exam

572
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,220
is just one of the many paths that lead to success.

573
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,590
- Yes. 
 - It's not the only one.

574
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,760
My daughter's future is definitely bright,

575
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,265
no matter how you do in the exam.

576
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,565
What are you talking about?

577
00:35:03,565 --> 00:35:07,030
Daughter, look at all these moms in qipaos,

578
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,240
hoping for a good start.

579
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,955
But doing well on day one isn't enough.

580
00:35:10,955 --> 00:35:13,060
You've got to do well every day.

581
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:16,470
Let's aim for winning the battle in one go and making it in one shot.

582
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,960
Yes.

583
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,740
I believe you'll do well this time.

584
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,640
- You'll have no problem getting into a top-tier university. 
 - Right.

585
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,310
Mom! Not that!

586
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:27,335
I want to go to Jinghai University!

587
00:35:30,165 --> 00:35:31,590
What?

588
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,840
She took after you.

589
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,520
- She's very confident. 
 - Of course.  Brave girl.

590
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,905
Of course.

591
00:35:37,905 --> 00:35:39,905
I prayed yesterday.

592
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,940
 Bless me, Study God. 

593
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:04,110
Forget it. This time, everything's lined up perfectly for me.

594
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,440
You guys just wait for my good news.

595
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,400
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

596
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,435
You got it!

597
00:36:08,435 --> 00:36:09,935
Here.

598
00:36:11,156 --> 00:36:14,146
Go! Go! Go!

599
00:36:14,146 --> 00:36:16,360
Go on. Go for it.

600
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,050
- Good luck! 
 - I'm going.

601
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,280
I'm really going.

602
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,305
- Careful. 
 - You got it!

603
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:21,805
You got it.

604
00:36:23,945 --> 00:36:24,880
Bye-bye.

605
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,110
You got it!

606
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,620
- You got it! 
 - You got it!

607
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,570
You got it.

608
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,590
Go now.

609
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,520
Good.

610
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,326
   

611
00:37:05,326 --> 00:37:07,795
All examinees, please rise.

612
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:13,125
Exam papers, answer sheets, all sealed and intact.

613
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:17,210
Now, we'll distribute the papers.

614
00:37:28,115 --> 00:37:29,960
 From that day on, 

615
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:34,570
 my 28-year life exam was reset to a blank page. 

616
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:37,660
 All the wrong answers and the paths I strayed from 

617
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,880
 could be tried again. 

618
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,170
 Life has no right answers. 

619
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,820
 It's hard work that makes your choices right. 

620
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,655
 My choices are the right answer. 

621
00:37:48,655 --> 00:37:51,085
All examinees, please sit.

622
00:37:53,281 --> 00:37:55,900
It's time. You may begin.

623
00:38:01,895 --> 00:38:06,650
 Wait, this isn't the same test I took before. 

624
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:12,750
   

625
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:16,320
♫  Block out the AC, sofa, and soft drinks  ♫

626

Everyone, gather.

649
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,370
Sit down.

650
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,500
- Here, Principal Fu. 
 - Principal Fu.

651
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,730
Sit in the middle.

652
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,550
No need for the formality.

653
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,840
- I'll sit next to you. 
 - Okay.

654
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,665
Okay, everyone, look here.

655
00:39:17,665 --> 00:39:20,835
 Happy graduation! 

656
00:39:24,955 --> 00:39:28,080
   

657
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,500

00:39:40,933 --> 00:39:42,973
   

660
00:39:57,306 --> 00:39:59,576
Here they are.

661
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,950
This is for celebration if she did well. 
    

662
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:09,880
This is for comfort in case she failed.
    

663
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,050
Here's the plan. Do not rush and wait for my signal.

664
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,245
Okay.

665
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,145
This one is...

666
00:40:19,435 --> 00:40:20,840
How's it?

667
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,165
The result came out?

668
00:40:22,165 --> 00:40:23,565
Yeah.

669
00:40:23,565 --> 00:40:25,240
Looks good, huh?

670
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,840
Of course. In that practice match just now,

671
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,800
I gained over ten points and dealt more than 60,000 damage.

672
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,830
Guess how much I scored.

673
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,740
How much?

674
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,610
Sixteen point seven!

675
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:35,685
Six...

676
00:40:35,685 --> 00:40:36,740
He...

677
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,535
I can't believe this kid.

678
00:40:38,535 --> 00:40:40,940
We were asking about your college entrance exam result,

679
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,920
not your game.

680
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:45,050
Mom.

681
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,630
You're going to use that knife to cut the cake, right?

682
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,560
What else?

683
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,015
Don't just stand there. Go check your scores.

684
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,660
- Hurry. 
 - Okay, I'm on it.

685
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,365
Dad! Mom! My...

686
00:40:54,365 --> 00:40:55,965
Wait.

687
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,985
- Stay strong. 
 - Congrats on...

688
00:41:01,985 --> 00:41:04,185
- Keep trying. 
 - the victory!

689
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:10,440
You prepared two sets of lines?

690
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,470
Well, you already understand.

691
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:19,010
We prepared two cakes just in case.

692
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,190
Anything's possible, right?

693
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:24,180
Be grateful. They were doing this for you.

694
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,580
When it comes to me, I don't know if they'll cut the cake or cut me.

695
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,730
Honestly, I'm not sure whether you should celebrate it or comfort me.

696
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:37,390
Let's put them down first.

697
00:41:40,035 --> 00:41:41,740
Here we go.

698
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,945
- Go on. 
 - Start.

699
00:41:47,846 --> 00:41:51,146
Six hundred and seventy...

700
00:41:51,146 --> 00:41:53,226
Nine? 
  &lt;(Max 750) 

701
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,730
   

702
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:07,760
   

703
00:42:11,635 --> 00:42:14,260
 Gu Xuejiao, I'm set for JUFE. 

704
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:17,490
 Are you getting into your dream school, Jinghai University? 

705
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,360
Gu Xuejiao, you'd better think it through.

706
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,670
Jinghai University's usual cut-off is over 690.

707
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,285
If you don't make it, you'll have to repeat a year.

708
00:42:35,285 --> 00:42:37,185
 Leave your sister alone. 

709
00:42:54,950 --> 00:43:04,880
