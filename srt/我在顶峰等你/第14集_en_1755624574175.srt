1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Try to grow the flowers in the summer

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now tell the truth about life

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's not complicated to count the flowers

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The youth is swaying

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We are getting stronger

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My heart is still hot and boiling

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Follow the rhythm and release it gently

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Don't be afraid to light up the firework

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'll fly with you bravely

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My love is still hot and boiling

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The bright and small eyes

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let us cross the barrier of time

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Go

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
He has a new milk tea

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Let's go together tomorrow

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You scared me

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Ok, let's go tomorrow

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We have a deal

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Go and say I'm good at drinking

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Hurry up

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What's going on?

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Drink it

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Drink it

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Drink it

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Drink it

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You are so drunk

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You are so drunk

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Drink it

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Drink it

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Drink it

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Drink it

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This is two plates

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
24 yuan in total

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Here, this is your milk tea

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Thank you

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We have a few cups left

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
One cup is 12 yuan

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Let's settle down

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The special drink

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Thank you

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The milk tea is good

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Drink it

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You will fall in love

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Welcome to the next room

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
There is always something wrong

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Shulan

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You want to drink a sip

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You can't call us in line

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I just pass by

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I don't like this kind of sweet stuff

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I bought it for others

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Did you hear the advertisement?

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Just drink it

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You will fall in love immediately

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Such an unwise advertisement

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We are done talking about you

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Of course, you have to come to the autumn self-restraint

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let's talk

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
When you are in line

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Talk more about this kind of low-level study topic

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Good news

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The number of people you are now and the production capacity of this store

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's just that you two are not in the same line

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We are also in the same line

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
This

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
This is a dangerous question

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But this team

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's really going to be in the heaven

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I want two cups

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Bring the book

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
How many cups do you want?

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We want five cups

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Five cups in total, right?

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Okay

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
How about it?

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Didn't you drink enough yesterday?

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
How many cups do you want?

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Three cups

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
For Siqi

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Forget it

84
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Four people in the dormitory

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Three cups for each

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Four, one, three

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Wait a minute

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
His math level is quite good

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Sorry, guys

90
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Today's milk tea is sold out

91
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You come early tomorrow

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm so sorry

93
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Sorry, sorry

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What's wrong?

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So sorry

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Sorry, sorry

97
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Don't, Tiantian

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We've been waiting for a long time

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Don't worry

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
How could I be ashamed of myself

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Sister Pupu is coming

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Sister Pupu is coming

103
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
One cup for each

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Is it enough?

105
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
This cup is worth several cups

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Who let our Xuejiao have a class?

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll be a professional

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Is it delicious?

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Cool

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Is it delicious?

111
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
If your milk tea is sold out

112
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Other milk tea shops have to close

113
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
When I was in line today

115
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Someone said he was an investor

116
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
He wants to invest me

117
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What did he say?

118
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What did he say?

119
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
He said

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
He wanted to invest in a shop

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Which is called

122
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Two-choice-one tea shop

123
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But he especially likes me

124
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What did you say?

125
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I answered him seriously

126
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I told him

127
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
If you want milk tea, come

128
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You want to fool me

129
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You've been lying so much these years

130
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You can fool me

131
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's ridiculous

132
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Thanks to you

133
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
For teaching me about the scumbag

134
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I can say

135
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Am I right?

136
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Now this kind of fraud is too much

137
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Come on

138
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Come on

139
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'll call your sister

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
We can't be fooled

141
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Our sister is the smartest

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
After the distribution of about 90% of the votes

143
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What is Gu Xuejiao doing now?

144
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What is she thinking?

145
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Did she remember

146
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Did she remember

147
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What she forgot?

148
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I was the boss she hated last time

149
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
This time

150
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But became her respected senior

151
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Then I will continue to use this

152
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Identity to get along with her

153
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
This is the best for me and her

154
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
All the best

155
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
After Li Shige left

156
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Even the lab is quiet

157
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What is he doing now?

158
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Is the work going well?

159
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I barely contacted him

160
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He also kept silence in a tacit understanding

161
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The people of the city can afford it

162
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Put it down

163
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What happened at the flower festival night

164
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Let the evening breeze blow away

165
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The members of the Xinhai University Lab

166
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Just this spiritual bread

167
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What's the situation?

169
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Lei Zhenghua

170
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What's your situation?

171
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Why are you back so soon?

172
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The cooperation with BNC is yellow

173
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Actually

174
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Just the opposite

175
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
We went to Germany this time

176
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's not for Tan O'Fer

177
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
We hope that BNC as an investor

178
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Invest in our western clothing project

179
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
They also said in vain before

180
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
No such precedent

181
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But now I have compromised

182
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You are a bad boy

183
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You are a good bet

184
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What if they disagree?

185
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Professor

186
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This time, Lao Lin used this trick

187
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He is so stubborn

188
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I almost got it

189
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Because I don't want to work for them

190
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Even if this time is not Tan O'Fer

191
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
We still have the resources of Jun Lian and Zhao Zong

192
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
As a backer

193
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Now they have mental stress

194
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Instead, Zhao Jinlai

195
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Conditions for us

196
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Made a great concession

197
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
We don't have to go abroad

198
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Work for them

199
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We can stay in China

200
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We are the main theme in China

201
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
To start a business team

202
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You like to go the most mysterious way

203
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You are so impulsive

204
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You have fooled everyone

205
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And you have fooled

206
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The whole family

207
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
When the BNC's funds arrive

208
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
We will make up for it ten times

209
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Ten times is enough

210
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We need to leave enough investment

211
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Don't worry, Professor Tan

212
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I will keep an eye on the lab

213
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But except for the original staff of western clothing

214
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I may need an assistant

215
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Assistant

216
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Mr. Chen, look at me

217
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Mr. Sun, look at me

218
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Let me go

219
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Shut up

220
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You are an assistant to Xiao Lin

221
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You are more active than me

222
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Aunt, go back to your work

223
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I have someone in my heart

224
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I am a freshman

225
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
How can I be your assistant

226
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You are the second person

227
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Who can solve Professor Tan's program

228
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I will choose whoever I want

229
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Who else?

230
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Ok

231
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You can get back to work

232
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Gao Rui and I just got the code of western clothing

233
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I need you to teach me

234
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
How many?

235
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Ten thousand

236
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You are a robot, right?

237
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Do you need efficiency?

238
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You are always in my hand

239
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You are my brother

240
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Really?

241
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Nothing

242
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You don't remember the day I sent you away

243
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I remember

244
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I remember

245
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I remember

246
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I remember

247
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I remember

248
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I remember

249
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I remember

250
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You don't remember

251
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I remember

252
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I remember you didn't let me go

253
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Dazhu

254
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't admit to what happened that day

255
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I just talk nonsense

256
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
After you teach me the code

257
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Put the code into the simulation program

258
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
We will test it tomorrow

259
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Ok

260
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I will go to find a mobile phone

261
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Wait

262
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Use this

263
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Ok

264
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Li

265
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
As your first classmate

266
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I am your senior

267
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Senior, please

268
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
He doesn't like you

269
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
If he really likes you

270
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
How could he send a mobile phone

271
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
and leave without saying a word?

272
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Thank you

273
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Senior Li

274
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You should go back to work

275
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I am not comfortable with you watching me

276
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I have a big job

277
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I am leaving

278
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Long time no see

279
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Have you seen the plan made in Hongtao????

280
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
We are on a effects

281
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You had better stay for the exam

282
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Your school is really ruling

283
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You can make a tea fresh

284
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Perfect

285
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,280
Sweet Tea.

286
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,640
Sweet Tea?

287
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,240
Isn't it...

288
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,400
Yes.

289
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,400
It's the classmate of Gu Xuejiao,

290
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,720
Sun Tiantian.

291
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,720
What a nice name!

292
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,600
What's going on?

293
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,680
I received an email before.

294
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,400
I told Sun Tiantian

295
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,640
that Gu Qianong doesn't really like him.

296
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,440
So there are leashes here and there.

297
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,560
I wish I could see it first in person

298
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,880
when I first saw this.

299
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,120
Look.

300
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,120
I just came here and thought the girl who makes milk tea

301
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,120
wasn't very smart.

302
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,120
I was a little bit upset.

303
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,120
Who sent me this PPT?

304
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,120
Could it be someone set me up?

305
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,120
No, I have to ask her.

306
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,120
Don't worry.

307
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,120
Give me the new address.

308
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,120
You don't care.

309
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,120
You've grown up.

310
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,120
You know to share your worries for your sister.

311
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,120
I'm telling you,

312
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,120
this proposal

313
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,120
has a detailed introduction of

314
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
the likes of the new generation of consumers.

315
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
And it also predicts

316
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
the next explosion of the consumer sector.

317
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,120
I'm not so confident

318
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,120
in my special market research partner.

319
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,120
I really doubt

320
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,120
if this is a person who has been through it.

321
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,120
We don't believe this

322
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,120
if we've been educated high-level.

323
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,120
You don't understand, do you?

324
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,120
A good investor

325
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,120
must list all kinds of possibilities.

326
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,120
But sister,

327
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,120
you'll be a mental patient

328
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,120
if you go through the University of Jinghai.

329
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,120
My reputation is more important.

330
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,120
How are you recently?

331
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,120
You don't report your situation to me?

332
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,120
Quite good.

333
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,120
I have something to do.

334
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,120
What's the matter?

335
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,120
I have something to report to you.

336
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,120
Something?

337
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,120
Can you tell?

338
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,120
Say it.

339
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
I haven't seen you

340
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
so careless for years.

341
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,120
A girl kissed my roommate.

342
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,120
My roommate likes this girl.

343
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,120
But...

344
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,120
But...

345
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,120
But this girl,

346
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
because of her previous experience,

347
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,120
she doesn't want to start a new relationship.

348
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,120
What kind of girl?

349
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,120
Just like you.

350
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,120
You're focused on your work.

351
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,120
You just want to improve your career.

352
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,120
Men are like smoke in the eyes.

353
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,120
A man who loves his career.

354
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,120
Once this love brain is blocked,

355
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,120
it's not easy to start again.

356
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,120
In the eyes of girls in your career,

357
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,120
are all men

358
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,120
like a stinky rag

359
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,120
who don't open their eyes?

360
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,120
And

361
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,120
my career is not bad.

362
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,120
I'm telling you.

363
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,120
The man in the love brain

364
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,120
is full marks.

365
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,120
If he makes a mistake,

366
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,120
he will get a zero mark.

367
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,120
And the career brain,

368
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,120
every man is zero marks.

369
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,120
But when he is touched,

370
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,120
he will get a bonus.

371
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,120
Up to 100 points.

372
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,120
Then he will accept him.

373
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,120
So there is hope

374
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
when it comes to 100 points.

375
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,120
It's harder than climbing the sky.

376
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,120
At last,

377
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,120
we are on the moon.

378
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,120
I'm leaving. You can drink.

379
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,120
No.

380
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,120
You don't like the new year.

381
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,120
You should change to the new year.

382
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,120
What about Xiao Guo?

383
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,120
What new year?

384
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,120
I just...

385
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,120
You're so weird.

386
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,120
Xiao Gao.

387
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,120
You're wrong.

388
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,120
Why are you running?

389
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,120
Am I that scary?

390
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,120
All the little boys.

391
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,120
Okay. That's all for today.

392
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,120
Dismiss.

393
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,120
Bye.

394
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,120
Bye. Bye.

395
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,120
Go. Go to Lu Chuan.

396
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,120
No.

397
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,120
I have something to do.

398
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,120
You're so self-conscious.

399
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,120
The inter-sport match is about to start.

400
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,120
I have to practice more.

401
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,120
You go first.

402
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
Go. Bye.

403
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,120
Anyone here?

404
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
Xu Jia.

405
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,120
I...

406
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,120
I...

407
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,120
I...

408
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,120
I...

409
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,120
Why are you so useless?

410
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,120
Is it that hard to say I like you?

411
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,120
Xue Jiao.

412
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,120
I like you.

413
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,120
You're so greasy.

414
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,120
Xue Jiao.

415
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,120
I like you.

416
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,120
Be my girlfriend.

417
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,120
Isn't it too strong?

418
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,120
No.

419
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,120
I have to make it bigger.

420
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,120
Jiao Jiao.

421
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,120
Our school is going to the inter-sport match.

422
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,120
I'll be the first one to send it.

423
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,120
I invite you to watch it.

424
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,120
No.

425
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,120
You must cheer for me.

426
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,120
What's this?

427
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,120
Give it back.

428
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,120
The final ticket.

429
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,120
I'll give it to you.

430
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,120
Thank you.

431
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,120
I'll go by myself.

432
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,120
Give it back to me.

433
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,120
He's been busy in the lab recently.

434
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,120
You can't see him anywhere.

435
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,120
Give it back to me.

436
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,120
You can't give it back to him.

437
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,120
I'll go to the kitchen to prepare the food.

438
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,120
Just tell him.

439
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,120
Bye.

440
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,120
Remember to send it.

441
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,120
Bye.

442
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,120
For automatic driving,

443
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,120
in addition to the set route,

444
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:42,120
we have to monitor the emergency situations.

445
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,120
For example, the driver fainted.

446
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,120
In this case,

447
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,120
AI must take over the steering wheel

448
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,120
and pull the car to the side of the road safely.

449
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,120
Then we can contact the hospital.

450
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,120
I have a good understanding of this situation.

451
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,120
Even if the driver is drunk,

452
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,120
we have to stop the car from starting

453
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,120
to prevent the driver from breaking the law.

454
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,120
To achieve these functions,

455
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,120
we have to monitor the driver's heart rate.

456
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,120
In this case,

457
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,120
we have to plug the heart rate belt

458
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,120
into each driver.

459
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,120
But it's hard to achieve in real life.

460
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,120
So we, Xiyi,

461
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,120
have joined a medical company

462
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,120
to install the monitoring heart rate module

463
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,120
into the seat belt.

464
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,120
You must be wondering,

465
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,120
the seat belt is separated from the clothes.

466
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,120
The driver will inevitably adjust the seat during driving.

467
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
How can we do the accurate measurement?

468
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,120
Brother Gao,

469
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,120
you two are like the TV shopping channel.

470
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,120
The design standard of this monitoring program

471
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
is to monitor the heart rate

472
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,120
within five percent within twenty seconds.

473
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,120
Today's test is these two chairs

474
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,120
and two test chairs.

475
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,120
I'll take this one.

476
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,120
Gu Xunxiao will take that one.

477
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,120
Why?

478
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,120
Brother Gao,

479
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,120
aren't you a professional in testing?

480
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,120
It's the rule of the lab.

481
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
Whoever makes the parts

482
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,120
and who gets the first test

483
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,120
will be the first to be tested.

484
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,120
Besides, you're Ling's assistant.

485
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,120
So, please.

486
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
I'll do it.

487
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
It's not a TV show.

488
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,120
Come on.

489
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,120
One for each person.

490
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,120
I'll do it in your real state.

491
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,120
Start testing.

492
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,120
Do you think this belt is reliable?

493
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,120
Reliable?

494
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,120
The heart rate of the blood cell has started to rise.

495
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,120
If I sit opposite the god,

496
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,120
my heart will also beat faster.

497
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,120
Isn't this a variable heart?

498
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,120
It's not a normal heart.

499
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,120
It's a normal heart.

500
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,120
It's a normal heart.

501
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,120
Isn't this a variable heart?

502
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,120
It's not a normal heart.

503
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,120
Anyway,

504
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,120
it's not the right time to test.

505
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
No.

506
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,120
It's rising so fast.

507
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,120
Halfway.

508
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,120
Halfway.

509
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,120
If I insert another letter

510
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,120
here...

511
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,120
You really forget

512
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,120
what happened that night?

513
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,120
I really don't want Ling Zhi Hua to leave.

514
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,120
But I...

515
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,120
I'm back.

516
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,120
Why did you climb up again?

517
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,120
You...

518
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,120
You...

519
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
You...

520
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
Are you back?

521
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,120
Gu Xue Jiao.

522
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,120
You must stop your love brain.

523
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,120
Even if it's at the university, you can't.

524
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,120
You don't know

525
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,120
I came back ten years later.

526
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,120
I actually took my bag

527
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,120
and made your dog change my program.

528
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,120
I went to the top of the exam.

529
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,120
Everything I worked hard

530
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,120
to pay for

531
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,120
is a waste of paper

532
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,120
in your opinion.

533
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,600
What should I do to appease the pain you've been through?

534
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,600
The gap in your heart.

535
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,600
I want to cross it.

536
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
I can cross it.

537
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,320
I'm already a mature person.

538
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,800
I'm very sure that I want something.

539
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,120
Nothing can become the whole of your life.

540
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,120
No matter what happens, it's not worth it for you to give up your life.

541
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:39,120
Do you know that it was that moment that I remembered you forever?

542
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,120
Gu Xue Jiao, do what you should do.

543
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,120
This necklace...

544
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,120
You didn't buy it for fake wine, did you?

545
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,120
The test is over.

546
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,120
Senior, where are you going?

547
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,120
I...

548
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,120
The bag is too tight. I need to use the bathroom.

549
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,120
I knew it. It must be the kitchen.

550
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,120
Senior.

551
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,120
Can't I escape from this love brain?

552
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,120
I can't do it if I'm cured.

553
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,120
No. I definitely can't.

554
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,120
You're not doing the test anymore?

555
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,120
I've finished the test.

556
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,120
Then, did Chen Xu cause any bug? Let's go check again.

557
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,120
Chen Xu didn't cause any bug.

558
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,120
Did anyone cause a bug?

559
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,120
No. I didn't.

560
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
I just didn't want to...

561
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,120
I know.

562
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,120
You didn't want to fall in love?

563
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,120
I don't think that you're not doing the test.

564
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,120
I know.

565
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,120
You're afraid that you'll become bad in love?

566
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,120
I don't know what you've been through before.

567
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,120
But if you're aiming to become a better person,

568
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,120
I won't be your bad teacher.

569
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,120
Of course, if you think I can't make you a better person,

570
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,120
you can tell me. It's okay.

571
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,120
I'm not a bad person.

572
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,120
You can tell me. It's okay.

573
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,120
We can change our ways

574
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,120
and get along.

575
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,120
I've experienced uncertain life.

576
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,120
That's not good.

577
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,120
Not good at all.

578
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,120
So now,

579
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,120
I just want my life

580
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,120
to be like a math formula.

581
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,120
Mathematics and evidence.

582
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,120
There won't be any mistakes.

583
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,120
But didn't you already have the answer that night?

584
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,120
What if you didn't make a mistake?

585
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,120
What if the current me

586
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,120
is the right answer?

587
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,120
What answer?

588
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,120
I'll help you remember.

589
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,120
This is not what you don't remember.

590
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,120
This is it.

591
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,120
Forget it.

592
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,120
It's none of your business.

593
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,120
Let's go.

594
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,120
Old Man,

595
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,120
is that prop drawing of yours

596
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,120
already good enough to be used in our next round?

597
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,120
Shut up.

598
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,120
Can you still make better materials?

599
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,120
I not only want to shoot,

600
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,120
I also want to shoot in a circle of 300 degrees.

601
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,120
Follow me.

602
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,120
Don't say that.

603
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,120
This picture is really pretty.

604
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,120
Yeah.

605
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,120
Where can we find such a good atmosphere?

606
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,120
You're so talented.

607
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,120
Let's take this picture

608
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,120
as the cover of our promotional film.

609
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,120
I think it's good.

610
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,120
What is this?

611
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,120
What is this?

612
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,120
What is this?

613
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,120
I don't know.

614
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,120
What is this?

615
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,120
A day's pre-release.

616
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
Open it.

617
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
Okay.

618
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,120
Ready.

619
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,120
Three, two, one.

620
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,120
The End

621
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,120
Good morning, Mr. Chen.

622
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,120
Good morning.

623
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,120
What are you looking at?

624
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,120
What are you eating?

625
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,120
The school TV station

626
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,120
filmed a video of a couple kissing

627
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,120
by a mosaic classmate.

628
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,120
It's a couple

629
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,120
kissing under the tree

630
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,120
and being photographed.

631
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,120
Aren't they all mosaics?

632
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,120
I'm so anxious.

633
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,120
What are they doing?

634
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,120
Yeah.

635
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,120
We seem to be photographed.

636
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,120
A passerby took a video

637
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,120
of a couple kissing.

638
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
Let's take a look.

639
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,120
Do you know how to do it?

640
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,120
No.

641
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,120
What are you looking at?

642
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,120
You turned the light off.

643
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,120
Can't you handle it?

644
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,120
I said the theater is so lively today.

645
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,120
And the whole class is eating melons.

646
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,120
I'm so happy.

647
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,120
Luckily,

648
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,120
I'm the manager.

649
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,120
I deleted the video

650
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,120
at once.

651
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,120
Otherwise,

652
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,120
what if the video

653
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,120
of the 18th season is deleted?

654
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,120
That's not necessary.

655
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,120
But you did a good job

656
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,120
of purifying the online environment.

657
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,120
Are you the main character

658
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,120
of the 18th season?

659
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,120
Yes.

660
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,120
No.

661
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,120
Can you do it?

662
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,120
I didn't do it wrong.

663
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
Brother.

664
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,120
No?

665
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,120
It's boring.

666
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,120
Sorry.

667
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,120
The number you dialed

668
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,120
is currently busy.

669
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,120
Please redial later.

670
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,120
Hello.

671
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,120
Where are you?

672
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,120
The meeting is waiting for you.

673
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
Okay.

674
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
I'm coming.

675
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,120
Hello.

676
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,120
Hello.

677
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,120
Hello.

678
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,120
Hello.

679
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,120
Hello.

680
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,120
Hello.

681
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,120
Hello.

682
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,120
Hello.

683
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,120
Hello.

684
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,120
Hello.

685
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,120
Hello.

686
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,120
Hello.

687
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,120
Hello.

688
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,120
Hello.

689
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,120
Hello.

690
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,120
Hello.

691
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,120
Hello.

692
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,120
Hello.

693
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,120
Hello.

694
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,120
Who is it?

695
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,120
How do you know

696
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,120
that I have a meeting here?

697
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,120
I don't want to know, either.

698
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,120
But you're so hot now.

699
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,120
I've searched it.

700
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,000
I...

701
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,800
I want to say something.

702
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,640
I...

703
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:39,920
I...

704
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,360
Are you smiling?

705
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,640
I finally see you smile.

706
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,880
Thank you last time.

707
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,120
I'm sorry.

708
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,000
Last time,

709
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,080
I'm sorry.

710
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,640
I'm too emotional.

711
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,880
I told you.

712
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,840
It doesn't matter whether you're a good student.

713
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,520
Look at me.

714
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,600
I'm from a poor family.

715
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,960
I'm not a good student.

716
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,360
You're a good student.

717
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,840
I'm sorry.

718
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,920
Being an out-colored student

719
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,960
We all have our own quality.

720
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,160
Good students and bad students

721
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,560
were determined by others.

722
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,200
They can't define our own life.

723
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,360
Wow, great.

724
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,240
Wait a minute.

725
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,240
Let me get a notebook.

726
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:56,840
Okay.

727
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,880
I'm not a bookworm.

728
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:58,920
No.

729
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,520
Enough. Stop pretending.

730
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,960
You don't even bring books in class.

731
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,800
You still take books.

732
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:03,880
No.

733
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,680
I really think

734
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,280
you have a good level

735
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,120
of speaking.

736
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,120
You have a good level.

737
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,960
It's like...

738
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,000
Do you understand?

739
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,720
In books,

740
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,680
there's a line after line.

741
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,800
What's the name?

742
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,640
Ming Yan.

743
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,560
Yes, Ming Yan.

744
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,720
Actually,

745
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,920
you told me

746
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,280
all these.

747
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,920
Ming Yan.

748
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Ming...

749
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:38,960
By the way,

750
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,160
I'm going back to school.

751
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,600
Wait.

752
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,120
I...

753
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:46,840
I didn't force you

754
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,200
to go to school.

755
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:48,960
I...

756
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,640
I...

757
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,280
I...

758
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,360
You know me.

759
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:53,840
I...

760
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,680
I'm sorry.

761
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,680
I didn't mean that.

762
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,760
My mouth...

763
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,960
I can't spit out my teeth.

764
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,760
I'm sorry.

765
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,080
Don't follow me.

766
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,320
Don't you have an internal meeting?

767
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,680
I'm done.

768
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,680
Can I go to you?

769
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,560
Whatever.

770
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,080
The End

771
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,360
Xue Xia,

772
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,160
I've been thinking about it.

773
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,680
I don't want to be a capitalist.

774
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,280
I want to be ordinary.

775
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,880
Why are you panicking?

776
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,400
You're the one who knows the core technology.

777
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,960
You're the investor now.

778
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,200
Not the investor.

779
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,760
But there's only one investor.

780
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,640
One-on-one, two-way selection.

781
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,200
What if he doesn't want us?

782
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,200
Impossible.

783
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,480
Leave it to me.

784
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,040
I'll teach you

785
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,440
how to be a capitalist.

786
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,440
Let's go.

787
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:08,920
Let's go.

788
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,000
Stop.

789
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,720
Mr. Zhang.

790
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,080
Hello.

791
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,000
Long time no see.

792
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,000
Hello.

793
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,640
Hello.

794
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,520
Sit.

795
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,240
Sit.

796
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,960
First, you need to learn to pack yourself.

797
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,560
As long as you have enough confidence,

798
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,840
the other party won't be able to tell.

799
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,880
At least, you can't be the one.

800
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,360
Mr. Zhang, let me introduce you.

801
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,800
This is the founder of our sweet tea.

802
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,240
And the chief dessert creator,

803
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,400
Ms. Sun Tiantian.

804
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:40,960
Hello.

805
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:42,840
This is...

806
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,520
Hello.

807
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,160
Hello.

808
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:44,760
Hello.

809
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,480
Hello.

810
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,120
Hello.

811
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,840
Hello.

812
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,160
This is the contract.

813
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,880
It's an old problem.

814
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,600
Every now and then,

815
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,440
we need to think about

816
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,760
some new dessert ideas.

817
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,280
We have several new products

818
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,480
that were born this way.

819
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,720
Wolf's Bay...

820
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,240
What's wrong?

821
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:10,880
Nothing.

822
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,800
He's calling the waitress.

823
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,680
Waitress.

824
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,600
Don't be so stingy even if you can't read it.

825
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,080
I'll do what I want.

826
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,720
Second,

827
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,720
suppress the other party with your spirit.

828
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,680
Break the other party's psychological defense line.

829
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,400
Remember,

830
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,480
you must show your respect to the people.

831
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:30,960
Actually,

832
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,480
many investors have contacted us recently.

833
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,640
Some of them

834
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,000
are very capable companies.

835
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,120
After all, it's a good project.

836
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,480
There are always investors.

837
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,320
Please answer the phone.

838
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,080
Hello?

839
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,240
Hello, it's your client.

840
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,520
Hello, don't open it.

841
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,120
Well,

842
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,240
I Nakata talked about a gear on sale.

843
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,680
I want to check it out.

844
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,000
Alright, show me the Prov, okay?

845
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,320
Sure.

846
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,800
Okay, I got it.

847
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,440
Sorry.

848
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,080
Hello.

849
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,520
Cheng Xiao,

850
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,280
are you free tonight?

851
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,360
I'm busy now.

852
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,680
If you're interested,

853
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,240
we may have another day.

854
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,320
Okay.

855
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,160
I'm sorry.

856
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,320
There are too many investors

857
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,120
who contact us recently.

858
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,400
I understand.

859
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,080
I read your project book.

860
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,920
It's a good project.

861
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,880
But before coming here,

862
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,600
we did some research.

863
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,440
At present,

864
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,920
only our company

865
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,880
has an investment interest in you.

866
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,120
We also want to invest all our money.

867
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,000
Of course,

868
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,680
we will leave you a position.

869
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,520
I understand.

870
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,480
Who wants to kick us out?

871
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,920
Is it really

872
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,240
the only way?

873
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,040
If you can go, you can go.

874
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,360
You can be a husband.

875
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,600
President Zhang.

876
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,280
Who said there was only one company?

877
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,600
No matter how much your company pays,

878
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,760
I'm adding 20% of the investment.

879
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,640
That's it again.

880
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,480
Why do we have to

881
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,320
split the capital

882
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,920
of your company?

883
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,280
You don't see

884
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,240
how many good projects your company has ruined.

885
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,440
It's too ugly.

886
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,600
You're good.

887
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:29,920
Done.

888
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,880
So now,

889
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,000
let's talk about the contract.

890
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,640
It's so simple.

891
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,360
Before the absolute power,

892
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,960
all the calculations are in vain.

893
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,960
Thank you, Jiang.

894
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,400
Thank you so much.

895
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,200
If it weren't for you,

896
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,240
I couldn't have talked.

897
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,360
I forgot the tickets

898
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,280
for the basketball game.

899
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,400
It seems to be today.

900
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:30,960
Hello, Mr. Tong.

901
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,120
I'm Yi Tianyu.

902
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:32,800
He's injured.

903
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,920
He didn't come to the game today.

904
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,280
Thank you.

905
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,160
It's okay. Let's go.

906
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,640
Sorry.

907
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,240
The number you have dialed

908
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,040
is currently unavailable.

909
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,200
Please redial later.

910
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,480
The number you have dialed

911
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,000
is currently unavailable.

912
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,120
Please redial later.

913
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,080
Please redial later.

914
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,800
Hello, Yi Tianyu.

915
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,840
Where did you go?

916
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,400
You didn't answer my call

917
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,360
and didn't reply my message.

918
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,160
It's Gu.

919
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,400
I'm Tianyu's dad.

920
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,920
YoYo English Channel YouTube

921
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,760
There will be no empty voices

922
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,440
Separate memories

923
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:13,200
Each line is a wrong path

924
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:19,040
We are thinking of each other

925
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:23,160
Let fate be destined

926
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,000
Let us give up all courage

927
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:32,200
I'm willing to travel with you

928
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,520
If you also

929
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,240
understand the secrets in my eyes

930
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:46,560
You will find that you are always in my heart

931
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:56,920
I tried to open my arms

932
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,840
Because of the love

933
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,880
I'm waiting for you at the peak

934
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:10,120
It doesn't matter if the wind blows

935
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,520
There is a sound very close

936
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:20,440
I know it must be you

937
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,960
I tried to open my arms

938
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,520
Because of the love

939
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,480
I'm waiting for you at the peak

940
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:48,120
It doesn't matter if the wind blows

941
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:52,280
There is a sound very close

942
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:58,760
I know it must be you
