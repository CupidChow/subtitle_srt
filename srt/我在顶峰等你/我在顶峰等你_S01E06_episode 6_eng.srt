00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,000

20
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,480
   

21
00:01:58,725 --> 00:02:00,080
 Cruise system normal. 

22
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,779
All systems are normal. Ready to start.

23
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:04,390
Copy that. 
    

24
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,550
Engage autonomous driving.

25
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,830
 - Copy that. 
 - Copy that. 

26
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,870
Test vehicle cruise confirmed.

27
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,150
 Autonomous drive is normal. 

28
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,870
 Steering normal. 

29
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,480
System is live. Please report the speed.

30
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,710
 Speed: Five kilometers per hour. 

31
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,300
 Monitor speed: five kilometers per hour. 

32
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,740
 Speed: five kilometers per hour. 

33
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,240
 Monitor speed: five kilometers per hour. 

34
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,920
 Speed: five kilometers per hour. 

35
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,524
 - Please report the speed. 
 - Speed: ten kilometers per hour. 

36
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:38,770
 Monitor speed: ten kilometers per hour. 

37
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,150
 The obstacle test is ahead. 

38
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,320
 Distance from obstacles: ten meters. 

39
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,430
 Auto-steering on.

 Please drive with caution. 

42
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,430
Lao Gao!

43
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,320
- Lao Gao! 
 - Senior Brother Lin.

44
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,670
Stop the test now!

45
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,960
There's something wrong with the data.

46
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,760
- What's wrong? 
 - There's no way, Senior Brother.

47
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,220
These number readings match the simulation results exactly.

48
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,080
Simulations had a 0.01% failure rate.

49
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,040
But it's not safe enough for real-world testing.

50
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,040
Lin Jiadong, take over Lao Gao's smart driving mode now.

51
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,390
Let him take manual control and leave the testing zone.

52
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,830
Dude, the experts are watching from the observation desk.

53
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,527
Don't worry. It's just 0.01%.

54
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,760
- We won't be that unlucky. 
 - Failure means 100%.

55
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,270
I'm the lead supervisor.

56
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,480
It's my call.

57
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,180
Stop the test.

58
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,710
Senior Brother Gao, Senior Brother Lin ordered us to terminate the test.

59
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,080
 Please disengage the autonomous driving mode 

60
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,050
 and drive back manually. 

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,830
 Report the speed. 

62
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,230
 Speed: ten kilometers per hour. 

63
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,990
 What does the monitor say? 

64
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,670
 20 kilometers per hour. 

65
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,640
 Speed: Ten kilometers per hour. 

66
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,760
 What does the monitor say? 

67
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,520
 Monitor speed: 50 kilometers per hour. 

68
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,250
 It's accelerating. 

69
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,450
 - Speed: Ten kilometers per hour. 
 - Reporting system error! 

70
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,700
 Monitor speed: 55 kilometers per hour. 

71
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,390
 Monitor speed: 60 kilometers per hour. 

72
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,960
Senior Brother Lin, what do we do? It won't stop.

73
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,110
- It won't stop! 
 - Same here.

74
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,280
- What's happening? 
  - The speed is 65 kilometers per hour! 

75
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,000
Why is it doing this?

76
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,880
Lao Gao, stay calm.

77
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,990
I'm going to try braking for you remotely.

78
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,960
 Brake. 

79
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,270
 Lao Lin, can you hear me? 

80
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,230
The speed is 75 now!

81
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,350
It keeps accelerating!

82
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,680
- What's the problem? 
 - No, that's not it.

83
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,680
- What's your status? 
 - I can't control it!

84
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,500
It won't decelerate!

85
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,420
- It's still accelerating! 
 - It's not working!

86
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,680
- What's the monitor speed? 
 - 85.

87
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,710
 - It has already exceeded the risk threshold!  
  - Lao Lin, what now? 

88
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,360
 -  The speed won't decrease!  
 - Everyone, help him slow down!

89
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,520
Lao Gao, steer early before the curve!

90
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,041
No good! Speed is still rising!

91
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,270
What now? It won't stop!

92
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,350
 It was my bad. I should've listened earlier. 

93
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,580
 We must've missed checking the code. 

94
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,917
 Next time, I'll follow your lead. 

95
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,390
 Lao Lin, slow down! 

96
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,520
 Steer! 

97
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,170
Brake! Does the brake not work?

98
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,150
- Stop the whole system! Hurry up! 
 - Okay.

99
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,200
- There's no response. 
 - It doesn't work.

100
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,560
 Hold on, Gao Rui! 

101
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,320
 We must minimize the damage! 

102
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,710
 Lao Lin, what do we do? 

103
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,100
 I won't die here today, right? 

104
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,760
Side-swipe the barrier to slow down!

105
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,790
Speed is 95 now!

106
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,470
What do we do?

107
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,430
 Try again! Side-swipe the barrier to slow down! 

108
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,350
Lao Gao!

109
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,400
- Gao Rui! 
 - Senior Brother Gao!

110
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,320
Please step aside.

111
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,440
No carotid pulse.

112
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,320
Begin CPR!

113
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,210
   

114
00:06:24,893 --> 00:06:26,470
 Gao Rui, time of death: 

115
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:31,359
 September 5th, 2014, at 22:19:32. 

116
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,500
   

117
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,640
Is Gao Rui's family here?

118
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,640
We got him back.

119
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,470
He's in a coma now and has been transferred to the ICU.

120
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,410
Go and pay the hospitalization fees.

121
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,910
 Everything seems like a repeat of the past. 

122
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,540
 But thankfully, 

123
00:07:10,204 --> 00:07:12,224
 it's not entirely the same. 

124
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,092
   

125
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:30,200
 This round's winning numbers are: 

126
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,532
- 07... 
  - 07 ...

127
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:35,371
 - 13...  
 - 13...

128
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,680
14...

129
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,100
 14... 

130
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,150
- 28... 
  - 28... 

131
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,125
- 32... / - 32... 
  

132
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,400
If you get the first five numbers, 
    

133
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,621
you'll get the third prize, right?

134
00:07:47,621 --> 00:07:49,640
Yes, but you could also hit the jackpot. There are two numbers left.

135
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,860
 The special numbers are 04, 11. 

136
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,860
Still, the third prize isn't bad.

137
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,520
It's a lot of money. It's enough for you to have fun.

138
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,390
It's to buy a life.

139
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,670
Why are lottery ticket buyers so weird lately?

140
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,120
Excuse me, where does the Gu family live?

141
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,790
Right here!

142
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,132
- This one? 
 - Yes.

143
00:08:29,132 --> 00:08:30,770
Okay. Thank you.

144
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:33,220
He's handsome.

145
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,040
   

146
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,060
Hello.

147
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,160
 Fate's gifts always come at a price 

148
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,970
 and with surprises. 

149
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,320
 As long as you live long enough... 

150
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,630
 The tables will turn! 

151
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,700
 The tables will turn. 

152
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,380
 So then... 

153
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,970
 I'll give it a try. 

154
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,100
Dear lab, I'm back!

155
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,440
Where's everyone?

156
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
I just gave them the debug plan.

157
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,470
They all went to the test track.

158
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,080
That's good.

159
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,490
With me hobbling around, people would find me cumbersome if it were crowded here.

160
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,060
Let's go.

161
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,830
Lao Lin, what snacks do you have in that bag?

162
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,060
I'm hungry.

163
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,130
It's work supplies inside.

164
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,710
Work supplies?

165
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,960
For a class.

166
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,700
Actually, for your class.

167
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:33,110
Wait.

168
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,950
Are you tutoring Xiao Gu later?

169
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:41,080
But... this is a fire extinguisher.

170
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,270
What class needs this?

171
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,410
Don't touch it.

172
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,250
It's explosive.

173
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,580
M-Medical miracle.

174
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,200
J-Just pretend nothing happened.

175
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,550
W-Well, hurry and go tutor Xuejiao.

176
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,300
The wheelchair's comfy, isn't it?

177
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,709
It was Gu Xuejiao's idea, right?

178
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:20,110
Don't sell me out during class later.

179
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,280
Relax.

180
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,040
But you... you should get well soon.

181
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,630
Can someone come help me move stuff?

182
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,970
- Me! I got it! 
 - Let me.

183
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,830
Xuejiao, let me help.

184
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,110
Let me do it. Here.

185
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,000
You do it like this.

186
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,290
- Make this... 
 - Do you want to lower this part?

187
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,400
When's Shiyun arriving?

188
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,260
I'll go and meet her.

189
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,560
Who told you I invited her?

190
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,750
Why not?

191
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,870
She just asked about your grades.

192
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,710
And said you've been distant lately.

193
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,110
What's going on?

194
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:11,440
Seriously, Gu Mingze, do you really not see it?

195
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,970
See what?

196
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,280
Your stupidity should be archived in history.

197
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,110
You really didn't invite her?

198
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,490
Nope!

199
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,160
Xuejiao, let me help.

200
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,100
Let me do it.

201
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,200
Thank your dad for me.

202
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,400
Hope it wasn't too pricey.

203
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,920
But does he have any important events today?

204
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,160
- He looked so... 
 - Exaggerated?

205
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,920
He was so handsome.

206
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,470
My dad says his projects aren't going too smoothly.

207
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,260
He has to "ride trends, adapt to modernity,

208
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,020
and be the pig in the wind."

209
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:56,680
Which self-help guru got to him this time?

210
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:02,440
He invested in some movies with a big-shot contractor he worked with.

211
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,210
You know Tang Jingjing?

212
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,220
Want her autograph? He can get it.

213
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,320
- You must be bluffing. 
 - Really? I want it.

214
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,460
- Me too! 
 - I'm serious. No problem.

215
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,740
Tang Jingjing? 
    

216
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,230
No!

217
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,860
Why not?

218
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,400
 Did his dad go broke because of this? 

219
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,200
Investing in her movies is a total disaster.

220
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,880
Disaster? It's not a disaster movie.

221
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,800
It's a romance movie.

222
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,370
What? You're her anti-fan?

223
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,440
I'll explain later.

224
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,710
It's almost time.

225
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,320
I invited a VIP today.

226
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,680
He should be here soon. I'll go and meet him.

227
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,440
Aren't I your VIP?

228
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,960
You?

229
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,440
- What's the problem? 
 - Who do you think you are?

230
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,680
Senior Brother Lin.

231
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,060
Senior Brother Lin!

232
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,680
Uncle!

233
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,940
That's quite a gift.

234
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,590
Red and fiery!

235
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,630
Exactly, Senior Brother Lin.

236
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,750
We won't set the rooftop on fire.

237
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,350
But you're here. It's better safe than sorry.

238
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,560
Senior Brother Lin, have a seat!

239
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,630
- Sure. 
 - We've got tons of good food today.

240
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,990
This way.

241
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,110
Gu Xuejiao, I'll give you one last chance.

242
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:18,080
If you invite Shiyun over, I'll forgive you.

243
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,650
If you're so great, why not invite her yourself?

244
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,440
Let’s see if she even pays you any attention.

245
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,290
Then don't blame me for being ruthless.

246
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,940
Sister Zhang! Hanging laundry?

247
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,820
Why are you still sitting here?

248
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,750
Didn't I tell you to deliver some charcoal upstairs?

249
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,790
Don't keep Xuejiao and those kids waiting.

250
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,880
Relax. I just sent some up.

251
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,770
We have some time now.

252
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,440
Let's talk about my thing.

253
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,470
Your thing?

254
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,040
You reminded me.

255
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,280
You snored all night. I barely slept.

256
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,060
No... Not the snoring.

257
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,990
Then what is it?

258
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,750
Remember what I said yesterday?

259
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,840
About buying the car?

260
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,040
What car?

261
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,890
We're just getting by.

262
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,960
Look...

263
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,080
This is what I'm thinking.

264
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,080
I'm a man. An adult.

265
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,340
It's not right for me to sit around at home all day.

266
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,020
If we buy a car, our own car,

267
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,340
I can drive around part-time and earn some cash.

268
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,280
The best part is it's our own car.

269
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,350
We don't have to pay the taxi company.

270
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,970
Isn't that great?

271
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,860
I can even drive you to and from work!

272
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,040
Oh, please don't. Who am I to make you my driver?

273
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,440
If you want to run an illegal cab, do what you want.

274
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,610
Don't drag me into it.

275
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:55,710
You always oversimplify things.

276
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,110
Where will the money come from?

277
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,460
Isn't our money all in stocks?

278
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,280
Didn't you say the stocks were skyrocketing?

279
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,800
What's with the sudden car idea?

280
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,710
Well... Yes.

281
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,980
Stocks are flying.

282
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,350
It wasn't my idea.

283
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,280
It was... Xuejiao.

284
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,920
She saw me checking out cars the other day.

285
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,830
She said there was a premier ride-hailing recruitment

286
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,160
and gave me a flyer.

287
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,200
Wait. She asked you to go and see a public restroom?

288
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,560
It's premier ride-hailing. Not a public restroom.

289
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,370
I'll find the flyer for you.

290
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,960
You said public restroom...

291
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,110
What else could it be?

292
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,680
- It's done! 
 - Perfect!

293
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,000
Senior Brother, make the sausages extra crispy.

294
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,110
Okay, no problem.

295
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,080
This is for Xuejiao.

296
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,060
You're so sweet to her.

297
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:00,410
Yi Tianyu, let's discuss tactics for the basketball league in a few days.

298
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,040
Come here, have a seat!

299
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,810
Tianyu, eat some melon.

300
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,750
 If you won't invite Shiyun, 

301
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,390
 don't expect your plans to work out either. 

302
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,690
Senior Brother Lin, I'll help you.

303
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,720
Who's your favorite player?

304
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,100
There's no rush, man.

305
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,580
What did Gao Rui promise you?

306
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,120
W-What promise?

307
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,160
You got played by him.

308
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,750
I told him I'd tutor you until after the college entrance exam.

309
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,050
Really? Amazing!

310
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,030
See...

311
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,860
Senior Brother Xiao Gao's so weak.

312
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,900
He can't keep a secret.

313
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,960
Thank you.

314
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,000
Here, it's all done.

315
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,550
Thank you, Senior Brother Lin!

316
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,370
Thanks, Senior Brother.

317
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,640
- Give me a sausage. 
 - It's mouthwatering!

318
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,680
- Thanks. 
 - I want a sausage.

319
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,030
- It's really nice. 
 - Here.

320
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,550
I don't want any more.

321
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,530
Why not? It's good.

322
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,140
Your loss.

323
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,600
Time for song requests!

324
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,120
Tianyu, when did you learn this?

325
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,680
Xuejiao, what do you want to hear?

326
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,210
I'll sing it for you.

327
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,852
- Then... 
 - Jay Chou!

328
00:18:36,852 --> 00:18:38,270
David Tao!

329
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,600
You're all picking the hard stuff.

330
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,230
I just started learning.

331
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,750
How about I'll sing what I'm best at?

332
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,970
Xuejiao, remember to clap for me.

333
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,660
Here I go.

334
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,300
♫  In a dark room  ♫

335
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,760
♫  Be careful when lighting a lantern  ♫

336
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,360
♫  To prevent an echoing sound  ♫

337
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,640
♫  Recalling the memories  ♫

338
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,295
♫  Every intertwined trail of footprints  ♫

339
00:19:12,295 --> 00:19:17,780
♫  Is the journey we take towards each other  ♫

340
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:22,022
♫  Let fate run its course  ♫

341
00:19:22,022 --> 00:19:26,537
♫  Let us give all our courage  ♫

342
00:19:26,537 --> 00:19:32,200
♫  To journey through time with you  ♫

343
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,440
♫  If you can also  ♫

344
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,800
♫  Read the secret in my gaze  ♫

345
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:46,858
♫  You'll realize you've always been in my heart  ♫

346
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:57,847
♫  I try to open my arms  ♫

347
00:19:57,847 --> 00:20:02,235
♫  Because I'm certain of this love  ♫

348
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:05,435
♫  I'll wait for you at the summit  ♫

349
00:20:09,004 --> 00:20:11,010
What's wrong? Did you burn yourself?

350
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,796
Does it hurt?

351
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,320
A-A little bit.

352
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:23,030
♫  I know it must be you   ♫

353
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,500
- Keep singing! 
 - Don't stop!

354
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,210
A little bit.

355
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,590
I'm so sorry! Hold this for me.

356
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,400
Yi Tianyu, what are you doing?

357
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,030
It's all wet.

358
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,270
I didn't mean it.

359
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,840
Are you okay?

360
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,690
- Thanks. 
 - Let me go turn off the water.

361
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,570
I can't turn it off! Drop it!

362
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,690
Somebody! Control the pipe!

363
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,640
Want to see a rainbow?

364
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,090
Move it away!

365
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,570
Give it to me.

366
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,820
Rainbow!

367
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,130
- Let me take it. 
 - It's a rainbow!

368
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,730
Let me.

369
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,600
 Sunshine and rainbow. 

370
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,680
 Running and soaring. 

371
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,168
 Friendship and family. 

372
00:21:45,168 --> 00:21:47,768
 Blooming and growing. 

373
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,990
 It's my youth. 

374
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,070
 My youth after I was reborn. 

375
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,510
 Thank you for dancing in the sun with me. 

376
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,340
 May we shine together as bright as a rainbow. 

377
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,716
♫  Now is the time to format your life  ♫

378
00:22:03,716 --> 00:22:06,600
♫  Math and physics are not complicated  ♫

379
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:12,600
♫  Youth is full of obstacles, but we'll slowly become stronger  ♫

380
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,400
♫  My heart still burns passionately  ♫

381
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,080
♫  Follow the tempo, set yourself free  ♫

382
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,020
 This time, I flipped the script 

383
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,680
 on my last high school's tragic end. 

384
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,640
 Their company replaced romance novels 

385
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,490
 and became my most unforgettable memory this time around. 

386
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:42,380
♫  Let us transcend the obstacles of time  ♫

387
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,120
Wait.

388
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,790
Why am I getting obsessed again?

389
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:04,640
Gu Xuejiao, you can't fall into the same trap twice.

390
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,770
Stop messing with your focus.

391
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,970
What do they say?

392
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:12,750
Channel that obsession into strength.

393
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,290
And knowledge is strength.

394
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,430
Time to hit the books and calm down.

395
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,360
Gu Xuejiao, you ruthless girl.

396
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,030
Stop being so driven. Just give people some breathing room.

397
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:33,520
Oh, it's totally hopeless with overachievers like you.

398
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,980
   

399
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,210
 You really did prepare a gift for me. 

400
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,900
 I thought it'd just be 100 sets of test papers. 

401
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,580
 You wanted to know 

402
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,590
 how to go from the bottom of the class to the top in one year, right? 

403
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,010
 Talent, hard work, and luck. 

404
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,120
 And I've seen all three in you.  
    

405
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,640
 So I can only give my experience to you 

406
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,480
 as a little gift. 

407
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,470
 Two dots. 

408
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,600
 Three bams. 

409
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,790
 Nine dots. 

410
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,400
 Lao Yi, it's your turn. 

411
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,440
 What's the hold-up? 

412
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,470
Son, help me out.

413
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,050
What should I play?

414
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,510
Little chick.

415
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,840
Okay.

416
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,600
Your luck's always golden.

417
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,790
If I trust you, I can certainly win this round.

418
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,960
There you go!

419
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,920
 Kong! Dead wall draw! 

420
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,070
 Lao Yi, you just handed me a jackpot. 

421
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,050
Guess today's my unlucky day.

422
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,710
Dear guest, your service is complete.

423
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,990
Please remember your belongings.

424
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,180
Wishing you a pleasant rest.

425
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:12,070
Son, that was all thanks to you.

426
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,680
Because of you, those uncles had a blast.

427
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,920
Now, when I buy cement and sand from them,

428
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,220
they have to give me a discount.

429
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,310
Are we short of just those few tons of sand?

430
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,640
Just a few?

431
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,790
I ordered a dozen truckloads from them.

432
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,710
That's the Yi family's style.

433
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:31,790
Win at everything and ace whatever we do.

434
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,840
Oh, right! Do you need more allowance money?

435
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,240
Here, take some more.

436
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,360
Thank you, Dad.

437
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,720
Also, take this autographed photo for Xuejiao.

438
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,270
What's wrong? Not into celebrities anymore?

439
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,790
No.

440
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,830
It's just... Tang Jingjing...

441
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:54,470
 This company is the main investor of Tang Jingjing's movie, right? 

442
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,270
 There's so much bad information about this company. 

443
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,550
 Aren't you worried about your dad losing everything? 

444
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,070
 Let me break it down. 

445
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,960
 See these movies they invested in? 

446
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,960
 This, this, and this one. 

447
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,600
 They all flopped. 

448
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,200
 And these other three hit. 

449
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,270
 What's the common factor? 

450
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,270
 Their bosses were all born in the Year of the Tiger. 

451
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,750
 - When was your dad born? 
 - Year of the Tiger. 

452
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,310
 So scientifically or mystically, 

453
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:22,390
 your dad shouldn't touch this project. 

454
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,510
Nonsense!

455
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,120
Since when were you so superstitious?

456
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,200
It's not me.

457
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,380
This is Xuejiao's analysis.

458
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:38,920
Well, if Xuejiao said it, it must be legit.

459
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,440
You changed your mind so fast.

460
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:46,280
Xiao Gu's input is worth considering.

461
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,700
Dad, maybe we should just skip Tang Jingjing's movie.

462
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,200
Listen, son.

463
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,790
For girls, being obedient is key.

464
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:06,840
But what makes a man attractive is having your own opinion.

465
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,710
Don't worry about the investment.

466
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,990
I'll sign the contract on my business trip next week.

467
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,940
This is the Yi family's confidence.

468
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,230
1314?

469
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,310
817?

470
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,690
That's right, it's me. Come on.

471
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,120
Let me open it for you.

472
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,790
Sorry to keep you waiting.

473
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,390
Please get in.

474
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,560
- Be careful. 
 - You're professional.

475
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,010
Hello, passenger. I'm your ride-hailing driver.

476
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:21,530
You can call me Driver Gu. Happy to serve you.

477
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,920
Driver Gu, I'm catching a flight.

478
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,960
Try not to take detours, okay?

479
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,440
I can't.

480
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,550
These days, the platform's watching us in real-time.

481
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,880
We strictly follow the GPS.

482
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,470
Please don't worry.

483
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:36,360
Honestly, this is my first time using this ride-hailing stuff.

484
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,270
My son booked it for me.

485
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:40,970
- Technology is improving too fast now. 
 - Yes.

486
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,112
My daughter told me,

487
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:44,600
"You can go online and become a ride-hailing driver."

488
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,070
I was totally clueless.

489
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:48,070
Honestly, I miss those old days.

490
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,960
You can just wave at a cab, hop in, and off you go.

491
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,510
It was so convenient. But now, I don't even know how to use those apps.

492
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,920
The times have changed.

493
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,960
This is good, though.

494
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,160
It's at least legit, right?

495
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,360
It's better than driving unlicensed.

496
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,160
- Exactly. 
 - Right?

497
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,680
Now, driving this car,

498
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,640
I don't even worry about the traffic police.

499
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,060
 Accident ahead. 

500
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,860
What's this car doing?

501
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,200
Move.

502
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,550
Driver Gu, my flight's leaving soon.

503
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:19,250
Let's try to overtake if you can.

504
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,952
My daughter drills it into me every day,

505
00:29:21,952 --> 00:29:25,470
"Passenger safety always comes first."

506
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,230
You have a good girl.

507
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,160
Thanks. I'm sorry.

508
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,920
Once we get to the airport, you can just run ahead.

509
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,070
I'll haul your luggage and chase after you.

510
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,710
You did load the luggage, right?

511
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:45,020
Luggage? No, I didn't.

512
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,650
You didn't?

513
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,030
Of course not!

514
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,200
How'd you miss the suitcase?

515
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,360
Turn around now! Hurry.

516
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,010
Before it gets lost.

517
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,770
- I'm sorry. 
 - What a driver.

518
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,290
Hello.

519
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:06,960
 Dear passenger, we regret to inform you 

520
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,960
 that your flight, CA171, to Shen City has been canceled. 

521
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,360
Jeez.

522
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,850
What a day.

523
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:17,950
Why is nothing going right?

524
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,470
 President Yi, the master got back to us. 

525
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,710
 Your gut was right. 

526
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:28,870
 It's extremely unfortunate. 

527
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,139
 1314? 

528
00:30:35,139 --> 00:30:36,230
 817? 

529
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,360
817.

530
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,840
1314.

531
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,120
1314817.

532
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,440
8171314.

533
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,230
1314.

534
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,680
8171314*. 
    

535
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,550
Don't go. Life or death. 
    

536
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,710
This is heaven's will!

537
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,570
It must be.

538
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:57,260
My son warned me not to invest in Tang Jingjing's movie.

539
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,340
He was right. I really can't go.

540
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:03,640
Driver Gu, there's no need to rush now.

541
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,160
I'm in no hurry now.

542
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,680
- Take your time. 
 - Okay.

543
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,750
But your suitcase...

544
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,440
We still have to hurry for that. I can't lose it.

545
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,030
- Hurry. 
 - Okay.

546
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:16,120
Shift to Sport mode.

547
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,920
This burns more gas.

548
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,370
- No worries. I'll cover it. 
 - Okay.

549
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,040
Money's the last thing I have to worry about.

550
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,580
 Senior Brother Lin, I have to cancel again today. 

551
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,840
   

552
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,220
So you're waiting for your junior sister's update?

553
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,030
But seriously, ever since her celebration last time,

554
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:39,510
she's been cancelling for a whole week straight.

555
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,530
What's wrong? Is she sick?

556
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,680
 And these other three hit. 

557
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,230
 What's the common factor? 

558
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,200
 The bosses of the films that flopped were all born in the Year of the Tiger. 

559
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,310
 When was your dad born? 

560
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,300
 Year of the Tiger. Right. 

561
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,790
 So scientifically or mystically, 

562
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:57,760
 your dad shouldn't touch this project. 

563
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,890
What's wrong, Lao Lin.

564
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,470
I'm stress-testing right now.

565
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,960
Environmental parameters are ten times over the limit.

566
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,540
The blaring alarm is totally normal.

567
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,310
What are you so nervous about?

568
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,360
What's going on with you today?

569
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,880
Your head's in the clouds.

570
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:23,060
Though that instinctive move to pull me to safety did touch me.

571
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,450
I have to post it online and give you a good shout-out.

572
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,270
 No peaceful times come free. 

573
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:32,990
 When danger hits, it's your buddies yanking you back up. 

574
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,120
Solid sentiment,

575
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,370
but lame wording.

576
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,710
You need some special wording for Moments recently.

577
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:40,490
Otherwise, you get no likes.

578
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,160
    
    

579
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,400
High school life's pretty lively now.

580
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,320
They even have time to see games.

581
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,440
All right. Break time's over.

582
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,280
Back to stress-testing.

583
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,820
She needs a stress test, too.

584
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,380
Weird.

585
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:13,740
   

586
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,778
   

587
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:20,510
   

588
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:22,230
 No. 7! No. 7! 

589
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,550
 No. 8's nemesis! 

590
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,270
 No. 7! No. 7! 

591
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,230
 No. 8's nemesis! 

592
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,470
These kids.

593
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,270
 Show your might! 

594
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,990
 No. 8! No. 8! 

595
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,600
 Show your might! 

596
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,600
Our school and No. 8 High School are major rivals on the court.

597
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,030
This time, we must bring home-court dominance.

598
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,460
Crush their momentum.

599
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:44,590
If they put this energy into studying, they'd be unstoppable.

600
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:47,200
With this time, I would have finished two sets of problems.

601
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,440
You have to take a break.

602
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,870
It doubles your efficiency when you review.

603
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,230
You dragged me here!

604
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,360
Shiyun, are you here to see me?

605
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,883
Yeah. Go all out today.

606
00:33:58,883 --> 00:34:00,440
- I will. 
 - They're all waiting for you.

607
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,600
- Go prepare. 
 - I'm going then.

608
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,030
- You've got this. You have to win! 
 - Got it. Bye.

609
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,960
Why's the repeater class here, too?

610
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,510
 No. 7! No. 7! 

611
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:09,110
No. 8 High School, get on the court.

612
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,510
 No. 7! No. 7! 

613
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,050
 No. 8's nemesis! 

614
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:19,890
 Go! Go! 

615
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,530
Teams, exchange greetings.

616
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,320
 No. 7! No. 7! 

617
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,440
 No. 8's nemesis! 

618
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,950
 Go! 

619
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:46,160
Go! Go!

620
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,060
 No. 7! No. 7! No. 8's nemesis! 

621
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,240
 No. 7! No. 7! No. 8's nemesis! 

622
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,300
 No. 7! No. 7! No. 8's nemesis! 

623
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,170
 No. 7! No. 7! No. 8's nemesis! 

624
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:03,440
 No. 7! No. 7! No. 8's nemesis! 

625
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,330
 No. 7! No. 7! 

626
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,800
 Go! 

627
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,240
 No. 7! Go! Go! 

628
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,360
 Go! Go! No. 7! 

629
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,190
 Go! Go! 

630
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,920
 Nice shot! 

631
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,880
I didn't expect him to be this good.

632
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,070
 Go! Go! No. 7! 

633
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,800
No. 7! No. 7!

634
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,270
No. 8's nemesis!

635
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,880
Go!

636
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,550
No. 8's nemesis!

637
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,890
No. 7! No. 7!

638
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,880
You were right.

639
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,780
I should breathe in the joyful air of victory.

640
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,960
Go!

641
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,320
Go!

642
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,030
 Go! Go! Go! 

643
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,720
 Nice shot! 

644
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,150
No. 7! No. 7!

645
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,538
No. 8's nemesis!

646
00:35:51,538 --> 00:35:53,160
What're you staring at?

647
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:59,290
Why are you here? Shouldn't you be on the court?

648
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,070
No. 7! No. 7!

649
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,760
I'm deep in study mode now.

650
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,920
I haven't played ball in ages.

651
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,030
My hands are rusty.

652
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,820
I'll just cheer from the sidelines.

653
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,800
Scream your lungs out! Come on!

654
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,070
 No. 7! No. 7! 

655
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,720
 No. 8's nemesis! 

656
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,550
 No. 8! No. 8! 

657
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,550
 Show your might! 

658
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,990
 Go! Go! 

659
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:23,510
Doesn't it look good? It matches our team's jerseys.

660
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,520
Why's he over there?

661
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,450
 No. 8! 

662
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,140
 Go! 

663
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,390
 No. 7! 

664
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,960
 Go! No. 7! Go! 

665
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,320
 No. 7! No. 7! 

666
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,630
 Go! No. 7! Go! 

667
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,240
 No. 7! 

668
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,150
What're you doing? Are you playing ball or playing dirty?

669
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,430
- Gu Mingze! 
 - Are you okay?

670
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,720
- What are you doing? 
 - What's wrong with you?

671
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,860
No. 8 is playing dirty!

672
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,280
It's a foul!

673
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,760
Timeout!

674
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,370
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm fine.

675
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:05,370
Are you really okay?

676
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,760
Sit him down. Let me check.

677
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,940
- Are you okay? 
 - Sit him down.

678
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,620
- What's up? 
 - Where are our alternates? Why aren't they going in?

679
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,030
Our alternates are injured, too. We have no more left.

680
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,670
Then what do we do now?

681
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,360
He can't continue.

682
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,560
Shiyun, do you have tissues?

683
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,030
Yes, in my bag. Help yourself.

684
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:38,190
- Let me check. 
 - Yi Tianyu, you should go!

685
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,880
You skip class to study tactics.

686
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,590
Now's your time to shine.

687
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,190
No way. I can't.

688
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,470
Coach! I've got an alternate here!

689
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,960
Why is it Gu Xuejiao again?

690
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,760
She's always hogging the spotlight.

691
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,280
Let me put her in her place.

692
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,840
 No. 8's nemesis! 

693
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,868
 No. 7! No. 7! 

694
00:37:52,868 --> 00:37:56,400
Yi Tianyu, how dare you just sit and watch?

695
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,470
Get in to the game!

696
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,760
Coach, I really can't.

697
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,550
I haven't practiced in ages. My hands are rusty.

698
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,670
Man up! What's with the hesitation?

699
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,452
If you blow this chance,

700
00:38:04,452 --> 00:38:07,380
you'll end up as a game-addicted loser!

701
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:13,050
Me? A loser? Are you kidding?

702
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,320
Go! Hurry!

703
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,280
- Change your clothes. 
 - Get on the court!

704
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,040
Faster!

705
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,470
In life, everyone's chances are limited.

706
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,360
Go.

707
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,090
He already has his jersey on!

708
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,920
Come here.

709
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,960
Come on.

710
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,190
Follow the tactics I taught you.

711
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:52,990
- Got it. 
 - Let's go.

712
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,550
- Are you confident? 
 - Yeah!

713
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,590
Three, two, one.

714
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,250
Go!

715
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,030
- Go! 
 - Go! Go! Go!

716
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:05,160
 No. 8! No. 8! 

717
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,190
 No. 7! 

718
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,290
 No. 8's nemesis! 

719
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,210
 Go! Go! 

720
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:25,630
 Turns out you shine brighter without me. 

721
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,590
It turns out together we're a pile of shit.

722
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,030
Apart, we're stars.

723
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,590
You need to take a dump?

724
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,300
I have tissues!

725
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,360
- Thank you! 
 - No problem!

726
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,030
   

727
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,720
 The line's way too long. 

728
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,650
 Has the second half started? 

729
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,190
Principal?

730
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,710
Come with me.

731
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:51,510
 Shiyun, do you have tissues? 

732
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,910
 Yes, in my bag. 

733
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,900
 Why's there... 

734
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,510
 Well... I found it on the street. 

735
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,050
 I have no clue whose it was. 

736
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:06,030
 I didn't want to just leave it there, so I picked it up. 

737
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:08,590
 Let me find it a good home. 

738
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,650
 Go! Go! 

739
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,800
So satisfying.

740
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,590
But... it doesn't feel proper.

741
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,760
Shiyun, you're just too kind.

742
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,960
That's why you got bullied by Gu Xuejiao since childhood.

743
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,760
And now she's showing off in front of Yi Tianyu.

744
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,500
Who is it?

745
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,010
Gu Xuejiao? Weren't you...

746
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,960
Principal.

747
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,490
Principal Fu.

748
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,320
 I'm so sorry. 

749
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,820
 Senior Brother. 

750
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,590
 Senior, are you here to watch the game? 

751
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,590
 Or are you looking for Xuejiao? 

752
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:55,920
 She just went that way with a pack of cigarettes. 

753
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,440
 Cigarettes? 

754
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,650
 Where did you go? 

755
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,910
 Senior Brother Lin, what brings you here? 

756
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,970
 It's not a cigarette. 

757
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,800
 You think I smoke? 

758
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,630
 Check your bag. 

759
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,350
 Check again. 

760
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,460
   

761
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,540
 It's not mine! It... 

762
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,480
 Think about who it could belong to. 

763
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,510
 Nail polish? This color? 

764
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,920
 Chen Xiao? 

765
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,800
Explain yourself.

766
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,720
You're students from an elite class.

767
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,897
How could you do this?

768
00:41:52,897 --> 00:41:55,320
Such a disgrace to Class One!

769
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,630
Go back.

770
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,210
Come on.

771
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,150
Laugh if you want.

772
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,490
Let's go.

773
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:20,430
Do you think Principal Fu will pull the ultimate move on Zhou Shiyun

774
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,400
and call her parents?

775
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,920
If that happens, her family will be in chaos.

776
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,810
You reminded me.

777
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,090
I...

778
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,190
Xiao Lin.

779
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,910
Hello, Principal Fu.

780
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,510
Xuejiao wants to beg for Shiyun.

781
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,990
She says it's just a small thing,

782
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:49,760
and there's no need to involve parents.

783
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,280
Thanks for your reminder.

784
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,590
 Is framing a classmate a small thing? 

785
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:57,440
 Listen up! This time, I'll handle it strictly. 

786
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,960
 Their parents will be notified! 

787
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,000
Okay. Guess we have to listen to you.

788
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:12,110
You...

789
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:16,960
You've learned to be shady quickly. You're talented.

790
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,720
What are you talking about?

791
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,570
I don't understand.

792
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:23,510
Of course! Though I was framed,

793
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:25,280
it's a fact that smoking's bad for health,

794
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,680
especially for high school students.

795
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,860
You were just looking out for us.

796
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:38,720
By the way, why did you drop by today?

797
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,860
I'm here to catch someone, too.

798
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:43,740
Catch someone...

799
00:43:55,070 --> 00:44:05,090

00:45:58,574 --> 00:46:02,643
♫  Because I'm certain of this love  ♫

821
00:46:02,643 --> 00:46:05,402
♫  I'll wait for you at the summit  ♫

822
00:46:05,402 --> 00:46:12,203
♫  Even if the wind's harsh, it's all right  ♫

823
00:46:12,203 --> 00:46:16,365
♫  There's a figure approaching  ♫

824
00:46:16,365 --> 00:46:23,845
♫  I know it must be you   ♫
