 "Burning Tempo" - Duan Aojuan

00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,880
♫  One, two, three, four  ♫

00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,617
♫  Don't be afraid of the so-called star student  ♫

5
00:00:25,617 --> 00:00:29,480
♫  You are also someone else's legend  ♫

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,280
♫  Don't hold back, grow with all your might  ♫

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,820
♫  Midsummer's flowers  ♫

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,455
♫  Now is the time to format your life  ♫

9
00:00:40,455 --> 00:00:43,360
♫  Math and physics are not complicated  ♫

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,825
♫  Youth is full of obstacles, but we'll slowly become stronger  ♫

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,090
♫  My heart still burns passionately  ♫

12

♫  My love still burns passionately   ♫

16
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,789
♫  Shining in the smiling eyes  ♫

17
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:19,303
♫  Let us transcend the obstacles of time  ♫

18
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,000
   

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,190
   

20
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,550
I can prove that I'm telling the truth.

21
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,270
Go ahead.

22
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,310
Just now, we all saw

23
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,190
that Zhou Shiyun fell in Principal Fu's direction.

24
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,910
If I had thrown the ball from where I stood,

25
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,720
and it hit Zhou Shiyun along a parabolic path,

26
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,910
we all know that

27
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,260
force pushes opposite the impact.

28
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:02,840
If I really threw it, how could she fall toward Principal Fu?

29
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,320
Shiyun, you always say we're best friends.

30
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,860
Then can we go back to the scene

31
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,600
and reenact it for everyone to see?

32
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,240
The school has surveillance cameras everywhere.

33
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,040
We can replay the footage and verify it anytime.

34
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,570
But as for the mental distress and slander I've suffered because of you today,

35
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,870
I reserve the right to pursue legal action.

36
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,710
I'm on duty today.

37
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,460
Principal Fu, I'll head back now.

38
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,800
Student Gu explained everything thoroughly, didn't she?

39
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,080
We'll also reserve our right

40
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,150
to pursue legal action for slander and those things.

41
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,520
Let us know if there is any news.

42
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,910
Let's go.

43
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,430
Oh, by the way, you all have my card. Right?

44
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,270
Big projects, no sweat, Yi Dafa's your bet!

45
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,680
Come on, Dad. Let's go.

46
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,760
He...

47
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,660
The kids really are at a critical stage right now.

48
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,430
Yeah.

49
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,320
Even though this happened, don't worry.

50
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,960
I promise I'll handle it properly.

51
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,550
All right. Thank you.

52
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,920
- You're welcome. 
 - Thank you, Principal Fu.

53
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,240
- See you. 
 - Okay.

54
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,850
Take care.

55
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,260
Xiao Lin!

56
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,200
Principal Fu.

57
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,990
What brings you here?

58
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,080
- I've been listening for a while. 
 - Come on, let's chat inside.

59
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,140
- Long time no see. 
 - Did you grow taller?

60
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,270
Here, have some tea.

61
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,200
Principal Fu, I think you should have some first.

62
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,540
Otherwise, you won't be able to hold back the anger stirred up by those parents.

63
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,530
You heard it all?

64
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:09,140
I'm noticing this new batch of students is really impressive.

65
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,760
They value truth and facts, stand up for themselves,

66
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,620
and refuse to be wronged.

67
00:04:16,474 --> 00:04:20,030
Kids these days are getting tougher.

68
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:23,780
They're not as obedient as you guys used to be,

69
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,170
although you weren't a rule-follower either.

70
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,000
These young students are bigger headaches than you.

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,250
Yet, I also spent much time worrying about you back then.

72
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,470
Students are wayward in their own ways.

73
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,690
Principal Fu, did you call me here just to take a walk down memory lane?

74
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,340
Of course not.

75
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,830
Let's talk some real business.

76
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,590
Have you made up your mind about giving that speech?

77
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:53,960
Our school really needs a top grad like you

78
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,790
to come back and help your juniors.

79
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:59,680
Tell them about your college experience at Jinghai University.

80
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,350
Give them some motivation and cheer them on.

81
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,210
Now, we need to push hard on both academics and mindset.

82
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,440
Did you see that troublemaker earlier?

83
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,270
I suspended her on the spot.

84
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,210
No one could talk me out of it.

85
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,580
Anyway, enough about that.

86
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,200
How've things been for you at school lately?

87
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,250
I got suspended, too.

88
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,470
Drink your tea.

89
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,300
You all cause me trouble.

90
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,640
Are you serious?

91
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,250
Just drink.

92
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,390
Gu Xuejiao, I'm heading off.

93
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,210
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye.

94
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,340
   

95
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:49,592
No wonder Lin Zhihua likes writing code during his part-time gigs,

96
00:05:49,592 --> 00:05:51,030
it's so efficient to memorize vocab

97
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,960
while working.

98
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,760
Hey, there, is this Class 8 of Grade 12?

99
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,270
Yes.

100
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,560
 Was Zhou Shiyun a carrier pigeon in her past life? 

101
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,790
 She already informed my parents. 

102
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,420
- Gu Xuejiao. 
 - Mom.

103
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,590
- If... 
 - If Zhou Shiyun's mom hadn't told you,

104
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:08,270
you wouldn't even know I caused such trouble at school.

105
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,512
She...

106
00:06:09,512 --> 00:06:13,150
Mom, I swear I didn't lay a finger on anyone.

107
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,350
From beginning to end, the only thing I did

108
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,350
was trying to keep things from spiraling.

109
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,520
If you didn't touch anyone, why didn't you tell us?

110
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,200
Why hide it from us?

111
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,593
Because I knew that even if I told you I didn't hurt anyone,

112
00:06:23,593 --> 00:06:26,560
you'd still drag me to apologize like you're doing now.

113
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,320
You'd think that saying sorry would smooth things over.

114
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,580
It doesn't matter whose fault it is.

115
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,710
You should go and offer an apology. Understand?

116
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,440
A smile can disarm aggression.

117
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,000
Just humble yourself a little.

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,980
It never hurts.

119
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,350
Mom, how humble should I be?

120
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,200
Am I supposed to swallow my pride

121
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,560
and apologize to others for something I didn't do?

122
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,230
And what do we get out of that?

123
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,340
Expired drinks we can't even finish?

124
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,490
 Xuejiao, here, have a drink. 

125
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,880
 Why aren't you drinking? 

126
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,100
 She loves this. 

127
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,330
 But it's expired. 

128
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,000
Or maybe their snobbish attitude?

129
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,250
 Can you get her a job? 

130
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,830
 Any department is fine. 

131
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,470
 Let her do some odd end jobs. 

132
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,520
 My husband's company runs a tight ship. 

133
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,880
 We may address each other as relatives, 

134
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,470
 but we're not related by blood. 

135
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,420
 I'm afraid there's really nothing my husband can do. 

136
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,280
 I hope you understand. 

137
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,590
Child, what's gotten into you?

138
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,560
If you keep this up, how are you supposed to get along with your classmates?

139
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,830
I'm... I'm doing this for your own good.

140
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,230
I don't need it.

141
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,760
Mom,

142
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,300
honestly, none of us need it.

143
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,320
Jiao Jiao!

144
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,560
Jiao Jiao, are you okay?

145
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,910
I knew it was a misunderstanding.

146
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,860
Auntie, what brings you here?

147
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,270
It's fine, it's just a misunderstanding.

148
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,910
No need to worry so much.

149
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,320
Shiyun, you're always so considerate.

150
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,120
Help me talk some sense into Jiao Jiao.

151
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,910
Classmates will always have little disagreements.

152
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,520
It's better to reduce the trouble to a minimum. Right?

153
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,470
After all, you're in Grade 12 now.

154
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,470
Studies come first, right?

155
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,490
Auntie, don't worry. I definitely will.

156
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,680
Speaking of which, Jiao Jiao, I'm really concerned about you.

157
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,640
What's going on with you lately? Your grades have dropped again.

158
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,790
You can't keep going on like this.

159
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,170
Last time, you went home past midnight and I covered for you.

160
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,980
- I didn't feel... 
 - Wait.

161
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,510
She returned home past midnight?

162
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,080
- No... 
 - Auntie, you didn't know about that?

163
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,830
Jiao Jiao, I'm sorry.

164
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,440
- I... 
 - You... Enough.

165
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,930
- You should leave now. 
 - Gu Xuejiao!

166
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,750
Sorry, Shiyun. I need to talk to Xuejiao about something private.

167
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,630
Why don't you head back first? Don't make your mom worry.

168
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,990
Okay.

169
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,320
I shouldn't have said anything.

170
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,870
Auntie, please don't be mad.

171
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,590
Xuejiao didn't mean it.

172
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,080
I'll get going now.

173
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,112
- You...!  
 - Gu Xuejiao!

174
00:08:58,112 --> 00:09:00,870
I knew you and Gu Mingze were up to no good.

175
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,110
A girl your age, staying out till the middle of the night.

176
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,590
What were you doing? Tell me the truth.

177
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,990
Mom, just because Zhou Shiyun said something,

178
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,110
you're going to scold me again, aren't you?

179
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,970
I've got nothing to say.

180
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,230
Fine.

181
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,850
If you're so tough, then don't come home!

182
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:29,160
Honey, I might've gone too far just now with what I said to Xuejiao.

183
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,090
What should I do now?

184
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,430
We're leaving.

185
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,210
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye.

186
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,590
What are you doing here?

187
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,330
It's late. I don't drink coffee at night.

188
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,750
It's hot chocolate.

189
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,450
My treat.

190
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,020
Thanks.

191
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,200
Weren't you off today?

192
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,590
What are you doing in the bookstore?

193
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,280
Didn't you have a heated debate this afternoon?

194
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,210
Why the sudden gloom?

195
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:17,090
How do you know about that?

196
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:20,590
I was at No. 7 High this afternoon and overheard it.

197
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,590
So you know I got suspended?

198
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,710
It's just temporary.

199
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,810
Just wait for the truth to come out.

200
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,200
Gu Xuejiao,

201
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,760
do you remember your declaration for the college entrance exam?

202
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,130
Of course I do.

203
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,830
You look so defeated.

204
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,080
I thought you forgot.

205
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,800
I may be bummed out,

206
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,060
but that won't stop me from getting into Jinghai University.

207
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,560
You've been suspended.

208
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,470
How are you supposed to do that?

209
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,800
You're really rubbing it in when I'm already down.

210
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,840
You've managed to get me on board. What's impossible for you to achieve?

211
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,040
The bookstore's closing.

212
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,400
Let's go.

213
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,440
You go. I'll spend the night here.

214
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,210
There are monsters here.

215
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,110
Come on, I'm taking you somewhere.

216
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,660
Jinghai University? 
    

217
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,510
Why'd you bring me here?

218
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,220
Have you come here before?

219
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,930
Of course, I passed by it every day on my way to work.

220
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,970
What?

221
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,160
I mean... I've never been inside.

222
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,440
I don't have a student ID.

223
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,450
All I can do is stare at the gates.

224
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,120
Come on.

225
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,110
This place is at least twice as big as No. 7 High.

226
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:49,210
Is Jinghai University three times bigger than No. 7 High?

227
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,280
Probably more.

228
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,630
Actually, I wanted to check out the lab building.

229
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,010
I want to see where you usually have classes.

230
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,730
Once you get in, you can wander freely.

231
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,630
How about a match?

232
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,680
I don't know how to play.

233
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,960
There are no rules.

234
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,670
If you score once, I'll grant you one wish.

235
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,750
Of course, as long as it's legal.

236
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,210
Deal?

237
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,530
Are you serious?

238
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,750
- The loser calls the winner Master. 
 - Bag.

239
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,000
Drop the bag. Come on.

240
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,680
Game on.

241
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,960
Can you do this?

242
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,580
Of course. A strong woman never says no.

243
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,870
Don't go easy on me.

244
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,090
I can block you just by standing still.

245
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,300
What are you doing?

246
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,870
One more time?

247
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,360
Come on.

248
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,400
Try again.

249
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,260
Run a little.

250
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,990
This court's pretty big, right?

251
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,960
Huge.

252
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,490
Try again.

253
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,570
Again.

254
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,610
I'm done. You're a pro, yet I'm an amateur.

255
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,920
I'm just a nerd,

256
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,590
but even I know playing basketball takes brains.

257
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,290
You should use yours, too.

258
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,160
I'm done. I'm going home.

259
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,320
Giving up that easily?

260
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,030
Careful!

261
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,140
I won!

262
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,160
You tricked me.

263
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,960
How's that tricking you?

264
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,400
Everyone dodges out of instinct.

265
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,960
That's called playing smart.

266
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,970
I haven't said my wish yet.

267
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,890
Wasn't your wish to be called Master?

268
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,490
Let me hear you.

269
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,640
Master.

270
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,750
No.

271
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:30,870
Senior Brother Lin, can you help me talk to the school?

272
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,250
I really don't know what else to do.

273
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,340
You're so smart. Please help me figure something out.

274
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,490
I'm basically your strategist now.

275
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,430
Jinghai University's court is gorgeous,

276
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:00,050
but we could catch a cold lying around like this.

277
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,490
Can't you just enjoy your life?

278
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,830
Why are you so mindful of your health?

279
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,470
Because someone once told me that

280
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,030
as long as I stay alive,

281
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,070
there will be opportunities to turn the tables.

282
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:25,200
Which life coach shared this insightful maxim with you?

283
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,070
Let me check on your review progress.

284
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,960
First line of "The Epang Palace Rhapsody."

285
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,510
"With the fall of the six states, the empire unified;

286
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,790
The mountains in Shu were denuded, and the grand Epang Palace was built."

287
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,200
I really can recite it.

288
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,380
From Earth, what's the brightest planet in the solar system?

289
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,582
Venus.

290
00:17:51,582 --> 00:17:53,750
The heliocentric theory was established in which century?

291
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,840
16th.

292
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,900
An astronaut throws a ball of mass, m, straight up on the moon.

293
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,030
The time for the ball to return is t.

294
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,672
Given that the ratio of the moon's mass to Earth's is p,

295
00:18:03,672 --> 00:18:05,030
and the ratio of their radii is q,

296
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,030
with Earth's gravitational acceleration being g,

297
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:13,310
what is the ball's initial speed when the astronaut throws it upward?

298
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:25,380
V equals pg divided by 2q².

299
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,230
One more question.

300
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,120
Do you have anything harder?

301
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,450
Let me show you what genuine

302
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,100
all-round development is like.

303
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,600
Tell me about the development of cosmic evolution theory in China.

304
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,120
Back in the Western Han dynasty,

305
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,070
"Huainanzi: Beginning of Reality" said...

306
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:58,790
It said...

307
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:01,250
It said...

308
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,360
All right, all right.

309
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,200
You're the real MVP of all-round development.

310
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,820
Happy now?

311
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,690
Let's go.

312
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,052
"Huainanzi: Beginning of Reality,"

313
00:19:30,052 --> 00:19:31,940
how do you recite it again?

314
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,120
I remember!

315
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,710
Who? Who's there?

316
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,270
- Run. 
 - Who's there?

317
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,470
- Stop! 
 - "Huainanzi: Beginning of Reality" said...

318
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,920
"The cosmos had a start. It also had a phase without a start.

319
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,120
And even before that phase without a start, there existed another state."

320
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,200
Did I get it right?

321
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,450
Yes.

322
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,040
Thanks for tonight.

323
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:18,445
Although I was a little down from being wrongly accused,

324
00:20:18,445 --> 00:20:21,480
nothing's going to stop me from applying to Jinghai University.

325
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,720
I'm off.

326
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,600
Where are you going?

327
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,720
Home. Or my mom's going to think I ran away, and she'll cry pearls.

328
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,720
It's late. I'll walk you.

329
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,270
   

330
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,070
Here's a question. 
    

331
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,890
If FC is perpendicular to AB,

332
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:56,380
and we need the value of the ellipse's eccentricity e,

333
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:00,880
then, tell me, what method should we employ to solve this?

334
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,580
 Plug-in values. 

335
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,290
Correct. We will plug in values to solve this.

336
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,360
Plug-in values.

337
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,710
First, we substitute point A

338
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,470
- into what? 
  - The ellipse equation. 

339
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:26,710
Right. That way, we know what?

340
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,120
That point A lies on the ellipse, right?

341
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,050
Then what do we do?

342
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:37,750
We assign KAQ and KAP as 1 and -1.

343
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,920
Right? Next, what can we do?

344
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,960
 - We can set...  
 - Why are you pushing yourself so hard?

345
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,400
You're suspended, why do you still come?

346
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,750
 Got it? 

347
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,710
 If you have a similar problem next time, solve it the same way. 

348
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,600
The weather report just warned of heavy rain.

349
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,490
Don't get soaked.

350
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,690
Okay.

351
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,640
 Time for the sympathy play. 

352
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,530
 Let the storm come, the bigger the better. 

353
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,470
Now let's move on to the next question.

354
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,812
Let's check the next question.

355
00:22:12,812 --> 00:22:15,800
It's... It's number 14, right?

356
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,510
What is the question?

357
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:24,540
It's about five Olympic volunteers who are randomly assigned

358
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,185
to four different service posts,

359
00:22:27,185 --> 00:22:30,400
with each post having at least one volunteer.

360
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,760
Do you guys still remember how I told you to solve this last time?

361
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,640
 Where's the forecasted storm? 

362
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,100
 I'm sweating buckets in this raincoat. 

363
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,790
What's the method?

364
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:26,230
Gu Xuejiao's parents really don't care enough about her studies.

365
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,652
Their kid got suspended, and instead of coming themselves,

366
00:23:28,652 --> 00:23:31,710
they sent you, the tutor, to plead on their behalf.

367
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,140
Not educating a child well is the father's fault.

368
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,580
I'm her tutor, which makes me like a father*... 
  (*Famous Chinese saying) 

369
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,840
I mean, it's my fault.

370
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,200
Don't act like it's all on you.

371
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,960
Xiao Lin, let me tell you, no one can sway this decision.

372
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,470
A student's job is to study,

373
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,550
and that's all No. 7 High cares about.

374
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,790
As long as I'm still the principal here,

375
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,880
anything that distracts students from learning

376
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,910
will be kicked out of this school.

377
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,570
Then let's go out.

378
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,840
Why?

379
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,400
I haven't been back in a while.

380
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,030
- I'd like to walk around. 
 - I won't go, go on your own.

381
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,710
- Come with me. 
 - I'll have my tea.

382
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,470
What are you doing?

383
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,020
Come on.

384
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,990
Can't you enjoy staying alone?

385
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,420
My goodness.

386
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,250
This is nice.

387
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,950
Yi Tianyu.

388
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,940
Yi Tianyu?

389
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,390
Why are you there?

390
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,350
Do you understand?

391
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,960
I got it.

392
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,490
If you got it, then the whole class probably does, too.

393
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,900
Come on, tell me.

394
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:54,810
What method should we use to solve this problem?

395
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,970
It’s been a while since you came back, huh?

396
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,870
Principal Fu,

397
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,550
it's really hot today.

398
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,840
Yes.

399
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,940
Why else would I wear short sleeves?

400
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,910
Why is this kid still attending classes even while sick?

401
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,760
She's eager to learn.

402
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,550
Principal Fu.

403
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,000
 I'm so considerate. 

404
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,680
 I want to go to Jinghai University! 

405
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,160
 Why is this kid still attending classes even while sick? 

406
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,820
 She's eager to learn. 

407
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:08,220
Bring over Gu Xuejiao from Class 8 of Grade 12.

408
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:12,080
   

409
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,880
It's for you.

410
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,340
I'm good.

411
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,540
Well, plans really can't keep up with change.

412
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,350
I nearly roasted out there.

413
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,050
So, tell me. How'd it go?

414
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:36,230
Total victory, of course.

415
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,070
I'm allowed to return.

416
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,620
Congrats.

417
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,640
But the one who framed you got off scot-free.

418
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,440
Does that sit right with you?

419
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,070
I thought you hated injustice most.

420
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:48,230
What's the point of beefing with a kid?

421
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,240
It'll drag me down to her level.

422
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,310
Aren't you a kid yourself?

423
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,760
Yeah.

424
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:03,180
What's keeping you so busy?

425
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:13,280
Just say what you want to, don't get so close.

426
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:23,790
Thing is, I need another favor.

427
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:26,230
I already got you reinstated, and you still want more?

428
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:30,710
I was indeed reinstated, but Principal Fu added a condition.

429
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:33,840
He said I must make it

430
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,180
into the top 100 in the next mock exam.

431
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,770
What?

432
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,360
Into what?

433
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,940
Into the top 100.

434
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,550
Senior Brother Lin, don't go. Please help me out!

435
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,710
Don't try that same act you pulled on Principal Fu with me.

436
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,790
Please sit down first.

437
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,200
Come on.

438
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,950
Sit down.

439
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,720
Show me your last report card.

440
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,170
Hand it over.

441
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,200
Principal Fu has to be kidding.

442
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,130
Read it.

443
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:35,740
I got 89 in Chinese and 81 in English.

444
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:40,650
As for math, well...

445
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,770
58.

446
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:50,360
That was because I got spooked during the test,

447
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,070
and performed worse than usual.

448
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,440
Second-to-last in the entire grade.

449
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,400
How many students are there in your grade?

450
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,880
About four to five hundred?

451
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,030
Trust me.

452
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:04,790
Before Grade 11, I was doing really great.

453
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,790
It's just that I got a bit carried away with all the distractions.

454
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,470
But I'm back on track now.

455
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:12,070
Now, all I know is study, study, and study more.

456
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:28,070
Then Student Gu who only knows study, study and study more,

457
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,680
stop talking about your past glory.

458
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,940
It wasn't much to brag about anyway.

459
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:40,450
Have you really never been beaten up for being too mean?

460
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,230
You've got just over three months before the first mock exam.

461
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:49,510
It's only possible if you can study 24/7 with no break,

462
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,970
read rapidly, and have photographic memory.

463
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:55,580
But I'm not alone.

464
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,030
I've got a buff.

465
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,840
Me?

466
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,120
Buff.

467
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,040
You're going to help me.

468
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,550
The clock is ticking, and the task is daunting.

469
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,230
Let's get started now.

470
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:35,470
   

471
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:39,180
You really came prepared, huh?

472
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,692
 Mock exam goals and prep plan. 

473
00:31:45,692 --> 00:31:48,070
 Step one. The review time and schedules for each subject 

474
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,670
 must conform to the Ebbinghaus curve. 

475
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,920
 One, two, three, four. 

476
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,250
 One, two, three, four. 

477
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,840
  - One, two, one. 
 - Ambulance. 

478
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,340
Ambulance.

479
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,500
- Limit? 
 - Limit.

480
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,810
 One, two, three, four. 

481
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,350
- Check, please. 
 - All right.

482
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,140
50 yuan, please.

483
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,100
Thank you.

484
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,990
Make a conditional sentence.

485
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:33,080
My amount of exercise is at my limit.

486
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:39,170
I might need an ambulance if I keep running like this.

487
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,870
You've improved.

488
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,420
 One, two, three, four. 

489
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:53,040
   

490
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,600
 What kind of saccharide is starch? 

491
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,050
Polysaccharide.

492
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,350
 And monosaccharides? 

493
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,020
Ribose, glucose, fructose, and galactose.

494
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:09,010
 Whichever kind it is, you hate them all. 

495
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,310
Not all. Next question.

496
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:16,460
Senior Brother Lin, can you ask something I know, too?

497
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,600
Ribose, glucose, fructose, and galactose.

498
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,360
Skill trees, player versus player,

499
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,890
economy system, and environmental narrative.

500
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:37,112
Honey, can you tell what Mingze's even saying there?

501
00:33:37,112 --> 00:33:38,300
Isn't it obvious?

502
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,500
That's a history question.

503
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,180
Oh, history.

504
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:47,640
Our family must've racked up some good karma.

505
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,840
First, we had Senior Brother Xiao Gao, and now we've got Senior Brother Xiao Lin.

506
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,500
It's right before Chinese New Year,

507
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,750
and he's still tutoring these two little rascals.

508
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,580
- So nice of him. 
 - Yeah.

509
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,020
Honestly, let's invite Senior Brother Xiao Lin over

510
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:03,310
before Chinese New Year and treat him to a proper meal.

511
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,070
Yeah!

512
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,060
Is that Xuejiao?

513
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,180
Let me say something, too.

514
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,160
What's up? You have something to ask her?

515
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:13,250
Her brother's pretty handsome, though.

516
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,630
Mind your own business.

517
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,470
I just wanted her to teach me.

518
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:21,760
I need to know how she managed to keep you working through the festival

519
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,610
while I can't even get you to sit down for a family dinner.

520
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,990
Your parents decided to spend the Chinese New Year in Hawaii,

521
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,550
and I got your ticket right here.

522
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,130
If you're not going, come up with your own excuse.

523
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,240
The time difference is too big.

524
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,590
Remote tutoring is not convenient.

525
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:49,740
So, you're skipping the year-end party, too?

526
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,150
What a coincidence. I've already got plans.

527
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:56,320
 Senior Brother Lin, drop by for dinner sometime before the festival. 

528
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,190
 A little thank-you feast. 

529
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,540
You're quite the senior brother,

530
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,470
you're really up to standard.

531
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,380
You got an express package.

532
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,690
Since when did you start shopping online?

533
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,880
It's not your zodiac year. 
  (Tradition to wear red) 

534
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,590
I've been tutoring for free all this time.

535
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:17,280
She sent it to show a little gratitude.

536
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,560
   

537
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,700
   

538
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,740
Thin skins and generous fillings.

539
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,400
It's the New Year. It's common to get greeting messages.

540
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,370
Just let me take a look.

541
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,950
What?

542
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,880
We profited! We profited!

543
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,040
We turned a profit!

544
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,330
What turned a profit?

545
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,153
What else?

546
00:36:35,153 --> 00:36:37,610
My brother's stock went up. 
    

547
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,260
What turned?

548
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:45,470
I get it. The electric coil turns.

549
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,420
They must be doing a physics experiment.

550
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,620
How nice.

551
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,760
Water's boiling. Let's cook the dumplings.

552
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,170
Okay.

553
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:01,030
Young students and old students, get ready.

554
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:03,860
It'll be ready soon, dumplings are coming!

555
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,110
- Let me do it! 
 - I'll hold the tray. Go ahead.

556
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,240
Let them spin.

557
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,350
These dumplings are going to be tasty.

558
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,880
 New year, fresh start. 

559
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,360
 Luck is coming our way. 

560
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,360
 Take a chance, we may win a jackpot. 

561
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,820
 Gu Xuejiao, good times are coming our way. 

562
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,550
Here we go! Here are the dumplings!

563
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,280
Here.

564
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,661
Here, dumplings!

565
00:37:35,661 --> 00:37:36,760
Come on.

566
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,400
- Careful. 
 - You're never in a rush to study.

567
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,530
But when it comes to food, you're first in line.

568
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:44,550
Did you scald yourself? Our guest hasn't even tried one.

569
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:47,300
Have some drinks. Cool off your mouth.

570
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:53,130
Xiao Lin, you and Mingze should have a drink with me.

571
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,740
How can you let kids have alcohol?

572
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,260
You really set a bad example.

573
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,190
It's okay. I'll have some.

574
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,430
Good.

575
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,840
You...

576
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,070
Thanks, Uncle.

577
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:10,320
Don't mention it. This bottle's been aging for years.

578
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,440
Don't drink too much at once.

579
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,670
All right then, let's raise a glass.

580
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,230
Come on.

581
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,150
Today, on behalf of the family,

582
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:22,280
I just want to thank Xiao Lin

583
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,440
for being so dedicated to tutoring the two of them all this time.

584
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,590
Thank you so much.

585
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,880
I'm not great with words.

586
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,780
So, may you eat well, enjoy yourself,

587
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,030
and stay warm.

588
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:36,390
- Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

589
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,530
Come on. Dig in!

590
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:44,880
Dad, did you put a coin in the dumplings today?

591
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,550
Whoever gets it will strike it rich.

592
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:49,030
You... Oh, come on.

593
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,590
Your sister said coins aren't hygienic,

594
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,150
so I went with peanuts today.

595
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,630
Peanut, peanut, luck's your strut!

596
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,450
- Right? 
 - Not bad!

597
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,160
I think I got one.

598
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,700
Me, too.

599
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,420
What about you?

600
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,320
I have to get one, too.

601
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,960
Senior Brother Lin,

602
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,030
wishing you a year filled with success and luck.

603
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,840
Then I wish you steady progress and smooth sailing

604
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,620
on your college entrance exam, Student Gu.

605
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,860
Mom,

606
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,570
I choked.

607
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:34,920
Go to the bathroom, quick. Go!

608
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,240
No.

609
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,550
I just ate too much and got bloated.

610
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,500
I'll take a walk downstairs.

611
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:46,570
- All right then. Go ahead. 
 - It's that, uh, amylase or something.

612
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:47,670
All right, enough.

613
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:50,360
- You have food in your mouth. 
 - Don't bite your tongue.

614
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,360
I'm off, bye!

615
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,720
- Silly kid. 
 - Here, Xiao Lin, try some of this fish.

616
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,340
Give it a taste.

617
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,820
Thanks.

618
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:13,430
Hey, big-time Designer Gu.

619
00:40:18,896 --> 00:40:21,126
How'd you know I was here?

620
00:40:23,275 --> 00:40:25,595
You were spotted and posted.

621
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,440
Come on, let's go.

622
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,070
Come on.

623
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:43,240
Hey! Don't drag my mentor away!

624
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,700
- Principal Fu. 
 - You're going home anyway!

625
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,440
Xiao Lin, what are you doing here?

626
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,330
Happy New Year, Principal Fu. It's the holiday, so I'm having fun here.

627
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,280
What a coincidence.

628
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,240
Someone just sent me an anonymous text

629
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,040
saying a student from our school is hanging out in this internet cafe.

630
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,110
Why is Principal Fu here?

631
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:03,900
How would I know?

632
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,760
I was just eating nearby with my wife and kid.

633
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,800
That student is really unlucky.

634
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,060
Come on. Let's catch him red-handed.

635
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,380
Principal Fu.

636
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,600
What now?

637
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,650
You...

638
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,280
Just watch for my cue.

639
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,740
Stay sharp.

640
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,110
Where are you going?

641
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,860
About that speech at school,

642
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,150
I want to think about it some more.

643
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,190
Didn't you turn me down last time?

644
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,780
Did you change your mind?

645
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,700
What? What is it?

646
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,550
How can this kid be so reckless?

647
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,500
Is this a flyer?

648
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,670
I don't even play this stuff.

649
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,130
Stop!

650
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:02,800
You walk so fast.

651
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,430
Why do you look so familiar?

652
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,280
Are you from No. 7 High?

653
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,510
Yeah. No.

654
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,840
You changed your words.

655
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,960
Spill it.

656
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,960
Which grade, and which class?

♫  In a dark room  ♫

667
00:43:14,835 --> 00:43:18,790

♫  Every intertwined trail of footprints  ♫

671
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:38,775
♫  Is the journey we take towards each other  ♫

672
00:43:38,775 --> 00:43:42,250

678
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:16,481
♫  I try to open my arms  ♫

679
00:44:16,481 --> 00:44:20,282
♫  Because I'm certain of this love  ♫

680
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:23,304

682
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:34,220
♫  There's a figure approaching  ♫

683
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:40,801
♫  I know it must be you   ♫

♫  I try to open my arms  ♫
