♫  One, two, three, four  ♫

18
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,000
   

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,030
   

20
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,420
- You've graduated? 
 - Yeah.

21
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,360
If you've graduated, there's no problem..

22
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,420
By the way, which university are you at now?

23
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,110
Carleton College in the UK.

24
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,470
- Carleton College? 
 - Yes, yes.

25
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,390
Is that a real college?

26
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,980
It is!

27
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,730
A prestigious newcomer actually.

28
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,710
- Really? 
  - Yes.

29
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,910
All right, I won't keep you.

30
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,700
Thank you, sir.

31
00:02:12,412 --> 00:02:13,660
What happened here?

32
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,430
Such a mess on the floor!

33
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,240
I don't play here anyway.

34
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,670
You should go.

35
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,190
- Cute panda. 
 - Very engaging.

36
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,880
Why am I here?

37
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,168
Looking for someone.

38
00:02:27,168 --> 00:02:29,300
- Right! I'm leaving then! 
 - Okay.

39
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,830
No problem.

40
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,090
Now, where is that kid?

41
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,910
Let's go.

42
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,960
- Let me take that off for you. 
 - No way!

43
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,060
This is my disguise! What if Principal Fu turns around and comes after me again?

44
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,010
What would I do then?

45
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,090
They got the culprits.

46
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,360
Hurry and go.

47
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,550
I'm not leaving, Master!

48
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,940
I want to protect the beautiful world of Azeroth together!

49
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,320
Seriously, go home!

50
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,670
If my sister catches me, she'll lambaste me again.

51
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,640
Then I'll share the blame with you.

52
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,430
Keep this up, and I'm calling your parents.

53
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,890
Give me your parent's number.

54
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,040
No need for that!

55
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,410
I'll head home after I finish my noodles.

56
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:35,670
Master, listen. From now on, I'm changing my name to "Master's Defender"!

57
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,430
Call yourself whatever you want.

58
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,660
Just stop calling me "Master" 24/7!

59
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,370
Seriously, you're killing me!

60
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,860
You're pretty much dead already.

61
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,800
What now? You?

62
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,690
I... You're dead meat!

63
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,830
Sis... Sister!

64
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,110
Let's just talk this out! Don't hit him.

65
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,640
Senior Brother Lin! This is family business, stay out of it.

66
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,600
You're dead meat.

67
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,490
You're coming home with me. Right now.

68
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,260
Easy! Stop hitting me.

69
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,430
Don't hit my master!

70
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,800
Hit me if you have to!

71
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,040
You're not even an official employee at Roller Blast.

72
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,110
Why are you working so hard?

73
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,810
You don't even take New Year's off?

74
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,040
Well, I'll let it slide this time since it's New Year's.

75
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,030
You can insult my master, but never Roller Blast!

76
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,270
No, you can't insult him either!

77
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:23,240
I've never seen a designer who understands users better than he does.

78
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,440
But you treat him like he's nobody!

79
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,470
It's not that bad...

80
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,270
Master says, Roller Blast is going mobile one day.

81
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,790
It'll be even more popular then.

82
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,420
Easy, don't use 'flag' so casually.

83
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,200
Master, I've decided!

84
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,960
My new alias is... Flag!

85
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,200
Flag?

86
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,910
Why does that sound so familiar...

87
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,960
What are you smiling about?

88
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,710
You think it sounds familiar, too, don't you?

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,470
No, I just think it's a little corny.

90
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,810
But honestly, it does match the game on that flyer.

91
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,790
 The winner of the Best Designer Award 

92
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,120
 at the 2023 Hangzhou Game Expo, Flag! 

93
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,590
 Please come to the stage to accept your award! 

94
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,640
 This kid used to call me "Master". 

95
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,000
Roller Blast? Mobile version?

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,010
Yes!

97
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,960
It'll get more popular than this?

98
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,440
Okay, enough bragging.

99
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,680
Let's go home.

100
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,390
Remember how I covered for you?

101
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,560
You promised you'd return the favor.

102
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,960
Go ahead, tattle on me.

103
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,270
If I ever get scared, I'll take your last name!

104
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,350
I'm not an informer.

105
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,340
And you already have my last name.

106
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,170
Gu Xuejiao, don't just walk away like that!

107
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,100
You're creeping me out.

108
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,510
Return this for me.

109
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,450
What's going on?

110
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,370
See that? This is what it looks like to run the show.

111
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,130
I'm jealous.

112
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,967
   

113
00:06:13,967 --> 00:06:16,760
   

114
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,560
Coming!

115
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,000
Good morning. I finished three practice tests before I left.

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,740
Go and get some sleep.

117
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,560
What are you doing so early in the morning?

118
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,960
We're doing morning exercises.

119
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,590
Yes, new semester, new vibe.

120
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:55,190
Also, Senior Brother Lin said that morning exercise is good for the brain.

121
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,680
He should exercise more.

122
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,680
Senior Brother Lin has a point.

123
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,440
Wait a second.

124
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,130
One of you is in pajamas, the other in a jacket?

125
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,840
How are you exercising?

126
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,770
Well, Mingze says he wants to go jogging.

127
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,180
Go ahead then.

128
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,580
- I'll see you out. 
 - I pulled an all-nighter.

129
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,120
Are you trying to kill me?

130
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,680
Why'd you come back at this hour anyway?

131
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,890
Just go sweat it out.

132
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,810
Bye-bye.

133
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,220
Good, good.

134
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,250
Easy, Xuejiao, be careful with your back.

135
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,810
Got it. Dad, good night!

136
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,280
Saying good night so early in the morning?

137
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,949
   

138
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:53,280
   

139
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,880
My dear sister!

140
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,470
Gross! Just call me by my name!

141
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,910
Thanks for such an awesome gift.

142
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,440
The latest smartphone!

143
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,270
 Is this a reward from the stock exchange for participants? 

144
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,060
Have fun with it.

145
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,740
Thanks a ton!

146
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,252
This is weird.

147
00:08:17,252 --> 00:08:20,760
Since when does the stock exchange give out fancy gifts to small investors?

148
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,470
What's wrong?

149
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:26,680
Mingze got a phone from the stock exchange.

150
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,590
Jealous?

151
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,200
Not really, it's just a phone.

152
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,710
I've got bigger dreams!

153
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,870
Keep your feet on the ground for now. Sit down.

154
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,990
A bunch of errors again?

155
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,350
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,230
Hurry and fix your mistakes.

157
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,760
Today we're starting the next phase of your study plan.

158
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,990
 [Your Order:  Your order for a phone has been received.  If you are satisfied with it... 

159
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,690
Is A the right answer here?

160
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,560
Gu Xuejiao, even your brother could get this one.

161
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,680
 Mock exam goals and study plan are ready. 

162
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,110
 Second step, apply what you learn 

163
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,800
 and strengthen your memory. 

164
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,160
Relative molecular mass.

165
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,810
Xuejiao.

166
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,510
Starch, polysaccharide, polymer compound.

167
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,980
Chemical formula:

168
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,750
 n.

169
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,560
It can be converted by the liver

170
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,280
into glycogen and triglycerides.

171
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,870
Eat too much starch, you risk heart disease,

172
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,790
and you can gain weight.

173
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,870
Then eat this.

174
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,830
Fructose, monosaccharide.

175
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,920
It has the same formula as glucose.

176
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,040
Both are C6H12O6.

177
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,510
They're isomers of each other.

178
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,680
Moderate intake helps you think better.

179
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,320
Here, eat up.

180
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,060
How do you know so much about health and nutrition?

181
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,200
Trying to make the world a better place.

182
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,980
You're seriously impressive.

183
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,560
If I had to memorize all this, my brain would surely explode.

184
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,350
Xuejiao!

185
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,440
You have snacks!

186
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,580
Thanks!

187
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,960
That's the last bag of this flavor.

188
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,040
I'll restock for you.

189
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,379
How can they be like this?

190
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:09,440
After them!

191
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,790
Hey, you two! Just wait!

192
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,660
Stop running!

193
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,320
Hello? Senior Brother Lin?

194
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,040
What time is our tutorial tonight?

195
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,920
 The tutorial is canceled. 

196
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,690
 Gao Rui just woke up. 

197
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,300
Old Gao!

198
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,260
You're awake.

199
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,590
You are...

200
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,260
You don't recognize me?

201
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,960
Oh, sorry, we'll get out of your way then.

202
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,800
Just kidding.

203
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,710
Come on, man.

204
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,740
Still no sense of humor, right?

205
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,680
Nurse, are there any post-op side effects we should be aware of?

206
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,110
What should we watch out for during his recovery?

207
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,830
And when will he be able to go home?

208
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,990
Why not just ask her to create

209
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:14,920
a full post-op care slideshow for you?

210
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,260
You really think this nurse has time for that?

211
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,630
How are you feeling?

212
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,090
I'm fine; feeling much better.

213
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,200
 Three, two, three, four. 

214
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,280
 Five, six, seven, eight. 

215
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,040
 Senior Brother Gao, just focus on getting better. 

216
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,430
 Make yourself at home in the hospital. 

217
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,092
 Three, four, five, six... 

218
00:11:41,092 --> 00:11:43,200
 Most people want patients 

219
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,280
 to get out of here quickly, right? 

220
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,960
 I really need to get discharged, 

221
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,470
 so I can get back to tutoring you two. 

222
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,140
That would be the real disaster.

223
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,040
 Senior Brother Gao, can you maybe stay 

224
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,160
 in the hospital a little longer? 

225
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,470
 I understand. 

226
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,980
 You're worried that if I get discharged, Senior Brother Lin won't keep tutoring you. 

227
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,490
 My number one client's been poached! 

228
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,160
 Relax. I'm just an occasional drop-in student. 

229
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,830
 At best, a potential client. 

230
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,110
 Your loyal customer Gu Mingze 

231
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,310
 is and will always be your ball and chain. 

232
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,180
 Massage the Sibai acupuncture point. 

233
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,510
 One, two, three, four, 

234
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,590
 ive, six, seven, eight. 

235
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,732
So, after class today...

236
00:12:30,732 --> 00:12:32,510
I've got plans.

237
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,530
With who?

238
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,000
Do I have to tell you everything?

239
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,230
I want to come, too.

240
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,480
You sure about that?

241
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,080
I'm going to a tutorial.

242
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,770
You want to come?

243
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,410
I'm in.

244
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,030
Finish this then.

245
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,630
Just kill me now.

246
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,410
Tell me the truth. Were you worried I'd never wake up?

247
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:17,310
Just sitting home every single day, drowning your sorrows in joke books?

248
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:21,080
But with all these hospital visits, do you even have time for experiments?

249
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,920
Fried chicken!

250
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,710
That's not for you.

251
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:30,550
You just had surgery, stick to a bland diet for now.

252
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,310
I'm fed up with rice porridge and pickles.

253
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:45,990
I've been in here for ages.

254
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,920
Did you guys pay the bills for me?

255
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,320
Relax.

256
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,460
Your bills won't break me.

257
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,160
I won the lottery. No joke.

258
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,820
That's too wild even for you.

259
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,590
Nobody's buying that.

260
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,470
You never stop talking even when you're eating, do you?

261
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:07,760
But honestly, seeing you this energetic... I feel relieved.

262
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,400
I have to run to tutoring.

263
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,440
I'll be back to see you tomorrow.

264
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,560
Wait, something's off.

265
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,870
Since when did you like fried chicken?

266
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,590
Who's it for, then?

267
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,990
Your hopeless tutee's little sis.

268
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,400
Why does she get fried chicken and I don't?

269
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,920
Are you secretly charging her or something?

270
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,660
Shouldn't he be going to the lab?

271
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,040
 Gao Rui, don't worry about the lab for now. 

272
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,240
 Just focus on getting better. 

273
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,670
 We'll be waiting for you to bounce back. 

274
00:14:38,696 --> 00:14:41,590
Does "we" include Lin Zhihua?

275
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:47,550
Professor Tan, your researcher is turning into a top-notch tutor!

276
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,800
Hey, Senior Brother Gao.

277
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,590
I just found out Professor Tan

278
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,200
thought something was off with Old Lin.

279
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,230
He booted him from the lab months ago.

280
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,440
 The thing is, C1's our project. 

281
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,230
 I can't finish it without him. 

282
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,680
So I need to get him back ASAP.

283
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,160
Then go talk to Professor Tan.

284
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,920
I don't even know him.

285
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,010
That's a bit much to ask.

286
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:19,710
Look, you managed to talk him into being your tutor.

287
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,780
And even though I have no idea how you pulled that off,

288
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:27,040
I bet you can help with this, too.

289
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,540
Me?

290
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,040
 The real problem right now 

291
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,280
 is that Professor Tan thinks Old Lin is not his normal self. 

292
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,040
 But Professor Tan surely wants his star student 

293
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,040
 back in the lab more than anyone. 

294
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,830
 So really, we have to get Lin back on his game. 

295
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,140
 He's just never gotten past that mental block. 

296
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,160
 He doesn't say so, but I know that deep down 

297
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,760
 he still blames himself for what happened. 

298
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,510
 Ten years from now, Lin Zhihua is stuck in management 

299
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,470
 instead of engineering. 

300
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,560
 Is that all because of that accident? 

301
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,440
 The world needs one more brilliant engineer, 

302
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,680
 not another corporate suit. 

303
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,960
   

304
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,560
 I took psychology as an elective in college. 

305
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,920
 Hopefully this will spark some ideas. 

306
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,470
 Just the conclusion. 
   

307
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,830
 Skip the methodology? 

308
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:36,380
So straight-up geniuses are just built differently.

309
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,080
Senior Brother Lin.

310
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,920
About that alumni speech, are you going or not?

311
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,960
My head teacher cornered me today and asked me,

312
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,920
your outstanding junior, to invite you, our star alum

313
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,030
back to the campus to give us a pre-exam pep talk.

314
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,840
 Step one for beating PTSD: 

315
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:13,010
 Return to where it began and own that stage again. 

316
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,710
I don't have time.

317
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:20,150
You don't need to worry one bit about missing our tutorial sessions.

318
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,820
It has nothing to do with you.

319
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,620
Come on, give it some more consideration.

320
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,510
So many of us are looking forward to it.

321
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,550
Hi. Is order 1162 ready?

322
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,270
Coming right up.

323
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,600
- Thanks. 
 - Thank you.

324
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,270
So all that was just for a delivery order?

325
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,310
Such pretty latte art, too bad

326
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,960
the customer won't even get to see it.

327
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,270
So you see?

328
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,190
You don't have that craftsman's spirit.

329
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,270
Yes, well.

330
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,710
Not everyone can be like you, Senior Brother Lin.

331
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,310
Seriously, don't you think working here

332
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,790
is just making latte art for takeout coffee?

333
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,940
- Meaning? 
 - Such a waste!

334
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,440
Get back to your homework.

335
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,580
I...

336
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,230
You promised me you'd get him here, no matter what!

337
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,680
You said for sure Lin Zhihua would show up!

338
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,790
Now you're telling me he can't make it?

339
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,400
So who's going to give the speech now?

340
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,440
Should I cancel the whole thing?

341
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,550
Director, calm down.

342
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,470
Have some water first.

343
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:52,920
At the time, Xuejiao swore to me that Lin Zhihua would come.

344
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,510
And I admit, I probably just trusted her too much.

345
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,020
Well...

346
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,680
You know, Xiao Lin's gotten a bit full of himself recently.

347
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,570
Absolutely.

348
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,440
Principal Fu.

349
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,230
Speak of the devil!

350
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,600
Shouldn't talk about people behind their backs.

351
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,660
You're right, here he is.

352
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,400
   

353
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Hello, everyone.

354
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,450
I'm Lin Zhihua.

355
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:29,210
Coming back to No.7 High today, my mission is simple:

356
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,340
help every one of you get into your dream colleges.

357
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,180
And I know everyone here today has amazing potential. 
    

358
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,350
So next, I ill explain what worked for me.

359
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,840
Back in high school, we all differentiated courses 
    

360
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,250
as either memorization or understanding. 
    

361
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:51,550
Let's take science as an example.

362
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:55,020
Most of you probably think it's all about understanding concepts.

363
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,440
But that's not the whole story.

364
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,640
Physics... 
    

365
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,550
You may think it's all about understanding.

366
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,110
Look, everyone's taking pictures.

367
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,960
But honestly, memorizing formulas is where you start.

368
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,340
Only then can you wield them like tools.

369
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,140
Help me take a picture when this is over, okay?

370
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,680
Okay, okay.

371
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:30,750
Three, two, one... cheese!

372
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,930
- Take one for me too! 
 - Me too!

373
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,120
- Thanks! 
 - Thank you!

374
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,400
All right. 
    

375
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,510
Three, two, one... Cheese!

376
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,550
Come on, Senior Brother Lin.

377
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,380
Me too! I want one!

378
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,920
Last one, girls. Senior Brother Lin is really busy.

379
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,256
Three, two, one.

380
00:20:48,256 --> 00:20:49,209
- All done, Senior Brother Lin. 
 - Thank you.

381
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:52,400
- Come on, let's go. 
 - Senior, do you have a written version of those study tips?

382
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,120
- Can I get a copy? 
 -  Me too! I want one! 

383
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,160
- The school's posting it... 
 - You'll all get it.

384
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,230
Senior Brother Lin's got other things to do now, so let's wrap it up.

385
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,750
Senior, could you repeat that book list?

386
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,400
Yes, please!

387
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,470
- I've got the list! 
 - I've got it!

388
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,840
- I have the list! 
 - Check the school forum!

389
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,230
Everyone, time to go! 
    

390
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,990
Senior, this is for you.

391
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,160
Thank you for the speech.

392
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,680
I bought these especially for you.

393
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,790
I'm a huge fan of your teaching style.

394
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,680
I also heard you're my sister's tutor.

395
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,220
Small world, huh?

396
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,890
Your sister?

397
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,680
Yes. Our families are distant relatives.

398
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,640
Plus, Auntie Si Tong has been our housekeeper for years.

399
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,560
I call her Auntie, so Xuejiao is basically like a real little sister to me.

400
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,750
She told me Xuejiao has recently found a really dedicated tutor.

401
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,990
I'm so jealous.

402
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,880
Senior Brother,

403
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,550
could you tutor me, too?

404
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,880
My parents will pay double your rate.

405
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,750
Housekeeper?

406
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,990
Hold on!

407
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,660
No way! That's not happening...

408
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,710
Sorry.

409
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,360
Seriously, Xuejiao?

410
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,740
Just because your family's tight on cash means no one else gets tutoring?

411
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,360
You just can't see the big picture.

412
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,990
Someone like Senior Brother Lin, so noble, so above it all,

413
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,470
he sees money as nothing.

414
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,770
Who thinks he'd care about money?

415
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,840
You just don't get it.

416
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,390
Right, Senior Brother?

417
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,320
Look,

418
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,390
it's clear you're talented, and very smart.

419
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,600
But the first mock exam is less than a month away.

420
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,310
Having one student is already hard enough for me.

421
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,040
I can't handle two.

422
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,140
- But... 
 - With less than a month left,

423
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:38,360
we really can't waste time on some irrelevant people.

424
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,270
Let's go, excuse us. Coming through.

425
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,960
 Senior! Senior Lin! 

426
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,470
She's got no shame.

427
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,770
What's the big deal?

428
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,085
   

429
00:22:48,085 --> 00:22:50,870
 This mock exam is your first major checkpoint, 

430
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,160
 your trial run before the real battle. 

431
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,880
 When you wake up, don't jump up. 

432
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,800
 Stay still for 30 seconds, 

433
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,420
 let your blood reach your waking brain and body. 

434
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,320
♫  Block out the ridicule from outsiders  ♫

435
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:08,260
 Healthy mouth and gut bacteria... 

436
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,270
 keep your system balanced and steady. 

437
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:13,694
 This helps you get into test mode quickly. 

438
00:23:13,694 --> 00:23:15,990
 Holotropic breathing is considered 

439
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,030
 one of the best methods to ease pre-test anxiety. 

440
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,300
 Take three deep breaths. 

441
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,010
 It lets you step back from the stress briefly. 

442
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,020
♫  If there are no second chances in life  ♫

443
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,960
♫  Then now is the last chance  ♫

444
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,575
   

445
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,960
   

446
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,760
♫  No more invasions of laziness  ♫

447
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,180
♫  There is no secret manual to life, so let's ignite it  ♫

448
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:41,800
   

449
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,470
What?

450
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,830
Getting nervous about your scores now?

451
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,620
Here she comes! She's here!

452
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,270
Everyone is excited, right?

453
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:40,030
Mock exam results are in, along with rankings.

454
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:43,870
I'll call names; collect your score sheets when you hear your name.

455
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,360
Qi Lei.

456
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,340
Ranked 293rd in the year.

457
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,750
Yi Tianyu. 427th in the year.

458
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,680
Qi Lei, grab mine.

459
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,880
I'll take his, ma'am.

460
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,280
Thanks.

461
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,252
This student didn't do badly at all.

462
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:03,840
- Xi Junyang. 
 - Here!

463
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,730
Ranked 193rd.

464
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,280
Keep up the hard work.

465
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,240
Gu Xuejiao.

466
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:24,420
Zhou Shiyun. 9th in the 12th grade!

467
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,540
Thank you, sir.

468
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,790
Liu Yanbin.

469
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,710
13th in the year.

470
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:35,420
You're incredible!

471
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,920
I wonder if she made it into the top 100.

472
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:45,400
If that dork made it, I'll eat my hat.

473
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,380
I wonder how she did...

474
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,345
Ask her!

475
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:54,920
Xuejiao,

476
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,230
listen, it's totally normal not to score high on these tests.

477
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,600
It's okay. Don't stress.

478
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,260
Your mom will ask Uncle Zhou to pull some strings,

479
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,630
or maybe switch schools.

480
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,630
Look at her!

481
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,710
   

482
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,870
You ranked 99th! (in all classes)

483
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,640
Am I seeing this right?

484
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,750
- Impressive, huh? 
 - You're amazing!

485
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,600
All right, we're going out to eat tonight!

486
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,120
Eat what?

487
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,270
What should we eat?

488
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,160
Let her choose.

489
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,270
Hmmm, I want hotpot!

490
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,620
You got it!

491
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,560
Tianyu, play some basketball?

492
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,780
- Not today. 
 - What's wrong?

493
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,420
Too much manga will rot your...

494
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:52,250
Am I seeing things, or have you completely lost it? Reading a textbook?

495
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,790
Give this to the team.

496
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,250
This scrap of paper? Why bother?

497
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,200
   

498
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,790
What?

499
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,990
Quitting?

500
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,680
I have to focus on studying now.

501
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,000
What's gotten into you?

502
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,490
Didn't you always say you'd rather dig ditches than study?

503
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,230
Between 99 and 427,

504
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,720
there is a difference of 27 teams.

505
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,860
You're right.

506
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,620
I've got to start closing the gap between her and me.

507
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,110
Now you sound like me.

508
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:43,210
I got through every test with this.

509
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,320
But I won't need it anymore.

510
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,060
I'm passing it on to you.

511
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,920
Put it to good use.

512
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:59,580
Better not. I am bottom-ten material for now.

513
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,840
If I actually use it,

514
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,290
I'll inherit your "dead last" title.

515
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,780
Life doesn't just consist of dreams.

516
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,710
Your future won't fight for itself.

517
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,580
You're hopeless.

518
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,530
Coming through!

519
00:28:20,552 --> 00:28:21,510
   

520
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:26,000
I can't believe you'd come to tell Old Gao after getting your scores.

521
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,430
Of course, he is our matchmaker.

522
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,540
What?

523
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:34,960
M... M...

524
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,970
M... Middleman, right?

525
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,920
Watch your words.

526
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,012
Excuse me. That patient...

527
00:28:50,012 --> 00:28:52,000
 Three, two, one. 

528
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,690
I don't know.

529
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,920
Hello?

530
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,990
- What? 
 - What's wrong?

531
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:06,510
Gao Rui is going out for a test drive.

532
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,520
- What's going on? 
 - Gao...

533
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,860
Sir, Senior Brother Gao insisted on testing

534
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,070
to see if that last accident would happen again.

535
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:29,200
 So you've been his sidekick since college, Assistant Lin? 

536
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,750
Old Gao! The system's still buggy!

537
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,020
Are you trying to crash twice?

538
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,930
That was just a freak accident.

539
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,200
I'm not backing down.

540
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,840
It's a one-in-ten-thousand chance it would happen again.

541
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,690
- Old Gao, listen to me... 
 - Right now, you're off the team.

542
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,930
What gives you the right to stop me?

543
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:45,340
I don't want to watch you die, okay!

544
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,960
I keep reviewing what happened.

545
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,470
It's not a probability issue.

546
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,340
Our test system's compatibility with

547
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,070
the environmental simulation settings aren't good enough.

548
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,470
It led to a stack overflow, which crashed the whole thing.

549
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,750
If you want back in, wait until I've fixed the bugs, deal?

550
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,730
How long will it take?

551
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,960
Old Lin, I just knew it, you're stalling again.

552
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,030
The hospital just notified me that I only have a 10% chance

553
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,130
of recovering through rehab.

554
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:23,640
Maybe it would've been better if I'd just died in that car.

555
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,070
Let's go.

556
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,470
Now. He can debug right now!

557
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,180
Who are you?

558
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,210
Who's that?

559
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,780
You're asking me to debug right here and now?

560
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,840
Whether you're helping Senior Gao out with the project or tutoring me,

561
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,120
haven't you always been working on your debugging plans?

562
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,030
That's not true.

563
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,990
Then, why are you always glued to your laptop?

564
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,890
Binge-watching TV dramas?

565
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,170
Let's go, start the car.

566
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:55,650
Senior Brother Gao, don't do anything stupid!

567
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,440
Give me ten minutes.

568
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,260
Just ten minutes.

569
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,200
 Hello. 

570
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,400
 I need your help. 

571
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,960
 Hello. 

572
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,720
 What are you working on? 

573
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,400
 Cut to the chase. 

574
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,400
 Don't stand so close. 

575
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,880
 Make a conditional sentence. 

576
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:48,270
 My amount of exercise is at my limit. 

577
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,960
 - Starch is? 
 - Polysaccharide. 

578
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,020
 And monosaccharides? 

579
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:54,530
 Ribose, glucose, fructose, and galactose. 

580
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,020
All done.

581
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,540
But this is just a model for now.

582
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,590
It needs a lot of testing and experiments before...

583
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,480
Professor?

584
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,610
You guys...

585
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,680
Professor.

586
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,040
Your vacation is about over.

587
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:27,990
Professor, Lin Zhihua from C1 Lab, Jinghai University,

588
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,020
is requesting reinstatement.

589
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:34,080
Request approved.

590
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,070
You tricked me!

591
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,160
Actually, before I was overthinking it.

592
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,920
A new perspective cleared things up.

593
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,820
And it's all thanks to you, Professor,

594
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,410
for making me take a break and do odd jobs.

595
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,250
It helped me find a new solution.

596
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,510
Senior Brother Lin,

597
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,480
you have no idea how hard I worked to get you back on the team.

598
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,750
How are you going to thank me for this huge favor?

599
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:14,080
I was already planning to go back regardless.

600
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,440
How were we supposed to know?

601
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,300
Anyway, I've been worrying about you nonstop.

602
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,300
And I heard from Senior Brother Gao that you hit the lottery.

603
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,400
Shouldn't you give me a little something?

604
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,680
Doesn't have to be something fancy.

605
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:34,320
Just a nice top-100 celebration gift, how does that sound?

606
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,870
Okay.

607
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,410
50 sets of mock exams from the last five years.

608
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,890
How does that sound?

609
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,630
Make it a hundred!

610
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,230
- Pick something else! 
 - Something else?

611
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:49,210
- How about I give you a quiz? 
 - That's even worse!

612
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,750
 - Old Gao, listen to me... 
 - Right now, you're off the team. 

613
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:03,170
 - What gives you the right to stop me? 
 - I don't want to watch you die, okay! 

614
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,670
 You're asking me to debug right here and now? 

615
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,620
 Whether you're helping Senior Gao out with the project or tutoring me, 

616
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:24,867
 haven't you always been working on your debugging plans? 

617
00:34:24,867 --> 00:34:25,960
 That's not true. 

618
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,990
 Then why are you always glued to your laptop? 

619
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:29,490
 Binge-watching TV dramas? 

620
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,360
 What's happening? 

621
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,750
 Don't panic, just hit the call button! 

622
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:05,060
 I once believed that I controlled my own destiny. 

623
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,760
 Whether using a remote to control toy cars when I was a kid, 

624
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,750
 or effortlessly mastering exams. 

625
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,800
 I could precisely score 59 in every subject, deliberately failing. 

626
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,200
 This control thrilled me more than perfect scores. 

627
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:28,340
 In entrepreneurship, victories came so easily. 

628
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:32,960
 What I valued most were my brothers-in-arms. 

629
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,620
 No, comrades. 

630
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,490
 But years later, 

631
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:41,190
 at my best friend's funeral, 

632
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:46,510
 I suddenly realized destiny was never mine to command. 

633
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,760
 Sometimes, it mocks me. 

634
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,900
 The more I tighten my grip, the less I have to hold. 

635
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,110
 Gao Rui. 

636
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:59,030
 Time of death: September 5, 2014 

637
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:01,770
 10:19:32 p.m. 

638
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:04,720
 When fate chooses to break the arrogant, 

639
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,880
 it requires nothing but a flick of its wrist. 

640
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:11,320
 Then someone told me, that's not true. 

641
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,810
 Why are you so afraid to die? 

642
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:17,880
 Someone told me, as long as you're alive, 

643
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,520
 you always have the chance to start again. 

644
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,850
 Hey. 

645
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,540
 You're blocking my view. 

646
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,400
 What did you say? 

647
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,370
 I said, you're blocking my view of the scenery. 

648
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:11,150
 You know, I sent out 17 resumes this summer. 

649
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:14,230
 But my college isn't very good, so no one wanted me. 

650
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,920
 17 directly rejected. 

651
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,070
 And I never even thought about giving up. 

652
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,400
 So what's got you so stuck? 

653
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,790
 Not getting an internship isn't the end of the world. 

654
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,940
 Who said I was giving up? 

655
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,030
 Then, why are you sitting up there? 

656
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,920
 Getting ready to swim? 

657
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:47,400
 Nothing should take over your entire life. 

658
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,190
 So you know, no matter what happens, 

659
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,630
 it's not worth giving up your life for. 

660
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,460
 Baby. 

661
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,630
 As long as you're alive, you always have the chance to start again. 

662
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,790
 I wish you a long, long life. 

663
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,530
As long as you're alive...

664
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,420
   

665
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:49,580
   

666
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:09,470
   
   

667
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,580
     
   

668
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,980
   
   

669
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,190
 This time, 

670
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:12,280
 I've returned to before it all began. 

671
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,150
 Is this fate messing with me again, 

672
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:18,030
 or a second chance to turn it all around? 

673
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:30,050
 Gao Rui. Time of death: September 5, 2014. 

674
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,400
 So sad... He and Senior Brother Lin were best friends. 

675
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,770
 Senior Lin hasn't been the same since. 

676
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,470
 Don't distract the genius while he's reviewing the incident. 

677
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,630
 What? 

678
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,380
 You couldn't find it either? 

679
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:56,200
   

680
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,220
Hello?

681
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:09,490
Old Gao?

682
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:13,740
 What's up? You're missing me already? 

683
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,510
What nonsense are you spouting?

684
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,340
Now, listen carefully.

685
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:26,070
We have to cancel today's road test.

686
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:28,150
Something bad could happen.

687
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:30,590
All-nighter debugging has you hallucinating?

688
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:33,400
Wait, how did you know?

689
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,030
Doesn't matter. Just listen to me, the test must be canceled.

690
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,880
We can always reschedule. Okay?

691
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,510
Come on, we've done this before.

692
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,920
Besides, we're against the clock.

693
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,470
At least give me a real reason.

694
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:45,670
There could be an accident.

695
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,840
Is that enough?

696
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,590
Seriously, Old Lin, since when have you, Mr. Stoic,

697
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,767
 actually started doing dark humor? 

698
00:41:51,767 --> 00:41:53,590
I'm being serious!

699
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:55,994
Old Lin, what's wrong with you today?

700
00:41:55,994 --> 00:41:57,920
 Don't worry. I've got this. 

701
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,990
 The professor and experts are all here. 

702
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:01,440
 Hello, professors and experts, I'm Lin Zhihua's partner. 

703
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,280
- My name is Gao Rui. 
 - Gao Rui handles all the testing,

704
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,500
both online and offline.

705
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,760
As for Lin Zhihua, he's responsible

706
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,990
for motor systems development and the core architecture.

707
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,320
Old Lin will be here any minute.

708
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,070
Professor Tan, we're ready for testing at your command.

709
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:16,190
Proceed whenever you want.

710
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,720
Understood.

711
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,220
Gao Rui!

712
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:50,030
