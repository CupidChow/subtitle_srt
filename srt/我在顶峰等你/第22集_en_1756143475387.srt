1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Try to grow the flowers in the summer

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now tell the truth about life

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's not complicated to count the flowers

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The youth is swaying

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We are getting stronger

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My heart is still hot and boiling

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Follow the rhythm and release it gently

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The night sky is brightening, only the fireflies are blocking

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will fly bravely with you

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My love is still hot and boiling

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Shining in the smile

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let us cross the barrier of time

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We can't just ask now.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
In the car program diary, there are all the car's operating records.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If we check it, we will know.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is what I think is more troublesome.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The company's server was just in that time.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So the diary of the accident of Yi Tianyu has been lost.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But this kind of operation requires a lot of technical support.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This Mr. Yi is a financial person. How did he do it?

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
If this accident is not an accident, but a human accident,

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Then there must be people who know technology in Huachuang.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Can technical failure help people?

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Let's stop this first.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
How can we stop? The accident statement meeting is the day after tomorrow.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
They blocked the best crisis public relations time of 72 hours.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
They must want to win the game at the accident meeting.

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
By then, there is really no chance of turning the tables.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Everyone, wait for my news. I will go out for a breath.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He was hit by the bank.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You still don't know him.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Do you think this is really Yi Tianyu's own doing?

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
His own doing?

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Making car accident?

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What do you think?

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't know. So I am very confused now.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But if it really is Yi Tianyu, then he is probably after me.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Then I have more responsibility to solve this matter.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Never blame the victim.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What you need to do now

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
is to sleep and rest.

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Then you,

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
do you believe me?

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Believe that we can overcome this difficult situation together.

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Then of course.

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It is the same every time before.

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This time, we will surely overcome this difficult situation.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Don't think about it anymore.

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I will definitely overcome this difficult situation.

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,800
Don't think about it.

53
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,840
The antidote needs to be taken carefully.

54
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,600
This matter

55
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,760
can't be delayed for too long.

56
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,480
You're so heavy.

57
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,200
Xue Jiao.

58
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,000
Xue Jiao.

59
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,400
I, Qi Lei,

60
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,720
only know that Gu Xue Jiao

61
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,360
is always talking about Xue Jiao.

62
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,480
Xue Jiao.

63
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,040
I heard that Yi Tian Yu is out of the hospital.

64
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,920
I'm here to see him.

65
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,640
Uncle Yi told me that he lives here.

66
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,480
That's great.

67
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,200
He's a big shot.

68
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,800
I didn't even park my car properly.

69
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,040
I'll go down and park my car.

70
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,080
Come on, you can do it.

71
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,360
Come on, be careful.

72
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,440
Be careful.

73
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:57,880
Be careful.

74
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,800
There's a roof.

75
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,400
Come on.

76
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,120
Be careful.

77
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,840
Okay.

78
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,480
How did you get so drunk just after you left the hospital?

79
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,120
Give me another bottle.

80
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,440
Okay.

81
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,080
Yi Tian Yu.

82
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,600
Yi Tian Yu.

83
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,240
Although the program log of the server cloud end

84
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,280
has been lost,

85
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,560
it can still leave a message

86
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,160
in his phone.

87
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,400
It's the same as last time.

88
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,560
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,440
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,320
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,200
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,120
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,960
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,800
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,720
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,600
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,440
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,720
It's the same as last time.

99
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,520
His password

100
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,040
is also my birthday.

101
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,680
You're quite skilled at typing passwords.

102
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Your leg is better.

103
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,160
You're lying to me.

104
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,720
We're the same.

105
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,920
You came to me

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,840
to cheat me, right?

107
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,720
What are you looking for?

108
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,840
I'll help you.

109
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,160
I want to know the truth about CR accident.

110
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,320
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

111
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,480
It's gone.

112
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,720
The game hasn't started yet.

113
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,040
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

114
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,080
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

115
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

116
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,240
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

117
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,520
The game hasn't started yet.

118
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,840
You're in such a hurry to leave.

119
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,480
Your game should be over.

120
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,320
I'm going to call the police now.

121
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,600
You...

122
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,960
Why are you calling the police?

123
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,720
You said my leg got better too fast, right?

124
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,520
You're the one who's leading the CR accident.

125
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,920
How can you wrong me?

126
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,880
I'm the victim.

127
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,880
Ling Zhihua is the victim, right?

128
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,640
She's the victim.

129
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,840
But the victim is me.

130
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Are you crazy?

131
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,040
Open the door.

132
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,920
The CR accident I drove

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,960
was a car accident.

134
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,560
There's no reason for it to happen now.

135
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,880
You're leaving like this.

136
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,560
Aren't you afraid

137
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,480
the same problem

138
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,760
will happen to the CR victims?

139
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,920
The switch is here.

140
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,600
You only have to walk out today.

141
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,680
The slide will no longer be

142
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,360
a simple face-to-face event.

143
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,360
Can you bear to see those innocent people

144
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,560
get hurt because of your choice?

145
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,680
Yi Qianyu.

146
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,320
You're not that kind of person.

147
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,440
Am I?

148
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,040
I'll know once I try it.

149
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,800
You can try it.

150
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,160
I'll keep these for you.

151
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,080
Do you know

152
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,680
how many laws you've violated?

153
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,000
It's all because of you.

154
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,680
You don't cooperate with me at all.

155
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:18,880
I've already

156
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,480
reported it to Ling Zhihua for you.

157
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,320
It's enough for you to know

158
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
how to deal with it.

159
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,680
I'm not going to let you go.

160
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,880
I'm not going to let you go.

161
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,160
I'm not going to let you go.

162
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,360
I'm not going to let you go.

163
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,680
I'm not going to let you go.

164
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,880
I'm not going to let you go.

165
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,520
You're very considerate.

166
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,720
Where are you staying tonight?

167
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,200
I only have one bedroom.

168
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,880
If you're worried,

169
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,520
you can sleep on the sofa.

170
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,240
This is my house.

171
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,800
Can you lock me in?

172
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,320
Stop looking.

173
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,800
There's nothing in there.

174
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,600
I'm not going to let you go.

175
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,960
I'm not going to let you go.

176
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,280
I'm not going to let you go.

177
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,600
I'm not going to let you go.

178
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,880
I'm not going to let you go.

179
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,680
Mr. Long is there.

180
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,520
Crippled隻子

181
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,600
Crippled隻子

182
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,040
Crippled隻子

183
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,320
He has to call someone.

184
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,800
I'm out of here.

185
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,760
I have an appointment

186
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,880
Hello, are youova Xiao Liu?

187
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,400
Do you need me number?

188
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,340
When I got a call,

189
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,360
has police captain Pang come down from the window?

190
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,420
Is this...

191
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,300
I'm sorry.

192
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,700
Siqi is here?

193
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,660
What's wrong?

194
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,980
Siqi asked for a long vacation.

195
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,620
Xue Xiao must know where she lives.

196
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,380
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is power off.

197
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,300
Hello, auntie.

198
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,500
Can you let Xue Xiao answer the phone?

199
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,820
Xue Xiao?

200
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,860
Xue Xiao hasn't been back recently.

201
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,340
What's wrong with her?

202
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,780
It's okay, auntie.

203
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,900
I remembered it wrong.

204
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,860
Xue Xiao came to the company early in the morning.

205
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,100
I'm sorry.

206
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,220
I'm sorry.

207
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,220
I'm sorry.

208
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,140
I'm sorry.

209
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,060
I'm sorry.

210
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,900
I'm going to bed.

211
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,820
Bye.

212
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,620
Mom,

213
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,500
you'll have surgery tomorrow.

214
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,900
You have to be careful.

215
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,140
I heard from the caretaker that

216
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,580
you slipped a few days ago.

217
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,660
Fortunately, you didn't have to postpone the surgery.

218
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,700
I heard that the doctor who gave me the surgery

219
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,740
flew from overseas.

220
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,900
Isn't it expensive?

221
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,780
You changed my medicine

222
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,860
into imported medicine.

223
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,660
Where did you get so much money?

224
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,140
The company gave me equity

225
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,060
and paid me.

226
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,220
Did Xue Xiao help you

227
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,260
win the money again?

228
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,380
It's that your mother

229
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,340
highlighted the thing.

230
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,740
You have to

231
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,340
repay her well in the future.

232
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,780
I wanted to go home

233
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,660
so that she would take care of me.

234
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,380
But the illness

235
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,460
was too fatal

236
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,780
to get me cured.

237
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,700
Mom, you have to give up your job

238
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,300
for the sake of your salary.

239
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,540
If I didn't betray you...

240
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,300
Mom.

241
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,460
Why are you saying this?

242
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,260
We've searched everywhere we can.

243
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,740
Where else can he go?

244
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,100
There's a place.

245
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,300
Where?

246
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,500
How did you get in?

247
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,140
What's the breakfast?

248
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,540
I'll make it for you.

249
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,180
The COVID-19 program of CR.

250
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,860
The driver's door's security.

251
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,260
You...

252
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,260
You...

253
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,580
You're cruel.

254
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,260
Yin Tianyu!

255
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,860
The fun is about to begin.

256
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,460
Don't forget

257
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,780
what I told you.

258
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,500
Xue Qiao!

259
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,180
Xue Qiao!

260
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,780
You're so rude to others,

261
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,700
Senior Li.

262
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,780
Xue Qiao!

263
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,420
The bedroom is not good.

264
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,340
My girlfriend is in there.

265
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,700
I will go to the bathroom.

266
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,380
Soon, I will knell your answer first.

267
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,740
Boss.

268
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,700
What?

269
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,500
Yes?

270
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:40,980
You've become so evil.

271
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,180
you'll crew up with Shi, so

272
00:16:42,180 --> 00:17:07,380
I gave her a chance to

273
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,820
press off and

274
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,820
It's not convenient to be in the shower and in the shower.

275
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:32,420
At this point, you can still visit my house?

276
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:37,220
If I remember correctly, the time before the accident statement meeting is less than a day and a half.

277
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,820
I have to ask you to remind me.

278
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,520
Since you are here, drink some tea.

279
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,020
I forgot that you don't have any time to drink tea.

280
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,020
After all, you have nothing on your horse.

281
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,020
No, you are the one who reminded me.

282
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:03,220
The college roommate in the school sent me a box of tea that was very good for his hometown.

283
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:07,020
I just don't know where to put it. Once I find it,

284
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,820
I will definitely find you to try it.

285
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,420
Okay, I have a chance.

286
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,820
Yi Tianyu!

287
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,820
Don't make another mistake.

288
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,820
The tea in the bathroom is not good to drink.

289
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:42,020
You guys forced me to do it.

290
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,820
The roommate in the school sent us tea.

291
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,620
I am the one who sent tea to the school.

292
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,820
Siqi?

293
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,020
U-Pan?

294
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,020
The time before the accident statement meeting is less than a day and a half.

295
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,820
Now all the evidence is still in Yi Tianyu's hands.

296
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,620
Gu Xuejiao, you will definitely think of a way.

297
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,220
Hello, this is Luo sausages?

298
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,900
I am Š 사람 service.

299
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,700
Why did you come here?

300
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,140
Remember the meal you prepared, this is for you.

301
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,540
Thanks, I will definitely come again.

302
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,940
Yeah, you can eat this.

303
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,100
What is wrong?

304
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,100
What's wrong with you?

305
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:01,900
Xueqiao.

306
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:02,460
Xueqiao.

307
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,140
Get out.

308
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,540
Okay.

309
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,580
I'll get out.

310
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,260
You can ask me to do anything.

311
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,340
As long as you don't cry.

312
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,660
What do you want me to say?

313
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,620
No.

314
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,420
Only this.

315
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,260
How about this?

316
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,740
As long as you don't come here,

317
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,340
I'll take you out to play.

318
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,740
He really doesn't eat anything.

319
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,580
You don't have to go to the company.

320
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,700
Just leave it to them.

321
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,100
Anyway,

322
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,860
the makeup is already in my bag.

323
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,660
You are the most important.

324
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,700
I don't like men who are in love.

325
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,060
Okay.

326
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,300
Then I'll handle the company.

327
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,860
I'll let Qi Lei take you there.

328
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,380
Where do you want to go?

329
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,420
I'll go with you.

330
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,940
Give me back my card.

331
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,300
How can I pay you?

332
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,100
How about this?

333
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,420
You use my credit card.

334
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,380
I've already arrived at the accident statement.

335
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,380
Just pretend.

336
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,020
After all, you have to go with me.

337
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,620
You came out on your own.

338
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,220
You can't lose to me.

339
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,220
Now the time is not mature yet.

340
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,980
Although I didn't see him.

341
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,100
I know he must have his own plan.

342
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,900
But I still don't know

343
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,060
what the plan is.

344
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,180
I have to trust him.

345
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,980
Our two goals are the same.

346
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,020
What are we going to do next?

347
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,540
Next.

348
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,540
Next, we have to let everything

349
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,300
go as Yi Tianyu wants.

350
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,780
Only if we cooperate with Yi Tianyu,

351
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,620
we can make the most of Yi Tianyu.

352
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,220
The more we cooperate with Yi Tianyu,

353
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,500
the easier it is for the school

354
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,620
to find flaws in him.

355
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,020
I'm going back to the hotel now.

356
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,860
Just do what you should do

357
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,060
as an air conditioner.

358
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,060
Let's go.

359
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,260
Wait.

360
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,460
I bought something for Tianyu today.

361
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,340
I forgot to pack it up.

362
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,460
It's a little cold recently.

363
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,540
Put it on.

364
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,620
Thank you.

365
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:58,660
Get in the car.

366
00:22:59,260 --> 00:22:59,980
Sit tight.

367
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,420
The past navigation information is deleted.

368
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,860
Which mall do you want to go to?

369
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,660
You can choose.

370
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:14,900
Okay.

371
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,220
初一医院

372
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,020
dementia

373
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,260
Sikui's mom.

374
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,420
Take theror notices.

375
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,380
What are you sayingLAUGHS

376
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:47,900
的人潮

377
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,260
Thank you.

378
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,260
Show me that one.

379
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,580
Okay.

380
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,980
Thank you.

381
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,180
I want both. Thank you.

382
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,700
Can you tell me your phone number?

383
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,780
I'll help you to write down the score.

384
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,460
Okay, thank you.

385
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,060
Your consumption score

386
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,540
has been sent to your phone number.

387
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,700
Let's go shopping.

388
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,140
Go shopping? Why not?

389
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,140
I'm not going shopping.

390
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,140
I'm going to buy some food.

391
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,140
I'm going to buy some food.

392
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,140
I'm going to buy some food.

393
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,540
Let's go shopping. Why not?

394
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,540
Let's go.

395
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,180
You're back.

396
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,340
There's more in the car.

397
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,860
I'll go.

398
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,460
You're

399
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,140
trying to buy something.

400
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,460
What's wrong?

401
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,140
It's hot.

402
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,020
Let's continue tomorrow.

403
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,820
As long as you're happy.

404
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,540
What does she want to tell me?

405
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,140
Okay.

406
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,940
Let's start.

407
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,620
Try it.

408
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,980
I don't know what flavor you like.

409
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,380
So I made you one dish and two dishes.

410
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,140
Is it bad?

411
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,660
Yi Tianyu.

412
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,660
I hope you understand

413
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,660
that everything between you and me

414
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,660
is my personal choice.

415
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,660
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

416
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,460
Not even Ling Zhi Hua.

417
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,060
I should be your target.

418
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,860
Not him.

419
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,860
The reason you played with me for a day

420
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,860
is to annoy me.

421
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,660
I'm not your target.

422
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,660
I'm not your target.

423
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,660
I'm not your target.

424
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,660
You're trying to annoy me.

425
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,180
What a pity.

426
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,180
The more you protect her,

427
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,380
the more I don't want to bother her.

428
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,860
What should I do?

429
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,020
Try it.

430
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,580
I don't know if I

431
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,180
will make you these dishes.

432
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,980
But I'm sure my cooking skills are better than before.

433
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,620
After all, I'm really working hard

434
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,780
to learn how to cook abroad.

435
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,180
Just to have a day like today

436
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,380
to cook for you in person.

437
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,780
What's the last time?

438
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,180
What are you talking about?

439
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,980
I don't understand.

440
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,580
Let me help you recall.

441
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,180
At the door of Jingda Lab.

442
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,380
Who is like you?

443
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,580
Your ex-boyfriend Yi Tian Yu

444
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,180
was always with you.

445
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,580
How do you know Yi Tian Yu

446
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,980
is my ex-boyfriend?

447
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,580
When someone was working,

448
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,580
he didn't do his job.

449
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,180
Wiping the two of their photos.

450
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,180
It's all in the past.

451
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,980
This time,

452
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,780
I've always been

453
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,780
just an ordinary friend of his.

454
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,980
Why do you only talk about the past?

455
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,580
We've all been

456
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,980
people who have lived once again.

457
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,980
I...

458
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,980
I have something to tell you.

459
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,980
If you were him,

460
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,980
and you were taken away,

461
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,980
the only one you have,

462
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,980
would you not hate him?

463
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:42,980
These years,

464
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,180
I've been asking myself,

465
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,180
Yi Tian Yu,

466
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,700
why can't you

467
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,700
work harder

468
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,700
and become better than him?

469
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,700
Then everything

470
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,700
might be different.

471
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,900
Tell me.

472
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,900
Will you?

473
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,500
I like Ling Zhi Hua

474
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,300
because he's not good or good.

475
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,300
We've been together for eight years.

476
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,700
Every day of these eight years,

477
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,700
we've been working hard

478
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,700
to become better.

479
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,700
I don't believe you're making up stories.

480
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,700
But this is the truth.

481
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,700
This time,

482
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,700
you've all changed.

483
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,300
Why are you so determined

484
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,300
that I won't change?

485
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,300
I won't become better.

486
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,300
I won't become

487
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,300
a better person.

488
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,300
I will cherish you more.

489
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,300
You've become better.

490
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,300
Why are you still

491
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,300
holding on to the past?

492
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,300
Really.

493
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,300
Don't go to Meihua

494
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,300
and say you haven't

495
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,300
walked the same path.

496
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,300
Is he really

497
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,300
a low-class person?

498
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,300
This is bad.

499
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,300
I don't care.

500
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,300
Even if he's a bad person,

501
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,300
he's a low-class person,

502
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,300
I want him.

503
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,300
I don't care.

504
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,300
I don't care.

505
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,300
Because in that world,

506
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,300
there's you.

507
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,300
Cheers.

508
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,300
I'll eat it.

509
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,300
It's delicious.

510
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,300
But I want you to eat it with me.

511
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,300
Sorry.

512
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,300
Drink. Drink. Drink.

513
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,300
Drink.

514
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,300
Drink. Drink.

515
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,300
Drink. Drink.

516
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,300
Drink. Drink.

517
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,300
Drink. Drink.

518
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,420
Drink. Drink. Drink.

519
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,520
18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25,

520
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,720
27, 28, 29, 30, 31,

521
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,820
31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36,

522
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,820
38.

523
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,820
38.

524
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,820
38.

525
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,820
Yi Tianyu.

526
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,320
Yi Tianyu.

527
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,540
the shape of the compass.

528
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,540
Put the numbers of each amount

529
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,580
on the nine-point grid keyboard

530
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,460
in order.

531
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,380
The corresponding pinyin

532
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,220
is what the school wants to tell me.

533
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:27,740
Nine, four, one, three, four, one.

534
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,180
Nine, eight, two, six, one.

535
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,700
Nine, four, one, one.

536
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,980
One, one, one, one.

537
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,300
Nine, four, one, one, one.

538
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,820
Si Qi, wrong.

539
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,220
Petitioners

540
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,420
Contestants

541
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,020
Please

542
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,740
The patient had been transferred to the hospital few days ago

543
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,460
Can you tell me

544
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,580
Which hospital she did step into?

545
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,100
Sorry

546
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,740
We can't tell you

547
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,540
Thank you

548
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,380
You're welcome

549
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,380
Hey

550
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:12,780
How about it?

551
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,140
According to your request,

552
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:14,860
Gao Rui and I

553
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,380
have collected

554
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,540
all the blood disease experts'

555
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,260
recent reports.

556
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:17,980
We found that

557
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,220
Professor Wei's Weibo IP

558
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,540
just became Jinghai last night.

559
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,020
Judging from his photos,

560
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,220
his hotel should be

561
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,300
opposite the Xiehe General Hospital.

562
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,060
Okay.

563
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,300
I don't care about your company.

564
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,020
But if you don't

565
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,180
find Xue Jiao back,

566
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,140
I'll teach you a lesson.

567
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:30,900
Don't worry.

568
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:40,700
Mr. Yi,

569
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,460
there's still an hour

570
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,540
left until the statement meeting.

571
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:43,260
Your speech

572
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,500
has been uploaded to the commentator.

573
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,740
According to your speech speed,

574
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,140
it's exactly 20 minutes.

575
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,700
This is the printout.

576
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,660
Please have a look.

577
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,660
Does Lin Zhenhua use the commentator?

578
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:54,860
Yes.

579
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,100
He's a semi-finalist.

580
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,140
Then withdraw the commentator.

581
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,740
Okay. No problem.

582
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,060
This is the confirmed media list.

583
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,820
Please have a look.

584
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,420
Congratulations to Mr. Yi

585
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,260
on joining Huachuang Group.

586
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,300
Don't be so cocky.

587
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,460
As long as Mr. Gu is kind enough,

588
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,340
he doesn't need to practice.

589
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,500
Why haven't you removed

590
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,460
the brand of Jingda's

591
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:29,820
excellent school rain?

592
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,340
My mistake.

593
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,060
I think

594
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,300
your temperament

595
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:37,820
is the best for

596
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,940
the style of this office.

597
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,260
Yes.

598
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,940
How can Lin Zhenhua compare to me?

599
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,260
Am I right?

600
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,420
If you know the exact information,

601
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:14,020
it's just a pattern.

602
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,620
I might have forgotten a thing.

603
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,940
No, your knowledge was wronged.

604
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,100
There must be something wrong.

605
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,460
Lin Zhenhua always

606
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,900
does not obey the communities.

607
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,020
No.

608
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,620
Think about who has her own body,

609
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,020
or who has others' bodies.

610
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,180
Then what does it decoration

611
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,140
mean to her?

612
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,420
I have a theory about the population.

613
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,620
She has no participate in this phenomenon,

614
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,200
agreed on the,-

615
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,960
Wait a minute.

616
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,760
I scrub my face too.

617
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,640
I want you make some food.

618
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,080
bordering on making ​​m realise you are a miserable person

619
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,360
and are so exhaustive like a rolling ball.

620
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,400
Zhao Xiao'v

621
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,440
You eat, too.

622
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,240
Okay.

623
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,240
Yes, k rapete

624
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:03,400
Yes.

625
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:03,480
Yes.

626
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:03,920
great!

627
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,200
Qi Lei.

628
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,360
Do you remember the days

629
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,040
when we had a party together in high school?

630
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,720
Yes.

631
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,920
Many times.

632
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,760
We had barbecue at your house.

633
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,560
And we went on a graduation trip together.

634
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,000
It was ten years ago.

635
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,680
Now I think about it.

636
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,080
It feels like yesterday.

637
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,320
I was happy at that time.

638
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,800
Although I grew up,

639
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,040
there's nothing to be happy about.

640
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,600
Mom.

641
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,360
Do you want to eat apples?

642
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,080
I'll wash some fruits for you, okay?

643
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,440
Okay.

644
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:18,960
Siqi.

645
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,160
Sit down and talk.

646
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,620
Put the food on the Malaysia narrow spoke

647
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,460
and make sure Snow is safe.

648
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,560
I make this mouth colic.

649
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,260
Thanks.

650
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,460
Okay.

651
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,360
DID INaaaaay

652
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,100
Don't beat it.

653
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,060
Never beat it.

654
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,020
Delicious?

655
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:31,540
Yes.

656
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,660
I fucking love it.

657
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:38,660
We are destined to hand over all our courage

658
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:44,660
I'm willing to travel with you through time

659
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:52,660
If you can read the secrets in my eyes

660
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:58,660
You will find that you are always in my heart

661
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:08,660
I try to open my hands

662
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:12,660
Because I'm sure that I love you

663
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:15,660
I'm waiting for you at the top

664
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:22,660
It doesn't matter if the wind blows in the big wild

665
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,660
There is a sound close

666
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:31,660
I know it must be you

667
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:45,660
I try to open my hands

668
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:50,660
Because I'm sure that I love you

669
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:53,660
I'm waiting for you at the top

670
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:59,660
It doesn't matter if the wind blows in the big wild

671
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:03,660
There is a sound close

672
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:09,660
I know it must be you
