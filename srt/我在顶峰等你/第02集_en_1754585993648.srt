1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Try to grow the flowers in the spring and summer

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now tell the truth about life

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's not complicated to count the flowers

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The youth is swaying

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We are getting stronger

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My heart is still hot and boiling

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Follow the rhythm and release it gently

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The night wind is lighting up the way for me to go

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will fly with you bravely

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My love is still burning

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Shining in the smile

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let us cross the barrier of time

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You are studying here?

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Of course I am studying history

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
My sister's sad history

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I heard that you are worse than Yi Tian Yu this time

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You are the best of the best

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Give it back to me

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Is she the one who always plays cool on the court?

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The ball is okay, but it's not as attractive as your brother

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Give it back to me

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
No, no, no

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I told you to give it back to me

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Don't force me to beat you

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Hurry up, give it to me

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You, you, you

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You beg me, beg me, beg me, I'll give it back to you

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You are a bad guy, give it to me

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What are you talking about at night

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Mom, you help me

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I asked her to borrow a book of practice, she refused to lend it to me

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Mom, Gu Mingze always has the ghost painting on my practice book

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I bought several books in a semester

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You help me

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I can't accompany you with the things you bought

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I can't accompany you

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What is it?

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You have been in the south for a few years more than Jiaojiao

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You can't change your accent

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You two quarrel every day

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You speak Cantonese, she speaks Mandarin

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm going to blow my mind

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Can you stop quarreling and study hard?

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Sit down

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Be good

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Why are you looking at me like this?

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You shouldn't feel your old brother is a bad guy now

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
How do you know Yi Tianyue

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What's up, I'm curious

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I know more than you think

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But don't worry

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Shiyun asked me to keep it a secret for you

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I can do what I promised

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You have such a good best friend

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You burned the hometown in your last life

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Keep it a secret for me

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
She wants to use someone else's mouth to spread my ugly things

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Unfortunately, I met a fool

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Do you know that girls sometimes speak the opposite of the right words?

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What is the opposite of the right words?

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What are you talking about?

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
OK, you'd better never know

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I must break up with him this time

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You go to find Yi Tianyu and Fugui Rui

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'll call a car for you

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll send you back

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Who told him to be one or two years higher than me in the exam?

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
If it wasn't for Yi Tianyu

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
He might not be me in the final

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
My mom always compared me to him

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
She said I couldn't even pass the exam

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Now, he's crying

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
That's the way he is in his life

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Mom, I'm home

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm home

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Good morning, mom

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Good morning

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Has auntie Sito not come today?

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Stop talking

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I was really enough for this Li Sitong

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I understand that he has two backers in his family

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Let him come a little later

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,720
I won't have breakfast at home today.

88
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,160
I have to go to school for morning classes.

89
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
Go ahead.

90
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,480
I'll get a bread.

91
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,080
Sorry, sorry.

92
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm late.

93
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,960
Well,

94
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,960
I have something urgent at home.

95
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,840
I'll cook whatever you want.

96
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,120
It's all Xue Jiao's fault.

97
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,440
It's okay, Mrs. Si Tong.

98
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,160
Don't blame Xue Jiao.

99
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
Actually,

100
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,240
she's really...

101
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,720
She's really studying hard.

102
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,280
She ordered a lot of textbooks from the bookstore.

103
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,880
She blocked the door this morning.

104
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,000
Your mother said your early training is okay for you.

105
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,680
Have you never considered

106
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,080
that a child with high education

107
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,560
is only good for good,

108
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,320
rather than being a bully in school?

109
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,400
My mother said

110
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,040
a grown man with a great heart

111
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,760
who representatives from the country

112
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,160
will pursue uprightness but not a dream.

113
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,040
In my eyes,

114
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,240
you're shy

115
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,120
to be a crybaby.

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,040
No wonder your mother says

117
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,320
You're so stubborn.

118
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,120
Let's see how you're going to change your mind.

119
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,440
Xin Xin.

120
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,640
Leng Leng.

121
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,760
What's wrong?

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,240
A late birthday gift.

123
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,240
My dad has been hiding the novel you've been wanting to read

124
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,640
in this text book.

125
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,800
Don't worry.

126
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,360
Your parents won't find out.

127
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,080
Don't worry.

128
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,880
You're so considerate.

129
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,080
I'm going to wash up.

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,680
I'm going back.

131
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,120
Little green tea.

132
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,320
You're still not satisfied with my love?

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,440
Zhou Shi Yi.

134
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,000
You're the most important talent in the company.

135
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,280
I'm going to support you.

136
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,920
But, Miss Zhou.

137
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,960
You really have to treat me to a meal.

138
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:23,980
The company is currently officially arranging the

139
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,640
Aston Martin's goods.

140
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,360
You really want to get in?

141
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,520
You're going to make trouble again?

142
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:40,840
Yes.

143
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,920
I have to study

144
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,720
with Aston Martin's programmers.

145
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:44,800
Stop right there.

146
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,400
Dad.

147
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,840
You called me?

148
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,000
Why did you change my impression chart?

149
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,360
Dad.

150
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,920
Did you fill the wrong engine hole?

151
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,400
Who is free to change your impression chart?

152
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:00,640
Come.

153
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,840
Come and see for yourself.

154
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,760
Even the holes are the same.

155
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,680
You're right.

156
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,480
Why did you change his impression chart?

157
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,440
You...

158
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,840
How can you...

159
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,880
What are you doing?

160
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,240
You can just fill it again.

161
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,520
You can't hit the child.

162
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,680
How can I fill it?

163
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,880
Look at what you did.

164
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,080
You even paid the compensation.

165
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,000
I've been here all my life.

166
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,080
How can you be so naughty?

167
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,880
Dad.

168
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,400
Dad.

169
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,320
Dad.

170
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:31,880
Dad.

171
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,960
Where are you?

172
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,720
Hit me.

173
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,400
Dad.

174
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,200
Dad.

175
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,240
I'm running away.

176
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,840
Dad.

177
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,640
Don't hit me.

178
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,400
Hit me.

179
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,000
Dad.

180
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,800
Dad.

181
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,320
Dad.

182
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,440
Dad.

183
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,680
According to what we know,

184
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,520
the well-known phone brand Yano

185
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,920
officially announced its bankruptcy today.

186
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,880
I am one of the biggest original suppliers

187
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,600
of Yano,

188
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,560
the original supplier of Shunan.

189
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,640
I was rejected by a large number of people.

190
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,560
I have no way to go.

191
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,160
Next, I will broadcast the financial news for you.

192
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,280
This...

193
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,560
This...

194
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,000
This...

195
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,400
Dad.

196
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:03,840
Dad.

197
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,240
Dad.

198
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,840
Dad.

199
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,000
Doctor,

200
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,160
how is he?

201
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,520
He's fine.

202
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,880
He can leave after his blood pressure stabilizes.

203
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,800
Great.

204
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,640
Thank you.

205
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,760
Gu Xueqiao,

206
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,280
you've been acting strange lately.

207
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,120
You're so innocent.

208
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,840
Why did you touch Gu's impression?

209
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,280
You even had a fight with your father.

210
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,200
Otherwise, Gu's job would be gone.

211
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,720
And Gu's compensation would be gone.

212
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,960
Yes.

213
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,320
I can predict the future.

214
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,400
How about that?

215
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,280
I can just touch his finger.

216
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,160
Not to mention Gu's compensation.

217
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,480
We're all rich.

218
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,680
I'll give you a ladder.

219
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,040
You can really climb up, right?

220
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,080
If you're so good at it,

221
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,680
you can predict the future.

222
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,520
Why don't you go and buy lottery tickets?

223
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,560
You still need to think about Gu's compensation.

224
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,200
I really want to buy it.

225
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,160
If you can really predict the future,

226
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,720
can you help me to calculate

227
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,840
whether Shiyi and I can get into the same university?

228
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,720
Where are you going?

229
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,560
What's it?

230
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,760
What's it?

231
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,480
Guess who's coming to!

232
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,400
It's Gu Nian.

233
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,480
Oh.

234
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,680
I didn't say anything.

235
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,880
You know what I'm going to say.

236
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,160
Just for our tacit understanding,

237
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,800
I'll accept you as my tutor.

238
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,160
Brother Li.

239
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,800
Are you talking about the dog's skin?

240
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,880
I'm talking about my second child.

241
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,440
Brother Li. Brother Li.

242
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,160
Brother Li.

243
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,280
Brother Li.

244
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,280
Brother Li.

245
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,920
What happened to him?

246
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,200
Although there are only a few people who support me,

247
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,400
every time we meet,

248
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,880
he encourages me

249
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,680
and tells me not to give up.

250
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,680
I didn't expect him to be like this.

251
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,080
You can go out first.

252
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
Brother Li.

253
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
I think

254
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,840
when Brother Gao wakes up,

255
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,800
he will definitely hope that

256
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,280
his life and work

257
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,480
will not change.

258
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,880
Otherwise,

259
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,080
he will be sad.

260
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,880
Then I'll go first.

261
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,880
It seems that you really told him

262
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,880
you wouldn't give up.

263
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,080
Follow me.

264
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,880
It's not that I can't teach you.

265
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,120
Find all these

266
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,280
and come to me again.

267
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,880
What are these?

268
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,280
The final version of the review.

269
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,880
You said it was the final version.

270
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,280
Where can I find it?

271
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,880
What did Brother Gao teach you?

272
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,480
Don't give up.

273
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,680
Brother Li.

274
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,880
Let's add each other on WeChat.

275
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,480
So that I won't be able to read you everywhere next time.

276
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,680
You can't. There's no quota.

277
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,480
No quota?

278
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,680
Don't do any social activities.

279
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,880
Don't add unnecessary people.

280
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,880
Stay here.

281
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,680
Gao Rui is your good friend.

282
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,280
You are more upset than everyone else.

283
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,080
This is not your problem.

284
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,880
It's the safety awareness of the project team

285
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,080
that is problematic.

286
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,080
I should have known

287
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,480
about Old Gao earlier.

288
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,680
We don't want this to happen.

289
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,080
Everyone is upset.

290
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,480
But you are in this state.

291
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,080
You are not the only one who is upset.

292
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,480
You are the only one who is upset.

293
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,880
You are the only one who is upset.

294
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,080
But you are in a bad state right now.

295
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,480
I don't think Gao Rui

296
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,480
wants to see you like this.

297
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,480
How about I give you an idea?

298
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,280
Gao Rui has been working hard

299
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,480
at the Qingwun Pavilion.

300
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,880
How about you take over his job

301
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,080
and finish him off?

302
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,680
So that when he wakes up,

303
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,680
his life will still be the same.

304
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,880
Nothing has changed.

305
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,680
I'm sorry.

306
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,680
I'm sorry.

307
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,480
I'm sorry.

308
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,680
If you want money,

309
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,880
you have to invest.

310
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,680
If you want to invest, you have to make money.

311
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,880
Let me ask you.

312
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,880
How many investors have made money?

313
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,480
I'm telling you, most of them are losing money.

314
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,840
But am I an ordinary person?

315
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,560
If it weren't for my vision,

316
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,960
would we have the money

317
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,160
to make up for it?

318
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,600
Alright, stop it.

319
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,040
Don't think about the money.

320
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,360
I'll go and check

321
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,720
the five-year fixed interest.

322
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,240
No.

323
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,280
Honey,

324
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,200
don't listen to my investment plan.

325
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,160
Look at your dad.

326
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,320
He's just because I have a vision.

327
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,480
He's just a fool.

328
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,200
Come on, I'll tell you my plan.

329
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,560
Honey,

330
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,480
I know,

331
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,480
you haven't managed to find me.

332
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,920
Bro,

333
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,000
what are you doing, Wu Xue Xiang?

334
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,160
You're not even a boomeran.

335
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,240
Who are you?

336
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,560
Bro,

337
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,760
you've gotten into three college exams already.

338
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,200
Why are you interested in learning?

339
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,280
This is the motivation to turn sadness into motivation.

340
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,880
Do you have money?

341
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,400
I suddenly remembered that I have some review materials to buy.

342
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,360
Do you think I will believe you?

343
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,880
No.

344
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,080
My dad!

345
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,560
My dad!

346
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,760
Dad, I put the money here.

347
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,760
Give it to me!

348
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,640
Give it to me!

349
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,360
I will tear it!

350
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,280
What's wrong?

351
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,000
What's wrong?

352
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,840
You tear it!

353
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,840
Tear what?

354
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,960
Tear what?

355
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,240
Well...

356
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,200
Today's mustard is too spicy.

357
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,440
Come on!

358
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,440
Come on!

359
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:44,960
Come on!

360
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,280
Come on!

361
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:46,840
Come on!

362
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,640
Come on!

363
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,640
Come on!

364
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,160
Come on!

365
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,840
Come on!

366
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,640
Come on!

367
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,120
Come on!

368
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,280
Come on!

369
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:54,800
Come on!

370
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,400
Come on!

371
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,320
Where did he go?

372
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,160
Since it's the best version,

373
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,560
even if he has it,

374
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,600
he won't share it with me easily.

375
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,160
Come on!

376
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,800
Come on!

377
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,040
Come on!

378
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,760
He used to be the best player in the basketball game.

379
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,280
Why did he suddenly change?

380
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,280
It's weird.

381
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,040
Bye.

382
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,440
Xue Jiao, aren't you coming with us?

383
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,720
What?

384
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,600
You want to win the championship of the basketball game?

385
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,160
This is a brilliant strategy.

386
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,400
To show my potential,

387
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,840
I baked these cakes myself.

388
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,000
You and Yitian are colleagues.

389
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,040
You should cheer for him, too.

390
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,360
Next time, call me when you're a top player.

391
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,320
I'll go for you.

392
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,120
God, I didn't ask for it.

393
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,440
Don't waste my wish.

394
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,320
Xue Jiao, look.

395
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,800
Our team is leading the game.

396
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
Come on!

397
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,720
No one is here.

398
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm not his friend.

399
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,880
With such a good skill,

400
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,360
I might as well do two more questions.

401
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,760
Come on!

402
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,480
Come on!

403
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,480
When did he get angry

404
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,320
and turn his face away?

405
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,840
Come on!

406
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,480
Come on, Yitian!

407
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,320
Come on!

408
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:02,880
It's time for the class.

409
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,960
Let's go back to the classroom.

410
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,520
Yitian, I'll go with you.

411
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,520
You're a fool.

412
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,120
Let's go back to the classroom.

413
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,920
Yitian, let's go back to the classroom.

414
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,600
Okay.

415
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,640
Come on!

416
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,240
What's going on?

417
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,840
Yitian, come on!

418
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,520
Yitian, come on!

419
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,320
Come on!

420
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,080
Yeah.

421
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,600
Let's play.

422
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
You're a fool.

423
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,200
Let's go back to the classroom.

424
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:19,960
Yitian, let's go back to the classroom.

425
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,480
Come on!

426
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,200
Be careful!

427
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,200
Pretend to knock him down

428
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,520
and apologize with the most handsome smile.

429
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,440
He'll be touched by my sincerity.

430
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,680
He'll forgive me no matter what.

431
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,200
Yitian,

432
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,640
you're a genius.

433
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,480
What's going on over there?

434
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,160
What's going on?

435
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
What's going on?

436
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,160
What's going on?

437
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,120
Let's go.

438
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,640
Mr. Qin.

439
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,760
Excuse me.

440
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,280
Are you okay?

441
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,840
Your arms are too sore.

442
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,200
You can't escape.

443
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,640
Take this and apply it.

444
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,120
Chen Xiao, you're so sweet.

445
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,920
He seems not angry.

446
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,120
As expected,

447
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,880
handsome smile is invincible.

448
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,520
Thank you.

449
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Come on, let's play.

450
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,560
Let's go.

451
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,160
Let's go.

452
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,120
Let's go.

453
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,920
Let's go.

454
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,920
Let's go.

455
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,840
A person's pulse is wealth.

456
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,920
A person's face is value.

457
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,440
Since someone is willing to pay for his face,

458
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,720
I have no reason not to use it.

459
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,240
Yitian,

460
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,320
you finally have a place to shine.

461
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,800
The beauty of the ordinary is not important.

462
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,960
The ordinary is the laugh of the ordinary.

463
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,120
The ordinary is the laugh of the useless.

464
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,480
The ordinary is the laugh of the meaningless.

465
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,920
Why do you want to share it with others?

466
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,480
Sharing is the most valuable thing.

467
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,880
It's not a big deal if you have hands.

468
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,560
Are you interested in

469
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,240
Yitian's personal book?

470
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,160
The first step is to create a private desire.

471
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,680
Why are you so good at it?

472
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,560
You're so good at it.

473
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,920
Why don't you say you're good at it?

474
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,960
Seven six six.

475
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,240
Chen Xiao, come back.

476
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,680
I'm done.

477
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,200
The second step is to be hungry and sell.

478
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,600
Take your fans' hearts.

479
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,920
Who has the top of the seven classes

480
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,000
to write notes with them?

481
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,120
I want to have it too.

482
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,560
Please help me.

483
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,560
Who can help me find

484
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,120
the total number of students' 300 questions

485
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,640
and listen to the sound of the bell?

486
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,240
I remember that you have

487
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,120
some final version of the review materials.

488
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,120
Although it has been changed,

489
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,160
there is a set called the 300 questions of students' must-read.

490
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,560
Why are you asking this too?

491
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,840
Is this question popular recently?

492
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,600
Gu Xueqiao is asking this too.

493
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,440
He must be asking about Gong Wenzheng.

494
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,240
He must be doing this for the sake of loving me.

495
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,160
Don't let him get it.

496
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
I'm sorry, teacher.

497
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,080
The first point.

498
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,880
Remember this.

499
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,560
We can write down the notes.

500
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,560
What is the first point?

501
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,400
Absolute.

502
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,160
Free thought.

503
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,640
After school tomorrow,

504
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,240
let's go to that store, okay?

505
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:11,800
Okay.

506
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,400
But I think the amount given by the boss

507
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,280
is getting less and less.

508
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:14,760
It's not enough.

509
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,760
You can say it.

510
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,960
I have no money.

511
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,120
Who told you to ask for money?

512
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,720
I want the 300 questions of students.

513
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,880
No.

514
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,600
Don't care about it. It's really not worth it.

515
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,280
He is bullying the students of our class.

516
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,200
I can see that the students are bullied.

517
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,080
And look.

518
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,440
There are three of us here.

519
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,720
He is alone.

520
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,920
He has a chance to deal with him.

521
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,600
Let's go.

522
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,560
Since he is alone,

523
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,320
you still have to help him.

524
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,320
Stop.

525
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,160
Gu Xue child.

526
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,440
I haven't found you yet.

527
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,800
How could you find a friend?

528
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,160
Why are you so timid now?

529
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,160
Such a person is very rude, you know?

530
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:19,160
How can you take me?

531
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,160
Count one, two, three.

532
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:34,160
One, two, three.

533
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,160
Go.

534
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,160
Poor you.

535
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,160
These are your friends.

536
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,160
You can't teach me.

537
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,160
Are you okay?

538
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,160
I'm fine.

539
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,160
Where's the glue?

540
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,160
I don't know.

541
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,160
Gu Xueqiao, put it down.

542
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,160
Chen Hao, hurry.

543
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,160
My body is dirty.

544
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,160
It's so heavy.

545
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,160
You blocked me here.

546
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,160
Hurry.

547
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,160
You two go.

548
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,160
Who dares to go? I'll see who dares to go.

549
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,160
I'll take it.

550
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,160
Paterson, you two.

551
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,160
Hurry.

552
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,160
Paterson.

553
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,160
Gu Xueqiao, you...

554
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,160
Wait for me.

555
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,160
Xueqiao.

556
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,160
Then she can do it herself.

557
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,160
Don't hurt others in the room.

558
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
Thank you.

559
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,160
No need to thank me.

560
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,160
Liu Xuewei.

561
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:36,160
Can you take this as a reward for my goodwill?

562
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,160
You...

563
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,160
Hello.

564
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,160
How much?

565
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,160
20.

566
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,160
Thank you.

567
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,160
The final version of the review you want is here.

568
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,160
Thank you.

569
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,160
Touch the bottom.

570
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,160
See your level of performance.

571
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,160
Thank you.

572
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,160
Let me see.

573
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,160
Wait.

574
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,160
Stop talking about it.

575
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,160
Go home after you eat.

576
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,160
I'm not hungry.

577
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,160
I'm hungry.

578
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,160
You...

579
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,160
You can't eat all these?

580
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,160
Then go home and eat.

581
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,160
I have a question to finish.

582
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,160
It's useless to think about it.

583
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,160
It's a trap.

584
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,160
I was in my first year of high school.

585
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,160
I was in my early twenties.

586
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,160
But you are in your late twenties now.

587
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
Face the reality.

588
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,160
Can you give me some more advice?

589
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,160
I think the probability is not enough.

590
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,160
My brave quality.

591
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,160
Stop劲This snack.

592
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,160
Maybe you need to help me.

593
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
Yes.

594
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,160
Auntie Li finished it.

595
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,160
The safe-lippings came empty.

596
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,440
I'm going to solve this problem.

597
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,080
I'm going to solve this problem.

598
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:07,680
Let's see.

599
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,920
The idea is right.

600
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,240
But the calculation process is a bit complicated.

601
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,000
Find a way to simplify it.

602
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,480
I knew it.

603
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,640
With my smartness,

604
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,360
I can definitely solve this problem.

605
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:23,960
It's too late.

606
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,040
Go home and do it.

607
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,840
I'm going to go home.

608
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,640
I'm going to go home.

609
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,880
Go home.

610
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,120
Send me the photo after you're done.

611
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,680
Okay.

612
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,120
It's over.

613
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,760
What's wrong?

614
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,040
It's locked.

615
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,560
What should we do?

616
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,320
Find a way.

617
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,560
Where did this go?

618
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,480
It's even later than mine.

619
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,480
Qi Xiao.

620
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,120
Qi Xiao.

621
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,760
Qi Xiao.

622
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,560
Qi Xiao.

623
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,400
Qi Xiao.

624
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,280
Qi Xiao.

625
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,240
Qi Xiao.

626
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,040
Qi Xiao.

627
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,480
Did you sleep well?

628
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,760
You're working hard.

629
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,800
You're sleeping so early.

630
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,760
Where did you go?

631
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,760
Why aren't you back?

632
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,160
Zhou's house.

633
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:57,840
Sorry for the interruption.

634
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,280
I was trying to cover for you.

635
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,280
You didn't tell me

636
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,480
that you went to the house.

637
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,160
It's solved.

638
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,160
But I have to wait.

639
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,480
Staying in the ocean of knowledge.

640
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,440
When I get into the Jingda University

641
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,800
and return to the school's award,

642
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,760
I must let this glorious history

643
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,960
flow in it.

644
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,280
There's no need to prepare for the award.

645
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,120
You don't need it.

646
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,000
You're so annoying.

647
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,280
Is it worth it

648
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:39,880
to explain such a question?

649
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,520
Yes.

650
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,760
It's not about the three-minute heat, right?

651
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,560
You look like an impulsive person.

652
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,240
Impulsive people

653
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,920
are usually three minutes of heat.

654
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,600
You can do whatever you want.

655
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,080
But you can't give up.

656
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,800
So you're trying to

657
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,720
give me a difficult question.

658
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,440
To test

659
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,640
if I'm three minutes of heat?

660
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,800
You're so annoying.

661
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,480
You don't help me.

662
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,600
I don't care about you.

663
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,600
Xue Jiao.

664
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,760
Your quilt...

665
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,200
Xue Jiao.

666
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,800
I know you are already there now.

667
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,200
completamente unconscious.

668
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,200
Don't even want to get support.

669
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:46,720
Here.

670
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,960
Who are you?

671
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,120
Why do you sleep

672
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,800
Here.

673
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,440
Then we should write it.

674
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:11,600
However,

675
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,520
why do you need to write?

676
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,280
Done.

677
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,320
You watch thepeak?

678
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,440
Mingze.

679
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,700
You're not sleeping?

680
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:42,780
sitting

681
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:43,980
What are you doing?

682
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,380
I saw it online.

683
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,340
In a sleeping 유 passé

684
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,060
will be better.

685
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,100
Do you try?

686
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,500
You always do these useless things.

687
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,420
Keep your voice down.

688
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,500
Your sister is asleep.

689
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,260
Learn from her.

690
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,500
Wake up early.

691
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,420
Focus on your study.

692
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,420
Next time, I'll...

693
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,060
Be careful, Hu Dai.

694
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,660
Sorry, the number you dialed is powered off.

695
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,220
Sorry, the number you dialed is powered off.

696
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,620
Powered off?

697
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,900
You've ruined your study.

698
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,660
If it weren't for your brother, I'd have stopped you.

699
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,700
You're so useless now.

700
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,180
You can play with Xue Xiao.

701
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,460
I'll protect the back room.

702
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,860
Xue won't be caught.

703
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,860
How sad.

704
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,300
Wait for me.

705
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,820
Have you never been surprised?

706
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:21,740
Well...

707
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,100
No.

708
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:48,620
でも

709
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,380
No. What am I doing?

710
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,620
There are only five of us?

711
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,580
It's okay.

712
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,980
I'll help you to unite the world.

713
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,220
You&I

714
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,260
What's happening?

715
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,020
What Do you want from me?

716
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,020
I want I want something.

717
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,620
Gao

718
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,420
Li

719
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,620
Gao Rui, the time of death is September 5, 2014

720
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,620
20-20-19 minutes 32

721
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,620
You... you had a nightmare

722
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,620
You are not scary in any nightmare

723
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,620
You just put away that keyboard

724
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,620
Wait for me to scare you

725
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,620
I figured it out

726
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,620
Look

727
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,620
I picked it up myself

728
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,620
I'll show you

729
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,620
This

730
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:56,620
An is equal to 2 minus An minus one

731
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:02,620
So An plus one is equal to 2 minus An, right?

732
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,620
So

733
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,620
Bn plus one minus Bn equals

734
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:15,620
An plus one minus one minus An minus one

735
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:21,620
Equals 2 minus An minus one minus one minus An minus one

736
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,620
Right?

737
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,620
Then

738
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:29,620
Bn plus one minus Bn equals

739
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,620
What's up?

740
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,620
It's a monster. Hide

741
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,620
I'll save you, don't touch it

742
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,620
I'll save you, don't touch it

743
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,460
I'm sorry.

744
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,540
I'll save you. Don't be afraid.

745
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,180
Don't be afraid.

746
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,020
I'll protect you.

747
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,900
What's going on?

748
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,380
Who are you,

749
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,260
Miss Qian?

750
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,820
I'm wondering who you are.

751
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,500
Hua Hua.

752
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,460
Who is this silly girl?

753
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,180
Hua Hua.

754
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,060
Hua Hua is me.

755
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,020
Don't call me by my real name.

756
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,700
You two know each other?

757
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,140
She's my sister.

758
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,420
I'm Hua Chengyu.

759
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:40,820
Lin Zhi Yue.

760
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,660
It sounds like her sister.

761
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:44,820
Sister.

762
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,780
You're always so rude.

763
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,300
Let's compete with each other.

764
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,660
Hua Hua is your little sister-in-law?

765
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,140
Yes.

766
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,820
Pack up if you're free.

767
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,340
Let's go.

768
00:39:59,260 --> 00:39:59,900
Hua Hua.

769
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,820
You've been staring at someone.

770
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,500
Strange.

771
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,340
The monk of high standing?

772
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:20,820
Yes.

773
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,420
I see.

774
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,500
So you code your word

775
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,020
to defend her

776
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:26,940
instead of laboratory her to the lover, right?

777
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,740
are you BRIAN's daughter?

778
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,100
Shout and I'll go.

779
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,820
Don't come back that night.

780
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,380
Still not skipping?

781
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,900
Fine. I'll ask him directly.

782
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,100
Stop talking nonsense.

783
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:52,820
Sister.

784
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,820
Don't you go home that late?

785
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,820
How do you know Hua Hua?

786
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,460
Please give her a cup of tea.

787
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,820
Let fate decide

788
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:06,660
to give us all the courage.

789
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:12,060
I'm willing to travel with you through time.

790
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,460
If you

791
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,140
understand the secrets in my eyes,

792
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:26,420
you will know that you are always in my heart.

793
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:36,460
I'm trying to open my hands

794
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,660
because I'm sure that I love you.

795
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,660
I'm waiting for you at the top.

796
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:50,060
It doesn't matter if the wind blows.

797
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:54,460
There is a sound that is very close.

798
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:58,860
I know that it must be you.

799
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:04,060
I know that it must be you.

800
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,460
I'm waiting for you at the top.

801
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:13,860
It doesn't matter if the wind blows.

802
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:20,260
There is a sound that is very close.

803
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:24,860
I know that it must be you.

804
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:28,460
No need to care

805
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,780
There is a sound

806
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:32,580
Very close

807
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:38,860
I know it must be you
