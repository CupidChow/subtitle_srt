1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Try to grow the flowers in the summer

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now tell the truth about life

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's not complicated to count the flowers

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The youth is swaying

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We are getting stronger

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My heart is still hot and boiling

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Follow the rhythm and release it gently

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Don't be afraid to light up the firework

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'll fly with you bravely

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My love is still hot and boiling

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The bright and small eyes

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let us cross the barrier of time

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Your posture is not good enough

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I know you

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Your legs are like this

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yes

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's the best way to open it

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You have a good taste for a man

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I haven't eaten pork or seen pig's trotters

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I have a little taste

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Really?

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Your brother gave you a taste

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yes, my brother

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He likes it

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He seems to care about nothing

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
In fact, he is just avoiding the reality

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Look at that guy, he is so handsome

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So handsome, take a picture

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Look at him

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
He is so handsome when he is asleep

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
If I had a boyfriend, I would be so handsome

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Please be quiet

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Hey, classmate

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm here

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm here

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm here

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm here

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Hey, classmate

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What's wrong, Shi Rui?

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Can you stop being so annoying to my school?

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You are disturbing my study

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Sit down

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
How is it?

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yours?

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Why didn't you help me give it to him?

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Because he has a girlfriend

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But I heard he said he had no girlfriend

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Please help me, classmate

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I know you are best friends with him

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Please

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm here for him

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I don't have time to talk with him

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Gu Xuejiao

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What is the longest confession?

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You are so rude

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
This is also a piece of white paper?

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This is a meaningful white paper

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This is a meaningful white paper

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You are playing with fire

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
This is playing with fire?

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is playing with fire?

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
This is playing with fire?

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This is playing with fire?

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
This is playing with fire?

67
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
This is playing with fire?

68
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This is playing with fire?

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This is playing with fire?

70
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
This is playing with fire?

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
This is playing with fire?

72
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
This is playing with fire?

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
This is playing with fire?

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is playing with fire?

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This is playing with fire?

76
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
This is playing with fire?

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
This is playing with fire?

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This is playing with fire?

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
This is playing with fire?

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This is playing with fire?

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
This is playing with fire?

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
This is playing with fire?

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
This is playing with fire?

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This is playing with fire?

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This is playing with fire?

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
This is playing with fire?

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This is playing with fire?

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This is playing with fire?

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This is playing with fire?

90
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
this.

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
No.

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,200
You guys are who?

94
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,000
I don't know what are you talking about.

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What are you talking about?

96
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Without me,

97
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
guarding.

98
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,000
Let's give a acting competition.

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
["Wang Zeyu is back, he'll take on this audition"]

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Where is he?

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Where?

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
W goods?

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,800
Do you know it?

104
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,080
You want to participate in the competition?

105
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:26,880
Yes.

106
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,760
Didn't you say you wanted to play a long-term war with BNC?

107
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:44,900
I thought of a way to turn the long-term war into a

108
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,960
If I use your patent technology in the national competition

109
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,800
to win the championship,

110
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,960
that is to prove that the CE technology rejected by BNC

111
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,320
is completely feasible in the face of the national media and experts.

112
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,520
I'm good at hitting you.

113
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,840
Gu Xuejiao,

114
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,400
you're trying to go against me, aren't you?

115
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,680
Lin Shixiong.

116
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,480
Don't explain.

117
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,480
This year's national security competition,

118
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,160
I'm the captain of the team.

119
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,320
If you want to get some experience,

120
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,600
you can come to me directly.

121
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,880
Why did you give the patent to Professor Tan directly?

122
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,920
You want to be the captain, too?

123
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,520
I tell you,

124
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,880
this time, I'm not in your shoes.

125
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,960
I will never let you down.

126
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,600
Professor Tan didn't promise anything.

127
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,000
He just wants us to compete internally

128
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,920
to be the captain.

129
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:35,960
You...

130
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,120
You're called a traitor.

131
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,160
You're challenging the authority of the predecessors.

132
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,840
Just like that,

133
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,520
you can arouse your inner spirit?

134
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,400
Lin Shixiong,

135
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,240
you can't be mentally able to handle it.

136
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,360
We call it a conscience competition.

137
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,760
The first place in the competition.

138
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,760
A little bit.

139
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,280
You really don't know the truth.

140
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,120
Wait and see.

141
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,800
I'll make you suffer a terrible loss.

142
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,880
You have time to be bored here.

143
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,320
Why don't you study some more questions?

144
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,920
I'll go to Professor Tan

145
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,920
to ask him some more questions.

146
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,680
You come with me.

147
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,840
You're playing with me?

148
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,240
You're so arrogant.

149
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,440
Gu Xuejiao, you're so smart.

150
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,000
Why do you have to compete with me?

151
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,880
Mom.

152
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:35,960
No.

153
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,040
Is she here?

154
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,440
This is too bitter.

155
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,480
Where are they?

156
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,240
They're all following Lin Jia'an's

157
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,920
national training plan.

158
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,880
Although we're traitors,

159
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,400
we're with you.

160
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:00,960
Jiayi,

161
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,840
you're really too weak.

162
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,240
I'll bring you something to eat.

163
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,840
Jiayi,

164
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,680
you're so cool.

165
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,680
You're still so arrogant.

166
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,360
Shulan.

167
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,040
Don't get me wrong.

168
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,680
I just haven't had the time to leave.

169
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,520
I've been applying for you

170
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,520
and I've already got the offer.

171
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,760
I don't have time

172
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,360
and I haven't tried to get a good sleep.

173
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,920
Of course,

174
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,120
I just don't want to be the only one

175
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,320
who's lost in my life

176
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,480
because of you.

177
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,080
Bye-bye.

178
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,840
Shulan.

179
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,760
Sh...

180
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,560
Rui.

181
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,640
No.

182
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,160
He's already a doctor.

183
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,080
He can't even say goodbye to me.

184
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,480
I'm really a leader now.

185
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,640
Is this too casual?

186
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:13,960
Forget it.

187
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,600
I can't do this.

188
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,560
No.

189
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,560
Who do you think I am?

190
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,000
As long as you can represent

191
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,120
the University of Jinghai,

192
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,320
I can guarantee that

193
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,040
you'll definitely win the championship.

194
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,840
You're not Qin Xiaoyi.

195
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,160
Give me strength.

196
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,440
Come with me.

197
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,400
No.

198
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,240
I'm not going.

199
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,640
I want to compete with my idol

200
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,920
for the next star.

201
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,640
I understand.

202
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,040
But don't take me seriously.

203
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,880
You're making a rocket and a star chain.

204
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,120
Does it affect the car?

205
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,640
Don't make your life

206
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,160
so limited.

207
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,560
I don't have time.

208
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,640
This is the record of

209
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,880
your professional team

210
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,760
in the public service position

211
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,560
for the past three years.

212
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,880
As long as the National Intelligence Competition

213
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,920
can get the title,

214
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,560
your resume will be very beautiful.

215
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,040
You can not only talk,

216
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,480
but also focus.

217
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,000
My professional name

218
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,960
is Hua Bing.

219
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,080
I'm different from others.

220
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,640
I guarantee that you'll win.

221
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,920
Stop.

222
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,680
I won't agree.

223
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,960
You'd better give up on me.

224
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,080
Who said I want to attack you?

225
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,400
My teammates have already recruited the horses.

226
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,160
Although you're very good,

227
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,600
you didn't...

228
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,840
You're not as good as you can be.

229
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,520
What's wrong with you, Gu Weidong?

230
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,880
They're both not from the lab.

231
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,400
You don't know that

232
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,680
you can't allow outsiders to ride the car.

233
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,520
I've already

234
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,120
applied to Professor Tan in advance.

235
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,120
He approved it.

236
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,360
Without me,

237
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,800
you three can't do anything.

238
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,520
Our PK with the team

239
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,640
is the intelligence, information,

240
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,560
and security defense battle.

241
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,280
Before the competition,

242
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,120
we have to build a firewall in advance.

243
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,000
In the competition,

244
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,280
we have to break through

245
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,720
the opponent's firewall in 30 minutes.

246
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,280
The infrastructure of the firewall

247
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,080
is already in the group of three of us.

248
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,880
Why am I not in the group?

249
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,320
I'll leave it here today.

250
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,240
Without me,

251
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,520
you can't win at all.

252
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,240
Then why are you so sure

253
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,920
that we can win with you?

254
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,560
Because in my life dictionary,

255
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,360
there is no word like this.

256
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,400
Well,

257
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,120
can I marry you?

258
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,640
Aren't you only

259
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,040
willing to be with us?

260
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,160
I suddenly remembered

261
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,800
your selection meeting in the first year.

262
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,360
That's a surprise.

263
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,160
Of course,

264
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,880
the most important thing is

265
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,920
my heart is with you.

266
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,480
As a captain,

267
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,720
I don't know how to treat you.

268
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,000
You have me.

269
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,560
Let's go.

270
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,760
I...

271
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,960
I told you not to drink water.

272
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,920
Tell me when you wake up.

273
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,960
However,

274
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,160
if you can't,

275
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,000
there's no peace there.

276
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,080
How about all of us

277
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,720
don't have peace?

278
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,080
How?

279
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,400
Obedient always

280
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,960
just give a little notification

281
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,160
when things happen.

282
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,360
Hence,

283
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,720
I would like to

284
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,360
ask you one question.

285
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,920
If I did something wrong,

286
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,920
I'll tell you this.

287
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,400
I'm doing my best to help you.

288
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,640
Take it.

289
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,600
I didn't buy too much.

290
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,560
Here.

291
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,200
Tell me.

292
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,720
The conditions in our house are getting better.

293
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,000
Do you think I can rest properly?

294
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,400
You can't rest until you're well.

295
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,520
Didn't you hear that?

296
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,120
You'll get sick if you're idle.

297
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,880
It's not wrong to say that.

298
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,320
The employee's boss is a good worker.

299
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,760
If he doesn't work today, he'll work tomorrow.

300
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,040
It's not a good job.

301
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,120
Let's go to another mall.

302
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,000
Let's continue to spend.

303
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,680
This money is not for me.

304
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,920
It's all for your daughter.

305
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,720
Look.

306
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,160
It's changing.

307
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,800
It's about to change seasons.

308
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,240
I need to buy her something new.

309
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,000
They haven't been back for days.

310
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,840
That's right.

311
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,640
They haven't been home for two or three weeks.

312
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,240
Could it be...

313
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,440
They're in love.

314
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,400
With whom?

315
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,520
Xiao Lin.

316
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,640
They're from the same lab.

317
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,120
They're together all the time.

318
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,240
They're in love.

319
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,280
I was hit by a car

320
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,560
downstairs that day.

321
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,560
I'm in love.

322
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,200
They're not in love.

323
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,440
I don't believe it.

324
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,040
Let's go to Jingda.

325
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,600
To Jingda.

326
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,160
Let's go.

327
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,680
It's an automatic lock.

328
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,800
The shoes are almost broken.

329
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
Fasten your seat belt.

330
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,280
Come on.

331
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,480
Let's toast to the establishment of the team.

332
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,800
Cheers.

333
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,280
Enjoy the food before heading back to the lab.

334
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,960
It's scary here.

335
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,120
Can't imagine.

336
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,680
Why was the simple meal

337
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,760
not fresh?

338
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,680
It's coffee.

339
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,640
Relax.

340
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,280
You really don't know.

341
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,920
to stimulate Xia Shulan.

342
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,720
Wenbo is the only one

343
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,000
who is swaying the lottery.

344
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,520
If he didn't see

345
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,160
your team's soul burning,

346
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,840
how could he get out of the game?

347
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,440
What an old fox.

348
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm eating hotpot.

349
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,760
Who are you talking about?

350
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,600
It's me.

351
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,000
It's me.

352
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,800
Old foxes should eat grass.

353
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,400
I won't talk to you. I'll hang up now.

354
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,320
We didn't

355
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,320
say hi to Xu Jiao.

356
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,320
He just came.

357
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,520
It's not appropriate.

358
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,640
We're here to see our daughter.

359
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,120
You didn't do anything wrong.

360
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,360
What's on your mind?

361
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,920
Uncle, auntie.

362
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:21,800
Don't talk nonsense.

363
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,720
Be quick.

364
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,120
Xiaoli.

365
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,120
Xiaoli.

366
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,440
What a coincidence.

367
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,760
You are...

368
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,120
We bought some things

369
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:30,880
for Xu Jiao

370
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,960
for him to send up.

371
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,000
I remember that

372
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,480
the dormitory is in this direction.

373
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,320
We walked and walked

374
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,840
and we came to the lab.

375
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,520
Your auntie is lost.

376
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,360
Xu Jiao isn't at school.

377
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,200
She went to eat hotpot with her friend.

378
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,960
Why didn't she call you?

379
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,040
It seems that she's really fine.

380
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,480
Keep observing.

381
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:55,880
It's okay.

382
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,000
Let's take the things

383
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,200
and send them to her dorm.

384
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,160
You're so busy.

385
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,400
How can you be so shy?

386
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,480
It's okay. Don't be too busy.

387
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,560
It's okay.

388
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,240
Be good.

389
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,080
Okay.

390
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,480
Xiaoli.

391
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,600
Are you busy recently?

392
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,760
Look at what you're asking.

393
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,400
Xiaoli must be very busy.

394
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,120
Right?

395
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,280
I'm fine recently.

396
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,560
Then, aren't you busy at all?

397
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,360
Yes.

398
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,840
Can't you be busier?

399
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,560
Aunt, do you have

400
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,000
something to tell me?

401
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,760
Is it so obvious?

402
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,440
It's very obvious.

403
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,280
Just ask.

404
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,440
Then I won't be in the circle.

405
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,800
Xiaoli.

406
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,800
Do you have a boyfriend?

407
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,560
Aunt, you have to

408
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,560
accept my boyfriend.

409
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,440
Didn't Xue Jiao tell you?

410
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Tell you what?

411
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,000
It seems that the situation is not clear.

412
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,320
That is to say, she's still chasing...

413
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,120
It's kind of true.

414
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,640
I always think that

415
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,280
Xue Jiao is very dependent on you.

416
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,200
I'm also worried about being a mother.

417
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,560
I want to help her ask.

418
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,640
Of course.

419
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,320
You're such an excellent boy.

420
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,000
The girl you like must be special.

421
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,640
She's really special.

422
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:11,840
Alright.

423
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,960
I'm a rock.

424
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,920
I'm going to fall.

425
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,040
It's not a fate to be your mother-in-law.

426
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:19,920
Aunt.

427
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,920
It's a fate.

428
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,120
The girl I'm chasing

429
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,040
is Xue Jiao.

430
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,280
I knew it.

431
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,640
I knew it.

432
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
Well, Xiaoli.

433
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,120
You can do your work.

434
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,520
Just send me the money.

435
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,480
No, I'm not busy.

436
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,560
I'll send you to the dormitory.

437
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,960
No need.

438
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,040
We can go there ourselves.

439
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,240
You can do your work first.

440
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,760
How can I do that?

441
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,520
I'll send you.

442
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
Leave it to me.

443
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,240
You should go there quickly.

444
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,040
Well,

445
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,400
didn't Xue Jiao go to eat hot pot?

446
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,400
Go and have a look.

447
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,720
Yes, yes, yes. Go.

448
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,640
Go.

449
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,440
Go quickly.

450
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,200
Be bold.

451
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,360
I'll go now.

452
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,240
Go.

453
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,160
Go.

454
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,600
Thank you, uncle and aunt.

455
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,520
You're welcome.

456
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,840
Well, I...

457
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,720
I'll do my best.

458
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,600
Do your best.

459
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,680
I knew it.

460
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,320
Look at me.

461
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,280
Don't worry.

462
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,400
Our pig

463
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,280
can finally eat cabbage.

464
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,560
What are you talking about?

465
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,000
That's cabbage.

466
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,840
It attracts a good pig.

467
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,840
Yes, yes, yes.

468
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,840
I told you.

469
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,200
You don't have to come.

470
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:41,840
Look.

471
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,160
What's wrong with not coming?

472
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,040
I can't feel

473
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,080
the feeling of his mother-in-law.

474
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,520
That's great.

475
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,360
You...

476
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,160
Hurry up.

477
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,040
Come back.

478
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,760
Look at him.

479
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,800
He's so handsome.

480
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,880
So what do we eat?

481
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,760
Crab.

482
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
Are there three eggs?

483
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,040
Let's order first.

484
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,000
A duck intestine.

485
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,240
I don't know.

486
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,480
Crab.

487
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:20,260
I don't eat

488
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,040
I don't eat.

489
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,080
Forget it.

490
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,320
We just order these for now.

491
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,080
How about

492
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,960
we talk about the public first?

493
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,880
Siqi, Applied Electronics Department.

494
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,720
Then I'll be in charge of Applied Protection.

495
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,920
Then let's go to ProПр Rain.

496
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,680
Let's go.

497
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,240
What's going on there?

498
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,080
All right, I'm here now.

499
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,600
One to oneien, okay?

500
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,120
Mr. Lin.

501
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,000
I will run the institute

502
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,160
給你準備 Zoë.

503
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,320
Closing the interview

504
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,640
after the pilots were reported to CentralfarSTAim.

505
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,600
Thank you, thank you.

506
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,520
See you next time.

507
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:01,920
Hopefully.

508
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,000
A little problem going on,

509
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,400
Thank you.

510
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,440
Dr. Wen.

511
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,320
I'll go ask Lin's family about the animals.

512
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,760
I'll go back and check.

513
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,000
Dr. Wen.

514
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,720
Excuse me.

515
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,560
May I ask

516
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,040
if the dishes are ready?

517
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,400
Okay.

518
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,740
You can't stand by anymore anyway.

519
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,680
I'll eat.

520
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,080
What about me?

521
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,040
Why are you still acting so sweet?

522
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,920
Since their Wuyi has escaped,

523
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,920
I should act found altaing after others.

524
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,800
I've told

525
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,880
your parents to come to the school.

526
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,200
What have you told them?

527
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
My parents came to find me at school.

528
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,000
And you just let them know?

529
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,880
I didn't say anything.

530
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,120
I asked you last month.

531
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,320
Didn't you say that you told your parents?

532
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,480
I was just saying it.

533
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,560
I just wanted to find a reason.

534
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:19,960
You...

535
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,800
You asked yourself.

536
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,920
We've been together for so long.

537
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,240
You still don't want to tell them?

538
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,920
But I think if my parents know,

539
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,040
everyone in our family will know.

540
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,080
And those classmates.

541
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,960
I don't want them to think

542
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,240
we're doing a test of our career.

543
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,120
What's wrong?

544
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,200
Do you feel safe?

545
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,640
I'm fine.

546
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,240
You can tell me when you want.

547
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,080
Anyway, I'm just asking you out.

548
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
You didn't say yes.

549
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,240
Alright.

550
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,920
You're going to get changed anyway.

551
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,360
After you graduate,

552
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,840
I'll take care of the whole world.

553
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,920
And I'll be your boyfriend.

554
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,600
Okay?

555
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,640
Okay.

556
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,200
It's open.

557
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,080
What would you like?

558
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,500
I'll go down first.

559
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,760
A bowl ofCoo.

560
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,480
Alright.

561
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,880
Our family thesci

562
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,880
brought us tea News.

563
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,200
We brought tea leaves.

564
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,120
They're good.

565
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,480
Thank you.

566
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,480
My bonus is for tea production.

567
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,200
My mom heard that I'm going to the competition.

568
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,120
So she lent me a lot of experience.

569
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,480
Here, try it.

570
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,440
Xu Jiao.

571
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,000
I think Brother Ling cares about us too.

572
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,760
How about leaving some for him?

573
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,600
We need to use the lab now.

574
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,680
I forgot to tell you.

575
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,320
We have the right to use the lab during the day.

576
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,400
If you want to come,

577
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,720
come after 9 o'clock.

578
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,440
Why?

579
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,880
Who told me to go to the lab

580
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,000
when I applied for the right to use the lab?

581
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,240
You went to eat hot pot.

582
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,960
Brother Ling, can I come back?

583
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,520
We don't have a kind family here.

584
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,360
As the captain,

585
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,400
you can't even get the right to use the lab.

586
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,560
What's the point of asking you?

587
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,160
Let's go.

588
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,240
Nian Yu, Xiao Ying.

589
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,240
No.

590
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,560
These little girls are all Nian Yu.

591
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,640
A Lun Sen, Xiao Ying.

592
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
No.

593
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,120
I can't.

594
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,120
I can't.

595
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,120
I can't.

596
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,120
I can't.

597
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,120
I can't.

598
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
I can't.

599
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,120
I can't.

600
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,120
I can't.

601
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,120
I can't.

602
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,120
I can't.

603
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,240
Jiang Cheng and Ji Zhi.

604
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,120
If they could have taken it,

605
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,520
they would have taken it.

606
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,040
Bei Er, Xiao Ying.

607
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,720
I have to make Ling Zhi Hua go out

608
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,120
to persuade him.

609
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,120
Sweet tea.

610
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,920
I don't want to.

611
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,920
Let me hug you.

612
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,320
What's wrong?

613
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,520
It's not easy to bring the team?

614
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,720
Stay up all night.

615
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,920
Plus, the team is so small.

616
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,720
It's too hard to bring them.

617
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,920
It's still my fault that I didn't become the leader.

618
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,520
Leader.

619
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,320
Can you teach me

620
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,920
the secret of managing the team?

621
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,720
My secret is that I can control you.

622
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,320
You didn't say it.

623
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,920
The more thoughtful people are,

624
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,520
the harder it is for them to manage.

625
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,520
Especially the three

626
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,320
male-female rivals.

627
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,320
They are sure to cooperate with each other.

628
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,920
Unless it's more difficult.

629
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,920
You said it right.

630
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,320
If you become a boss,

631
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,320
won't you use this to

632
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,320
stimulate your employees?

633
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,120
It's not that easy to help people that are in trouble.

634
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,320
There is no difficulty,

635
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,320
but difficulties.

636
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,520
So cunning.

637
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,920
Did you learn it from me?

638
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,720
I am a big fox,

639
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,920
while you are a small fox.

640
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,960
I shouldn't have proposed to you.

641
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,000
It's ok now.

642
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:50,220
I'll

643
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,680
It's a breakthrough now.

644
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,880
Well,

645
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,080
The dead programmer.

646
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,080
Didn't you get it?

647
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,680
The dead programmer.

648
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,600
He's calling us the dead programmer.

649
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,400
So ridiculous.

650
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,920
If you don't mind, please be quiet.

651
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,200
You may not have noticed

652
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,560
that there are people working here.

653
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,480
You're so annoying.

654
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,960
What about me?

655
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,040
There is really one

656
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,680
who is my rival.

657
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,960
The historical breakthrough.

658
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,080
Chief Steward, I'm sorry.

659
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,200
I'm going to use your jealousy

660
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,920
to stimulate the team.

661
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,440
I saw another post.

662
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,320
I can't do it anymore.

663
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,120
I stayed up all night.

664
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,120
And I'm still so lazy.

665
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,800
Don't call me.

666
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,600
I'm not the one who doesn't want to help you.

667
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,520
It's mainly because you can't have a good rest

668
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,920
and it will affect the second day.

669
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,720
I'm sorry.

670
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,560
I'm sorry.

671
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,480
I'm sorry.

672
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,480
I'm sorry.

673
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,480
I'm sorry.

674
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,480
I'm sorry.

675
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,480
I'm sorry.

676
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,480
I'm sorry.

677
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,480
I'm sorry.

678
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,480
I'm sorry.

679
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,480
I'm sorry.

680
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,480
I'm sorry.

681
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,480
I'm sorry.

682
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,880
I want to go to class the next day.

683
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,880
I'll ask you to give me a good lesson.

684
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,880
I'm so sleepy.

685
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,880
I want to sleep.

686
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,080
Wait.

687
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,880
Chief Steward really let me go like this?

688
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,080
The power is out.

689
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,480
I just went back to sleep.

690
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,880
It's a ghost.

691
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,480
It's a ghost.

692
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
Baby.

693
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,480
Baby.

694
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,480
Who's pretending to be a ghost at night?

695
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,480
You're so rude.

696
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,480
I'm busy these days.

697
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,480
You go and get the flashlight.

698
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,480
Come out.

699
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,480
I'll go with you.

700
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,480
Wait.

701
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,480
What's that?

702
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,480
What's that?

703
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,480
Help.

704
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,480
Help.

705
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,480
Help.

706
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,480
Help.

707
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,480
Help.

708
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,480
I'll help you.

709
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,480
I'll help you run the fastest.

710
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,480
It's not blood.

711
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,480
What's this?

712
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,480
Carbonic acid solution.

713
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,480
Low in carbon dioxide solution.

714
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,480
Red.

715
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,480
Early and mid-stage.

716
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,480
That's really beautiful.

717
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,480
You're quite capable.

718
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,480
History has broken through in a few days.

719
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
Go.

720
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
You're so boring.

721
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,480
So boring.

722
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,480
So boring.

723
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,480
You're a little fast.

724
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,480
Let's go.

725
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,480
You're so mean.

726
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
You're so mean.

727
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,480
The enemy is not good.

728
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
You're so mean.

729
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,480
Professor Tan, look.

730
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,480
My face.

731
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,480
He did this.

732
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,480
He's afraid that he can't compete with me.

733
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,480
He's being used by you.

734
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,480
Professor Tan.

735
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,480
I really didn't do it.

736
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,480
Professor Tan.

737
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,480
Other shops have stopped

738
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,480
except for the equipment.

739
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,480
Even the surveillance shop has stopped.

740
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,480
He's trying to pull me down.

741
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,480
He even thought of the evidence.

742
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,480
He's so good at this.

743
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,480
He's so good at this.

744
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,480
He's so good at this.

745
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,480
He's not as good as my high school classmate.

746
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,480
Because there's no surveillance.

747
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,480
So he's just drunk.

748
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,480
Right, Professor Tan?

749
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,480
Then tell me.

750
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,480
How did I get this wound?

751
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,480
Professor.

752
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,480
You can punish me if you want.

753
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,480
You've always been my academic leader.

754
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,480
I came to you

755
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,480
for the college entrance examination.

756
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,480
But what Senior Lin did.

757
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,480
To be honest, I'm very disappointed.

758
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,480
What's wrong with me?

759
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,480
Professor.

760
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,480
I'm not staying here anymore.

761
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,480
I wanted to take some honor and leave.

762
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,480
But I didn't get it.

763
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
I'm probably going to be punished.

764
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,480
I'm not trying.

765
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,480
You young people.

766
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,480
You're quite honest.

767
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,480
Professor.

768
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,480
Last night, I was clearly drunk.

769
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,480
But suddenly I stopped.

770
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,480
Senior Lin.

771
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,480
Why did you scare us?

772
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,480
We were scared.

773
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,480
No, no, no.

774
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,480
I'm here.

775
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
I won't run.

776
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,480
Professor Tan.

777
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,480
If you want to punish me,

778
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,480
then let me do it together.

779
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,480
Gu Xue Zheng.

780
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,480
You go out first.

781
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,480
When will Xiao Yu have a party?

782
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,480
It's hard to say.

783
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,480
Director Zheng is very busy today.

784
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,480
He asked you to tell me something.

785
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
What's wrong with your face?

786
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
I came for this.

787
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,480
Okay.

788
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,480
What about this?

789
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,480
Where's Jia Dong?

790
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,480
He just left.

791
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,480
I'll send him back.

792
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,480
He just left.

793
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,480
I learned from Jia Dong

794
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,480
about the situation of Lin Zhi Hua.

795
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,480
He said he wanted to...

796
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,480
He's lost his way.

797
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,480
He's starting to think about the prize money for the competition.

798
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,480
Okay.

799
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,480
Let him know.

800
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,480
Even this little thing.

801
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,480
I won't give it to him.

802
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,480
By the way, isn't Jia Dong preparing for the competition?

803
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,480
Why are you here?

804
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,480
I won't bother you.

805
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,480
I'll handle it myself.

806
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,480
I'm done.

807
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,480
The lab is out of control.

808
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,480
How's your team burning?

809
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,480
It's a group of passionate experts.

810
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,480
I'm sorry.

811
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,480
As long as the team is right,

812
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,480
I won't be sad.

813
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,480
Congratulations.

814
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,480
It seems that I can't win the hot pot.

815
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,480
But I miss you.

816
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,480
Okay, I won't talk to you anymore.

817
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,480
We have to go back to the lab tonight.

818
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,480
Remember to come and visit.

819
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,480
Okay.

820
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,480
Everyone who said that just now

821
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,480
is already clear enough.

822
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,480
Let me say it again.

823
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,480
Shu Lan...

824
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,480
Stop.

825
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,480
Stop.

826
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,480
We're going to open the hot pot.

827
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,480
Come on, sisters.

828
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,480
Cheers.

829
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
I mean...

830
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,480
Leaders, come on.

831
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,480
Come on.

832
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,480
What are you writing?

833
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,480
What are you writing?

834
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,480
Wen Bo, you're good.

835
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,480
You're reliable.

836
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,480
You've been studying for so many years.

837
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,480
I didn't know that

838
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,480
there was such a small path to take.

839
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,480
Leaders, don't worry.

840
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,480
I'm here.

841
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,480
I promise to return to school as soon as possible.

842
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,480
Okay, I'll send you a mail this time.

843
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,480
Do you want to have a group name?

844
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,480
As I see it,

845
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,480
the more plain and ordinary the name is,

846
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,480
the more it can show our rich inner sea.

847
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,480
Do you think it's right?

848
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,480
You haven't said

849
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,480
how we know if it's right or not.

850
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,480
Right or not is our name.

851
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,480
So cold.

852
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,480
Xue Qiao,

853
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,480
look at who you are.

854
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,480
If you go to the national competition,

855
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,480
you'll be the god of the world.

856
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,480
How about we call it

857
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,480
the top-level genius?

858
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,480
How about it?

859
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
I like it.

860
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,480
I like it, too.

861
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,480
Top-level genius.

862
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,480
It feels like a big tree with skin.

863
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,480
I like this.

864
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,480
I'll take this.

865
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,480
Okay.

866
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,480
Hello.

867
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,480
Are you back?

868
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,480
I'm on the road.

869
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,480
Wen Bo

870
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,480
took us to

871
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,480
the alley behind the school today.

872
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,480
Do you know?

873
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,480
We've been talking about it

874
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,480
at the hotpot restaurant.

875
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,480
What?

876
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,480
I've always had a question for you.

877
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,480
Do you have a boyfriend?

878
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,480
You've been secretly calling

879
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,480
our parents

880
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,480
to ask them about

881
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,480
Wu Xue Jiang.

882
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,480
You're suspicious.

883
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,480
I...

884
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,480
My brother.

885
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,480
Ming Zi.

886
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,480
Ming Zi, can you hear me?

887
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,480
My WeChat signature

888
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,480
is what you mentioned in the interview.

889
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,480
Don't let others define your life.

890
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,480
Did you hear that?

891
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,480
He loves you so much.

892
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,480
What are you doing?

893
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,480
Give me

894
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,480
all your stuff!

895
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,480
I'm sorry.

896
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,480
I'm sorry.

897
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,480
Brother.

898
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,480
We're all here.

899
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,480
We're all here.

900
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,480
We're all here.

901
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,480
We're all here.

902
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,480
We're all here.

903
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,480
We're all here.

904
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,480
Brother.

905
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,480
We're all here.

906
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,480
We're just here to make money.

907
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,480
Right?

908
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,480
Come on, guys.

909
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,480
Give us the money.

910
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,480
We'll pay you back.

911
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,480
Brother.

912
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,480
Brother.

913
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,480
Can you give me the receipt?

914
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,480
I'll transfer the money to you right away.

915
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,480
Are you kidding me?

916
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,480
The man in the back.

917
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,480
The man in the back.

918
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,480
It's you.

919
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,480
Is the computer on your back?

920
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,480
The computer is here.

921
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,480
Good boy.

922
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,480
You're quite a man.

923
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,480
I'll see

924
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,480
if it's your bone

925
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,480
or my stick.

926
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,480
Kill them all!

927
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,480
My bone!

928
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,480
My bone!

929
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,480
My bone!

930
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,480
My bone!

931
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,480
Smash them!

932
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,480
My computer!

933
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
My computer!

934
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,480
You!

935
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,480
Who are you?

936
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,480
Are you okay?

937
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,480
Are you hurt?

938
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,480
My computer!

939
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,480
Wait.

940
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,480
Gu Dan!

941
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,480
What's wrong with you?

942
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,480
Let me ask you.

943
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,480
Let me go!

944
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,480
Go!

945
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,480
Don't move.

946
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
Don't move.

947
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,480
Watch out!

948
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,480
You...

949
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,480
I'm sorry.

950
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,480
Watch out!

951
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,480
Don't run!

952
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,480
I know a lot.

953
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,480
I...

954
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,480
I'm sorry.

955
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,480
I'm sorry.

956
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,480
I'm sorry.

957
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,480
I'm sorry.

958
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,480
I'm sorry.

959
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,480
I'm sorry.

960
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,480
I'm sorry.

961
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,480
I told you I'm fine.

962
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,480
You're fine.

963
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,480
Let me see.

964
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,480
Does it hurt?

965
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,480
Don't move.

966
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,480
Does it hurt?

967
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,480
Didn't they say they didn't succeed?

968
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,480
Where's my head?

969
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,480
Is it okay?

970
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,480
Jia Dong.

971
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,480
Master.

972
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,480
Why are you the first one here?

973
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,480
Gao Rui and the others haven't arrived yet.

974
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,480
I'm nearby.

975
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,480
So I came quickly.

976
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,480
Why are you so hurt?

977
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,480
I'm asking you.

978
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,480
I'm asking Wen Bo.

979
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,480
My pants are dirty.

980
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,480
My pants are dirty.

981
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,480
My pants are dirty.

982
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,480
Aunt.

983
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,480
Aunt.

984
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,480
Jia Dong.

985
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,480
Let me in.

986
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,480
I want to see my aunt.

987
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,480
I'm not letting you in.

988
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,480
It's such a busy day.

989
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,480
She's not here.

990
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,480
I asked you to help me vent your anger.

991
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,480
Why did you hurt my master?

992
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,480
I didn't.

993
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,480
And Xiao Ke and Xiao Peng, forget it.

994
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,480
Why did you hurt her face?

995
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,480
Teach her a lesson.

996
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,480
Okay, don't believe it.

997
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,480
Teach her a lesson.

998
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,480
Excuse me.

999
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,480
Could this be done by Lin Jia Dong?

1000
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,480
Let me.

1001
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,480
It's okay.

1002
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,480
My hands can handle it.

1003
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,480
Do you still remember the president of B&C, Zheng?

1004
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,480
The one who wanted to do that stuff for you in that wine club.

1005
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,480
The innovation of the Boxue team.

1006
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,480
The development of the foreign industry.

1007
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,480
The獨流 of the industry.

1008
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,480
She's Lin Jia Dong's aunt.

1009
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,080
They have the same taste.

1010
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,080
You knew it.

1011
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,720
Why did you keep Lin Jia Dong?

1012
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,520
Aren't you afraid he'll sell you?

1013
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,880
Lin Jia Dong likes to make small moves.

1014
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,400
But it has nothing to do with him.

1015
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,360
He's just too wavering.

1016
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,560
He's easy to be used.

1017
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,760
You're so innocent.

1018
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:54,480
YoYo English Channel YouTube

1019
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,920
Light up a lamp, be careful

1020
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,120
So you won't hear the sound of empty space

1021
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,800
Break up memories

1022
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,600
Each line is a wrong path

1023
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,400
We're thinking about each other

1024
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,640
Let fate decide

1025
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,360
Let us give up all courage

1026
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,760
I'm willing to travel with you through time

1027
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,160
If you also

1028
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,880
understand the secrets in my eyes

1029
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:10,160
You'll find you're always in my heart

1030
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:16,440
I'm trying to open my arms

1031
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,560
Because I'm sure of love

1032
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,680
I'm listening to the wind

1033
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:29,720
It doesn't matter if the wind blows

1034
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,360
There's a sound very close

1035
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,720
I know it's hard to let go

1036
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:43,640
I'm trying to open my arms

1037
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,160
Because I'm sure of love

1038
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,680
I'm listening to the wind

1039
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,360
The wind is too strong

1040
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,640
I'm waiting for you

1041
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,640
I'm waiting for you

1042
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,640
I'm waiting for you

1043
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,640
I'm waiting for you

1044
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,640
I'm waiting for you

1045
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,640
I'm waiting for you

1046
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:12,120
It doesn't matter

1047
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,240
There's a sound very close

1048
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:22,600
I know it must be you
