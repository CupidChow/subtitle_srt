 ♫ Don't be afraid of the so-called top scorer ♫ 

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,480
 ♫ You're a legend in someone else's story too ♫

00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,200
 ♫ Don't hold back, grow with all your might ♫

 ♫ Flowers bloom at the height of summer ♫ 

7
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,620
 ♫ Now let's reformat this life anew ♫ 

8
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,480
 ♫ Physics and math aren't that hard ♫ 

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,860
 ♫ In the flaming youth,
we grow stronger together ♫ 

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,280
 ♫ My heart still burns with fiery heat ♫

 ♫ Follow the rhythm, let your spirit relieve ♫

 ♫ Let us break through time and space ♫ 

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,311
 

18
00:01:39,311 --> 00:01:40,870
Don't give them any chance.

19
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,100
Okay.

20
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,680
Watch me take them down.

21
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,480
Blue team scores again.

22
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,201
I'm at their flag now.

23
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:52,640
Bring it straight back.
Don't let the spinner move at all.

24
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,200
Blue team scores again.

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,830
- It's fine.
- Found a loophole.

26
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,110
- Go from here.
- Okay.

27
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,840
Blue team scores.

28
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,616
 
Score is now 18 to 18.

29
00:02:07,616 --> 00:02:09,900
- Captain, I'm here.
- Okay.

30
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,480
- Shu Lan, let's attack together.
- Okay.

31
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,030
- It's fine
- Don't rush.

32
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,010
- Go.
- I'm in.

33
00:02:16,976 --> 00:02:18,090
Red team scores.

34
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,821
I'm in.

35
00:02:19,821 --> 00:02:20,880
Blue team scores.
 

36
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,126
20 to 20.

37
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,010
Final round.

38
00:02:30,295 --> 00:02:31,400
- Ready.
- Ready.

39
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,250
- I'm ready.
- I'm ready.

40
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,870
Ladies and gentlemen, the match is counting down.

41
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,240
This will be the final round.

42
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,900
Let's wait and see.

43
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,350
The car is shaking badly now.

44
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,590
Both sides are fighting for control.

45
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,710
- Okay.
- With a nice spin, the controlled car

46
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,430
stops in Blue team's zone.

47
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,420
Blue team takes the final win.

48
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,210
Everybody, as the final buzzer goes off,

49
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,840
the winner of NISC goes to Capital University.

50
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,640
Thanks to the two teams from both universities

51
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,760
for bringing us this amazing match.

52
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,920
Let's applaud our champion and the runner-up.

53
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,692
CU...

54
00:03:07,692 --> 00:03:11,970
- Champion...
- We won!

55
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:18,432
CU...

56
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:23,193
CU...

57
00:03:23,193 --> 00:03:27,849
CU...

58
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:31,490
What's going on? Didn't you say it was foolproof?

59
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:36,140
CU...

60
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,930
I've got a surprise for you later.

61
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,680
What surprise?

62
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,100
Now, let's welcome the champion to the stage.

63
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:53,760
CU...

64
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:02,000
I heard after we broke down,
you made the counter plan.

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,250
Almost took me down.

66
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,180
If it were you, would you give me a break?

67
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,650
Of course not.

68
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,760
But I gotta say, you're really good.

69
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,510
Congrats.

70
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:20,512
CU...

71
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:24,860
Please welcome Ms. Zheng
to present the award to our champion.

72
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,590
Congrats.

73
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,620
Congrats.

74
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,075
You guys are so lucky.

75
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:43,220
Fair and square. We earned it.

76
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:55,772
CU...

77
00:04:55,772 --> 00:04:57,710
Congrats to Capital University
for coming back in the last ten minutes

78
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,880
and taking the title.

79
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,790
Everyone here was nervous for you.

80
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,710
Any words for the crowd?

81
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,040
This win is from years of training.

82
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,650
The match had some twists,

83
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,570
but the result was no surprise.

84
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:14,055
I'd like to thank someone
for the huge support for us.

85
00:05:14,055 --> 00:05:15,964
Gu Xue Jiao, we're in public.

86
00:05:15,964 --> 00:05:17,690
Careful there.

87
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,890
That person is Ms. Zheng from B&amp;C Motors.

88
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,040
Ms. Zheng, the captain thanks you by name.

89
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,420
Is that because you have
a long-standing arrangement with them?

90
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:33,000
Uh, Miss, shouldn't you be
focusing on the winning team?

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,147
Ms. Zheng, B&amp;C and CU's
honorary captain Lin Zhi Hua

92
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:37,707
are in an industry-academia collaboration.

93
00:05:37,707 --> 00:05:42,037
Was this title of Capital University prearranged?

94
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,467
I assure everyone
this contest was fair and square.

95
00:05:48,467 --> 00:05:49,487
No shady deals at all.

96
00:05:49,487 --> 00:05:52,057
Please interview the champion team.

97
00:05:52,057 --> 00:05:54,167
Let them enjoy this moment.

98
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:00,320
Ms. Zheng, may I ask
if this competition you hosted

99
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,339
represents the highest level nationwide?

100
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:04,529
Absolutely.

101
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:08,049
Does that mean
Capital University's intelligent info tech

102
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:09,239
is now number one in the country?

103
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:12,649
Xue Jiao's move is brilliant.

104
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:15,609
Here, I want to announce something to everyone.

105
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:18,600
CU's intelligent info tech will be applied

106
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,609
to the C1 driverless car

107
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:23,669
developed by our honorary captain Lin Zhi Hua.

108
00:06:24,864 --> 00:06:28,014
Ms. Zheng, do you have faith in C1?

109
00:06:30,997 --> 00:06:33,649
You've all seen the competition results.

110
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:36,479
And it's a contest hosted by B&amp;C itself.

111
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,109
If the host itself has no confidence
in the champion,

112
00:06:39,109 --> 00:06:43,289
then how are we, the competing teams and users,
supposed to feel?

113
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:47,609
Ms. Zheng, please answer my question.

114
00:06:47,609 --> 00:06:52,289
Do you have confidence
in the champion selected by B&amp;C Motors?

115
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:56,559
Of course,

116
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:59,092
- I have confidence.
- She admitted our technology

117
00:06:59,092 --> 00:07:01,209
on behalf of B&amp;C in front of the media.

118
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:03,219
Does that mean
she won't cause us trouble anymore?

119
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:06,239
Someone who caused trouble once
will definitely do it again.

120
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,609
Shu Lan.

121
00:07:07,609 --> 00:07:09,239
Can't you say something nicer?

122
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:11,379
- Yeah...
- Alright, fine.

123
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:13,219
Gu Xue Jiao is quite something.

124
00:07:13,219 --> 00:07:18,549
I believe Capital University's future cooperation
with B&amp;C will only get better.

125
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:24,419
Everybody, Ms. Zheng has something to attend to.

126
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:25,949
I'll answer questions for her.

127
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:27,189
Please come here.

128
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:28,649
Come over here.

129
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,359
Just you wait.

130
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:32,029
This isn't over.

131
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:43,659
So this is your so-called surprise?

132
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:45,879
How was it? Do you like it?

133
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:48,119
Super satisfying.

134
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:49,359
Congratulations.

135
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:50,999
Thank you.

136
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:06,059
Hello!

137
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:10,599
Why do you come so early?

138
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:12,609
I haven't even finished setting up yet.

139
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:14,849
I wanted to come early to help you with that.

140
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:16,879
You bought all these things?

141
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,371
Zhi Yue... Wait.

142
00:08:21,371 --> 00:08:25,600
Lin Zhi Yue, thank you for coming.

143
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,005
Calling me by my full name, what's up?

144
00:08:29,005 --> 00:08:32,271
We can talk later.
Let's focus on setting up first.

145
00:08:32,271 --> 00:08:34,521
You bought these flowers, too?

146
00:08:35,741 --> 00:08:37,611
They're really pretty.

147
00:08:43,561 --> 00:08:46,261
 

148
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,800
Is this...

149
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,300
Actually, there's no celebration.

150
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,280
I prepared all this for you.

151
00:09:09,411 --> 00:09:10,531
Shi Yun.

152
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:12,361
Shi Yun.

153
00:09:14,391 --> 00:09:16,511
What? Your sister won.

154
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:18,720
Aren't you gonna congratulate her?

155
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,120
Don't be so down. It's just a gold medal.

156
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,080
I have tons of them. I'll bring some for you.

157
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,890
Are you showing off?

158
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,400
No, absolutely not.

159
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,320
I mean I can give you all the gold medals
I won at design contests.

160
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,740
If you find it not enough, I...

161
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,890
I'll keep competing and winning.

162
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,101
By then, Xue Jiao will have only one gold medal,

163
00:09:39,101 --> 00:09:40,392
but you'll have so many.

164
00:09:40,392 --> 00:09:42,410
You still beat her.

165
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,740
I don't need it.

166
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,705
I will earn my own medals.

167
00:09:45,705 --> 00:09:47,760
Shi Yun, don't be mad.

168
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,270
I'm not saying second place is bad.

169
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:53,100
I just mean

170
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,530
you're already amazing.

171
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,285
Rank doesn't really show your true strength.

172
00:09:57,285 --> 00:09:58,866
Believe in yourself.

173
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:01,096
Your future will be brighter.

174
00:10:16,435 --> 00:10:19,600
I'm bad with words, always making you mad.

175
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,320
Just now, I saw you were gonna lose.

176
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,440
So I googled some comforting quotes
for second place.

177
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,670
No need to comfort the second place.

178
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,290
No... Look at this one.

179
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,560
It doesn't matter if you win or lose.

180
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,900
Being happy matters most.

181
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,220
Who says I'm not happy?

182
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,980
You don't have to pretend.

183
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,280
If you're upset, just say it.

184
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,557
You wanna cheer me up.

185
00:10:43,557 --> 00:10:45,622
It's easy.

186
00:10:45,622 --> 00:10:47,800
Just promise me.

187
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,670
Promise what?

188
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,340
 Just promise me that in your heart, 

189
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,670
 I'm always number one. 

190
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:08,620
This is the work schedule for working on the new lab model,

191
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,050
made by the champion captain.

192
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:15,650
This is the date schedule
made for the captain herself by her boyfriend.

193
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,890
- Let me see.
- Let me see.

194
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,810
 

195
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:23,197
 

196
00:11:23,197 --> 00:11:24,221
Not bad.
 

197
00:11:24,221 --> 00:11:26,440
Covering both food and entertainment.

198
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,840
Pretty good.

199
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,980
- But...
- Too time-consuming.

200
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,740
Right. Dates take up too much time.

201
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,680
I'm saying this work schedule is unreasonable.

202
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,360
We gotta consider the whole lab's efficiency.

203
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,310
Working so hard, are you trying to be

204
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,960
the lab's big boss after I graduate?

205
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,620
Well, that's only a matter of time.

206
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,431
I just want to learn more
from you while you're here.

207
00:11:58,431 --> 00:12:01,310
I can already imagine
what you'll be like when you grow up.

208
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,270
Just like my sister, a career woman.

209
00:12:07,911 --> 00:12:11,600
Capital University Team
was stripped of the NISC title,

210
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,840
as decided by the Committee due to rule violation.

211
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,600
Shameless.

212
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,050
Let's go.

213
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,622
Where?

214
00:12:20,622 --> 00:12:22,642
Time for the final battle.

215
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:41,840
Ms. Zheng, why did you cancel our championship?

216
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,229
You mean this?

217
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:46,580
We received complaints about rule violations

218
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,290
by the Capital University team
during the competition.

219
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,530
The committee decided to disqualify you
and revoke the championship.

220
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,800
I'm in a tough spot, too.

221
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,920
After all, I told all the media

222
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,070
that I had faith in you.

223
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,340
Who filed the complaint?

224
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,720
Many people.

225
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,390
It would hurt B&amp;C's reputation.

226
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:07,790
You are the one who's been
damaging B&amp;C's reputation.

227
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,970
Dr. Cai, I didn't expect you'd come...

228
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,060
I've always admired the speed of tech reserves in the Asia region,

229
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,680
especially in your area.

230
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,500
I often praise your team
in front of other regional teams.

231
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,120
Thank you, Dr. Cai.

232
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,245
But I didn't know your promotion and rewards

233
00:13:27,245 --> 00:13:30,180
came at the cost of stealing
so many tech achievements

234
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,360
from all these startups.

235
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,310
 

236
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,652
No...

237
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:40,170
-  So, it was you... 
- Wait, Dr. Cai.

238
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,920
I talked to each one of them on your list.

239
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,860
Here's what they sent back to me.

240
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,920
What list?

241
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,170
- Ugh...
-  Yes, it was me. 

242
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:55,630
Give me the contacts of all the teams
B&amp;C has screwed over.

243
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,890
I know you must have them.

244
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,496
 

245
00:14:03,496 --> 00:14:05,054
 

246
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:06,160
 

247
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,479
 

248
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:08,900
 

249
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,514
 

250
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:15,360
I'm terribly sorry to let you see this.

251
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,920
Lin, thanks to you,

252
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,430
B&amp;C Motors got to root out this big mole.

253
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,800
Don't worry.

254
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,410
We will deal with this seriously.

255
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,380
It won't affect our future cooperation.

256
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:32,460
Sorry, Dr. Cai, we've decided to end

257
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,230
our tech partnership with B&amp;C Motors.

258
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,830
Why?

259
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,430
Everyone knows we and other startups
have been treated unfairly.

260
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,490
Your company breached the contract first.

261
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:51,170
We have the right to choose not to cooperate.

262
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,530
It's a demonstration of contract spirit.

263
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:01,220
Alright, I respect your choice.

264
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,100
But if you ever need help,

265
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,670
you can always reach out to me.

266
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,170
I will.

267
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,400
So you already contacted Dr. Cai.

268
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,931
Just like that, you took Ms. Zheng down.

269
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:22,096
And you even lied to me about it.

270
00:15:22,096 --> 00:15:24,387
I gotta thank you, champion.

271
00:15:24,387 --> 00:15:28,097
Otherwise, how could we have a legit reason?

272
00:15:28,097 --> 00:15:29,290
Of course.

273
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,800
You have to pick the fruit yourself.

274
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,840
Can't just wait for the enemy to surrender.

275
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,670
Let's go. Let's have a little celebration.

276
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,070
You forgot the schedule?

277
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,425
I have lab work this afternoon.

278
00:15:41,425 --> 00:15:43,936
I'll help you. More effective.

279
00:15:43,936 --> 00:15:46,550
Let's relax now.

280
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,790
Lin, you were fully prepared this time.

281
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,560
It was a close call.

282
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,100
But I hope next time, if you have something,

283
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,480
you can tell me first.

284
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,080
I can be the person you trust completely.

285
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,630
Okay?

286
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,600
 Trust. 

287
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,360
 Trust. 

288
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,900
 Should I tell you what I already know? 

289
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,395
Good job, Petal.

290
00:16:31,395 --> 00:16:35,240
You not only saved C1
out of B&amp;C's traps unscathed,

291
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,940
but also made a name for yourself.

292
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,820
Wanna give your sister's investment pool a push

293
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,600
by bringing the project to Linqi?

294
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,640
I didn't come to you for this, Zhi Yue.

295
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:54,250
Then it's for your relationship?

296
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:03,470
I've been keeping something from Xue Jiao.

297
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:08,510
I wanted to tell her many times, but didn't get the chance.

298
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:12,030
Now I feel like I have to tell her.

299
00:17:15,266 --> 00:17:17,220
Don't look at me like that.

300
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,860
She's hiding the same thing from me.

301
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,430
I just worry that if I say it out loud,

302
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,390
it will ruin our relationship.

303
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,750
What if she thinks differently?

304
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,270
So what is it?

305
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,460
I can't tell you.

306
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,840
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

307
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,740
It's not important.

308
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,700
What can't you tell me?

309
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,840
You haven't said anything yet.
How do you know I won't believe you?

310
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,360
Mark my words. Girls hate it most
when you're not honest.

311
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,920
What exactly happened? Tell me.

312
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,080
I still plan to sell C1 to B&amp;C Motors.

313
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,490
That's it?

314
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,680
Hello, Xue Jiao.

315
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,080
Where are you?

316
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,360
On my way back to the lab.

317
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,160
I'm going to put the trophy in the lab.

318
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,300
After all, we earned this together.

319
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,497
I'll come and find you.

320
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,400
What's wrong?

321
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,060
Talk later.

322
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,610
I'm off.

323
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,831
What is it?

324
00:18:23,831 --> 00:18:26,110
So mysterious.

325
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,050
You're the girl who kissed in the hospital.

326
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,560
What?

327
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,490
What kiss?

328
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,390
Kid, why are you here all alone?

329
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,970
My mom went to the restroom. She told me to wait here.

330
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,430
Besides, I'm not a kid.

331
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,670
I'm already in fifth grade.

332
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:48,220
Okay, let me stay with you and wait for your mom.

333
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,810
Let's go.

334
00:19:01,396 --> 00:19:03,856
 Guess who I ran into. 

335
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,780
Study so hard?

336
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,720
Messi's Legendary Journey?

337
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,220
- You like soccer?
- Yeah.

338
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,490
Did you catch the last World Cup qualifier?

339
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,540
China beat Korea one to zero.

340
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,700
Of course.

341
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,530
Thanks to me, I had over
100 people watching with me.

342
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,390
It was so intense.

343
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,930
You're just like your boyfriend.

344
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:40,530
A bragging big talker.

345
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,880
What did he brag about?
Tell me.

346
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,260
He'll get here later.
We'll call him out to his face.

347
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:49,540
That's not gonna happen
because his big talk actually came true.

348
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,770
Came true?

349
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:51,770
Yeah.

350
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,560
He told me in the hospital

351
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,730
that China would win one to zero.

352
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,290
And he was right.

353
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:02,290
He also said Messi would win the 2022 World Cup.

354
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,990
That's years away.

355
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,250
- Your boyfriend...
-  Actually, I have a secret. 

356
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,670
 Actually, I have a secret, too. 

357
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,692
My mom said...

358
00:20:14,692 --> 00:20:18,770
Do you wanna know what you'll be like

359
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,360
ten years from now?

360
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,290
I've liked you for ten years.

361
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,290
Xue Jiao.

362
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,260
Why are you sitting here?

363
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,530
I've been looking for you.

364
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,630
Remember where this is?

365
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,744
Actually, I have a secret.

366
00:21:05,744 --> 00:21:07,914
What secret?

367
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,880
You remember it all now?

368
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,050
If I hadn't run into that kid today,

369
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,540
how long were you gonna keep it from me?

370
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,210
Sorry.

371
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,540
Believe it or not, I planned to tell you today.

372
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,385
And I've been waiting for the right moment.

373
00:21:50,385 --> 00:21:53,260
When is the right moment anyway?

374
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,080
I'm afraid the memories of both lives
will get mixed up.

375
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,570
It might hurt us.

376
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,600
I'm afraid that if I tell you,
you won't accept it.

377
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,930
You know what's most unacceptable?

378
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,640
It's you who looked down on me in the last life.

379
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,500
Even in this new life,
you still treat people like idiots.

380
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,690
Xue Jiao, it's not what you think.

381
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,010
I have never thought of you that way.

382
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,600
But that's exactly what you did!

383
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,870
You knew everything.

384
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,835
I... I know it's too late to say anything now.

385
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:37,080
But I planned to tell you before signing the C1 transfer agreement with B&amp;C.

386
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,370
- But...
- You're selling C1?

387
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,930
Can you get the ball for us?

388
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,770
Thanks.

389
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:48,833
Xue Jiao, let me explain.

390
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,080
Don't explain.

391
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,200
I don't wanna hear it.

392
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,860
Why do I have to listen when you want to talk?

393
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,210
Xue Jiao... Don't follow me!

394
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,352
Sorry, the seat is...

395
00:23:58,352 --> 00:23:59,500
I didn't want to come.

396
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,610
I was supposed to meet with your brother.

397
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:05,530
- Then where is he?
- Ask your boyfriend.

398
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:13,310
 

399
00:24:16,962 --> 00:24:23,142
I'm celebrating
that I finally see someone clearly.

400
00:24:23,142 --> 00:24:25,380
Not that great, though.

401
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,588
Spill it.

402
00:24:27,588 --> 00:24:30,820
Why did you fight with my sister?

403
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,030
Did you fall for someone else?

404
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,140
Am I that kind of person?

405
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,220
What else would a man care about?

406
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,110
Looks like no man escapes the natural law.

407
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,560
What natural law?

408
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,530
Food, sex, and desire.

409
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,560
That's human nature.

410
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,960
But if you dare hurt my sister...

411
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,640
"By nature, we desire food and sex."

412
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,543
I did hurt your sister's trust in me a bit,

413
00:24:58,543 --> 00:25:00,504
but it's not because of those.

414
00:25:00,504 --> 00:25:02,460
Then, what is it? Tell me, hurry.

415
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,490
I just told a white lie.

416
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,010
Isn't a white lie still a lie?

417
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,690
A white lie means it's forgivable?

418
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,160
What white lie?

419
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,320
That's just an excuse.

420
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,260
What matters most in a relationship?

421
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,400
It's trust!

422
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,910
If you love her, be 100% honest with her.

423
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,950
Lies you tell for her own good...

424
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,160
Does she really feel good about them?

425
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,720
That's just what you think.

426
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,986
No matter how deeply you're in love,

427
00:25:25,986 --> 00:25:27,787
you're still two different people.

428
00:25:27,787 --> 00:25:30,997
He can't be exactly how you want.

429
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,230
Got it?

430
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:41,400
If you truly meant well,

431
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,785
then lies told for the other's good
aren't that bad, right?

432
00:25:45,785 --> 00:25:48,345
Thoughts matter, not just the actions.

433
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,360
What about my brother?

434
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,050
Did he escape the natural law?

435
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:05,920
Your brother is different.

436
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,160
He's different.

437
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,970
Your phone.

438
00:26:14,353 --> 00:26:16,800
- Not answering.
- I'll answer it for you then.

439
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,930
Hello?

440
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,760
Ms. Sun, your bestie is wasted.

441
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,010
Come and pick her up.

442
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,250
My words didn't help anyway.

443
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,880
Okay.

444
00:26:27,777 --> 00:26:29,947
Sun Tian Tian.

445
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:40,250
 

446
00:26:44,761 --> 00:26:46,482
You hungry?

447
00:26:46,482 --> 00:26:48,133
No, I don't wanna eat.

448
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:50,183
Come on, have some.

449
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,370
Smells good.

450
00:26:57,669 --> 00:27:01,540
- Where's my card?
- Wen Bo, your senior brought it for you.

451
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,880
- Thanks!
- It's alright.

452
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,170
Gotta grab some food.

453
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,850
 

454
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,800
 Boyfriends come and go. 

455
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,060
 Sisters stand strong. 

456
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,880
Hi, Dad?

457
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,671
Hey, you little brat, what's going on?

458
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:52,150
Why did you come back without a word?

459
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:54,830
Did you get into trouble over there
and sneak back home?

460
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,690
Dad, give me some credit.

461
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:57,800
My visa expired.

462
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,190
I came back to renew it.

463
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:04,140
Wait, I remember your visa still has plenty of time left.

464
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,460
It's my turn to submit the paperwork.

465
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,640
Dad, I gotta go.

466
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,190
I'll go home right after. Bye-bye.

467
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:15,640
This kid... Something's off.

468
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,050
This is all for the Xue Jiao
that you keep thinking about.

469
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,510
Hello.

470
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:45,290
These are flowers we botany majors cultivated.

471
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:48,050
Would you like any help?

472
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:54,120
What flowers do you give someone for a breakup?

473
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,900
Breakup?

474
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,600
- If you're trying to win her back...
- No... Not me.

475
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,630
My friend. She broke up with her boyfriend.

476
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:04,150
I just wanna get her a bouquet to cheer her up.

477
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:09,160
Why do you look so happy about her breakup?

478
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,820
Do I? I'm really sorry for her.

479
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,700
This one.

480
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,290
Yellow.

481
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,450
May their love turn completely sour.

482
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,890
- Wrap it up for me. 
 - Okay.

483
00:29:31,105 --> 00:29:32,700
 Xue Jiao. 

484
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,750
 I know honesty is the foundation of everything. 

485
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,340
 But sometimes, hiding something
isn't out of malice. 

486
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:47,950
 To you, my past self is just a bunch
of awful memories. 

487
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,060
 That day when I found out you were
the one I was tutoring, I thought that 

488
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,760
 if this was fate, 

489
00:30:00,691 --> 00:30:03,301
 then let's start over. 

490
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,560
 I thought that keeping some things from you 

491
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,680
 would actually be better. 

492
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,740
 But I was wrong. 

493
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:18,880
 Does it sound like I'm making excuses? 

494
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:31,930
Screw your white lies.

495
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,300
 But I was wrong. 

496
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:37,730
 Any concealment or deceit
is just irresponsibility. 

497
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,690
 Forgive me for hesitating 

498
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,965
 and not telling you the truth sooner. 

499
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:45,670
 I apologize for my selfishness. 

500
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,280
 I'm sorry. 

501
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,300
What are you doing here?

502
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,150
I don't think I need to explain it.

503
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,360
This is the lab.

504
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,120
It's work hours.

505
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,550
Don't disturb them.

506
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,500
Please leave.

507
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,160
I'm here for Xue Jiao, not for you.

508
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,310
What? Do I need your permission?

509
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,990
You're not her boyfriend anymore.

510
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,720
Who says I'm not?

511
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,360
You don't need to know.

512
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,280
I know what I know.

513
00:31:53,635 --> 00:31:56,655
Do you know what yellow roses mean?

514
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,310
Why are you asking?

515
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,000
Look it up.

516
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,000
Xue Jiao must be very happy
to have an old friend like you, all brawn.

517
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,850
All brawn?

518
00:32:13,827 --> 00:32:15,497
What do you mean?

519
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:24,790
 Yellow roses are the only kind of roses
without a romantic meaning. 

520
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:27,780
 They symbolize friendship and care. 

521
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,440
Hello, Tian Tian.

522
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,550
It's me... I just got back.

523
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:10,200
I called you as soon as I landed.

524
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,160
Yeah, I miss you, old friend.

525
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,070
Actually, I need a favor from you.

526
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,960
Coming...

527
00:33:20,883 --> 00:33:22,643
Come in.

528
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,920
Sun Tian Tian is using us
to test her new milk tea again.

529
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,600
We should start charging her.

530
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,400
Everyone's getting work-fat.

531
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,440
We've all put on weight lately.

532
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,880
What Sun Tian Tian?

533
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,210
That's Ms. Sun.

534
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,710
Peach oolong tea,

535
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:51,070
zero sugar, less ice,
crunchy popping boba instead of normal boba.

536
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,670
Thanks. Exactly what I wanted.

537
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,990
Yi Tian Yu?

538
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,352
How did you...

539
00:33:58,352 --> 00:34:00,240
Surprise?

540
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,940
I told you, as long as I want,

541
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,873
there's nowhere I can't get to
and nothing I can't pull off.

542
00:34:07,873 --> 00:34:09,960
You did pull off a bit of a shock.

543
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,070
Let me introduce myself.

544
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,990
I'm Xue Jiao's high school classmate.

545
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,320
A very close one.

546
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,590
Pick whatever flavor you want.

547
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,450
Thanks...

548
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,370
What flavor do you want?

549
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,470
I forgot. You don't drink this.

550
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:29,380
Says who?

551
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,300
No need to force yourself.

552
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,620
I love milk tea.

553
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,630
You. Hurry and pick your milk tea.

554
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,920
Don't hold up the line.

555
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,650
Yeah.

556
00:34:55,244 --> 00:34:56,300
And you.

557
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,310
Leave if you're done.
Don't hold people up at work.

558
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:07,889
 

559
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:24,880
 

560
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,840
 

561
00:36:36,085 --> 00:36:38,285
You've come home?

562
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,320
I'm just back to grab some stuff.

563
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,960
I'll take the useful things back to my dorm.

564
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,580
You can throw away the rest before moving out.

565
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,400
Who said we're moving?

566
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,210
The more people think we're down and out,

567
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,570
the more we have to keep our pride.

568
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:59,210
Mom, don't be so proud.

569
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,480
Just face reality.

570
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,570
Sell the house and pay off debts.

571
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:08,390
Maybe there's a chance to start over.

572
00:37:09,473 --> 00:37:11,980
You've always lived by what others think.

573
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,030
To hold on to your pride,

574
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:18,080
are you really happy?

575
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,320
That's why I think you're hopeless.

576
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,585
You couldn't beat Gu Xue Jiao
on the college entrance exam.

577
00:37:22,585 --> 00:37:24,356
Finally got a chance to be in a national contest,

578
00:37:24,356 --> 00:37:26,227
and you lost to her again.

579
00:37:26,227 --> 00:37:29,089
Sometimes I wonder if you do this on purpose.

580
00:37:29,089 --> 00:37:30,883
Are you just fighting me

581
00:37:30,883 --> 00:37:34,023
to make me angry and embarrass me?

582
00:37:36,648 --> 00:37:40,490
Now look, she moved into a big house.

583
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:42,610
And we're moving from a fancy neighborhood

584
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,420
to an old rundown place.

585
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,220
Would you want to live there?

586
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,240
Is the second place in the national contest

587
00:37:49,969 --> 00:37:51,619
so embarrassing?

588
00:37:52,888 --> 00:37:56,538
Who in this world would remember second place?

589
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:01,725
I've always given you the best
since you were little.

590
00:38:01,725 --> 00:38:03,857
But you? Look at these.

591
00:38:03,857 --> 00:38:05,559
Look.

592
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:07,869
How many first places have you won?

593
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,020
My daughter shouldn't lose to anyone.

594
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,170
Forget it, maybe that's just your fate.

595
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:21,070
Yes.

596
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:25,309
Back then, when I couldn't get first in class, you yelled at me.

597
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,110
But when I finally got first place
in my grade in English,

598
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:33,500
you still complained that my total score wasn't high enough.

599
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,472
Sometimes, I'm curious.

600
00:38:35,472 --> 00:38:38,532
If I had got into Capital University

601
00:38:38,532 --> 00:38:42,390
and won first place in the national contest,

602
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,480
would you really be content?

603
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,220
No, you're never content.

604
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,280
Because in your eyes,

605
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,690
I'll never be the daughter who truly makes you proud.

606
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,050
So sometimes, I even forget

607
00:39:10,505 --> 00:39:13,275
that maybe I'm actually quite good.

608
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:25,210
Yeah, I lost this competition,
but I lost with honor.

609
00:39:26,078 --> 00:39:31,090
Second place nationwide is just the beginning of my science track.

610
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:33,090
From now on,

611
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,490
I won't be swayed by anyone's opinions.

612
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:52,405
By the way, I'm not moving to the new house.

613
00:39:52,405 --> 00:39:54,525
I'll live on my own.

614
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:43,180
Shi Yun, if you're sad, it's okay to cry.

615
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,441
Then, let's go.

616
00:40:48,441 --> 00:40:50,901
I'll take you to eat something good.

617
00:40:55,574 --> 00:40:58,004
You walked all the way with me

618
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,725
from my doorstep to here.

619
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:02,455
Why didn't you

620
00:41:03,032 --> 00:41:06,242
ask me why I'm crying?

621
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:12,590
When you're down, I just wanna be there with you.

622
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:16,300
And I've been calling you,
but you never picked up.

623
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:21,658
Seeing you okay now means everything.

624
00:41:24,888 --> 00:41:26,838
Say that again.

625
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:43,670
I said something wrong again.

626
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,092
Don't cry... Alright...

627
00:41:45,092 --> 00:41:47,130
I'm sorry... Don't cry...

628
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,892
Alright, don't cry...

629
00:41:48,892 --> 00:41:50,720
Hush now...

630
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:04,120
What... are you looking at?

631
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:11,224
You look like...

632
00:42:11,224 --> 00:42:13,980
Your tears are... "ascending to the blue sky".

633
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,220
 

634
00:42:15,225 --> 00:42:17,740
Your foundation is melting off.

635
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,250
You...

636
00:42:20,513 --> 00:42:24,054
If you don't know how to use poetry, don't just throw it around.

637
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,680
You actually look better now
than when you're crying.

638
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,570
You mean I look ugly when crying?

639
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:35,090
I never said that.

640
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:37,770
That's not what I meant. I swear.

641

662
00:45:01,539 --> 00:45:05,680
 ♫ Because I'm certain of this love ♫ 

663
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,400
 ♫ Summit of our youth ♫ 

664
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:15,201
 ♫ Even if the wind roars, it's okay ♫ 

665
00:45:15,201 --> 00:45:19,349
 ♫ There's a figure approaching ♫ 

666
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:26,425
 ♫ I know it must be you ♫
