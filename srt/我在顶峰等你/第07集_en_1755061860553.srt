1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Try to grow the flowers in the summer

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now tell the truth about life

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's not complicated to count the flowers

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The youth is swaying

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We are getting stronger

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My heart is still hot and boiling

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Follow the rhythm and release it gently

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The night wind is blowing, only the fireflies are in the way

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will fly with you bravely

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My love is still hot and boiling

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The bright and bright eyes

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let us cross the barrier of time

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You are good at making green tea.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What green tea? I don't understand.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yes, yes, yes.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Although I was framed, smoking is harmful to health.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Middle school students can't smoke.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What you did is out of concern for us.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
By the way, why are you here today?

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm here to catch people.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Catch people?

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I have to go now.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I have time to go to my class and watch the game.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Gu Xuejiao, you are pretty.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Look, I am studying in the classroom.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I am being criticized by English words in the court.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Only by practicing hard will power can I fight against the school in the middle of the world.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's more harmful than the pressure of the industry.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What?

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I saw it just now.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
When your deskmate Nan Sheng went on the court,

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
the whole court was shouting for you.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
No, Brother Ling.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yi Tianyu is my deskmate. I have to like him.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What is this?

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The origin of the silkworm is what we see every day.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Which ancient man said this?

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He said it well. I will write it down.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Maybe I can use it in the language test.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Today is the 15th.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You can't catch up with the study progress.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I almost missed the chance to be a second generation.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Anyway, no one can stop me from making progress.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It will drag me down and affect my thinking.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I can't eat the kuihlao again.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
From now on, the elimination test is the biggest reward for me.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Including you, Brother Ling.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Bye. I'm leaving.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The competition is over.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The competition is over.

53
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You said you wanted to recite English.

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You told me not to disturb you.

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You are not fooling me.

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
No.

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Mom, I'm sorry. I was wrong.

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I have a basketball competition today.

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So I just...

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Basketball competition?

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You are a senior.

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You still have the heart to watch the basketball competition?

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I just went there for two hours.

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I will be back soon.

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I can do a simulation for two hours.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
If you don't work hard,

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Gu Xuejiao will catch up with you.

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Her mom is very happy these days.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
She is dragging me down and making me sick.

70
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You still don't know how to get in.

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You are really a good daughter to your mom.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But I am the ninth in grade.

73
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Gu Xuejiao passed the college entrance exam in the big luck.

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
She can't compete with me.

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And she also went to the basketball competition today.

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Why can't I go?

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Why are you so loud?

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You learned to talk back?

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You learned to talk back?

80
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I...

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You know what you are doing.

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You are going to pass the final exam soon.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
If you don't pass the top five this time,

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
you don't have to go back to this house.

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Why are you so loud?

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Who?

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yes.

88
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I am her parents.

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Mom.

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Gu.

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You have lived in my house for so many years.

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yes.

93
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Look at the new door frame.

94
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It has become an old door frame.

95
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The new furniture has become an old furniture.

96
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yes.

97
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The new key.

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Gu.

99
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
New car key.

100
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You bought a new car.

101
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's company's.

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Company's.

103
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Why?

104
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You are going to start a new business so soon?

105
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It seems that you are quite generous.

106
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Come on.

107
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Drink some water.

108
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's like this.

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Liu.

110
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I want to discuss with you.

111
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Look at our rent.

112
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's this quarter.

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We pay the rent for the next quarter.

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Can you pay it back?

115
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I will pay it back for the next quarter.

116
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Gu.

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What do you mean?

118
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You mean Liu doesn't understand?

119
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
No.

120
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I didn't mean that.

121
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I didn't.

122
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
To be honest,

123
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I am a little nervous.

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
We are all old colleagues in the factory.

125
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Don't worry.

126
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I am not here to ask for rent.

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I am here to return the rent.

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I want to sell this house.

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Sell it?

130
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We want this house.

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Look.

132
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Our house is here.

133
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
With the increase in urbanization rate

134
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
and the effect of urban planning,

135
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
this is the best place to choose

136
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
in the new stone tube district.

137
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
This is the best place to exchange

138
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
the route and the subway route.

139
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
We buy this house now.

140
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
In less than a year,

141
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
we will definitely pay the rent.

142
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I didn't get a fever.

143
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Why is my brain burning?

144
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Why is my brain burning?

145
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I didn't say that.

146
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Brother Ling said that.

147
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
He has the algorithm model

148
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
to analyze market markets.

149
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He has a lot of markets.

150
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The truth is

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
often in the hands of a few people.

152
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Dad.

153
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Look at your big factory.

154
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
If Brother Ling didn't calculate

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
the development trend of the communication market,

156
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
he would have reminded me in time

157
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
that your old thinking

158
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
is now wide open.

159
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yes.

160
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
By the way,

161
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
can Xiao Lin's algorithm

162
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
calculate the market of stock?

163
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Of course.

164
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yes.

165
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Look.

166
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Brother Ling recommended a stock

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
before.

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
6003134.

169
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Look at this.

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's so much.

171
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Buy a house.

172
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
We listen to Xiao Lin.

173
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The last time you went to the stock exchange,

174
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Xiao Lin saved our family's life.

175
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So this time

176
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
we listen to him.

177
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yes.

178
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Look, your mom is right.

179
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
No, honey.

180
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I...

181
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I...

182
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I lost some money in the stock.

183
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's not necessarily enough.

184
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You...

185
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You be careful.

186
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Get up.

187
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
There is no way to get money.

188
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Let's find a way ourselves.

189
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Okay.

190
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Buy.

191
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Hello, Mr. Ma.

192
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
floozled.

193
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Abdul.

194
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
While listening to the guess,

195
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,500
I make sure he doesn't find this bullshit and

196
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
make sure no one is wrong.

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
WeiceAsia.

198
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Uncle,

199
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I have something I want to say.

200
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Just see what happened.

201
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
bean cō

202
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,280
Abandon. Abandon. Abandon.

203
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,560
How can you lose this time?

204
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,960
Come up if you can.

205
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,560
Run.

206
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,880
I want to ask you something.

207
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,440
The player who wore the number 10 in the high school basketball game

208
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,880
hasn't come to the training recently, right?

209
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,640
Yi Tianyu, he's retired.

210
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,440
He's...

211
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,400
He looks familiar.

212
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,280
You're the pervert who often comes to our school

213
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,760
to watch the training recently.

214
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,600
It's you.

215
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,000
You misunderstood.

216
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,800
Who are you?

217
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,040
Hello, I'm the coach of the wonderful sports district.

218
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,840
Wonderful.

219
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,040
You're here to pick me up.

220
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,240
Is work more important than you?

221
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,120
Great. Let me tell you.

222
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,640
I'll teach you how to eat the most delicious one tonight.

223
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,240
I just want to use this

224
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,640
AILAB's water glue baby.

225
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,640
Poor you.

226
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,640
Water glue.

227
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:57,880
I...

228
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,760
Water glue.

229
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,760
Water glue.

230
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,720
I haven't said anything yet.

231
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,720
The coach of the wonderful sports district came to me.

232
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,000
He watched the game with the eighth grade.

233
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,840
He's very fond of me.

234
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,560
As long as I can get three hundred points,

235
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,880
I can go to the wonderful sports district.

236
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,840
Great.

237
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This is a good thing.

238
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,680
You're a good athlete.

239
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,240
Why are you kneeling?

240
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,280
You're scaring me.

241
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,160
No, no, no.

242
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,000
You can't die.

243
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,360
If you die, who will tutor me?

244
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,080
Me?

245
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,280
You?

246
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,560
Tutoring?

247
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,160
What else?

248
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,800
You're funny.

249
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,240
Qiao.

250
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,720
You're my brother.

251
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,760
You have to help me.

252
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,560
You can line up.

253
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,760
I'll ask my brother

254
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,800
to tutor you.

255
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,520
Okay.

256
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,840
What are you doing?

257
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,360
I think you can help him.

258
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,520
The premise is to bring me.

259
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,400
I'll give you two a chance.

260
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,040
Isn't it a man's place?

261
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,640
Look.

262
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,440
What's this?

263
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,800
If Brother Lin Shi gets into trouble one day,

264
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,640
the police will find you a criminal.

265
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,120
If you tutor me,

266
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,120
I'll be like a student of my uncle.

267
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,040
I'll be like a student of Li Xue Chen

268
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,480
who's better than Bai Zheng Ping.

269
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,480
Come on.

270
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
It's too much.

271
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,520
I'm begging you.

272
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,520
I'm begging you.

273
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,920
I'm begging you.

274
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,160
Xue Qiao, you did a good job.

275
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,760
I'm begging you.

276
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,000
Xue Qiao, you did a good job.

277
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm begging you.

278
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,520
Stop.

279
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,160
I can only use the first lesson

280
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,960
that Brother Lin Shi taught me.

281
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,760
I can only use the first lesson that Brother Lin Shi taught me.

282
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,280
Finish these two sets of papers before school.

283
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,320
I'll promise you two.

284
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:55,720
Really?

285
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,320
Really?

286
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,720
Okay.

287
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,660
五,

288
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,360
六,

289
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,240
够呀,

290
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,920
要填了,

291
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,280
整好了,

292
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
раз,

293
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,480
够呀,

294
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,280
够呀,

295
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,480
ZZZ.

296
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,280
You're in our team?

297
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,880
It's watch time.

298
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,600
Sw 사람들이

299
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,960
Actually, it's all Gu's fault

300
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,360
If he didn't lose money in the stock market

301
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,800
he would have been paid

302
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
I know

303
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,360
Today is Monday

304
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,560
You are on leave

305
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,000
and came here

306
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,360
Just for this?

307
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,160
Don't worry, Sister Li

308
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,040
We are old relatives

309
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,200
We should help each other

310
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,400
Thank you so much

311
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,640
Actually, it's not much

312
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,840
Only 500 yuan

313
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,760
500 yuan, right?

314
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,120
I'll give it to you now

315
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,560
It's no big deal

316
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,360
Here, take it

317
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,640
Solve your problems

318
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,240
Pay it slowly, don't worry

319
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,720
No, it's not enough

320
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,160
I...

321
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,240
What?

322
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,040
Enough

323
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,720
Listen

324
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,120
There are some small agents

325
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,760
who help people to cut the price

326
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,600
You can hire them for 500 yuan

327
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,720
They can cut

328
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,440
100,000 or 800,000 yuan for you

329
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,520
It's impossible

330
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,960
Actually, we know the landlord

331
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,360
We are old friends

332
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:43,720
He...

333
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,000
How much do they want?

334
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,560
How much is their house worth?

335
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,280
They are just free gifts

336
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,560
They won't take it

337
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,160
Think about it

338
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,840
Listen

339
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,240
It doesn't matter who has more money

340
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,800
You can tell them

341
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,280
Don't let your landlord

342
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,640
fool you

343
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,560
Coming

344
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,000
This is...

345
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,320
Mingze, come in

346
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,440
Aunt

347
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,640
I haven't heard from you for a long time

348
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,920
How are you?

349
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,360
Are you still preparing for the exam?

350
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,080
Yes, I'm still preparing

351
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,560
Poor kid

352
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,960
He has been preparing for years

353
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,720
I think

354
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,280
you should find a job

355
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,280
If it's not easy to find a job

356
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,320
tell aunt

357
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,600
to arrange it for you

358
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,880
No need

359
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,080
Now he is

360
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,200
sensible and considerate

361
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,440
He doesn't go home every day

362
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,680
He has to go to the exam

363
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,480
with his sister

364
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,200
Right?

365
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,560
Why are you here at four o'clock?

366
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,000
Shouldn't you go to the exam?

367
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,480
Gu Xuejiao asked me to send this to you

368
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,480
For you

369
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,640
For me?

370
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,160
So much money

371
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,560
Where did you get it?

372
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,160
Xue...

373
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,920
Actually, it's me and Xuejiao

374
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,480
Dad has successfully

375
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,880
surpassed the recent

376
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,760
average change

377
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,840
Gu Xuejiao

378
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,640
It's so hard to memorize these words

379
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,800
Yes, that's what I mean

380
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,680
Dad asked me to send someone

381
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,640
to bring the cash to you

382
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,280
By the way

383
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,600
Here are the rest of the compensations

384
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,720
I've eaten two bags of cash

385
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,880
Great

386
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
Give me a drink

387
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,000
You...

388
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:37,880
This is...

389
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,320
What's this smell?

390
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,800
It's expired

391
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,080
How much is this?

392
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,520
All of this

393
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,240
was made in the stock market

394
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,480
Anyway, it's enough

395
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,880
Thank you so much

396
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,680
I'm in a hurry

397
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,480
to sign a contract with the landlord

398
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,160
We'll go now

399
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,320
Come on

400
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,920
Hello, aunt

401
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,080
You smell

402
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,080
Smell

403
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,000
Here you are

404
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,640
What's the rush?

405
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,720
You're disgusting me with your money

406
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,680
You're a bunch of poor and dirty people

407
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,600
Hurry up

408
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,800
Mom

409
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,000
I just took a college entrance exam

410
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,520
But I swear

411
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,080
I'll repeat that every year

412
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,040
I can't even remember what she said

413
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,200
Our stock is sold out

414
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,160
She's our hen

415
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,120
Are you angry about this?

416
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,760
Brother Ling said it in the blood test

417
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,680
Brother Ling's calculation model has calculated it

418
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,440
The probability of stock stock market crash is very high

419
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,160
If the stock price drops

420
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,240
we can't be the last wave of leeks

421
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,600
So it's from the science

422
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,920
We have to listen to science

423
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,080
What is leek?

424
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,320
I don't know

425
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,280
It's a big scientific tree

426
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,840
Where's your sister?

427
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,040
The final exam is coming

428
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,400
She's in a hurry to go to Brother Ling's class

429
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,080
This time the extra money is worth it

430
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,320
What are you laughing at?

431
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,640
Shouldn't you go to the class, too?

432
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,840
Why are you here?

433
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,880
Isn't this a special case?

434
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,360
Such a big one

435
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,680
Keep your voice down

436
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,080
I have to send it home

437
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,600
OK, you hold it more insecure

438
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,480
Reddish

439
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,400
Give me

440
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,360
You go to class

441
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,000
You can go

442
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,320
Go quickly

443
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,400
Then I go

444
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,720
Stinky boy

445
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,240
Yes, this one

446
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,280
You buy it in the warehouse as soon as it starts tomorrow

447
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,000
This family can make money even with a little effort

448
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,280
I don't believe I can't make money

449
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,880
Thousands of millions of cash flowed into my company's account

450
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,520
and earned your Gu family's ten sets of money

451
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,240
I also have easier to come

452
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,640
Whose hill?

453
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,280
Sun Tiantian

454
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,800
and Yitian Yul

455
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,600
I get it

456
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,000
You don't care about yourself or others.

457
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,360
Are you so confident about San Mo?

458
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,520
I was really forced to do so.

459
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,680
Look at their paper.

460
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,240
I feel that as long as they have enough questions,

461
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,800
they can complete my three-day homework in one night.

462
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,920
I have to give them a lecture tomorrow.

463
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,240
Lecture?

464
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,800
Although your lecture is very similar to

465
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,520
the essence of the Feynman theory,

466
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,080
you are also a helpful person.

467
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,680
Aren't you afraid that

468
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,320
you will give them a lecture?

469
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,160
So,

470
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,160
you don't support me giving them a lecture,

471
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,520
right?

472
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,240
If you want to become a role model for others,

473
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,760
you should be more strict with yourself.

474
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:46,960
Finish.

475
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,800
Give them a lecture.

476
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,060
So many!

477
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,840
Yes.

478
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,760
The junior high School cliff rolling in is coming to an end.

479
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,400
The college entrance examination is over.

480
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,000
He Matt when you openness

481
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,240
when we have the time

482
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,380
He is now

483
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,120
Stand in the south

484
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,360
Exit

485
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,280
please

486
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,000
Find him

487
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,240
Look up

488
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,460
Look up

489
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,680
Integrérer

490
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,760
Bo

491
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,640
Right

492
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,660
Right

493
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,860
Right

494
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,440
Stand up

495
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,480
November

496
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,040
Right

497
00:22:45,040 --> 00:23:03,640
Hurrah for the former

498
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,640
I'm the enlightened one

499
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,480
And the institutional one

500
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,080
The final exam!

501
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,440
Go!

502
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,840
Did you hear that?

503
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,640
You heard that too?

504
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,360
I heard that.

505
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,640
What did you say?

506
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,760
You say it.

507
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,320
You say it.

508
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,200
You say it.

509
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,560
Who said that?

510
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,360
I should say it.

511
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,320
Hurry up.

512
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,280
Senior!

513
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,320
Senior!

514
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,720
Did you hear that?

515
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,760
We heard that.

516
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,880
No, you heard that too.

517
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,920
I didn't hear that.

518
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,960
Hurry up and say it.

519
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,680
What is it?

520
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,720
I heard that.

521
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,040
I heard that.

522
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,560
The teacher is here.

523
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,440
The teacher is here.

524
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,400
Class begins.

525
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,600
Stand up.

526
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,880
Hello, teacher.

527
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,840
Hello, students.

528
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,480
Sit down.

529
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,360
Sir!

530
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,520
Teacher Wei Ying,

531
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,320
I'm sorry.

532
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,280
I'm late.

533
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,640
Wait.

534
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,240
Who told you to sit?

535
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,880
Come on, stand up.

536
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,240
Come on.

537
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,480
A sigh.

538
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,240
Why sigh?

539
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,960
Our grades this time

540
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,640
are usually not ideal.

541
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,360
Our grades are not ideal.

542
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,960
Some students' thoughts

543
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,240
are not on the study.

544
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,960
The class has already counted down.

545
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
The grades are still down.

546
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,040
I won't give you names.

547
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,880
Reflect on it.

548
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,800
It's useless to just bow.

549
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,240
You have to keep it in mind.

550
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,680
I hope these students

551
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,920
can reflect on themselves.

552
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,760
But some students

553
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,080
have improved.

554
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,920
Stand on the stage.

555
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,280
No way.

556
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,800
I'm late this semester.

557
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,640
I'm going to be caught once.

558
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,160
You heartless people.

559
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,920
I helped you study

560
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,200
and help you focus.

561
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,920
I'm so happy for you.

562
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,680
In this mock exam,

563
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,120
all the students

564
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,200
have improved significantly.

565
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,600
Some of them improved by more than ten points.

566
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,400
Some of them improved by nearly 100 points.

567
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,520
I'm very happy for you.

568
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,600
Compared to them,

569
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,720
some of them

570
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,480
had better grades

571
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,080
but were over-reacted.

572
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,360
This time,

573
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,600
a group of black horses

574
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,880
have been running all the way

575
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,880
and broke into the top ten.

576
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,120
Who is this person?

577
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,160
Gu Xuejiao.

578
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,800
Let me ask you.

579
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,960
How did you get

580
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,480
into the top ten

581
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,320
without thinking?

582
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,880
Did you hear the cheering?

583
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,920
She's from Class 8, Class 3.

584
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,040
Gu Xuejiao.

585
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,360
Friends.

586
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,480
Class 8.

587
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,320
My good friends from Class 1.

588
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,480
I won't say those harsh words.

589
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,160
We should know what we're thinking.

590
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:21,760
Okay.

591
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,680
You can be the ones to say something else.

592
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,320
I'll read the grades now.

593
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,120
The eleventh grade.

594
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,080
Zhou Shiyun.

595
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,560
1 hour rear-rent and 17 feeds.

596
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,680
Pass.

597
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,320
Pass.

598
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,440
Pass.

599
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,720
Pass.

600
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,320
Keep trying.

601
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,120
Okay, Professor.

602
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,440
Huang Xiaojia.

603
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,880
131.

604
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,160
My class is over 200th place.

605
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,440
Last time,

606
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,120
I'm not tired of reading it.

607
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,480
Why?

608
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,360
Because I...

609
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,840
I always read your names.

610
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,640
I'm easy to get tired.

611
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,480
Xue Qiao.

612
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,160
You're always the same.

613
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,640
Share your secret.

614
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,560
Yeah, Xue Qiao.

615
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,440
It's been a long time.

616
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,480
You're like a rocket in the sky.

617
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,720
You're amazing.

618
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,880
Xue Qiao is our benefactor.

619
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,680
Ye Zi.

620
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,120
Tell them how many points you got.

621
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,120
Not high.

622
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,280
Just 369 points.

623
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,040
But I can get to the top.

624
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,840
Yeah.

625
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,320
You're a big shot.

626
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,520
Teach me.

627
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,520
I'm begging you.

628
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,280
Teach me.

629
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,800
Teach me.

630
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,760
Let's start from the last part.

631
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,480
Last time...

632
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,040
21.

633
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,720
Yeah.

634
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:52,920
21.

635
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,720
21.

636
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,520
The most common question

637
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,240
is the question of evaluation.

638
00:27:59,240 --> 00:27:59,920
Look.

639
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,080
The function f of x is equal to

640
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,720
the second square of x minus one minus x minus a times x.

641
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,000
Let's look at the first one.

642
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,240
If a is equal to zero,

643
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,640
it's the single-direction of f of x.

644
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,520
What's the single-direction?

645
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,280
Yu Tian Yu.

646
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,520
x is...

647
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,320
In this body,

648
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,800
it's the negative line of the beginning

649
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,160
to the zero of the beginning.

650
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,040
Shi Yue.

651
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,840
Shi Yue.

652
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,920
Why are you here?

653
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,440
Isn't Gao Si's classroom not here?

654
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,280
Didn't I see you didn't reply to my message?

655
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,880
Is it the day

656
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,760
of the final result?

657
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,240
I have to go back now.

658
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,520
Shi Yue.

659
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,320
No matter how many points you get,

660
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,600
you're the best.

661
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,640
Gao Si, come on.

662
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,400
Where are you?

663
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,200
Why don't you come back?

664
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,320
I've called your class teacher.

665
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,800
She said you got only a little point

666
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,000
in the final exam.

667
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
You don't even understand your daughter.

668
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,320
You're not even a little girl.

669
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,520
You're just a little girl.

670
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,720
You're just a little girl.

671
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,720
You're just a little girl.

672
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,280
You can't even pass

673
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,520
the daughter of Sister Li.

674
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,720
What are you still wandering around?

675
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,120
Listen.

676
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,920
If you get one more point

677
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,640
in this exam,

678
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,920
your mother's face will be...

679
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,680
You too!

680
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,120
I wish you a good luck in the final exam!

681
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,520
I will!

682
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,280
I'll give you a lucky game.

683
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,080
It's obvious.

684
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,920
What is it?

685
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,960
Speed up in the last keep of the final exam.

686
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,960
It was so much better

687
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,520
before the learning advantage rival was given.

688
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,600
Shouldn't you be

689
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,840
same in the last period?

690
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,560
That's the way.

691
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Today...

692
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,840
You give me a question today.

693
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,560
I've shown you how to do it before.

694
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,560
How many points?

695
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,280
How embarrassing!

696
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,840
You can't read the reference book.

697
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,520
It's all because of your brain.

698
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,720
Let's start.

699
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,120
I've read it before.

700
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,720
Blue.

701
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,000
BTS.

702
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,000
Jump over.

703
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,600
Beijing Go Up...

704
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,480
Interesting.

705
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:22,800
Here.

706
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,240
Teacher Gu.

707
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,280
Start.

708
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,360
Drugs.

709
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,000
Even time is precious.

710
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,440
All you need is time.

711
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,840
How about you?

712
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,080
Aren't you?

713
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,640
I can just let you know

714
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,040
what the truth is.

715
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,000
That s myself.

716
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:56,880
You can go ahead.

717
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,640
No takes, no gains.

718
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,160
and then take the question and sleep.

719
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,080
Do you know

720
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,360
what five points mean?

721
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:07,760
Sure?

722
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,480
You have to graduate from the course.

723
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:10,720
You study

724
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,120
more problem today without 11% reward is received.

725
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,420
The answer to the joint I gave you

726
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,880
is all standing by one point.

727
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,520
I guess it means

728
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,000
what?

729
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,320
What?

730
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,600
I made a mistake?

731
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,160
You're in an infirmary, keep the Chess more down.

732
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,480
When you were giving the questions,

733
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,240
what were you thinking on your computer?

734
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,760
Are you going to

735
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,160
give me a golden jade pendant,

736
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,040
a golden flower,

737
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,320
and let me see it?

738
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,280
Today is my last day of part-time job.

739
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,640
It's also our last class.

740
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,640
No way.

741
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,000
I need it without you.

742
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,400
There is less than a month

743
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,920
left before the college entrance examination.

744
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,640
What you need is not a question,

745
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,440
but confidence.

746
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,440
Miss.

747
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,480
Miss.

748
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,000
Miss.

749
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,920
Miss.

750
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,040
Let me check again.

751
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,000
The ID card, the certificate and the certificate are ready.

752
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,080
The entrance exam is coming.

753
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,000
Don't be nervous.

754
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,280
Relax.

755
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,000
Dad.

756
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,080
Don't move.

757
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:46,960
You'll break it.

758
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,280
I'm a little nervous.

759
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,360
This college entrance examination

760
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,760
is only one of the thousands of steps

761
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,520
that you have to take to get to Chengming High School.

762
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,880
And it's not the only one.

763
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,960
My daughter will be brilliant tomorrow.

764
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,280
No matter what you pass.

765
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,480
What are you talking about?

766
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,360
My daughter.

767
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,360
Look at these horses.

768
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,040
They are all wearing chequered clothes.

769
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,600
They are thinking about winning.

770
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,080
How can they pass the first day of the exam?

771
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,120
They have to pass every day.

772
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,400
Let's make it a success.

773
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,480
We will be famous.

774
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,800
I believe you will pass this time.

775
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,640
You can pass the first day.

776
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,480
Mom.

777
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,480
What are you talking about?

778
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,760
I want to go to the Golden Hall.

779
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,880
What are you doing?

780
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,360
What are you doing?

781
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,840
The child is still up to you.

782
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,120
You are really confident.

783
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,480
Of course.

784
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
Of course.

785
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,000
I lost yesterday.

786
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,000
I'm a student.

787
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,880
The Golden Hall

788
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,880
Anyway.

789
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,120
Now we have everything.

790
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,680
You can go back and wait for me.

791
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,440
Okay.

792
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,400
Okay.

793
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,480
Come on.

794
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,200
Come on.

795
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,000
Come on.

796
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,240
Go.

797
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,280
Go ahead.

798
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,040
Hurry up.

799
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,480
Come on.

800
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,000
I'm going.

801
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,480
Come on.

802
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,280
Come on.

803
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,080
Come on.

804
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,880
Mom.

805
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,080
Come on.

806
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,880
Come on.

807
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,880
Come on.

808
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,200
Is it okay?

809
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,800
Really it's good.

810
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,600
Good, good.

811
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,040
All sound of fishy.

812
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,760
Test piece.

813
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,600
Hmmm.

814
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:14,600
Mask complete.

815
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,060
Now you begin to pay the money to the test piece.

816
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:31,080
From that day on, my 28 years of life exam paper has regained its blankness.

817
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:36,080
All the questions I answered wrong and the wrong path can be redone.

818
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:40,080
Life doesn't have the right answer.

819
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:45,080
Trying to make the choice right, my choice is the right answer.

820
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,080
All the students, please sit.

821
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,080
Time's up. Start the exam.

822
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,080
Start the exam.

823
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:06,080
This... This isn't my high school exam paper.

824
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,080
I can't say if I can start over.

825
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,080
If I fail again, don't be sad.

826
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,080
Even if I die, I'll be able to break through the seven walls.

827
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:47,080
If life is not a game anymore, then the last chance is in my hands.

828
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,080
Inefficient. The signal of exhaustion.

829
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,080
Inefficient. The channel of confusion.

830
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,080
Inefficient. The heartbeats of fear.

831
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,080
I want my life to be a mark for someone.

832
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,080
Inefficient. The hug of inferiority.

833
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,080
Inefficient. The noise of loneliness.

834
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,080
Inefficient. The weak energy.

835
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,080
Let's go. Let's go.

836
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,080
Come here. Let's get up.

837
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,080
Let's go. Let's go.

838
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,080
Come, director.

839
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,080
Come, everyone. Look here.

840
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,080
Happy New Year!

841
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,080
Happy New Year!

842
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,080
Coming. Coming.

843
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,080
Coming.

844
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,080
This is for improving your score.

845
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,080
This is for comforting your score.

846
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,080
Don't worry.

847
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,080
Watch me act.

848
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,080
This is...

849
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,080
How is it?

850
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,080
Is the score out?

851
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,080
It's out.

852
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,080
It looks pretty high, right?

853
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,080
I got more than 60,000 points in the practice round.

854
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,080
Guess my final score.

855
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,080
What's the score?

856
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,080
16.7.

857
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,080
You...

858
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,080
You... You brat.

859
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,080
I'm asking you how many points you got in the college entrance exam.

860
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,080
Not how many points you got in the game.

861
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,080
Mom, you'd better use this knife to cut the cake.

862
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,080
Or what?

863
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,080
What are you standing here for? Go and check the score.

864
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,080
Okay. I'll go right away.

865
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,080
Mom, I...

866
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,080
I'll go right away.

867
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,080
I'll do whatever you say.

868
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,080
You two are still talking.

869
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,080
Okay. You've all seen it.

870
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,080
We're both ready to do anything.

871
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,080
We're both ready to do anything.

872
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,080
Everything is possible.

873
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,080
I'm contented.

874
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,080
I'm not even good at cutting cake or cutting people.

875
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,080
I'm not even good at cutting cake or cutting people.

876
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,080
I'm not even good at cutting cake or cutting people.

877
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,080
Actually, I don't know if you should celebrate this score.

878
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,080
Actually, I don't know if you should celebrate this score.

879
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,080
Or comfort it.

880
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,080
Okay. Then thank you.

881
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,080
Hurry up.

882
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,080
I'm coming.

883
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,080
Come on.

884
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,080
Start.

885
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,080
679.

886
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,080
679.

887
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,080
679.

888
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,080
Gu Xuejiao.

889
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,080
I'm amazing.

890
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,080
Is there a scene in your dream?

891
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,080
No.

892
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,080
I'm just kidding.

893
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,080
I'm just kidding.

894
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,080
I'm just kidding.

895
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,080
I'm just kidding.

896
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,080
Gu Xuejiao, think about it.

897
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,080
The scores in Jing'an University are all over 690.

898
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,080
If you don't get enough scores, you'll have to study again.

899
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,080
Don't bother you here.

900
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,080
I'm just kidding.

901
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:26,080
There will be no empty voices

902
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,080
Separate memories

903
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:33,080
Every line is a wrong path

904
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:39,080
We are thinking about each other

905
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:43,080
Let fate be destined

906
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:47,080
Let us give all the courage

907
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:53,080
I'm willing to travel with you through time

908
00:43:53,080 --> 00:44:00,080
If you read the secrets in my eyes

909
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:07,080
You will find that you are always in my heart

910
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:16,080
I try to open my hands

911
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,080
Because of the love

912
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,080
I'm sure

913
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,080
I'm listening to the wind

914
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:29,080
It doesn't matter if the wind is blowing

915
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:33,080
There is a sound close

916
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:39,080
I know it must be you

917
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:54,080
I try to open my hands

918
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,080
Because of the love

919
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,080
I'm sure

920
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,080
I'm listening to the wind

921
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:08,080
It doesn't matter if the wind is blowing

922
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,080
There is a sound close

923
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:18,080
I know it must be you
