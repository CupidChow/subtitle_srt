1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Try to grow the flowers in the summer

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now tell the truth about life

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's not complicated to tell the truth

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The youth is swaying

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We are getting stronger

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My heart is still hot and boiling

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Follow the rhythm and release the love

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The night wind is lighting up the sky and leading me to fly

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will fly with you bravely

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My love is still hot and boiling

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Shining and smiling eyes

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let us cross the barrier of time

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Do you remember Mr. Zheng from BNC?

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The one who wanted to be your boyfriend in the wine show?

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The innovation of the Boxu team, the development of the foreign industry, and the unique industry

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
She is Lin Jia Dong's aunt

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,080
What about the smart po gastronomy?

20
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,680
How could I let her go?

21
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,840
It's been a month

22
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,400
Her much love is empty

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,520
but she thinks I want her升

24
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,020
If we don't help her,

25
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,600
how could she maybe buy more flowers?

26
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,640
What are you talking about?

27
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,280
Both have similar liquid Swiss

28
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,680
Can't do return burgers

29
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,600
It is your reaction

30
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,440
You are so talented

31
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,520
You knew it

32
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,360
Why one left her?

33
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,200
So don't be afraid that she will sell it to you

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,760
How many computers?

35
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,360
Just a few.

36
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,400
They're so stupid.

37
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,520
They can't affect our progress.

38
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,000
The data has been uploaded to the cloud.

39
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,440
If they do that,

40
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,160
we'll be even more successful.

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,920
Now our team is

42
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,400
invincible.

43
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,960
That's good.

44
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,640
Try it.

45
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,000
The super-vote

46
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,920
affects the heart rate.

47
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,520
You eat this.

48
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,200
Report to Ms Gao.

49
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,320
So…

50
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,400
No doubt this is a cheese bun.

51
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,200
With bitter gourd?

52
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,160
bitter gourd?

53
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,120
It's not a good time.

54
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,320
We are all in the Chinese medicine department.

55
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,600
We should be careful about the choice.

56
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,400
Yes.

57
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,840
Then I...

58
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,480
This is what I prepared for you.

59
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,800
Protein, carbon, vitamin, and nutrition balance.

60
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,160
You deserve it.

61
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,400
Try it.

62
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,200
How is it?

63
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,240
This is called takeout.

64
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,000
Takeout?

65
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,400
I made it myself.

66
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,960
No wonder it's so delicious.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,080
Really?

68
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,200
But compared to takeout,

69
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,320
I think it's more effective.

70
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,880
Really?

71
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,000
Come here.

72
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,680
You...

73
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,840
Where did you come from?

74
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,120
I've always been here.

75
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,200
But you two were blinded by love.

76
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,400
You are so mean to me.

77
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,080
Where did you learn this?

78
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,400
It's okay.

79
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,000
You can also think that I don't exist.

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I don't mind.

81
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,720
You...

82
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,280
You are not uncomfortable.

83
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,240
You can lie down.

84
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,120
You can lie down.

85
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,120
You can lie down.

86
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,120
You can lie down.

87
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,120
You can lie down.

88
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,120
You can lie down.

89
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,120
You can lie down.

90
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,120
You can lie down.

91
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,280
You have a headache, right?

92
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,040
I'll call the doctor for you.

93
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,360
It's okay.

94
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,720
No, you are so smart.

95
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,280
It's okay.

96
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,440
Yes.

97
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,040
He is not blind.

98
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,960
Sister, you

99
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,680
come here for 800 times a day.

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,640
I don't know

101
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,240
how much he is hurt.

102
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,560
You little brat, what do you know?

103
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,520
I think you are not as old as me.

104
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,440
Don't pretend to be an adult.

105
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,720
Sister, I

106
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,840
look more mature than I look.

107
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,240
What about you?

108
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,240
Do you like homework?

109
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,400
You are playing with your phone here.

110
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,240
Don't you have enough homework?

111
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,960
But tell me more.

112
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,520
Next time I come here,

113
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,280
I'll get you more

114
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,120
five-year midterms and three-year simulation.

115
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,480
Do you want the yellow version or the human version?

116
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,160
Tell me.

117
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,120
Your girlfriend is so fierce.

118
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,560
Be quick.

119
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,400
What time is it now?

120
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,080
What's wrong?

121
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,800
You have something to do?

122
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,000
Or is there another guest

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,520
besides me?

124
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,400
I'm sleepy.

125
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,200
I feel like it's almost noon.

126
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,360
Midnight?

127
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,280
Yes.

128
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,320
Then go to bed after you finish eating.

129
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,600
I'm going back to school.

130
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,760
I've been busy with the competition recently.

131
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,560
I don't have time to do my homework.

132
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,160
Thank you.

133
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,640
I'll cheer you on.

134
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,680
I'll feed you.

135
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
I can eat by myself.

136
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,200
I just picked it up.

137
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
No.

138
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,400
You picked it up just now.

139
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,240
I...

140
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,640
You two forgot about me again.

141
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,240
He doesn't care about you.

142
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,840
It's good that you came here.

143
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,160
Then eat more.

144
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,840
I'm going back.

145
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,560
Don't worry. Go ahead.

146
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,200
See you tomorrow.

147
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,880
See you tomorrow.

148
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,520
I'm leaving.

149
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,520
Bye. Don't worry.

150
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,760
Eat more.

151
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,000
Eat it all.

152
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,840
I'm sorry.

153
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,640
You can't come in.

154
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,640
There's a meeting inside.

155
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,400
I'm sorry.

156
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,360
I'm sorry. You can't come in.

157
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,600
Investment 1.2.

158
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,440
Why are you so unruly?

159
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,080
You hate to be interrupted

160
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,880
when Mr. Zheng has a meeting.

161
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,640
Qiao Lin.

162
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,000
Long time no see.

163
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
Take him to the reception room.

164
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,080
No need.

165
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,600
I'll leave after I deliver the things to Mr. Zheng.

166
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,840
This is the surveillance video from last night.

167
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,120
This is the surveillance video from last night.

168
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,840
Turn off the machine.

169
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,080
I know Mr. Zheng hates to be interrupted.

170
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,920
But at the same time,

171
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,120
our team from Jingdao

172
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,640
also hates to be interrupted.

173
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,120
I don't know what you're talking about.

174
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,120
You don't have to understand.

175
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,080
But if you have other actions,

176
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,400
this video

177
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,920
is not just on my phone.

178
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,600
It will appear on the major social media.

179
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,680
Mr. Zheng's mom

180
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,840
must not care about the reputation.

181
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,880
But I think BNC will care about me.

182
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,400
Good morning.

183
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,120
The secret I told you

184
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,000
is sayin'

185
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,680
Don't tell no ones

186
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,480
Your secret tells them.

187
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,320
You must do it carefully.

188
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:50,840
Miss.

189
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,640
I'm gonna go back to the station.

190
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,240
You won't answer the question, right?

191
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,760
Come on.

192
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
I can teach you.

193
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,120
Keep it a secret for me.

194
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,160
Deal.

195
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,720
What era is it now?

196
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,640
You can find it on the Internet.

197
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,520
No need to waste it.

198
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,280
Hello.

199
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,240
Meixi Legend.

200
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,000
You can use books to change your film.

201
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,880
I can tell your mother.

202
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,000
This is not a game.

203
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,520
This is a legend.

204
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,160
How about this?

205
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,200
Keep it a secret.

206
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,680
I'll tell you when to stop learning to watch the drama.

207
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,520
I don't believe you.

208
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,520
Why should I believe you?

209
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
Smart.

210
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,520
You even know how to smoke first.

211
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,520
The World Cup is in a few weeks.

212
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,520
China will win 1 to 0 against Korea.

213
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,520
So fake.

214
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
You don't even make up a good story.

215
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,520
You lost the bet, but you didn't lose.

216
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,520
What if it's true?

217
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,520
You really know when Mei Xi will win the championship?

218
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,520
I need to get a license now.

219
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,520
It's real.

220
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,520
Really.

221
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,520
Don't sacrifice it for others.

222
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,520
Where are you going?

223
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,440
to the quality test.

224
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,360
Why don't you take the exam?

225
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,400
I'm waiting to see the national team

226
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,280
and to make the country proud.

227
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,760
You still want to take the exam?

228
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,440
If you don't watch the game, you won't watch it.

229
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,520
Anyway, you'll lose.

230
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,640
That's right.

231
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,640
Let's go. We'll be late.

232
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,080
Let's go.

233
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,680
If you don't beat Lin Jia Dong,

234
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,600
no one is allowed to leave.

235
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,360
Okay.

236
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,800
Kunzhu is going to finish the battle.

237
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
Don't let him get away.

238
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,800
Three minutes.

239
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,320
Kunzhu beat Lin Jia Dong.

240
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,640
This is too hard.

241
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,120
Three minutes more.

242
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,080
No matter how hard you try, you can't miss it.

243
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,800
The loser of the jade cup is here.

244
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,480
Brother Lin, congratulations on your discharge.

245
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,160
Open your protection wall code.

246
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,760
Let me see.

247
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,360
How is it?

248
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,240
Is it good?

249
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,240
Let me see.

250
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,840
Are these the basic codes of our Antisachronon?

251
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,240
Did the stones leave somewhere else?

252
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:42,960
They left.

253
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,440
I believe that the stick was broken due to the last battle.

254
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,760
Their computer dish was notαιahmed properly.

255
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,480
Someone took it away.

256
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,720
The computer was smashed

257
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,000
at 70 or 80 years old last time.

258
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,120
Both of them couldopefe after taking it back.

259
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,480
But certainly there is a missing piece.

260
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,720
Could it be that they

261
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:57,920
removed our J hertz 괜

262
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,560
and they are restored?

263
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,220
What should we do, mine?

264
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,300
Theム…

265
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:02,800
Thenament will begin soon.

266
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,040
We can't postpone it.

267
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,760
Right?

268
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,760
The competition is about to start.

269
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,360
We can't wait to see the final result.

270
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,880
You're here, Da Shan.

271
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,520
Brother Shi.

272
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,520
Don't worry.

273
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,200
We've prepared

274
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,280
for it.

275
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,480
Are you afraid

276
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,160
I'll lose the competition?

277
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,360
Hello, Gu Xue Diao.

278
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,600
Hello, Shu Lan.

279
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,360
Hello, Wen Bo.

280
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,440
Hello, Nobody Cares Man.

281
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,480
My name is Zhao Fei Fei.

282
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,560
He's Siqi.

283
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,840
It doesn't matter.

284
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,560
After the competition,

285
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,840
I'll never see you again.

286
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,480
Did you leak

287
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,480
our code?

288
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,520
What did you say?

289
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,040
I've seen it.

290
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
You've seen it?

291
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,200
Help me contact

292
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,720
the team on this list.

293
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,480
I want to get the details

294
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,520
of their cooperation with BNC.

295
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,640
Not bad.

296
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,800
It's a pity that it's public.

297
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,520
The full answer

298
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,000
is a waste of paper.

299
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,120
It's a pity.

300
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,480
How about this?

301
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,240
Two teams work together.

302
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,400
But I'm afraid

303
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,320
the result will be

304
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,720
a one-to-one.

305
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,520
Do you have a choice?

306
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,400
I do have a suggestion.

307
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,080
Professor Tan will lead

308
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,440
the team's competition

309
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,600
to the judges.

310
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,920
In order to keep

311
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,160
the fair and just,

312
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,440
we also invited a mysterious guest

313
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,480
as a judge.

314
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,520
I'll announce the new rules.

315
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,320
Because of the team

316
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,360
in this competition,

317
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,800
there's an irreversible factor.

318
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,960
According to Professor Tan's instructions,

319
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,160
this competition will be

320
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,360
a defense battle

321
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,160
with smart devices.

322
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,600
It will be a distribution service

323
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,560
and a clear break.

324
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,560
Take off the firewalls

325
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,160
and attack without defense.

326
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,000
Professor Tan agreed to

327
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,760
use this afternoon's afternoon

328
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,000
to have a student-famous

329
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,040
intellectual exam.

330
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,280
The computers in the empty classroom

331
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,280
will be used.

332
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,640
The service system will be

333
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,280
integrated into the network.

334
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,320
The two teams

335
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,080
need to search the computer

336
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,960
in the classroom

337
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,160
from the top 100 computers

338
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,200
to the computers in the classroom

339
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,920
of the judges.

340
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,200
And they need to

341
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,680
enter and control the smart device.

342
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,400
All computers in the classroom

343
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,320
have the same simulation program.

344
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,240
And they can use

345
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,360
different anti-intake systems.

346
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,320
The network address changes randomly.

347
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,440
No hints.

348
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,440
The

349
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,360
technical means of the borderline

350
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,680
will be entered by the judges

351
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,360
and the team with the control right will win.

352
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,440
The attack means

353
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,520
the attack range

354
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,840
will be in the building.

355
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,920
The computers in the school are old.

356
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,600
Shu Rong,

357
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,280
put your computer

358
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,360
as a service system.

359
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,880
Send the system update request

360
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,000
to all nodes.

361
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,160
After getting

362
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,600
the system update,

363
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,480
we will attack the network.

364
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,600
I remind you.

365
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
In all distribution nodes,

366
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,440
there is only one real entry target.

367
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,400
It takes too much time

368
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,280
to enter other computers.

369
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,080
Look at the first line.

370
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,000
It's not this one.

371
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,320
I think it's the wrong one.

372
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,840
Where?

373
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,800
I'll find it.

374
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,280
The Chinese team is in good shape.

375
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,120
Maybe they will surprise us.

376
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,360
Look.

377
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,000
Really?

378
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,560
Okay.

379
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,800
Go.

380
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,080
Here, take a look.

381
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,160
Let's start.

382
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,240
I think it's okay.

383
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,880
You're ready.

384
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,240
Explain the situation.

385
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,160
Explain it to me.

386
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,400
Explain it to me, okay?

387
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,320
Okay.

388
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,440
I'll go to the right.

389
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,040
Go.

390
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,960
The one in the air.

391
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,920
Okay.

392
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,400
Send us all the information.

393
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,880
Okay.

394
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,120
Tan.

395
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,640
Our two big rats

396
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,480
were rescued by someone.

397
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,600
That's right.

398
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,080
Our classroom

399
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,560
was found by a team.

400
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,520
It seems that we have a winner.

401
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,640
Let me see who it is.

402
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,760
Hi.

403
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,720
Xiao Lin has made a lot of progress

404
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,440
in the past two years.

405
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,440
It seems that Gu Xue Jiao

406
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,880
will work harder.

407
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,080
Yes.

408
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,760
We won.

409
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,480
We won.

410
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,680
We won.

411
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,160
Yes.

412
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,280
We won.

413
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,480
We were caught by the ref.

414
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,160
What?

415
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,680
Indeed.

416
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,360
On a big screen

417
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,600
as being the ref,

418
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,720
are you trying to get me to be scared?

419
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,800
Let me show you a nice one.

420
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,360
Mr. Lin,

421
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,360
you picked up

422
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,580
the computer in theЅl

423
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,440
clearly tony the weights of the trial.

424
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,040
You have two brushes.

425
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,200
Our team

426
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,680
broke down

427
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,260
all the computers

428
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,420
in the classroom

429
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,000
in the same time.

430
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,920
You belong to technical stuff.

431
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,920
I belong to violent stuff.

432
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,400
I haven't heard

433
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,680
You've accurately stepped into the bug we set up in advance.

434
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,680
Otherwise,

435
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,560
we can't win such a depressing game.

436
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,680
This is a big deal.

437
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,800
Don't look at it.

438
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,680
Just do it.

439
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,440
Hurry up.

440
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,980
Answer the quiz

441
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,060
Hon�ng

442
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,560
Nice shot!

443
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,860
Right into the basket.

444
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,280
Go!

445
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
Come on!

446
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,280
Come on!

447
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,280
Come on!

448
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,280
Come on!

449
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,280
Come on!

450
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
Come on!

451
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,280
Come on!

452
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,280
Come on!

453
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,280
Come on!

454
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,280
Come on!

455
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,280
Come on!

456
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,280
Come on!

457
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,280
Come on!

458
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,280
It seems that it is obvious who she will vote for.

459
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
As a member of the referee team,

460
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,280
who do you think will win?

461
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,280
I give up.

462
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,280
You...

463
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,280
You little brat.

464
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,280
You listen to the sound of your dance,

465
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,280
they are the real referee.

466
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,280
Yeah!

467
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,280
Yeah!

468
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,280
What is this?

469
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,280
What is this?

470
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,280
Should we throw the captain up

471
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,280
and celebrate?

472
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,280
Where is the captain?

473
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,280
Where is Xu Qiu?

474
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,280
Come on.

475
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,280
Congratulations.

476
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,280
I want to give you this victory.

477
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,280
You think of the logic of the game.

478
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,280
Let's not talk about work at another time.

479
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,280
OK.

480
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,280
Great.

481
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,280
What reward do you want?

482
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,280
I want to give you a kiss.

483
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,280
You will wake up later.

484
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,280
Have a rest.

485
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,280
Eat something delicious.

486
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,280
OK.

487
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,280
Where is the remote control?

488
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,280
Hey, water store.

489
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,280
Come on.

490
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,280
Don't shoot.

491
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,280
You are a grown-up.

492
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
What are you doing?

493
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,280
What are you doing?

494
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,280
Take a picture of me.

495
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,280
Don't look at me.

496
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,280
Find a small tool.

497
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,280
Find a small tool.

498
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,280
Let's start.

499
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,280
Let's start.

500
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,280
Why don't you move your chopsticks?

501
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,280
The reason why the animals of the senior class

502
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,280
have the smell of stinky food

503
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,280
is to identify the natural corruptive food.

504
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,280
Don't worry.

505
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,280
It's a normal product.

506
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,280
It's not edible.

507
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,280
Then you try it first.

508
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,280
You first.

509
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,280
Come on. I feed you.

510
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,280
I feed you.

511
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
Come on.

512
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,280
When my friend loves me,

513
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,280
I will beat him.

514
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,280
No.

515
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,280
I will do it myself.

516
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,280
It's true.

517
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,280
It's a matter of breaking the bottom line.

518
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,280
It has to be done step by step.

519
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,280
Pour some.

520
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,280
Pour some.

521
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,280
Half a cup.

522
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
You didn't leave me any.

523
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,280
I just wanted to

524
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,280
break your fate.

525
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,280
I just wanted to

526
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,280
break your fate.

527
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,280
I just wanted to

528
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,280
break your fate.

529
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,280
I didn't expect to be too late.

530
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,280
This kind of trash food

531
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,280
is enough to harm me alone.

532
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,280
Don't harm you.

533
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,280
No.

534
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,280
I don't want to use this.

535
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,280
Then what do you use?

536
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,280
Use my bottom.

537
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,280
No.

538
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,280
The animal of the senior class

539
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,280
has evolved the smell of smell.

540
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,280
It's to distinguish

541
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,280
the natural food of the corrupt world.

542
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,280
It's not to let you

543
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,280
eat the smell of the master's powder.

544
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,280
Then

545
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,280
it's time to prove that you love me.

546
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,280
You are scared.

547
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,280
No. I'm not smelly anymore.

548
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,280
What's going on?

549
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,280
I don't know.

550
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
I'm in a bad mood.

551
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,280
I'll stay here for two days.

552
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
You can continue.

553
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,280
Well.

554
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,280
You've been here all the time.

555
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
I just woke up.

556
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,280
I came out to have a sleep.

557
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,280
I didn't see anything.

558
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,280
What should you do?

559
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,280
Why are you sleeping like this?

560
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,280
I can sleep however I want.

561
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,280
But

562
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,280
I didn't sleep well.

563
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,280
I'm fine.

564
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,280
You don't look

565
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,280
like you're fine.

566
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,280
What should you do?

567
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,280
I'll go open the door.

568
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,280
You're here too.

569
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,280
Hello.

570
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,280
It's me. Gao Rui.

571
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,280
Are you okay?

572
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,280
Thank you for taking care of me last time.

573
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,280
I'm fine.

574
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,280
I'm fine.

575
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,280
I'm fine.

576
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,280
I'm fine.

577
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,280
I'm fine.

578
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,280
I'm fine.

579
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,280
I'm fine.

580
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,280
I'm fine.

581
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,280
I'm fine.

582
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,280
I lost my phone.

583
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,280
I'm afraid you can't find it.

584
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,280
This is my number.

585
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,280
Can you save it?

586
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,280
Okay. I got it.

587
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,280
I have to hang up.

588
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,280
Wait.

589
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,280
I have another thing.

590
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,280
Say.

591
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,280
Your earring is left

592
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,280
here.

593
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,280
When can it be convenient

594
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,280
to send it over to you?

595
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,280
Earring.

596
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,280
Let's talk about it.

597
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,520
I've been busy lately.

598
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,520
If you're not available,

599
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,520
I'll call Shansong.

600
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,520
I have a call.

601
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,520
I'll hang up now.

602
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,520
No, it's important.

603
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,020
It's very important.

604
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,520
Hello?

605
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,520
My slippers are here.

606
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,520
My bag is here.

607
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,520
I have a few things to do.

608
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,520
Sister, you're sick.

609
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,020
What's going on?

610
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,020
Xue Jiang, I knew you'd be here.

611
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,020
Congratulations, pretty girl.

612
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,020
Thank you, Sister Yue.

613
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,020
You're a PK.

614
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,020
Hua Hua is worried about you every day.

615
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,020
She's afraid you'll be sad if you lose.

616
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,020
That's good.

617
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,020
I'm happy to receive it.

618
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,020
By the way,

619
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,020
the list you sent me

620
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,020
was done by I-Girl.

621
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,020
This is what they replied to me.

622
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,020
What list?

623
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,760
I'll leave you two alone.

624
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,760
I just happened to pass by.

625
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,760
Three-person world.

626
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,760
I'll go now.

627
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,760
You're leaving?

628
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,760
I'm leaving.

629
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,500
I'm leaving.

630
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,500
Sister,

631
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,500
we need...

632
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
Soy sauce.

633
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,500
Can you go to Uncle Gao Rui

634
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,500
and buy us a bottle?

635
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,500
I understand.

636
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,500
Let's go.

637
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,500
Yeah, I see.

638
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,500
But the more money the industry raises

639
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,500
and prepares to deploy,

640
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,500
and the more it is open to ordinary investors,

641
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,240
the more pressure it will come under from regulators

642
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,240
to improve transparency.

643
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,240
Okay, see you later.

644
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,240
Sister,

645
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,240
have you been busy lately?

646
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,240
Busy?

647
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,240
I have a lot of procedures

648
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,240
to do just for your entrepreneurial team.

649
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,240
Then you still think of me.

650
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,980
What do you mean?

651
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,980
That night,

652
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,980
I contacted you,

653
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,980
and you kept avoiding me.

654
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,980
I was wondering

655
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,980
if I did not perform well that night.

656
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,980
What else do you remember that night?

657
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,980
That night,

658
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,980
we were so confused.

659
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,980
But the next day,

660
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,980
I felt guilty when I woke up.

661
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,980
But don't worry,

662
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,980
I will take good care of you.

663
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,980
Who needs you to take care of me?

664
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,980
No, no, no.

665
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,980
I'm a man.

666
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,980
I must be responsible for you.

667
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,980
I'm not a man.

668
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,720
Xiao Gao,

669
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,720
I think you might have misunderstood something.

670
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,720
Misunderstood?

671
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,720
What misunderstanding can there be?

672
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,720
So,

673
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,720
the 300 yuan you gave me that night

674
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,720
was not enough to pay me back.

675
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,720
300 yuan is not enough to pay me back.

676
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,720
That money was for you to take a taxi home.

677
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,460
I see.

678
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,460
I know what's going on with you now.

679
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,460
Listen carefully.

680
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,460
First,

681
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,460
I did not do anything to you that night.

682
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,460
I did not do anything to my brother's friend.

683
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,460
It's not right.

684
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,460
It's just that you drank too much,

685
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,460
so I sent you to the hotel.

686
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,460
Second, I took care of you.

687
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,460
I did not mean anything else.

688
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,460
I hurt you once because of Xiao Lin.

689
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,460
As his sister,

690
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,200
I should not have done anything to you.

691
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,200
Third,

692
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,200
I'm not the person you said I was acting.

693
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,200
So,

694
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,200
please delete this idea

695
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,200
in your mind immediately.

696
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,200
I'm sorry.

697
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,200
I misunderstood.

698
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,200
I'll get off in front.

699
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,200
I'm sorry.

700
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,200
I'm sorry.

701
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,200
I'm sorry.

702
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,200
I'm sorry.

703
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,200
I'm sorry.

704
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,200
I'm sorry.

705
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,200
I'm sorry.

706
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,200
I'm sorry.

707
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,200
I'm sorry.

708
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,200
I'm sorry.

709
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,200
I'm sorry.

710
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,200
I'm sorry.

711
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,200
I'm sorry.

712
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,200
I'm sorry.

713
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,940
Your things.

714
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,940
Thanks.

715
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,200
Thanks.

716
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,200
The F-group of the top players of the first round

717
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,200
successfully entered the final.

718
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,200
The video is so good.

719
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,200
I can see the blood and the pain.

720
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
Yes.

721
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,200
Come on.

722
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
Let's go to our most precious factory.

723
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,200
I just had a dream.

724
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,200
Who said that the best players are all dinosaurs?

725
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,200
The captain of the team is very good at talking.

726
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,200
Xu Xiao, you are really good at talking.

727
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,200
It's a pity that you can't let the audience in

728
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,200
after the final.

729
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,200
Otherwise, I would have been

730
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,200
in the whole room with a cannon.

731
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
I can go to the final.

732
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,200
Come on.

733
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Besides, the milk tea shop is so busy.

734
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,200
How can you go out?

735
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,200
But

736
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,200
you have to be in the final with Zhou Shiyun.

737
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,200
I didn't expect that you two

738
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,200
were right in the end.

739
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,200
From the experience of the high school students,

740
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,200
this must be a conflict

741
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,200
between the two teams.

742
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,200
You are so romantic.

743
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,200
What's so romantic?

744
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,200
You want to watch a play

745
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,200
in such an important final?

746
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,200
Didn't you hear the host say

747
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,200
that the elite is a traditional strong team

748
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,200
and the talented is a violent elite.

749
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,200
And you are the captain.

750
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,200
He is a small team member.

751
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,200
You two are highly-qualified.

752
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,200
You can't even have a conflict

753
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,200
with each other.

754
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,200
You are quite disappointed

755
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,200
that you are so tired from making money.

756
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,200
I can't even watch a play now.

757
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,200
It's all your fault.

758
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
You are so strong.

759
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,200
But Zhou Shiyun

760
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
has been very good

761
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,200
in the final.

762
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,200
I can't underestimate him.

763
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
You are not tired in my heart.

764
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,200
From an objective point of view,

765
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
you are the best.

766
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,200
OK.

767
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Then you can make money.

768
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,200
You are responsible for raising me.

769
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
Cheers.

770
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,200
I'll get some more.

771
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,200
I like you very much.

772
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,200
But there will be a competition in a few days.

773
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,200
Don't be too generous.

774
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,200
The last one.

775
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,200
OK.

776
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
Two bottles of beer.

777
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,200
No glue.

778
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,200
What a coincidence.

779
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,200
Long time no see.

780
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,200
The final is coming.

781
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,200
Come out and relax.

782
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,200
You too?

783
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,200
Shiyun and her brothers are like a forest.

784
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,200
The committee has not

785
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,200
published the content of the final.

786
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,200
But I heard that the content of the competition

787
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,200
is unprecedented.

788
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,200
I guess it will be very difficult.

789
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,200
But we can't leave Qizong.

790
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,200
So confident.

791
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,200
But it's true.

792
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,200
You are close to the competition.

793
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,200
You are here too.

794
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,200
I watched your video.

795
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,200
The whole process is clear.

796
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,200
It's great.

797
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,200
I'm glad that you are the finalists.

798
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,200
Although we are old friends,

799
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,200
I won't be indifferent.

800
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,200
What a coincidence.

801
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,200
Nope.

802
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,200
Just wait into it.

803
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,200
I'll get it.

804
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,200
Don't you

805
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,200
feel sad?

806
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,200
No.

807
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,200
Yuan is a great captain of Tangtang.

808
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,200
I'm just a flower ball player.

809
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,200
Why should I feel sad?

810
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,200
I mentioned it before.

811
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,760
is the sister of the same parents.

812
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,680
But I never said anything to her.

813
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,440
We can't just do that.

814
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:15,800
By the way,

815
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,360
should we order some supper

816
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,040
for your roommate?

817
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,400
What Gu Xue said is right.

818
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,760
Never leave the same person.

819
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,840
The final is just a change of style.

820
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,240
I have nothing to be nervous about.

821
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,040
It's good that you think so.

822
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,760
You are so nervous.

823
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,120
You don't even eat every day.

824
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,200
I'm not nervous just by looking at you.

825
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,400
In the final,

826
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,760
who will you cheer for?

827
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,640
Everyone.

828
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,520
Only one person can win.

829
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,280
Who do you choose?

830
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,440
I choose you.

831
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,720
You hesitate.

832
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,560
I will definitely choose you.

833
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,960
Do you want to come

834
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,400
to the opening of the final?

835
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,960
I happen to have a few tickets.

836
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,760
It's a waste to throw them anyway.

837
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,640
Well,

838
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,160
I happened to have something to do that day.

839
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,240
OK, forget it.

840
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,320
Boss, order.

841
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,560
Coming.

842
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,840
Look at you.

843
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,440
Aren't you scared?

844
00:36:34,440 --> 00:37:03,860
Five

845
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,320
I'm sorry.

846
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,000
You should be the one to blame.

847
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,280
If I get you in the first round,

848
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,240
you'll all be able to

849
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,440
take a break from the audience.

850
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,800
If today is the bragging contest,

851
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,040
I'm sure I won't be able to beat you.

852
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,400
But that's not the case.

853
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,760
Contestants, please pay attention.

854
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,320
The game will start soon.

855
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,560
Are you ready, guys?

856
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,160
I'm ready.

857
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,200
Okay.

858
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,600
Three, two, one.

859
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,320
Come on!

860
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,120
Welcome to

861
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,160
the first international

862
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,880
student intellectual security contest.

863
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,120
I'm the special guest of today's contest.

864
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,200
The smart engineer,

865
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,520
Gu Mingze, Linda.

866
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,360
All the vehicles used in this contest

867
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,360
are the new smart cars

868
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,960
that are about to be launched.

869
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,320
They have the world's leading

870
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,680
intelligent driving system

871
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,760
and driving experience.

872
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,000
Dear audience, dear students,

873
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,600
the national intellectual security contest

874
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,360
officially begins.

875
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,880
The venue of this contest

876
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,360
is divided into the free zone

877
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,680
and the points area.

878
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,200
The ultimate goal of both sides

879
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,320
is to use long-distance technology

880
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,960
to control the vehicle

881
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,680
and conduct a defense contest.

882
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,120
Your team has broken through

883
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,480
the car safety system.

884
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,600
Do I just have to say ten seconds?

885
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,440
Blue team gets one point.

886
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,360
The audience gets one point.

887
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,440
0 to 1.

888
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,000
Move to the left.

889
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,840
Follow me.

890
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,040
Blue team gets one point.

891
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,200
Red team gets one point.

892
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,000
Red team gets one point.

893
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Red team gets one point.

894
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Blue team gets one point.

895
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Blue team gets one point.

896
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Blue team gets one point.

897
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,920
Eat.

898
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,680
Good job.

899
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,160
You even got that back.

900
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,800
I'm just a small dish.

901
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,680
Sleep.

902
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,760
Something's wrong.

903
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,160
Why is the entry-level

904
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:49,800
entrance of the hall

905
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,800
higher than

906
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,120
the speed of my computer?

907
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,960
I'll go check.

908
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,840
Me too.

909
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,160
I can't move the book.

910
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,120
You're so cute.

911
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,760
Come on.

912
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,640
You're so cute.

913
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,480
I'm so cute.

914
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,200
I'm so cute.

915
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,360
What's wrong?

916
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,880
The score is too high.

917
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,080
The data is not going up.

918
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,120
Let me check.

919
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,720
The data is too high.

920
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,640
Something's wrong.

921
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,000
Red team gets one point.

922
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,640
Can you stop it?

923
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,240
No, I can't.

924
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,960
I can't run here.

925
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,400
Red team gets one point.

926
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:21,880
Run.

927
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,240
I've been attacking them.

928
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,360
But I can't get in.

929
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,720
Red team gets one point.

930
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,760
The score is 4 to 5.

931
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,440
I also want to ask Vincent.

932
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,920
Do you think

933
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,000
the teams on both sides are better?

934
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,400
It's okay.

935
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,040
I personally think

936
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,240
the teams of

937
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,600
Jinghai University

938
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,640
are better.

939
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,440
But in terms of potential,

940
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,280
I think

941
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,360
Jinghai University is better.

942
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,720
Red team

943
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,080
is 5 to 5.

944
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,280
Red team is catching up.

945
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,400
This is the team

946
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,720
that is provoking

947
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,880
the members of Jing University.

948
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:57,840
The members of Jing University

949
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,880
are asking for a pause.

950
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,480
Is there a problem?

951
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,120
No.

952
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,120
What about you?

953
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,440
I have no problem.

954
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,920
If there's no problem,

955
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,240
why do you keep losing points?

956
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,520
Whether it's attack or defense,

957
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,680
we've calculated it over and over again.

958
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,880
It's the same old routine.

959
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,760
There's no black technology in the field.

960
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,160
It's not the problem of the machine.

961
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,440
It's the problem of the people.

962
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,600
It's the problem of the remote signal.

963
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,560
The router is provided by the main office.

964
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,400
I've checked it.

965
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,800
I've checked it before the game.

966
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,520
Give me the key.

967
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:26,680
Hurry up.

968
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,280
I'll go.

969
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:29,920
Be careful.

970
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,400
Be careful.

971
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,640
We need you to send us

972
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,320
the address of the car's computer.

973
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,880
I need the address.

974
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,600
Lin Jing Dong sent us the address.

975
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,280
What's going on?

976
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:41,880
The signal loss rate

977
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,360
is more than 50%.

978
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,440
It's a hardware issue.

979
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,480
I'll go to the main office.

980
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,520
What's going on?

981
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,280
Look.

982
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,240
It's the same old routine.

983
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,240
It's the same old routine.

984
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,240
It's the same old routine.

985
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,240
It's the same old routine.

986
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,440
According to the rules of the game,

987
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,320
no hardware change

988
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,000
is allowed during the game.

989
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,640
If you think the game is not good,

990
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,280
please report it to the director.

991
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,560
I've checked it many times.

992
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,320
But I still don't know the problem.

993
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,200
I feel like I've wasted my time on the learning.

994
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,000
Find a solution.

995
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,080
The signal is lost.

996
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,480
It's useless.

997
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,000
We're almost there.

998
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,600
What?

999
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,200
We're almost there.

1000
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,040
Shulan,

1001
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,160
do you have any candy?

1002
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,640
How much do you want?

1003
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,760
How much do I want?

1004
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,040
I have some here.

1005
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,200
Zhou Shiyun,

1006
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,520
your observation is good.

1007
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,480
Your proposal

1008
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,120
is the best.

1009
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,480
You're the chief engineer.

1010
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,480
Thank you, captain.

1011
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,040
Let's go.

1012
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:49,640
Let's go.

1013
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,320
Let's go.

1014
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,600
What are the new generation's members doing?

1015
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,280
Are they being forced

1016
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,680
by the situation?

1017
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,400
I have to remind them

1018
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,480
that the new generation

1019
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,840
is only ten minutes away

1020
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:05,200
from the end of the game.

1021
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,040
Okay.

1022
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,720
You go.

1023
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,440
Go.

1024
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,240
Go.

1025
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:12,920
Any signal?

1026
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,120
I'll pass the signal to you.

1027
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:14,680
Okay.

1028
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,640
I got it.

1029
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,880
I got it.

1030
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,480
I got it.

1031
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,320
No problem.

1032
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,600
You're good, Xu Xiao.

1033
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,120
Don't let them do it.

1034
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,280
Okay.

1035
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,880
Let's see what I can do.

1036
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,320
I got it.

1037
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,880
Blue Team got another point.

1038
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,400
You're fair.

1039
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,840
Go ahead.

1040
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,840
Don't let them do it.

1041
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,640
Blue Team got another point.

1042
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,000
Okay.

1043
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,200
I found their target.

1044
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:39,800
Go from here.

1045
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,520
Okay.

1046
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,200
Blue Team got another point.

1051
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:02,600
I'm trying to open my hands

1052
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,680
Because I'm sure of love

1053
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,400
I'm listening to the wind

1054
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:16,280
The wind is too strong, it doesn't matter

1055
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,360
There is a sound close

1056
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:26,360
I know it must be you
