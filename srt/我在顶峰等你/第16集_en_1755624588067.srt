1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Try to grow the flowers in the summer

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now tell the truth about life

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's not complicated to count the flowers

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The youth is swaying

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We are getting stronger

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My heart is still hot and boiling

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Follow the rhythm and release the love

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The night is brightening, only the fireflies are in the way

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will fly with you bravely

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My love is still hot and boiling

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The bright smile

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let us cross the barrier of time

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Upstairs is the company's long-term room

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
If you drink too much,

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'll book a room for you

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You can live here

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's much more comfortable than Jingda's dormitory

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's too long

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
SOS

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Now Tang Seng is in the board room

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Take it for me

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What are you doing?

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Save Tang Seng

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Come, come, come

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Sit down, sit down

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Mr. Yang, let's have another drink

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Come, Mr. Sun

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Ok, you

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Lin, these people are too good

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I can't do it

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You can't

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Come, eat, eat

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Come

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Xiaolian

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm so happy to see you today

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I've spared you from playing the game

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
If you have a heart,

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
help me to drink this

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Thank you, sister

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll drink it with tea

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
To compete

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What tea with wine?

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Come

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If you drink it,

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'll treat you as my sister

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Look, look

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You've recognized it

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
This is the responsibility of Wu He, right?

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Come, drink it

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You can't get out without drinking it

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Come, drink it

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Come, drink it

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Drink it

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Hello, Mr. Zheng

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm Xiaolian's assistant, Gu

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Sorry, I'm late

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I propose a toast

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
This is the toast

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Look, it's me

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Xiaolian, you're addressing me as the assistant

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You are late

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Do you know how to drink in a circle?

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yes, I do

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Come, must order, girl

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
This is my girl

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Here is your bill

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Thank you, Mr. Zheng

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Come, this is your first time to town

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Your name?

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Wang

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,280
It's a fate.

74
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:44,800
Let's go.

75
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,440
Let's go.

76
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,720
Mr. Zheng,

77
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,440
I must give you another toast.

78
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,760
You're so...

79
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,400
I'm so touched.

80
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,520
I mean it.

81
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,760
I'm so touched.

82
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,400
Mr. Zheng, I mean it.

83
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,600
Let's drink it up.

84
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,920
Let's get drunk.

85
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,440
Let's go.

86
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,000
I mean it.

87
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:03,840
Mr. Zheng.

88
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,480
Let's go.

89
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,320
Let's get drunk.

90
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:05,880
Let's go.

91
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,680
Let's go.

92
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,720
Let's go.

93
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,600
Let's go.

94
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,320
Let's go.

95
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,480
Let's go.

96
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,480
Let's go.

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,080
Let's go.

98
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,840
Let's go.

99
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,880
Five-time model.

100
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,880
Jaejo culture.

101
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,280
For him,

102
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,140
he's still a trois kind of model.

103
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,900
That tall guy

104
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,560
can be proud to be so big.

105
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,160
I'm going to be big, too.

106
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,880
Sit down.

107
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,240
I've done everything for you.

108
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,280
How are you going to make it up to me?

109
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,880
You even know how to repay me?

110
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,640
It means you didn't drink too much.

111
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,560
You're a good drinker.

112
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,200
Of course.

113
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,120
I was...

114
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,600
What was it?

115
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,400
You caught the wine cup

116
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,720
when you caught the porridge, right?

117
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,280
You're right.

118
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,480
My dad used to give me

119
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,760
a chopstick to dip the wine.

120
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,880
The most terrible thing after growing up

121
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,800
is the drunkard.

122
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,960
When he drinks,

123
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,600
he's a gold-digger.

124
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,040
Stop bragging.

125
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,160
Who carried me back

126
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,560
when I drank too much last time?

127
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,320
It's different.

128
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,520
Why?

129
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,400
In KTV,

130
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,880
the drunkard was the wine cup.

131
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,840
Last time,

132
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,920
he was drunk on Mr. Ling's handsome face.

133
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,920
Since then,

134
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,240
I've been carrying the antidote with me

135
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,000
to prevent the virus from spreading.

136
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,360
In case...

137
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,920
In case you can't control it.

138
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,200
I'm dizzy.

139
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Let me help you.

140
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,640
Let me help you.

141
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,000
Season 2

142
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,640
Season 2

143
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,640
Didn't you come to my office

144
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,400
to observe work for the evening last week?

145
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,680
Why are you here again?

146
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,440
You don't understand.

147
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,880
I'm here to gather energy.

148
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,000
You don't know

149
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,240
how many things I've broken the A-class recently.

150
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,920
Why is your smell so strong?

151
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,680
I was forced out last night.

152
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,960
I'm still dizzy now.

153
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,440
The lab is so high.

154
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,040
You have to force yourself out of the place.

155
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,880
Then you have to force yourself out today.

156
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,760
And order a cake.

157
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,960
It's quite serious.

158
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,800
Today is not a hard day.

159
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,480
Today is...

160
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,400
I know.

161
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,000
Hard day, right?

162
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,360
Xue Xiao, you're always so fresh.

163
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,160
You started hard day at the age of three.

164
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,720
You can't be a busybody for the exam.

165
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,760
You have to get your impression first.

166
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,480
Wait.

167
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,080
Let me, the founder,

168
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,040
personally give you,

169
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,600
the major shareholder of the initiative,

170
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
the most beautiful cake.

171
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,520
Wait.

172
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,240
I'll go.

173
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,200
Look at this cake.

174
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,120
This cream, this flower.

175
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,120
I made it specially for you

176
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,480
to celebrate your signing.

177
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,600
Such a beautiful cake.

178
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,920
Is it for me to celebrate?

179
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,400
Or do you want to eat it?

180
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,200
Both.

181
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,080
Actually, Tian Tian insisted on giving it to me.

182
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,040
But I don't think you're happy

183
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,200
about your signing.

184
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,640
I'm just giving it to you.

185
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
I can't refuse.

186
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,280
Thank you.

187
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,400
I just haven't reached

188
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,920
the final victory.

189
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,480
But it doesn't matter.

190
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,680
Can we celebrate it in advance?

191
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,080
What's wrong?

192
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,720
You look worried.

193
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,080
Relax.

194
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,880
It will be fine.

195
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,080
Thank you.

196
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,680
Easy.

197
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,220
All done

198
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,220
You can go now

199
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,480
Surprise

200
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,880
Xiao Jiao

201
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
Why did you...

202
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,820
Do you take it or not?

203
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,220
We've bought the cake.

204
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,140
Then tonight,

205
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:13,980
let's celebrate

206
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,900
福火生量,

207
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:15,700
Make it a success!

208
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,160
OK.

209
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,660
Thanks for your help.

210
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,900
I hope we'll both show nothing.

211
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,120
If than Car scientists areDet 쓰�dy,

212
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,920
let's just see.

213
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,360
Let's see what people will think.

214
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:47,700
Repairer,

215
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,420
change your clothes,

216
00:10:48,500 --> 00:11:00,960
put your

217
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,120
clothes into the car,

218
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,060
and get home safely.

219
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,520
We will try our best then.

220
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,600
Bye color.

221
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,480
I'll pass by the capital.

222
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,040
How about

223
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,040
you come with me?

224
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,000
Me?

225
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,720
Is it appropriate?

226
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,680
What's wrong with that?

227
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,440
Get in.

228
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,840
I'll leave it to you.

229
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,960
You didn't see it?

230
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,440
See what?

231
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,480
They two.

232
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,760
If I don't pretend to be drunk,

233
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,560
they'll definitely

234
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,000
think of a way to drive you away.

235
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,240
I might as well help them.

236
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,040
With my usual drinking capacity,

237
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,680
you three are used to it.

238
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,400
I can also

239
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,200
send you all to your safety.

240
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,260
I didn't return until I

241
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,720
happened to see her.

242
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,840
observe the consumption of tod çocuk

243
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,440
Michele is sorry.

244
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,720
It's okay.

245
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,580
Your sword browser

246
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,760
should be at his waist.

247
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,880
I don't have the nerve to say it.

248
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,880
You clearly said that there's no one at home.

249
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,880
Then how would I know that Gao Rui said that he had something to do

250
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,880
and wanted to give me a surprise?

251
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,880
What surprise? It's clearly a surprise.

252
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,880
My heart is about to jump out.

253
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,880
I thought you were happy because of me.

254
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,880
That's right.

255
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,880
It's just a pity that the atmosphere was all ruined by him.

256
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,880
Then why don't you make up for it?

257
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,880
I'm going to go.

258
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,880
Young people nowadays are really...

259
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,880
If this is our Xue family, I won't break his legs.

260
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,880
It's good to have a family member.

261
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,880
It's really good.

262
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,880
Why is our date always so embarrassing?

263
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,880
Is it still embarrassing?

264
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,880
What smell?

265
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
What smell?

266
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,880
Creamy smell.

267
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,880
I'm going to go.

268
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,880
Here, drink some water.

269
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
Thank you, Uncle.

270
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,880
You're welcome.

271
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,880
Drink it up. I still have some left.

272
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
Seriously, this person...

273
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,880
He's always busy until late at night.

274
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
There's no time to rest.

275
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,880
Now, he's at home everyday being idle.

276
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,880
I know what boredom is.

277
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,880
I'll drive out whenever I have time.

278
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,880
I'll chat with the passengers.

279
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,880
They'll be happy.

280
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,880
But I didn't expect that

281
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,880
we could meet today.

282
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,880
What a coincidence.

283
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,880
What a coincidence.

284
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,880
Xue Jiao always reminds me that you're excellent.

285
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,880
I was thinking that

286
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,880
I was sitting at the door of my house.

287
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
It's so late at this time.

288
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,880
No one will be driving.

289
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,880
You're here.

290
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,880
Xinjiang, the door of my house.

291
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,880
Yes.

292
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,880
You haven't been here, have you?

293
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,880
I didn't tell you about Xue Jiao.

294
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,880
Come to my house when you have time.

295
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,880
You've been busy lately, right?

296
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
I've been busy until this point.

297
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,880
Really?

298
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,880
I'll go to the bathroom.

299
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,880
Okay.

300
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,880
I'll go to the bathroom.

301
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,880
Okay.

302
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,880
What's the matter?

303
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,880
Master.

304
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,880
Wait, I'll go get some water.

305
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,880
Get up.

306
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,880
Your sister's massage therapist.

307
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,880
Mom, is it appropriate?

308
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,880
Isn't Guo Jiaojiao not here yet?

309
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,880
She'll be here soon.

310
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,880
She's at home now.

311
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,880
She's having a speech meeting with their lab.

312
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,880
When she comes,

313
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,880
let her relax and lean on her.

314
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,880
Besides,

315
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,880
you're a designer.

316
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,880
Massage therapist,

317
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,880
get her a massage ball.

318
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,880
Let her lay on her hand.

319
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,880
We have four people in our family.

320
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,880
We only have three massage therapists.

321
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,880
But this one doesn't prepare me.

322
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,880
Look, look.

323
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,880
Son, don't mention this kind of problem again.

324
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,880
It's meaningless.

325
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,880
You can't imagine

326
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,880
who I was pulling just now.

327
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,880
A big star.

328
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,880
A wanted criminal online.

329
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,880
Stop talking.

330
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,880
Stop talking about pulling.

331
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,880
I said.

332
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
I didn't expect

333
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,880
I pulled Xiao Lin just now.

334
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,880
The one who did her homework

335
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,880
when she was in senior year of high school.

336
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,880
She actually got on the car

337
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,880
near our house.

338
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,880
I mean, the one I saw,

339
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,880
why is she so familiar?

340
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,880
Brother Ling appeared near our house

341
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,880
more than once.

342
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,880
Then they...

343
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,880
This is definitely what you two imagined.

344
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,880
When will Guo Jiaojiao come?

345
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,880
When she comes,

346
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,880
I'll ask her.

347
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,880
Your phone.

348
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,880
I didn't say she wouldn't come.

349
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,880
Why is this girl so willful?

350
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
She has made an appointment.

351
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,880
Brother Ling is such an excellent handsome man.

352
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,880
How can you bear her?

353
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,880
What a pity.

354
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,880
What a pity.

355
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,880
This kid.

356
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,880
Our school is also excellent.

357
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,880
Shut up.

358
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,880
Ling,

359
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,880
the next phase of the agreement will be done.

360
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,880
Shall we go out tonight

361
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,880
to celebrate?

362
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,880
Sister Jiaocheng.

363
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
It's not that simple.

364
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,880
What's there to worry about

365
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,880
about the board?

366
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,880
That's the situation.

367
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
CE failed to pass

368
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,880
the test of our technical department.

369
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,880
I'm sorry about that.

370
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,880
Can you show us

371
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,880
the technical department's test report?

372
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,880
I guess Mr. Zheng will say

373
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,880
this is an internal document.

374
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,880
He has no right to do so.

375
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,880
Mr. Zheng,

376
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,880
CE is a mature technology

377
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
that we have approved

378
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,880
many times in our lab.

379
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,880
We have also given

380
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
a full solution

381
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
to the technical difficulties

382
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,880
you mentioned last time.

383
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,880
The test failed.

384
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,880
This excuse is too ridiculous.

385
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
Excuses?

386
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,880
Ling.

387
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,880
Mr. Zheng,

388
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,880
how about this?

389
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,880
Can you help us

390
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,880
to ask the technical department's

391
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,880
engineer to talk to us face to face?

392
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,880
I think even if there is a dispute,

393
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,880
it should be

394
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,880
a misunderstanding.

395
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,880
We'll try to solve it.

396
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,880
I've tried my best

397
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,880
to help you.

398
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,880
But that's the result.

399
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,880
I have to consider

400
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,880
the interests of the group.

401
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
You have to make such a choice?

402
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,880
Yes, Mr. Zheng.

403
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,880
You can't give up

404
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,880
such a good project.

405
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,880
I didn't say I would give up.

406
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,880
CE is indeed

407
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,880
a very promising project.

408
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,880
You don't have to doubt it.

409
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,880
But the problem is

410
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,880
you have broken the contract.

411
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,880
You failed to pass the technical department's

412
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,880
verification according to the contract.

413
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,880
So BNC will take away

414
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,880
all the technical and patent

415
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,880
of your team

416
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,880
and continue to develop this project

417
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,880
through internal research.

418
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,880
What did you say?

419
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,880
I think I've made it clear to you.

420
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,880
You said you wouldn't pass it.

421
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,880
Why did you take away

422
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,880
the patent and technology

423
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,880
we have studied?

424
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,880
It's okay to keep the patent

425
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,880
and technology.

426
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,880
This is the contract notice.

427
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,880
Take a look.

428
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,880
Can you accept it?

429
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,880
Let's go.

430
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,880
There's no need to wait.

431
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,880
No.

432
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,880
Why are you leaving like this?

433
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,880
Who didn't suffer

434
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,880
the social poison

435
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,880
when they were young?

436
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,880
It's good to be used to it.

437
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
Young people.

438
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,880
Let's go.

439
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,880
Let's go, Gao Rui.

440
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,880
You wanted to

441
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,880
take away the patent.

442
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,880
BNC has been looking at

443
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,880
our technical patent

444
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
from the beginning.

445
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,880
My boyfriend is from

446
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,880
the international law school.

447
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
I'm going to ask him

448
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,880
if there's any way

449
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,880
to deal with him.

450
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,880
Where's the old lover?

451
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,880
We can't find Brother Ling.

452
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,880
Now

453
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
Ling Jiadong

454
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,880
has been calling

455
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,880
the phone

456
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,880
of Li Naicheng

457
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,880
for more than a dozen times.

458
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,880
Where's my phone?

459
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,880
The most vulnerable

460
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,880
are men who are beaten.

461
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,880
Everyone is trying

462
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,880
to find a way to

463
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,880
calm him down.

464
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,880
No.

465
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,880
He must be

466
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,880
trying to solve it now.

467
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,880
You know him well.

468
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,880
I...

469
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,880
I've been in the lab

470
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
for two or three years.

471
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,880
I'm just kidding.

472
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,880
What do you think he can do?

473
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,880
He...

474
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,880
He...

475
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
I haven't heard it yet.

476
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,880
I'm going to write it now.

477
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,880
Every time I see

478
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
bubble mixed with coffee,

479
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,880
I think of

480
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,880
the Olympic water polo match.

481
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
Angle, accuracy, strength,

482
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,880
and lack.

483
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,680
I don't want to do it and it's just the opposite.

484
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,520
Don't?

485
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,160
You just forget it.

486
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,160
You remember it now and then you speak.

487
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,360
This is...

488
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,160
Don't you hear me?

489
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,520
submerged.

490
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,280
Right.

491
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,080
And it's the opposite also.

492
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,360
Right now you are an expert in art,

493
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,720
but you are lacking tiny thoughts.

494
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,920
I don't have any plan.

495
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,400
Now in the lab,

496
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,800
someone is helping you to check the solid evidence.

497
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,240
Someone is helping you to find a law student.

498
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,600
You are here,

499
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,920
isn't it a little bit hard to persuade?

500
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,960
A cup of latte.

501
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,280
Okay.

502
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,400
I'm busy, too.

503
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,360
C1 is your hard work for so many years.

504
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,600
If the experiment fails this time,

505
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,360
it will make all efforts to help Dongliu.

506
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,080
And the most terrible thing is that the people are scattered.

507
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,440
The whole team will be gone.

508
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,720
When I was doing research and development,

509
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,840
I was under a lot of pressure.

510
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,320
Take this time to have a good rest,

511
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,680
including you.

512
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,400
I don't want to rest.

513
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,280
I can't waste time at this time.

514
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:54,920
You...

515
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:57,920
You...

516
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,320
You go back to the lab, okay?

517
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,320
I'll help you to work here.

518
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,320
Take me to the lab.

519
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,040
There are too many guests.

520
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,640
I can't walk away.

521
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,600
Senior

522
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,560
Attention.

523
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,080
Hello, Chunlan.

524
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,640
Xu Jiao.

525
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,640
Mr. Zhang is very experienced in this case.

526
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,640
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

527
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,640
I've already talked to Mr. Zhang about the basic case.

528
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,640
You guys can talk about the rest.

529
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,640
Bye-bye.

530
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,640
Mr. Zhang, please sit.

531
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,640
Then, based on this situation,

532
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,640
is our R&D team's role big?

533
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,640
It sounds like

534
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,640
BNC's gambling agreement has a suspicion of being a fraud.

535
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,640
They will cut the entrance from this direction.

536
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,640
I think it's a bit of a hope.

537
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,640
That's great!

538
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,640
BNC's legal team is not easy to deal with.

539
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,640
It will make the case much more complicated.

540
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,640
If you want to file a lawsuit, the cost will not be low.

541
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,640
I understand.

542
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,640
Then, what is your charge standard?

543
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,640
Our team's economic dispute case

544
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,640
will usually be calculated with a

545
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,640
100% tax on the shooting fee.

546
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,640
You are my junior,

547
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,640
so you will take good care of me.

548
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,640
But I estimate it won't be less than 5%.

549
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,640
5%?

550
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,640
It's okay.

551
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,640
You can think about it.

552
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,640
Wait.

553
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,640
Tiantian, the creative shareholder

554
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,640
needs to be changed.

555
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,640
No problem.

556
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,640
We will definitely file this lawsuit.

557
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,640
Last time, I

558
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,640
was taken away by the editor's

559
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,640
Zheng Zong.

560
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,640
This time, I

561
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,640
will have to start a counterattack.

562
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,640
Sorry, Mr. Zhao.

563
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,640
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

564
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,640
It's okay.

565
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,640
I just invested in the latest

566
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,640
hand-to-hand trade. It's interesting.

567
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,640
From the 88th episode,

568
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,640
my senior came to see me. It's quite interesting.

569
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,640
Really?

570
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,640
It's interesting.

571
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,640
Tiantian,

572
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,640
I heard that your C1 project with BNC

573
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,640
is not going well.

574
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,640
Mr. Zhao, do you still remember

575
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,640
when BNC entered the Chinese market

576
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,640
in a high-profile 20 years ago?

577
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,640
The first local car

578
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,640
they developed...

579
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,640
It's been too long.

580
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,640
I can't remember it. I forgot.

581
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,640
I remember.

582
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,640
But I remember it because

583
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,640
it was our senior from Jinghai University

584
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,640
who led the school's

585
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,640
research and development team.

586
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,640
You made me lose.

587
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,640
I just found out.

588
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,640
So you are

589
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,640
the former car

590
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,640
I worked with BNC.

591
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,640
Mr. Zhao.

592
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,640
Mr. Lin, I told you

593
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,640
that it had nothing to do with Zheng Qian.

594
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,640
I won't talk about it.

595
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,640
How about today?

596
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,640
Let's call it a day.

597
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,640
Mr. Zhao, the car you developed

598
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,640
back then,

599
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,640
was taken away

600
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,640
before it was delivered.

601
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,640
Do you still have dreams?

602
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,640
Do you think I'm too

603
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,640
young to have dreams?

604
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,640
You often

605
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,640
attend the investment meeting

606
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,640
of this car industry.

607
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,640
Everyone can see it.

608
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,640
Otherwise, we wouldn't know each other.

609
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,640
I was the first one

610
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,640
who was good to your C1 project.

611
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,640
But you

612
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,640
turned your head

613
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,640
and put me

614
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,640
in the position of

615
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,640
the head of the company.

616
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,640
I can't explain

617
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,640
the grudge between me and BNC.

618
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,640
But my C1

619
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,640
failure

620
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,640
was actually in my plan.

621
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,640
What are you doing?

622
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,640
I told you to be the record holder.

623
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,640
I'm talking to you.

624
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,640
Did you hear me?

625
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,640
Little boy.

626
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,640
What are you talking about?

627
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,640
When did it become your will?

628
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,640
Shouldn't it be our will?

629
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,640
We can sponsor it.

630
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,640
Of course we can take it back.

631
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,640
Even if it's sponsored by BNC,

632
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,640
we're also

633
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,640
implementing the contract.

634
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,640
Can you be more contractual?

635
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,640
You can't just take it back.

636
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,640
It's not a waste of money.

637
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,640
Mr. Zheng only has the contract.

638
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,640
Enough.

639
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,640
Sign it.

640
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,640
Hurry up.

641
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,640
This...

642
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,640
It's too clean.

643
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,640
Let me see.

644
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,640
This is the best one.

645
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,640
It's good.

646
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,640
It's good.

647
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,640
I'll sign it.

648
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,640
I'll sign it.

649
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,640
I'll sign it.

650
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,640
I'll sign it.

651
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,640
I'll sign it.

652
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,640
I'll sign it.

653
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,640
You're going to sign it?

654
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,640
I'll sign it.

655
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,640
I'll sign it.

656
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,640
You're crazy.

657
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,640
Lin,

658
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,640
working with BNC

659
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,640
is not a child's play.

660
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,640
I'll remind you

661
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,640
of the investment.

662
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,640
All the technical teams

663
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,640
working with BNC

664
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,640
are all good.

665
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,640
So I'm here

666
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,640
to ask you

667
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,640
to solve the contract

668
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,640
and the contract.

669
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,640
You're going home?

670
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,640
You're not even making coffee.

671
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,640
You're just staying at home?

672
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,640
Lin Zhi Hua.

673
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,640
I'll just stay at home

674
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,640
and you can't do anything.

675
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,560
Surely you don't have to

676
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:57,720
have daughterfals

677
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,520
to make me feel bad?

678
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,260
How long did everyone wait?

679
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,640
Even the end-user initiative

680
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,800
has been beholdn by BNC.

681
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,400
Take a seat.

682
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,400
Don't be upset.

683
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,560
It's good for your eyes. Look.

684
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,640
What time is it?

685
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,000
You're still here?

686
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,080
I asked you to go to the law firm today.

687
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,960
Why don't you go?

688
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,600
I'm playing games.

689
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,960
Tomorrow at 10 a.m.

690
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,520
Go to see a lawyer with me.

691
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,960
I've paid the lawyer's fee.

692
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,040
If you don't go,

693
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,080
you'll be the one to suffer.

694
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,200
What suffer?

695
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,000
Stop laughing.

696
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,640
Is there a way to ease the burden?

697
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,600
I know it's a very difficult thing.

698
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,000
But it's not a way to escape.

699
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,600
Don't worry.

700
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,880
No matter how difficult it is,

701
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,880
I'll be with you.

702
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,600
Okay.

703
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,240
I'll listen to you.

704
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:06,720
What time?

705
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,800
Tomorrow at 10 a.m.

706
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,280
Hello, brother Feng.

707
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,800
Hello, sister.

708
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,920
How many times have you closed the Logist tomorrow?

709
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,600
ring

710
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,560
Today, 12 o'clock.

711
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,600
Ok courage

712
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,240
What should I do?

713
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,720
Lu Mine

714
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,000
Install their wrong account

715
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,800
And tell theru's father

716
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,840
He's just a glasses seller.

717
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,120
No, do I look like he's delicious now?

718
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,160
But he's a big international client.

719
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,840
Brother, important task.

720
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,240
He's competing in the W frontal discount event.

721
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,720
So, I can go now.

722
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,720
It's quite a coincidence.

723
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,120
You walked from Jinghai University to here.

724
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,120
You must have worked hard.

725
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,520
Oh, right. Do you have something to do later?

726
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,920
I'll treat you to dinner.

727
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,720
Hi, needle.

728
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,920
Alright.

729
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,820
Let's have오tine.

730
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,920
How about another bottle?

731
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,320
Sure.

732
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,820
You still shareholders when you're into it.

733
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,720
You're here today specifically in my name right?

734
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,120
If you want to say something, just say so.

735
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,480
I do have something to tell you

736
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,720
I...

737
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:53,840
I...

738
00:32:59,240 --> 00:32:59,880
Waiter

739
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,240
Hello

740
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:00,960
One more

741
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,880
Please wait a moment

742
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,920
I want you to be my investor

743
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,560
Well

744
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,440
I have stopped working with BC

745
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,360
on the project of Lao Lin

746
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,280
But we can't find a new investor now

747
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,360
We are in a bad situation these days

748
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,400
I know

749
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,600
it would be better if Lao Lin told you about it

750
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,440
But you know Lao Lin's temper

751
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,800
He must be embarrassed to talk to his family

752
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,240
But I don't care

753
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,480
I have a thick face

754
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,240
Anyway, no matter what the situation is

755
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,080
if you are not happy

756
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,240
just tell me

757
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
I can take it

758
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,800
You are in trouble

759
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,080
at the beginning

760
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,560
The bigger the company like BNC

761
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,200
the more you can't

762
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,080
take advantage of a small company like yours

763
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,000
Since you are here

764
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,360
I will tell you the truth

765
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,480
Okay

766
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,080
If your core technology patent

767
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,040
is taken away by them

768
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,960
the company will be worthless

769
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,640
Even if I take charge of the financing

770
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,680
it's not a big deal

771
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,200
After all, no investor

772
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,440
is willing to invest his own money

773
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,320
in a company that loses value

774
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,040
I understand

775
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,760
Unless

776
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,680
Unless our boss wants to invest

777
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,760
But even if the boss wants to invest

778
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,960
it's hard to say whether your Lin Zhihua

779
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,320
is willing to accept it

780
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,200
He...

781
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,600
He dares not

782
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,120
Don't worry

783
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,480
As long as you can get the boss

784
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,360
I will definitely

785
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,760
bring Lao Lin here

786
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,920
Don't worry about it

787
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,040
Let's bring him into the capital

788
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:03,600
Don't worry

789
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,400
Leave it to me

790
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,560
Cheers

791
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,720
pectereum

792
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,560
It will definitely affect sleeping

793
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,720
If there is such a case

794
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:14,760
in our company

795
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,400
as long as no one is modified

796
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,320
I...

797
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:18,760
I egoistic

798
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,680
will go to the police

799
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,760
It will cause troubles

800
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,400
A person must save the troubles

801
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,180
More than one person

802
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,920
It's all my fault

803
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:34,720
Sir

804
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,840
Is there a problem with your performance?

805
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,720
They are in trouble

806
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,900
they you're not with양

807
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,040
T ones

808
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,680
Oh

809
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,760
I really

810
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,800
Obviously,musicians should listen to others

811
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,260
don't let anyone use such tools

812
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,100
who say so

813
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,440
Then you ask a lot age

814
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,280
or I would be mad

815
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,720
You would understand

816
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,800
No

817
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,840
I'm at your tricks

818
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,800
You are not a student

819
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,520
Why are you so cocky when you think so?

820
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,000
You know

821
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,720
division and division

822
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,480
Oops

823
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,680
Well

824
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,200
You are not my fault

825
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,920
You won't understand, dad.

826
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,000
Your mom and I agree.

827
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,160
We should be tied together

828
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,400
and support each other.

829
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,320
Right?

830
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,840
Look at us.

831
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,560
We have no mistrust in love.

832
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,000
Dad, you can just be a grandpa in front of others.

833
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,520
You and mom didn't divorce

834
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,840
because you tied it too tightly.

835
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,520
I don't want to tie it too tightly.

836
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,720
I don't want to keep you company

837
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,000
after you invest.

838
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,320
And,

839
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,240
drink less, dad.

840
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,600
Do a physical examination.

841
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,920
You'll have liver problems in two years.

842
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,880
I see, son.

843
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,000
Dad, dad.

844
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:41,800
Dad.

845
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,000
You can't kill me.

846
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,200
What?

847
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,240
Don't you think that I would let you be alone

848
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,720
if I dreamt about it?

849
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,360
Hey, comment released recently.

850
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,320
Let's discuss it.

851
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:03,960
Ok.

852
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,520
You're so arrogant

853
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,520
I don't want to argue with you today

854
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,520
What's your attitude?

855
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,520
You're the son of your own son

856
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,520
You're so cowardly

857
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,520
I'm wrong

858
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,520
You're just afraid

859
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,520
You're afraid that you can't stop the people in the board if you lose money

860
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,520
It's my son who blocked me with words

861
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,520
Ji Rui, my son has grown up

862
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,520
He has already seen us as parents

863
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,520
He doesn't refuse to accept the investment of other companies

864
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,520
He doesn't want to see us in front of him

865
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,520
We have been acting together for a lifetime

866
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,520
Do you think we should play with our son?

867
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,520
Don't you feel tired?

868
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,520
Be careful

869
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,520
Xiao Gu

870
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,520
If Lin Zhi Hua can't come today

871
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,520
We will meet another day

872
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,520
My formal legal consultations are in time

873
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,520
You're wasting my time

874
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,520
I'm sorry, lawyer Zhao

875
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,520
Please wait a moment

876
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,520
I'll go out and have a look

877
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,600
It's a serious problem in Cang Guangsheng's department.

878
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:59,860
If there is room for

879
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,060
professional legal team.

880
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,260
Since they dare to beat me,

881
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,180
there must be their legal explanation.

882
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,460
So later we will go in

883
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,140
to relax and calm down.

884
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,460
Then you can't lie flat.

885
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,060
I'm not lying flat.

886
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,420
Actually, yesterday,

887
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,300
I already tore open the cover

888
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,540
of BNC's fake cat

889
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,780
through the people I knew.

890
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,660
And I just got

891
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,180
the first-hand materials

892
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,100
of their violation of business ethics.

893
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,380
I will continue to collect

894
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,660
the materials of the other

895
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,540
BNC-hungered teams.

896
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,180
I'm not lying flat.

897
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,820
So

898
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,980
you have your own plan?

899
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,980
How long have you known me?

900
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,180
Can I be lazy for nothing?

901
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,620
BNC has been arrogant

902
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,620
for so many years.

903
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,220
It's not just me

904
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,340
who offended them.

905
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,780
I'm also a small creative team.

906
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,660
So my plan is

907
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,340
to unite all its enemies

908
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,300
and work together to deal with BNC.

909
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,060
This is called

910
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:01,020
the first-hand materials of business ethics.

911
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,460
I got the inspiration

912
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,340
from the game I played yesterday.

913
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,780
You got the inspiration

914
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,180
from the game you played?

915
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,060
Then you should have

916
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,260
told me in advance.

917
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,220
I didn't have

918
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,380
enough confidence at first.

919
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,100
And BNC was afraid

920
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,460
people would stare at me.

921
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,100
If I didn't act like them,

922
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,540
how could they relax and calm down?

923
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,940
Then this lawyer...

924
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,100
It's up to the lawyer.

925
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,860
You worked hard to find him.

926
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,700
Let's do it.

927
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,460
You two.

928
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,500
Do you have any time limit?

929
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,580
Do you know what time it is?

930
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,020
My problem?

931
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,340
Sorry.

932
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,940
Let's get started.

933
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,860
Can I take yourlass fall 옦

934
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,060
and change into patriotic white dressfыd-flute?

935
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:46,860
Be careful.

936
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,740
What do I do?

937
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:50,860
Look at me.

938
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,500
Look.

939
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,420
Your pose

940
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,380
is way too shabby.

941
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,980
Let me teach you a lesson.

942
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,940
This is how to use your legs.

943
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,420
Right.

944
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,740
is the best way to open up Bai Lan.

945
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,540
You have a lot of experience in Bai Lan.

946
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,220
I've never eaten pork.

947
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,580
I've never seen pig's trotters.

948
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,340
I have a little experience.

949
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:26,860
Really?

950
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,540
Your brother gave you experience, right?

951
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:31,700
Yes.

952
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,540
My brother.

953
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,700
