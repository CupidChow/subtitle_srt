19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,080
   

20
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,190
Little sister.

21
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,030
Why are you here so late?

22
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,390
How did you and Petal meet?

23
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,910
- I... 
 - I'm her tutor.

24
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,520
I help her with schoolwork.

25
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,080
So you're agreeing to tutor me?

26
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,900
Yes. Go to the Jinghai University.

27
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:00,660
Great! Then, just take these. Here.

28
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,600
What is this?

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,910
Isn't it written on there?

30
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,130
This is ginseng. And this, too.

31
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,060
And these are cordyceps.

32
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,320
They're all for you.

33
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,360
Since you've agreed to tutor me, I have to show my gratitude.

34
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,870
Please accept these.

35
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,120
Take good care of your health.

36
00:02:27,928 --> 00:02:29,360
   

37
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,040
   

38
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,060
How about I make you some ginseng tea first?

39
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,020
Senior Brother Lin.

40
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,910
She’s just someone from my high school who’s a few years younger than me.

41
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,140
Okay, okay, I get it.

42
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,150
But I think you really do need to take care of your health.

43
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,470
You've been so busy lately, you look worn out.

44
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,460
I can't bear to watch anymore.

45
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,610
Just get to the point. Skip the preamble.

46
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,460
I'll be direct then.

47
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,750
Your parents are coming back for the shareholder meeting.

48
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,570
You have to give them a warm welcome.

49
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,520
When they come back, Lin Qi should welcome them.

50
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,030
Why should I?

51
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,350
We'll greet them at the office. But at home, it's your job.

52
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,060
You've been living alone for years now.

53
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,710
Aren't you lonely?

54
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:37,520
Once Uncle and Aunt return, this house will be immediately full of life.

55
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,130
The spare key's by the door. Don't forget to grab it.

56
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,780
And once the date's set, tell me.

57
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,340
Okay. I'll find someone to come and clean up a bit.

58
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,330
And get the house ready for them.

59
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,750
When they get back, I'll just go and stay in my dorm for a few days.

60
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,510
I'm going to sleep.

61
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,390
Why isn't Jiao Jiao up yet?

62
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,470
She's been studying very hard recently. She's too tired.

63
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,050
Uncle Zhou gave us some supplements last time.

64
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,410
Check the date on them.

65
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,050
Give the fresh ones to Jiao Jiao.

66
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,220
And give the almost-expired ones to me.

67
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,880
You wish. We have to give those to our son.

68
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,130
Give me the expired ones then.

69
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,670
Dad, I'm still a kid.

70
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,590
Too many tonics will fry my brain.

71
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,180
I have to get to school early for a college exam prep rally today.

72
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,690
I can't talk right now. I have to go.

73
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,090
Okay.

74
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,760
Hello, students. 
    

75
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,640
 Hello, Principal! 

76
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,200
During freshman year, everyone can be carefree.

77
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,180
And during sophomore year, you can still laugh and be joyful.

78
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,520
But not during senior year.

79
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,680
Because now is the time to grind.

80
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,810
It's time to work hard.

81
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,640
Now, I want you all to ask yourselves,

82
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,050
do you know the Memorial Regarding the Northern Expedition, inside and out?

83
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,960
 - No.  
 - Who said no?

84
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,780
Why isn't he here yet?

85
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,790
Where is our class president?

86
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,910
Maybe he fell in the toilet.

87
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,790
I think he probably freaked out about going on stage.

88
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,960
 Understood. 

89
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,910
Come on, you know him.

90
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,240
Considering his personality,

91
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,030
he'll never miss a chance to shine in front of the whole grade.

92
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:29,370
Even if he has to crawl, he'll get himself here.

93
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,350
Be careful with your phone.

94
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,200
- It's okay. 
 - The principal is watching.

95
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,000
Romain Rolland once said,

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,350
there's only one true heroism in the world.

97
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:43,030
It is to see the world as it is, and to love it.

98
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,790
I hope you can see studying as it is

99
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,320
and love it

100
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,560
in order to reach one goal. 
    

101
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,160
Acing the college entrance exam! 
    

102
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,400
So, everyone,

103
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,230
the road is long and arduous,

104
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,980
but the best is yet to come.

105
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,420
That's enough with the small talk.

106
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:03,620
Now, let's welcome our student representative to the stage.

107
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,450
   

108
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,180
Dear teachers, fellow students, hello.

109
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,620
 - Where are you?  
 - I'm Zhou Shiyun, the class representative from Senior Year, Class 1.

110
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,020
 I'm at the entrance. 

111
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,950
Crawl... I'll crawl if I have to.

112
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,360
Thank you, everyone.

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,580
   

114
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:55,060
Next, let's welcome the class representative from Class 8.

115
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,110
Principal. Principal, come here.

116
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,980
Well... I'm sorry about this.

117
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,054
Our class representative is running over from the field.

118
00:07:04,054 --> 00:07:05,990
Look, there. He's on the field.

119
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,233
How can he be late for this?

120
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:09,570
He's running over. Look, there he is.

121
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,820
- There. 
 - That one?

122
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,720
Hurry up! Come on.

123
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,890
- Xuejiao! 
 - Isn't that Xuejiao?

124
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,840
Xuejiao. Hurry up.

125
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,760
Hurry. Xuejiao.

126
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,530
Gu Xuejiao?

127
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,590
- This... why are you here? 
 - Sorry, Teacher.

128
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,940
Come here. Come on.

129
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,180
Come.

130
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,840
Come on.

131
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,430
- Xuejiao. 
 - Xuejiao.

132
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,330
- Come here. 
 - What's going on?

133
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,160
What's the matter with you?

134
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,570
How can a class representative show up late?

135
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,412
- You forgot your watch? 
 - She...

136
00:07:49,412 --> 00:07:51,610
Wait, she... That...

137
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,760
Go and give your speech.

138
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,780
- Teacher, I... 
 - G-Go on then.

139
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,720
Come up here.

140
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,310
Let's welcome our Class 8 class representative to the stage!

141
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,360
Go, hurry.

142
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,330
- Go on. 
  - Yes! 

143
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,710
Go, go, go.

144
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,340
 Yes! 

145
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,060
   

146
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,090
Hello, everyone. I'm Gu Xuejiao from Senior Year, Class 8.

147
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,380
 Great! 

148
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,650
Go, Xuejiao!

149
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,200
My declaration for the college entrance exam...

150
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,540
is...

151
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,070
 I had to kick a contractor out to make room for you. 

152
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,500
 Although she's a contractor, she... 

153
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:55,420
She's passable, I guess, but can't compare to a real talent like you.

154
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,100
 You gave up everything for a guy, turning down promotion chances. 

155
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,240
 After five years, you're still a highly replaceable contractor. 

156
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:07,300
 If Yi Tianyu hadn't shown up, she might've gone to Jinghai University, not me. 

157
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,090
I want to go to Jinghai University!

158
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,280
♫  Block out the AC, sofa, and soft drinks  ♫

159
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,520
♫  Block out the games, TV, and posters  ♫

160
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,340
♫  Block out the yawning as a sign from heaven  ♫

161
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,950
♫  Block everything that is of no importance  ♫

162
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,810
- What are you laughing at? 
 - What are you laughing at?

163
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,090
That's great!

164
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,780
- Good! 
 - Xuejiao, you can do it!

165
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,140
Good!

166
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,180
Go!

167
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,480
Yes!

168
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,980
Go, Xuejiao!

169
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,000
- Xuejiao, go! 
 - Yes!

170
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,880
♫  Even if I fall, I fall with grace  ♫

171
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,080
♫  Whether life can be restarted   ♫

172
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
♫  I can't say for sure  ♫

173
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,420
♫  If I fail again, I won't be sad  ♫

174
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,880
You can do it!

175
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,640
♫  There is no secret manual to life, so let's ignite it  ♫

176
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,200
 - Yes. 
 - Jinghai University. 

177
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,390
 Yes, so? 

178
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,680
 Stop saying that. 

179
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,800
 He said it, not me. 

180
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,480
 - What did I say? 
 - Seriously? 

181
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,400
 What's wrong with Xuejiao wanting to get into Jinghai University? 

182
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,800
 I didn't say anything. 

183
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,990
 - Who said it? 
 - I heard you say it just now. 

184
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,100
I heard you're aiming for Jinghai University.

185
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,040
You're not talking about Jinghai Open University, right?

186
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,280
My dad said that it shut down years ago. Don't get scammed.

187
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,420
J, I, N, G, H, A, I.

188
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,990
Also known as the "Dream School."

189
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,700
You crossed the line.

190
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,110
Quiet! Quiet, please!

191
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,400
Class Representative, is your stomach better?

192
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,590
Cut it out. Don't mess around.

193
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,350
I've got real news.

194
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,040
The principal said all senior year students

195
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,550
will be having a parent meeting tomorrow afternoon.

196
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,400
 It's that parent meeting... 

197
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,080
 He kept saying that after the meeting. 

198
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,960
 How could anyone resist it? 

199
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,830
 I was thinking, we did make money before by following his advice. 

200
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,960
 Who would've thought it'd crash this bad? 

201
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,350
 Now look, we've put our savings in, 

202
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,930
 as well as the borrowed money. 

203
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,860
 What do we do now? How are we gonna live? 

204
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,240
 That so-called expert said, 

205
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,320
 "It has upside potential now. 

206
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,530
 Don't miss the opportunity." 

207
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,740
 Why did you believe everything he said? 

208
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,580
   

209
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:37,060
What do you need?

210
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,560
I need you.

211
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,380
Hello, nice to meet you.

212
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,700
I saw you had a nightmare last time in the bookstore,

213
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,410
so I got you a protective doll.

214
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,630
Senior Brother Lin, please. Just take it.

215
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,630
Maybe it'll help you ward off a big disaster.

216
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,510
This ugly doll will only give me more nightmares.

217
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,400
Don't listen to him. We won't listen to him!

218
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,292
I carefully selected this doll. It's both ugly and cute.

219
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:22,340
How could you say that?

220
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Senior Brother Lin.

221
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,270
You... I...

222
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,590
You're not giving me a doll for nothing. Just tell me.

223
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,440
I... I... I just... I...

224
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,380
I just have a tiny little request.

225
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,000
Can you go to the parent meeting for me?

226
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,560
That's a tiny request?

227
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,510
Just this once! Please.

228
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,920
Can you really bear to see me get scolded in front of the whole class by the teacher,

229
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,630
all helpless among a bunch of parents?

230
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,750
Yes.

231
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,060
And I'd enjoy it.

232
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,630
Then...

233
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,990
Then all the more reason to see it in person.

234
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,680
I'm off.

235
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,320
Don't try to trick me.

236
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,870
I'm not going.

237
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,520
Look over there.

238
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,960
Senior Brother Lin! Please.

239
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,590
Tomorrow afternoon at 3:00. Okay? Please.

240
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,120
- Here. 
 - Okay.

241
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,470
I heard someone in our class wants to go to Jinghai University.

242
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,430
That's one ambitious goal.

243
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,830
Hello, nice to meet you.

244
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:39,990
I'm Yi Dafa.

245
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,770
Big projects, no sweat, Yi Dafa's your bet!

246
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,350
We're all here thanks to fate.

247
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,750
Right?

248
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:55,680
Through our kids... I'm in construction.

249
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,820
Here, older brother.

250
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,230
Here, little brother.

251
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,070
I'm in construction. Call me if you've got any projects.

252
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,420
Uncle?

253
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,860
Dad!

254
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,180
I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I thought you were my dad.

255
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,990
Gu Xuejiao, since when were you nearsighted? Why didn't I know that?

256
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,700
I'm trying to get back to Class 1.

257
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,160
I've been studying too hard.

258
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,570
It's messing with my eyes.

259
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,870
 Weird. She's been all about studying lately. 

260
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,040
 What's gotten into her? 

261
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,470
Xiao Gu, hello, I'm Tianyu's father, Yi Dafa.

262
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,910
- Big... 
 - Big projects, no sweat, Yi Dafa's your bet!

263
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,870
What a great kid. This kid's going places!

264
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,040
Is this seat taken? Can I sit here?

265
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,910
Yes, you can.

266
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:46,560
 Back in the day, whenever Yi Tianyu and I fought, 

267
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,630
 Uncle always had my back. 

268
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:53,290
 Uncle, you also had your glory days. 

269
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,160
Xiao Gu, where are your parents?

270
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,040
My parents...

271
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,160
They've passed away?

272
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,360
Don't say that.

273
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,360
You...

274
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,560
Your dad looks so young!

275
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,920
I'm her uncle.

276
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,070
Biological uncle.

277
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,200
Such a fine-looking uncle.

278
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,960
Here's my business card.

279
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,040
Yi Dafa.

280
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,590
Thank you.

281
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,350
What made you change your mind and come to my rescue?

282
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,710
 Can you really bear to see me all helpless in front of the whole class? 

283
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,280
I couldn't bear it.

284
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,110
All right, parents, well, it's about time.

285
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,710
Please take your seats, okay?

286
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,440
And students, please go out.

287
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,510
Come on.

288
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,710
Don't say nonsense.

289
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,200
- Come on, hurry. 
 - Be nice.

290
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,140
Just wait to get scolded.

291
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,800
Tianyu, let's go play ball.

292
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,920
No.

293
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,200
Why not?

294
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,110
I already brought the ball.

295
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,310
My dad still doesn't know what score I got last time.

296
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,170
He should find out soon.

297
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,760
What if he gets so angry that he has a stroke?

298
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,550
Okay, I'll keep an eye out for you.

299
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,132
 This parent meeting is actually... 

300
00:16:44,132 --> 00:16:45,550
Gu Xuejiao.

301
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,030
What?

302
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,140
Let's take a look. Go.

303
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,990
 There's only one topic today, the college entrance exam. 

304
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:54,440
The Study God from No.7 High School is actually your uncle.

305
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,990
And you didn't tell me?

306
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,600
He's just a stand-in today.

307
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,000
You got someone to pretend—

308
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,410
 A few days ago, we already had our prep rally. 

309
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:09,270
 Some students' goals are really ambitious. 

310
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,790
Others are more realistic.

311
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,620
I believe you parents already have a clear sense

312
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,030
of what schools to aim for.

313
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,580
Right?

314
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,990
What goals? With 300-something scores?

315
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,360
So, today, if you have any questions,

316
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,550
I'm here to answer them. Okay?

317
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,270
Teacher, I heard someone in our class is aiming for Jinghai University.

318
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,580
Isn't that a bit much?

319
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,550
Having a major goal is already half the battle won.

320
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,640
Whose parent is that?

321
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,790
He looks so young.

322
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:47,250
I don't know if you've heard about the Zeigarnik Effect.

323
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:52,470
Those who have a big goal and are pushing forward towards it

324
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,550
have a greater chance of success.

325
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,310
So, I don't think it's laughable.

326
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,520
In fact, if every goal were easy to reach,

327
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,000
then life wouldn't be worth much.

328
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,550
The Zeigarnik Effect.

329
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:18,200
Whose parent is that? He's so eloquent!

330
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,350
Who's eloquent? Let's go.

331
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,360
What about your dad?

332
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,550
Forget it.

333
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,360
I just remembered, last time he beat me like crazy without a break.

334
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,710
He's not going to have a stroke.

335
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,650
He's right.

336
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,790
Big dreams need a bold spirit.

337
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,540
You need to aim high to reach high.

338
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,890
I'm going to write it down.

339
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:38,130
I think this parent made a very good point.

340
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,960
We often say,

341
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,790
parents' support gives children the strength to go far.

342
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,640
 Parents' vision sets the child's horizon. 

343
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,440
 So, I think, it isn't necessarily a bad thing 

344
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,920
 to aim a little higher. 

345
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,790
Your daughter Shiyun got the highest score in English this time.

346
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,400
She's so impressive.

347
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,880
What tutoring program is she in?

348
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,070
Her?

349
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,640
She doesn't go to any tutoring classes.

350
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,510
We've never interfered in her studies.

351
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,510
It's all her own effort.

352
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,360
What a brilliant kid.

353
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,410
And she isn't just smart, she's pretty too.

354
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,930
Of course, she takes after her mom.

355
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,380
You flatter me.

356
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,710
Yunyun.

357
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,230
- Mom. 
 - We were just talking about you.

358
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,920
Were you helping the teacher again?

359
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,990
Okay, we'll leave you two to chat.

360
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,300
- We'll leave first. 
 - Okay, see you around.

361
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,440
Bye-bye.

362
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,660
- Goodbye, Aunties. 
 - Goodbye.

363
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:32,160
Mom, I'm done with my things, too. Want to go home together?

364
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,400
Go home?

365
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,260
The gift for your teacher is in the car. Go and get it.

366
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,600
Out of all the subjects, only your English is decent.

367
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,390
All the money I spent on you was for nothing.

368
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,750
Shiyun.

369
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,160
So what do you think? Am I reliable?

370
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,230
What do you mean?

371
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,960
That night, I helped cover for you and Xuejiao.

372
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,990
Seriously, it was a test of both physical and mental strength.

373
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,160
I was running back and forth between two rooms

374
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,020
and switching between two genders.

375
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:21,510
You mean that night when Jiaojiao and I were together?

376
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,970
Yes.

377
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,550
Is your mom done with the parents' meeting?

378
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,340
My mom actually asked me to tell her something.

379
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,840
- Parents' meeting? 
 - You didn't know?

380
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,490
There was a meeting, but I'm in the repeaters' class.

381
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,200
We didn't have one.

382
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,960
But the meeting for Class 8 should be over by now.

383
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,380
My mom should've left already.

384
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,270
Did your class's meeting run late?

385
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,530
It wasn't the meeting.

386
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,970
It was my mom chatting with everyone.

387
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,240
It took a while.

388
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,510
But can you blame her?

389
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,210
Her daughter is doing so well,

390
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,420
she must've been glowing with pride at the meeting.

391
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,760
Well, that's her glory. It has nothing to do with me.

392
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,440
Why would you think that?

393
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,950
You're amazing. Your mom should be proud of you.

394
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,710
Am I really amazing?

395
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:14,180
If you aren't, then who else can be called amazing?

396
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,040
Then tell me, what's so amazing about me?

397
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,150
You're pretty.

398
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,820
And beautiful.

399
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,060
Aren't those the same thing?

400
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,660
What else?

401
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,990
And...

402
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,190
- And... 
 - Shiyun!

403
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,620
Why are you here?

404
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,230
Your mom's looking everywhere for you.

405
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,780
Aren't you Xuejiao's brother?

406
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,850
What are you doing here?

407
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:42,280
Why do you care? It's not like you own the place.

408
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,260
Shiyun, is he your friend?

409
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,840
Not really.

410
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,530
Big dreams need a bold spirit.

411
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,990
You need to aim high to reach high.

412
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,730
- That's great. 
 - This is amazing.

413
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,830
This is awesome, really.

414
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:03,420
Xuejiao! You're back so early?

415
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,820
Yes. School let out early today.

416
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,000
I also want to go to the bookstore to get some reference books.

417
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,310
Why did you suddenly buy a new computer?

418
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,830
This is the cash cow for our family.

419
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,272
- Exactly. 
 - Are you guys...

420
00:22:17,272 --> 00:22:20,630
A while ago, Uncle Zhou recommended a promising stock.

421
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,760
We gave it a try.

422
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,830
We didn't expect it to keep climbing.

423
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,680
We withdrew all our money

424
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,240
and also borrowed 30,000 yuan from your Grandma. We put it all in.

425
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,080
   

426
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,260
What did you feed her? You gave her a stomachache.

427
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,550
Is this a happy face?

428
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:46,500
Yeah, what's with that face?

429
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,330
I mean...

430
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,690
 So, the stock expert is actually Zhou Shiyun's dad. 

431
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,240
 I dodged the parent meeting, 

432
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,140
 but didn't see this coming. 

433
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:06,575
 So, this is what "life never stops throwing curve balls at you" means? 

434
00:23:06,575 --> 00:23:07,720
 No. 

435
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,660
 There must be a way to fix this. 

436
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,440
   

437
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,040
Even a dictation took that long?

438
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,920
   

439
00:23:28,315 --> 00:23:30,640
6003135.

440
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,760
There were plenty of good stocks. Why did they pick this one?

441
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:38,120
 It's been crashing the whole time. 

442
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,080
 We're so unlucky. 

443
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,390
 There's just one digit difference, just one. 

444
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,500
 6003135. 

445
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,680
 If I had known, I would've bought the neighboring stock, 

446
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,500
 and I would've made a fortune. 

447
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,310
 The crashing stock ends with 135. 

448
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:57,770
 Then does the neighboring stock end with 134 

449
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,400
 or 136? 

450
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,900
 It's all fate. 

451
00:24:07,499 --> 00:24:11,159
Is it 4 or 6?

452
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,550
It's 6.

453
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,910
With the fall of the six kings, the empire unified.

454
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,250
The mountains in Shu were denuded, and the grand Epang Palace was built.

455
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,260
Over three hundred li it spreads, severing the sun from the heavens.

456
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,480
You can't even recite the first line.

457
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,337
Take the ginseng back, use it on yourself.

458
00:24:25,337 --> 00:24:27,630
I... I wasn't thinking about that.

459
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:30,960
You really underestimate your own teaching skills.

460
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,430
What were you thinking about?

461
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,670
You couldn't even tell 4 from 6.

462
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,130
I...

463
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,520
I'm looking at this for my parents.

464
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,300
First, rule out the one in the middle.

465
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,030
Why?

466
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,940
This candlestick pattern clearly signals a drop.

467
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,520
You know stocks?

468
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,000
A little bit.

469
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,711
Then can you tell me which of these two

470
00:25:06,711 --> 00:25:09,701
shows signs of a big surge?

471
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,640
I can give you some info.

472
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,530
But don't chase the hype.

473
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,160
Especially you. 
    

474
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,440
This one.

475
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,090
Just like that?

476
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,860
Take it or leave it.

477
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,640
The Epang Palace Rhapsody.

478
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,290
Like I'd believe you.

479
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,160
Xiao Gu.

480
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,420
Uncle, what are you doing here?

481
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,390
- What a coincidence. 
 - It sure is.

482
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:37,860
I was just feeling lost, and then I saw you.

483
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,900
Quick, help find some books for my son.

484
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,940
I have no idea.

485
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,520
Your son?

486
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,740
Uncle, I'll be leaving first.

487
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,290
Sorry about that. I just randomly recommended a few books.

488
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,380
I didn't expect he'd buy them all.

489
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,640
You know, even if you told him to buy all the books here,

490
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,430
he would've done it.

491
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,350
What about you? Can you read all these books?

492
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,380
Read?

493
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,420
Why would I?

494
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,500
They'll all be my table props.

495
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,380
Xiao Gu, pick two more for him.

496
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,820
Money's not a problem.

497
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,830
I just hope he can really learn a thing or two.

498
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,570
That's all I ask.

499
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,040
I want to check out, please.

500
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,510
Hello.

501
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,820
Isn't this your uncle?

502
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,800
You work here?

503
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,900
He works part-time here.

504
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,890
He studies at Jinghai University, majoring in autonomous driving.

505
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,820
So? What's the big deal?

506
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,050
That's very impressive. Very.

507
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,840
- Brother Fa. 
 - Hurry and take a look.

508
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,410
Are we missing anything? Pick something out for us.

509
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,670
You must know the best.

510
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,470
You flatter me. Can he even finish all these?

511
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,140
He'll have to.

512
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,390
Give him an inch, and he takes a mile.

513
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,230
- Here. 
 - Okay.

514
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,080
Uncle and Xiao Gu.

515
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,800
Thanks to both of you.

516
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,880
You helped me big time.

517
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,470
- Bye, Uncle. 
 - Okay.

518
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,400
- Take care. 
 - Bye.

519
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:16,920
They're also calling me your uncle.

520
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,810
When can we stop being relatives?

521
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,710
Soon.

522
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,050
They're just being friendly.

523
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,470
What's the deal with you and Yi Tianyu?

524
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,610
What else could it be?

525
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,470
We're just classmates.

526
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,560
The college entrance exam is just around the corner.

527
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,180
Don't get distracted.

528
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,840
You have nothing to worry about.

529
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,160
Senior Brother Lin, I will never get distracted.

530
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,230
You better.

531
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,750
Go and do your dictation.

532
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,030
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

533
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,390
Can I order?

534
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,190
- What would you like? 
 - A latte.

535
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,750
25 yuan.

536
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,800
If I had a daughter like that, that'd be great.

537
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,670
Dad, you've got quite an eye.

538
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,840
Your dad has the sharpest eye in the world.

539
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,270
Just look at your mom.

540
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,840
I'm ranked last in the whole school.

541
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,960
She is a bit better. She's second to last.

542
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,720
Why didn't you say so earlier?

543
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,640
Is she like a promoter for the bookstore?

544
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,980
No, no, no. That's...

545
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,160
That's fine.

546
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,470
She's business-minded.

547
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,360
She's got a bit of my style.

548
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,670
Nice.

549
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,020
Knowing how to do business is also good.

550
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,240
- Okay. 
 - As long as she can make money.

551
00:28:38,957 --> 00:28:40,560
6003136.

552
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,760
6003134.

553
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,780
Pick whichever comes up.

554
00:28:52,534 --> 00:28:54,520
No.

555
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,910
I've never guessed a multiple-choice question right in my life.

556
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:00,539
I need backup.

557
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,890
Where are you sneaking off to?

558
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,290
Keep it down.

559
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,600
I'll leave the door open for you.

560
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,830
Can you do me a favor?

561
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,394
Brother, you're unlucky.

562
00:29:19,394 --> 00:29:22,684
Pick one for Mom and Dad.

563
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:26,220
How do I have bad luck?

564
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,800
You always miss the college entrance exam score by one point.

565
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,160
You're like a walking bad luck charm.

566
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,800
You were born for this.

567
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,315
Nope.

568
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:35,855
Dad!

569
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,210
All right, fine. I'll do it.

570
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,160
This one.

571
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,200
Bye.

572
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,510
6003136?

573
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:56,710
- Which of these two shows signs of a big surge? 
 - This one.

574
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:59,000
   

575
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,190
Two negatives make a positive.

576
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,400
6003134.

577
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,130
I'll pick you.

578
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,500
Now that I've got a direction,

579
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,760
where do I get the money?

580
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,930
Who touched my code?

581
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,160
It's so expensive.

582
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:54,210
Turns out the thief was closer to home.

583
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:59,230
Brother, we’re family. What’s yours is mine.

584
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:02,800
 Besides, Roller Blast is shutting down in a few years anyway. 

585
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,520
 Those items of yours will just be digital junk by then. 

586
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:12,000
What's mine is yours, and what's yours is for everyone.

587
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,880
What are you really up to?

588
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,400
I'm trying to make you rich.

589
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,710
All your gear sold for 8,000 yuan.

590
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:29,230
Plus my New Year's money, 3,000 yuan. We've got 11,000 yuan total.

591
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,300
Only 8,000 yuan?

592
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,890
An anonymous account posted this video on the school forum.

593
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,570
What anonymous account?

594
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:43,400
This video basically screams Chen Xiao.

595
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,810
That's true.

596
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,440
You ruined her plans twice.

597
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,530
Of course, she wants to come for you.

598
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:50,160
That's not the right mindset.

599
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,370
It sounds like victim-blaming to me.

600
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:54,080
It was self-defense.

601
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,120
They were at fault.

602
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,210
I don't know what victim-blaming is.

603
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,000
Why don't we just apologize?

604
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,800
It might not be too late.

605
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,440
You know why people keep getting bullied?

606
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,330
Because the bullies think they can get away with it.

607
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:09,250
If you keep swallowing your pride, all you'll get is more humiliation.

608
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,480
I've already been down that road before.

609
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,770
But the school is strictly enforcing discipline now.

610
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:16,120
If this blows up, we're screwed.

611
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,920
Things have a way of working themselves out.

612
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,480
We'll be fine.

613
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,690
Also, I've got real stuff to deal with.

614
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,080
I don't have time for their petty drama.

615
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,890
What real stuff?

616
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,400
 Senior Brother Lin. 

617
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,620
 Where should we meet tonight? 

618
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,400
Mr. "Life Is Precious"?

619
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,972
- Let me see! 
 - Wait, no...

620
00:32:34,972 --> 00:32:37,120
- What's going on? 
 - This is serious.

621
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,170
- Yi Tianyu 
 - What are you doing?

622
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,200
- That's Xuejiao's phone! 
 - Are phones allowed during the morning study period?

623
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,170
Give me that phone!

624
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,330
- Give it back. 
 - No.

625
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,860
- What are you doing? 
 - The teacher's here, sit down.

626
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,120
Gu Xuejiao.

627
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,120
Come with me.

628
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,680
He's not extremely mad at me, right?

629
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,660
No way.

630
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,850
He's been drinking ginseng tea every day.

631
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:11,450
You're fine.

632
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,620
But just tell the truth.

633
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:18,540
Well, just state the facts. Okay?

634
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,570
Teacher Yin, you can leave.

635
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,980
Okay.

636
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,760
Be good.

637
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:30,250
- Principal Fu. 
 - Here. Take a look at this video.

638
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,490
Principal Fu, I've already seen this.

639
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,880
You've seen it, and you still think you did nothing wrong?

640
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,250
She...

641
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:43,090
Auntie, this way.

642
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,400
Come in.

643
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,500
Hello, Mrs. Chen.

644
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,600
Principal Fu.

645
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,620
My child has been bullied at school.

646
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,710
I want answers.

647
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:00,390
Mom.

648
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,990
Mom.

649
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,600
Crying doesn't mean she's innocent.

650
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,120
This kid is way out of line!

651
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,770
You show no signs of regret at all.

652
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:17,430
Why should I regret? I did nothing wrong.

653
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,790
Look at the bruises you've given me.

654
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,160
And you still say you're innocent?

655
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,790
 Contour powder? 

656
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:24,370
 It's even the same shade as mine. 

657
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,640
Your arm's dirty. Let me wipe it for you.

658
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,850
What are you doing? That hurts!

659
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:30,940
Why does it hurt?

660
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,060
See? It's not dirty anymore.

661
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,520
My arm's dirty now.

662
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,290
Anyway, the evidence is here.

663
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,100
You can't deny it.

664
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,460
The school must take this matter seriously.

665
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,730
Otherwise, I'll take this to the education bureau!

666
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,330
The bureau's not just somebody's backyard.

667
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,890
But don't worry, Mrs. Chen.

668
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:58,770
We'll look into this and get to the bottom of it.

669
00:34:58,770 --> 00:34:59,940
Chen Xiao.

670
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,470
Don't exaggerate.

671
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,020
Tell me what really happened.

672
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,631
Gu Xuejiao, what's wrong with you?

673
00:35:31,631 --> 00:35:33,137
Are you okay, Shiyun?

674
00:35:33,137 --> 00:35:34,390
What's this got to do with Xuejiao?

675
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,600
- What's going on here? 
 - Don't fall for their tricks.

676
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,250
Does it hurt?

677
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:40,320
Class 8, how could you bully your schoolmates?

678
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,370
What do you mean? Who's bullying whom? Watch your mouth!

679
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,720
Go play somewhere else, losers.

680
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,120
- Yi Tianyu! 
 - Guys!

681
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,860
- Yi Tianyu! 
 - Don't mess with me!

682
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,370
Can you stop?

683
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,500
What are you doing?

684
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,380
Guys, seriously, can you please stop?

685
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,750
- Guys. 
 - Wait, guys, can you stop?

686
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:11,360
Don't go too far. Don't go too far.

687
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,840
Don't go too far.

688
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,285
- Wait... 
 - Stop.

689
00:36:16,285 --> 00:36:17,805
No...

690
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,730
How did you... Come on, get up.

691
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:40,560
Who did this?

692
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,680
Principal.

693
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,790
Xuejiao didn't mean it.

694
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,620
Don't blame her.

695
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,120
Stop!

696
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,660
- Stop. 
 - Stop fighting.

697
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,430
Guys, guys.

698
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,040
Gu Xuejiao!

699
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,840
What?

700
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,910
Why...

701
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,910
Why is it you again?

702
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,350
I-I didn't hit her.

703
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:10,850
Principal Fu, I can explain.

704
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,950
Principal Fu, I can vouch for her.

705
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:24,000
What are you looking at? It's none of your business!

706
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,980
   

707
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,130
- It's okay. 
 - Attention!

708
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,755
When are your parents getting here?

709
00:37:32,755 --> 00:37:37,250
Principal Fu, my dad comes here more often than he goes to work.

710
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,330
He's numb to it all.

711
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:41,060
Just wait a bit longer.

712
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,770
Principal Fu, my parents are really busy.

713
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:46,410
I can handle this small matter on my own.

714
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:48,040
What kind of attitude is that?

715
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,250
Starting fights is a small matter?

716
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,760
Only murder counts as a big deal, right?

717
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,210
Principal Fu, I came here twice today.

718
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,910
And it's always her!

719
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,680
The school has to take action.

720
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,430
- Yes, yes. 
 - Auntie, don't blame Xuejiao.

721
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,870
She's my best friend.

722
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,210
How could she hit me on purpose?

723
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,020
This must be a misunderstanding.

724
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,060
You have a good heart.

725
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,560
You're still defending her after what she did.

726
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,120
Sorry, sorry.

727
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,240
I went to the bank and it was so crowded.

728
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,720
Thank you for waiting.

729
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,850
Principal Fu.

730
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:18,980
It looks like you're personally handling this matter.

731
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:23,340
Dafa, you come to the school more than our physical education teachers.

732
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:26,290
I've also been meaning to visit you. I'll buy you dinner sometime.

733
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,360
Xiao Gu, you're here, too?

734
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,350
You rascal.

735
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:34,690
Are you saving damsels here?

736
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,080
Dad.

737
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,120
What are you talking about?

738
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,390
 She saved me. 

739
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:44,760
 So she does treat me differently. 

740
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:49,720
- Sir. 
 - Do you see your son's attitude?

741
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,120
Calm down. Here, let's smoke a cigarette.

742
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,690
No.

743
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,010
I've quit.

744
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:00,600
It's all fate that we parents get to know each other through our kids.

745
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,760
Here.

746
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,900
Take this.

747
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,690
My contact information is on it.

748
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:09,430
Okay? I think there's nothing money can't fix.

749
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,350
You can't do this at our school.

750
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,950
Then what can we do?

751
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,850
We'll go with your way.

752
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:19,060
Also, whatever Xiao Gu owes, I'll cover it as well.

753
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,720
Dad.

754
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,350
Uncle, you don't need to defend me.

755
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:30,180
Principal Fu, I really didn't hit her.

756
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,120
Students from the troublemaker class

757
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,660
just can't say a single honest word.

758
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,460
Sir, mind your words, please.

759
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,980
Kids at this age are fragile.

760
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,290
Do you have to say that?

761
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:42,290
- Do you feel hurt? 
 - Yes.

762
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:43,850
See?

763
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,250
Principal Fu, I can prove that I'm telling the truth.

764
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,160
Go ahead.

765
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,980
Just now, we all saw that Zhou Shiyun fell in Principal Fu's direction.

766
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,770
If I had thrown the ball from where I stood,

767
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,600
and it hit Zhou Shiyun along a parabolic path,

768
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,120
we all know that force pushes opposite the impact.

769
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,492
If I really threw it,

770
00:40:06,492 --> 00:40:09,690
how could she fall toward Principal Fu?

771
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:19,100
Shiyun, you always say we're best friends.

772
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,570
Then can we go back to the scene and reenact it for everyone to see?

773
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:46,150
