00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,680
 ♫ Don't be afraid of the so-called top scorer ♫ 

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,420
 ♫ You're a legend in someone else's story too ♫ 

5
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,220
 ♫ Don't hold back, grow with all your might ♫ 

6
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,160
 ♫ Flowers bloom at the height of summer ♫ 

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,600
 ♫ Now let's reformat this life anew ♫ 

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,520
 ♫ Physics and math aren't that hard ♫ 

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,000
 ♫ In the flaming youth,
we grow stronger together ♫ 

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,360
 ♫ My heart still burns with fiery heat ♫ 

11
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,080
 ♫ Follow the rhythm, let your spirit relieve ♫ 

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,800
 ♫ The night sky lights up, guiding my flight ♫ 

13
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,560
 ♫ I'll be brave with you, chasing the height ♫ 

14
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,360
 ♫ My love still burns, glowing so bright ♫ 

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,080
 ♫ Shining in eyes that smile with grace ♫ 

16
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,040
 ♫ Let us break through time and space ♫ 

17
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,960
 

18
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,820
Si Qi.

19
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,900
Let's sit down and talk.

20
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,070
Why didn't you

21
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,700
tell Xue Jiao about your mom?

22
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,710
We would have helped you.

23
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,670
There's no end to my mom's medical expenses.

24
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,610
You could help me once or twice,

25
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,920
but not for a lifetime.

26
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,640
Besides,

27
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,480
I've been a burden to my mom for years.

28
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,520
I don't want to be a burden to you, too.

29
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,060
Lin.

30
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,940
My mom is waiting for me.

31
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,060
I have to go.

32
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,520
Wait.

33
00:02:56,328 --> 00:02:57,959
Data on the company's server

34
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,591
and the surveillance footage
are manually overwritten.

35
00:03:01,591 --> 00:03:03,329
You run the data department.

36
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:06,004
If it's about my dereliction of duty,

37
00:03:06,004 --> 00:03:07,716
let the legal department contact me.

38
00:03:07,716 --> 00:03:10,156
What if the police come?

39
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,940
The police will find out
how you paid the medical expenses.

40
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,710
You're a technician. You know numbers don't lie.

41
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,470
No matter how well you remove the data,

42
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,360
it leaves traces.

43
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,910
Getting caught is just a matter of time.

44
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,815
Si Qi.

45
00:03:45,815 --> 00:03:49,560
You're Xue Jiao's old friend. I want to give you a chance.

46
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,270
But you have to tell me
the truth about the car accident.

47
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,570
The truth?

48
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,100
Wait for the upcoming accident briefing.

49
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,910
They will give an official statement.

50
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,037
Lin.

51
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:15,998
If I remember correctly,

52
00:04:15,998 --> 00:04:19,602
the accident briefing
is scheduled for 10:00 sharp.

53
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:23,758
It's too late now.

54
00:04:23,758 --> 00:04:26,325
Everything has been settled.

55
00:04:31,907 --> 00:04:33,258
Mom.

56
00:04:33,258 --> 00:04:35,000
Mom, what's wrong?

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,750
What's wrong, Mom?

58
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,680
What happened?

59
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,280
I got out of bed to get some water,

60
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,487
and my sight blurred.

61
00:04:45,487 --> 00:04:48,080
I have a terrible headache.

62
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,920
It's okay. Let me rub your temple.

63
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,990
Don't.

64
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,880
Why did you come in?

65
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,920
Auntie.

66
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,700
Have you hit your head lately?

67
00:04:58,046 --> 00:04:59,676
Let me see.

68
00:05:00,746 --> 00:05:02,223
I'm calling the security.

69
00:05:02,223 --> 00:05:03,784
You should call a doctor.

70
00:05:03,784 --> 00:05:05,370
Something is wrong with her.

71
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,880
 

72
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,370
Come in.

73
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,960
Mr. Yi, the briefing will start in ten minutes.

74
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,730
We can set off.

75
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,190
Has Lin Zhi Hua shown up?

76
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,550
Not yet.

77
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,950
He might be too embarrassed to see you.

78
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,439
I've overestimated him.

79
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,900
Students from Capital University are overpraised.

80
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,550
One gets cold feet.

81
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,830
One is ungrateful.

82
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,221
Right, Mr. Yi, you've become so popular

83
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:47,967
that the media wants to interview you
about your entrepreneurship.

84
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:50,512
They want an extra Q&amp;A session.

85
00:05:50,512 --> 00:05:55,033
No problem. I'll give them 15 minutes.

86
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:56,809
They may have a lot of questions.

87
00:05:56,809 --> 00:05:58,490
What about 20 minutes?

88
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,330
Ten minutes.

89
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,850
Your mom is in the operating room.

90
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:32,693
Subarachnoid hemorrhage.

91
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:35,460
It must be from that fall last time.

92
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,360
The doctor said
if we hadn't discovered it in time,

93
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,150
she may not have made it to the operation...

94
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,990
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

95
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,240
Thank you.

96
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,260
 Blue Mountain Capital's
core business philosophy is integrity. 

97
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,750
 Huachuang Motors won't let you down again. 

98
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,310
We were classmates ten years ago,

99
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,260
studying in the same classroom,

100
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,040
dining at the same canteen.

101
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,561
What about now?

102
00:07:13,561 --> 00:07:15,562
Tian Yu became an entrepreneur.

103
00:07:15,562 --> 00:07:18,670
But he's always treated us just like before.

104
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,200
Best buddies forever.

105
00:07:23,405 --> 00:07:25,775
You are his best friend.

106
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:29,527
Are you really happy

107
00:07:29,527 --> 00:07:31,381
to see him like this?

108
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,995
I'm not sure how much you know
about what he's done.

109
00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:44,506
But I know that if you let him go on like this,

110
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:47,826
he will end up on the path to self-destruction.

111
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,015
The three of us have been alumni.

112
00:07:56,015 --> 00:07:58,655
I've always seen you guys as my friends.

113
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,230
I don't think I've ever treated you unfairly.

114
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,360
Lei.

115
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,270
I know you value friendship the most.

116
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,257
Do you think what he is doing now

117
00:08:15,257 --> 00:08:18,247
is treating me like a real friend?

118
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,570
- Are you happy?
- Yeah.

119
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,100
Lin.

120
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,534
I know it might be too late to say this.

121
00:09:05,534 --> 00:09:07,560
But when I did those things for Mr. Yi,

122
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,587
I had no idea you'd be implicated.

123
00:09:10,587 --> 00:09:13,017
When I found out...

124
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:17,355
- It was already too late.
- No, it's not.

125
00:09:18,362 --> 00:09:20,932
Did you keep any evidence

126
00:09:20,932 --> 00:09:23,910
when you modified the C2 car system

127
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,650
and deleted program logs?

128
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,120
But the accident briefing has already begun.

129
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,540
It's too late even if you go there now.

130
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,980
It's not too late as long as there is a chance.

131
00:09:34,076 --> 00:09:37,106
But if we miss the chance,

132
00:09:37,106 --> 00:09:39,859
it may never come back again.

133
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:45,626
I have evidence.

134
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:56,970
 

135
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:04,092
 I'm the victim who was caught
in the Huachuang C2 accident 

136
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:05,130
 and the owner of... 

137
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,840
 Mr. Lin, the briefing has started.
Will you make it? 

138
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,740
 I apologize to the public
on behalf of Blue Mountain Capital and Huachuang. 

139
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,270
Former CEO of Huachuang, Mr. Lin Zhi Hua,

140
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,190
ignored the company's regulations

141
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,440
and disregarded morals during the suspension,

142
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,980
which led to a negative incident
with severe consequences.

143
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,580
The Board of Directors decided to expel him

144
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,970
and never work with him again.

145
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,580
 

146
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,670
Sorry, everyone.

147
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,820
I have other plans in a while.

148
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,910
I can only answer two more questions.

149
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,580
Please cherish this opportunity.

150
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,552
- Mr. Yi...
- Mr. Yi...

151
00:10:40,552 --> 00:10:43,120
Do you believe you've upheld integrity,

152
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,060
which you claimed to be your ideology?

153
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,820
This is an interesting question.

154
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,390
Since you're here, sit with us.

155
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,200
Isn't that Gu Xue Jiao?

156
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,411
One last question.

157
00:11:09,411 --> 00:11:12,712
- Mr. Yi...
- Mr. Yi...

158
00:11:12,712 --> 00:11:17,320
Do you think the former CEO Lin Zhi Hua
will be subject to legal sanctions?

159
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:20,439
That is possible.

160
00:12:00,378 --> 00:12:02,071
Call the security.

161
00:12:04,638 --> 00:12:06,448
As fast as possible.

162
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,386
Don't forget that I have the flash drive.

163
00:12:22,386 --> 00:12:23,866
What a coincidence.

164
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:26,809
I have one, too.

165
00:12:40,971 --> 00:12:43,453
It's not the information on the problem vehicle,

166
00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:45,943
but the cloud controller.

167
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,940
I need to connect it
to the company server to unlock it.

168
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,010
Check on Lin Zhi Hua.

169
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,440
I've disabled your control over the vehicles.

170
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,330
You have no cards left.

171
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,200
You have no access to it.

172
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,750
She doesn't.

173
00:13:22,796 --> 00:13:24,726
But I do.

174
00:13:24,726 --> 00:13:26,990
Hurry! To the server room.

175
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,890
I'm done with you.

176
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,360
Why is Lin Jia Dong so angry?

177
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,010
No idea.

178
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,920
You think you're the boss now?

179
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,526
Who supported you despite all the difficulties
to this very day?

180
00:13:54,526 --> 00:13:56,337
Everyone has left, except for me.

181
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:58,950
Now that I've done my part, you're trying to get rid of me?

182
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,580
You filthy capitalist!

183
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,170
Who are you?

184
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,740
 Get me the footage outside the server room. 

185
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,940
 Got it, Zhi Hua. 

186
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,170
Isn't she...

187
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,292
Yi Tian Yu, you are suspected
of faking a traffic accident,

188
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:38,290
destruction of property,
endangering public safety, forging evidence,

189
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,240
fabricating facts, false reporting, and so on.

190
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,120
Please come with us for the investigation.

191
00:15:01,135 --> 00:15:03,010
What's up? Xue Jiao.

192
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:07,010
Why are you so sure that I won't become better

193
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:10,440
and learn to cherish you?

194
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,690
 

195
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,370
 

196
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,141
I'll take over from here

197
00:15:35,141 --> 00:15:37,651
and host the accident briefing.

198
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:51,690
 

199
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,060
 ♫ In a dark room ♫ 

200
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,142
 ♫ How carefully we light a single lamp ♫ 

201
00:16:13,142 --> 00:16:17,983
 ♫ So there won't be an echoing sound ♫ 

202
00:16:17,983 --> 00:16:20,440
Do you trust me?

203
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,321
Do you believe that
we can get through this together?

204
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:26,221
Of course.

205
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,490
Just like every time before.

206
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,840
 The more we play along, 

207
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,884
 the more likely it is
for Xue Jiao to find a chance. 

208
00:16:40,884 --> 00:16:46,740
 ♫ To journey through time with you ♫ 

209
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,220
 ♫ If you can ♫ 

210
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:54,359
 ♫ Read the secret in my gaze ♫ 

211
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:59,799
 ♫ You'll see you've always been in my heart ♫ 

212
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,760
Hello.

213
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,520
Yeah.

214
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,740
What file? Is it so urgent?

215
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,360
Good boy, wait.

216
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,211
I mean, my goodness.

217
00:17:21,211 --> 00:17:23,061
Give me a second.

218
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,040
I know.

219
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,190
 Which means the brakes failed. 

220
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,920
 After repeated checking, we hereby announce 

221
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,010
 that the C2 car accident
is not due to technical reasons. 

222
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,990
 Instead, it's a setup. 

223
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,840
It's still playing.

224
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,190
You promised to spend time with me after work.

225
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,502
I'm not working.

226
00:17:55,502 --> 00:17:58,220
I'm checking out a cool guy.

227
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,730
Why don't you look at me since I'm right here?

228
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:04,810
How can your casual outfit compare to that suit?

229
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,460
Alright.

230
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,050
You're already tired of me, huh?

231
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,780
Hello, Shi Yun.

232
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,870
You must adopt the encryption method

233
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:20,400
I proposed for the C2 cars.

234
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,681
Your encryption is too easy to crack.

235
00:18:22,681 --> 00:18:23,962
I'm on vacation.

236
00:18:23,962 --> 00:18:26,120
That's it for now. Adopt my method.

237
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,651
That's it. Love you, bye.

238
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:30,571
I'm upset.

239
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,390
- How about we set up a rule?
- Okay?

240
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,040
Whoever checks work messages first

241
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,810
shall be punished by the other person.

242
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,980
Think about it.

243
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,640
I do sense some sincerity.

244
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,250
Then I'll think about it.

245
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,140
- Fine.
- Done. We have a deal.

246
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,340
It took you only three seconds to think about it?

247
00:19:02,245 --> 00:19:06,625
How can I hesitate over my girlfriend's edict?

248
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,450
Stop staring. I know I'm pretty.

249
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:27,390
I was worried sick when you were away.

250
00:19:28,862 --> 00:19:31,096
So I'm making up for it now.

251
00:19:31,096 --> 00:19:32,976
I want to stare at you.

252
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,630
I wasn't worried at all.

253
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:41,960
Because I knew you would
get the message I left you.

254
00:19:42,777 --> 00:19:44,300
I was only a little worried

255
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,565
that you'd be too love-struck

256
00:19:46,565 --> 00:19:50,343
and fail to settle the issues at Huachuang.

257
00:19:50,343 --> 00:19:53,623
I know you hate love-struck guys.

258
00:19:55,005 --> 00:19:58,825
I can start something like Huachuang
10,000 times.

259
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,700
But you're one of a kind.

260
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,899
I know.

261
00:20:27,899 --> 00:20:30,050
I would have

262
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,140
done everything for you, too.

263
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,260
Don't ever put yourself at risk again.

264
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,700
I won't lose you again.

265
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,750
Keep a close eye on me, then.

266
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,140
Like this?

267
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,790
Lin.

268
00:21:10,528 --> 00:21:14,017
The workaholic is suddenly taking a break.

269
00:21:14,017 --> 00:21:15,687
I'm so not used to it.

270
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,340
Hello.

271
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,690
Hello.

272
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,840
I may have to work overtime today.

273
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,210
What's going on?

274
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:34,030
Lin Zhi Hua has learned to exploit his employees?

275
00:21:34,738 --> 00:21:36,939
Your lovely cousin and his future wife

276
00:21:36,939 --> 00:21:39,810
asked for annual leave at the same time.

277
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:42,760
This is a non-combat attrition.

278
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,230
Xue...

279
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,950
I forgot she's on vacation again.

280
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:06,530
- Hello.
- Hello, baby.

281
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,530
I led the team back to Jinghai.

282
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,301
What time do you get off work?
Let me pick you up.

283
00:22:10,301 --> 00:22:11,435
 

284
00:22:11,435 --> 00:22:13,290
I'll work overtime.

285
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,050
Who dares you hold you there?

286
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,450
I'll teach them a lesson.

287
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,640
Who else could it be?

288
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,270
Your sister and your future brother-in-law.

289
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,660
Fine.

290
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:28,050
Alright. I'll see you after work.

291
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,550
Bye.

292
00:22:46,361 --> 00:22:49,431
Someone is going to pop up behind him.

293
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,600
Have you watched this?

294
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,690
No.

295
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,070
Why?

296
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,830
Aren't you scared?

297
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,860
I... I should be scared, right?

298
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,530
I'm scared.

299
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,470
This is so scary.

300
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,120
Forget it.

301
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,140
Let's watch romance.

302
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:26,640
Xue Jiao, here's Huachuang's next-gen
V2X connectivity protocol. Check it out.

303
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,230
Caught you.

304
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,160
What were the rules again?

305
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,049
The loser...

306
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:34,700
Thank you for your reminder.

307
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,720
Otherwise, I would have lost.

308
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,050
Your hands are under my custody.

309
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:13,268
No way.

310
00:24:13,268 --> 00:24:16,583
I'm having withdrawal symptoms as a workaholic.

311
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,293
Just let me see it.

312
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,210
The best way to beat one addiction
is to replace it with another.

313
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,530
But I'm not addicted to anything else.

314
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,510
Let me have a look.

315
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,080
What about this?

316
00:24:34,242 --> 00:24:37,062
I think it's working.

317
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:01,211
We're not in sync at all.

318
00:25:01,211 --> 00:25:04,880
It looks like I'm an older woman
dating a college student.

319
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,577
Didn't you say we'd come back to recall youth?

320
00:25:07,577 --> 00:25:09,360
I'm sticking to the theme.

321
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,050
You're right.

322
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,880
As long as I take care of myself,

323
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,930
I can get younger guys.

324
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,210
Right?

325
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,730
There you go.

326
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,070
I...

327
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Sorry. We didn't mean it.

328
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,356
- Sir... Sir.
- Junior.

329
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,887
Sorry.

330
00:25:25,887 --> 00:25:27,747
I'm a senior.

331
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,270
Sorry, Senior.

332
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,860
Give it back.

333
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:48,990
Senior, may I add you on WeChat?

334
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,242
She hates guys who play basketball.

335
00:26:01,242 --> 00:26:02,912
What?

336
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,510
Yeah.

337
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,141
Let's go, Senior.

338
00:26:08,141 --> 00:26:09,791
Okay, sir.

339
00:26:10,434 --> 00:26:11,774
Wait.

340
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:15,933
Too many young guys here. So dangerous.

341
00:26:15,933 --> 00:26:17,303
Come on.

342
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,050
Let's go somewhere else.

343
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,270
Come on.

344
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,660
So many sports students.

345
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,830
 The system detected that your vehicle
hadn't moved for a long time. 

346
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,250
Will you be my girlfriend?

347
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,433
Now that I think about it,

348
00:27:10,433 --> 00:27:13,580
your little trick was quite lovely.

349
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,540
Don't you owe me one more secret?

350
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:22,919
What secret?

351
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:27,880
What did you say on the day I got drunk?

352
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,550
Lin Zhi Hua.

353
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,420
Lin Zhi Hua.

354
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,940
You're much cuter this time.

355
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,687
Did I say something?

356
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,070
Isn't it obvious that you're hiding something?

357
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,080
You didn't realize that I went back in time

358
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,830
the first time you met me ten years ago, did you?

359
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,438
Am I that smart?

360
00:28:05,438 --> 00:28:07,218
I guess not.

361
00:28:08,668 --> 00:28:10,930
If that's not it,

362
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,550
what is it then?

363
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:17,589
You don't remember?

364
00:28:22,614 --> 00:28:24,124
Remember it now?

365
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:28,019
No.

366
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:30,389
You just want another kiss.

367
00:28:36,451 --> 00:28:38,301
That night,

368
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:41,580
I said,

369
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,230
"Gu Xue Jiao."

370
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,310
"I've been into you for ten years."

371
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,540
I've been into you for ten years.

372
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,510
What... what?

373
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:06,970
Lin Zhi Hua has been into Gu Xue Jiao...

374
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:09,396
I've been into you for ten years.

375
00:29:09,396 --> 00:29:11,326
For ten years.

376
00:29:17,828 --> 00:29:21,560
How can you be so bad at math?

377
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,100
We hadn't known each other for ten years.

378
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,830
Let me walk you through it.

379
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,932
How dare you take ugly photos of me?

380
00:29:37,932 --> 00:29:40,050
You're not ugly. You're adorable.

381
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,270
Look.

382
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,120
Don't cover up your awful conduct
of taking ugly photos with sweet-talking.

383
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,790
I'll keep the photo.

384
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,730
 

385
00:30:07,565 --> 00:30:08,640
Okay.

386
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,290
Caught you.

387
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,790
You lost.

388
00:30:12,902 --> 00:30:14,922
What was the rule again?

389
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:18,932
What was the rule again?

390
00:30:18,932 --> 00:30:21,392
You're at my disposal now.

391
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,412
Are you waiting for me to lose?

392
00:30:25,412 --> 00:30:26,951
Isn't it obvious?

393
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,880
Okay then. Just say it.

394
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,990
What's the punishment?

395
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,310
Open it.

396
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,750
Marry me.

397
00:31:22,537 --> 00:31:24,080
I am at your disposal.

398
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,881
 ♫ Because I'm certain of this love ♫ 

399
00:31:27,881 --> 00:31:31,161
 ♫ Summit of our youth ♫ 

400
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,250
What if I didn't lose?

401
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,196
You wouldn't give it to me?

402
00:31:40,196 --> 00:31:42,376
Then when are you going to propose?

403
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,550
I'll just wait a little longer.

404
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:55,700
For how long?

405
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,350
Another ten years?

406
00:31:58,749 --> 00:32:00,819
For as long as it takes.

407
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,310
Will you marry me?

408
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:15,890
Then I'll just reluctantly say yes.

409
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:19,646
 ♫ Read the secret in my gaze ♫ 

410

 Gu Xue Jiao. 

419
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:10,120
 Marry me. 

420
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,250
 I've been into you for ten years. 

421
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,770
 I've been into you for ten years. 

422
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:15,530
 For as long as it takes. 

423
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:17,050
 Marry me. 

424
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:18,930
 Marry me. 

425
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,550
 Lin Zhi Hua. 

426
00:33:27,621 --> 00:33:29,071
 Lin Zhi Hua. 

427
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,310
 Lin Zhi Hua. 

428
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,270
 Lin... 

429
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,380
 Lin Zhi Hua. 

430
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,940
Doctor, she woke up.

431
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,840
Why am I here?

432
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,360
- Where is Lin Zhi Hua?
- Who?

433
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,410
Lin Zhi Hua, where is he?

434
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,206
Her vital signs remain stable.

435
00:33:55,206 --> 00:33:59,607
But she's been mentioning someone
I haven't heard of.

436
00:33:59,607 --> 00:34:01,798
She's talking gibberish.

437
00:34:01,798 --> 00:34:04,119
A minor concussion from the elevator fall

438
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:07,560
could indeed cause
temporary memory disorientation.

439
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,330
Of course. Don't worry.

440
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,204
She will slowly recover.

441
00:34:11,204 --> 00:34:13,115
I'll arrange for some examinations.

442
00:34:13,115 --> 00:34:14,516
Call me if you need anything.

443
00:34:14,516 --> 00:34:15,736
Okay.

444
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:19,450
The elevator fell?

445
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:21,240
Me?

446
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,940
You don't remember?

447
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,640
The elevator fell when you were in there
with another person.

448
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,820
You've been in a coma

449
00:34:34,174 --> 00:34:35,954
for ten days.

450
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,940
What's going on?

451
00:34:49,834 --> 00:34:51,450
 

452
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:54,190
Isn't it what happened last time?

453
00:34:55,569 --> 00:34:57,079
Xue Jiao.

454
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,000
Why are you sounding like

455
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,410
a different person after you woke up?

456
00:35:04,881 --> 00:35:06,331
Gu Ming Ze.

457
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:09,270
What kind of job are you doing now?

458
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,810
Where's your team?

459
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,300
My team?

460
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:16,460
I've been working in an Internet cafe.

461
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:20,450
Where's your phone?

462
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:21,900
Give me your phone.

463
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,710
Your phone.

464
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,520
 The number you dialed does not exist. 

465
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,330
 Please check the number and dial again. 

466
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:40,160
 Sorry. The number you dialed does not exist. 

467
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,110
- What's wrong?
 - Please check the number and dial again. 

468
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,150
I want to be discharged.

469
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,190
I want to be discharged.

470
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,710
What's going on?

471
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:39,290
 

472
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,050
 

473
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,601
 ♫ Lost here in the storm ♫ 

474
00:36:52,601 --> 00:36:58,961
 ♫ Scanning every face I see ♫ 

475
00:37:00,142 --> 00:37:06,850
 ♫ Leaving the sorrow behind ♫ 

476
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,720
 I believe in us. 

477
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,300
 Just like every time before. 

478
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,930
 Isn't the basketball field huge here? 

479
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,340
 Let's play. 

480
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:20,080
 Setting a major goal is equivalent
to completing half of this goal. 

481
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:25,640
It is easier for someone with a lofty goal
to achieve success.

482
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,270
Happy birthday!

483
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,340
No coffee when you have a cold.

484
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:35,290
Last time, I missed you.

485
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:37,550
I hope this time,

486
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,930
you could give me a chance.

487
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,590
I'm late.

488
00:37:44,788 --> 00:37:48,680
 ♫ Between you and me ♫ 

489
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,150
Let me help.

490
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:55,290
I can start something like Huachuang
10,000 times.

491
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:57,300
But you're one of a kind.

492
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,330
 Are you feeling insecure? 

493
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,770
 Gu Xue Jiao, will you be my girlfriend? 

494
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,600
 You already know the answer. 

495
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,890
 Why would you ask again? 

496
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,680
 Let's say I want to double-check it. 

497
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,770
 It's up to you when to make it public. 

498
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:20,490
 Marry me. 

499
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:24,890
 This is the moment when I went back ten years ago. 

500
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:27,290
 The memories of those ten years 

501
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:29,680
 stopped at this exact moment. 

502
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,230
 Time overlaps again. 

503
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:35,200
 I'm back in this world. 

504
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,930
 Ten years. 

505
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:38,230
 One dream. 

506
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,490
Have you collected Lin Zhi Hua's work report?

507
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:00,670
Here.

508
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,490
Not for this year. Since he started working.

509
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:06,850
Our boss wants to read it.

510
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:08,300
Okay, I'm on it.

511
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,490
How did you get in? Talk to HR.

512
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:12,850
Don't bother us.

513
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,160
Give me all of Mr. Lin's reimbursement forms.

514
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,330
Our bosses suspect that Mr. Lin quit the job

515
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:21,370
because we've been mistreating him.

516
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:22,520
Hurry up, guys.

517
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,550
The top management is waiting.

518
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,410
He's not here. It's going to be chaos.

519
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,290
The reason he quit sounds like a joke.

520
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:31,500
I don't know what to tell the higher-ups.

521
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,770
 
 Traumatized by the elevator incident. 

522
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:35,970
Where is Lin Zhi Hua?

523
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,300
He just left.

524
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,420
Lin...

525
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,200
 For how long? 

526
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,820
 Another ten years? 

527
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,860
 For as long as it takes. 

528
00:41:48,081 --> 00:41:50,970
I stayed up all night as the administrator,

529
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,270
but they don't even cover my meal.

530
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,010
You could have asked me to stand up.

531
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,720
You freaked me out.

532
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,980
Are you okay?

533
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,980
I'm fine.

534
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,180
Gu Ming Ze.

535
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:15,790
Is that you?

536
00:43:06,055 --> 00:43:07,728
 ♫ In a dark room ♫ 

537
00:43:07,728 --> 00:43:11,678
 ♫ How carefully we light a single lamp ♫ 

538
00:43:11,678 --> 00:43:17,193
 ♫ So there won't be an echoing sound ♫ 

539
00:43:17,996 --> 00:43:21,358
 ♫ Flipping through memories ♫ 

540
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:25,370
 ♫ Every line a trail where our steps entwine ♫ 

541
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:31,588
 ♫ That's us drawing closer to each other ♫ 

542
00:43:31,588 --> 00:43:35,101
 ♫ Let it be fate ♫ 

543
00:43:35,101 --> 00:43:39,193
 ♫ Let us give all our courage ♫ 

544
00:43:39,193 --> 00:43:45,352
 ♫ To journey through time with you ♫ 

545
00:43:45,352 --> 00:43:48,818
 ♫ If you can ♫ 

546
00:43:48,818 --> 00:43:52,941
 ♫ Read the secret in my gaze ♫ 

547
00:43:52,941 --> 00:43:59,501
 ♫ You'll see you've always been in my heart ♫ 

548
00:44:02,524 --> 00:44:09,410
 ♫ I try to open up my arms ♫ 

549
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:13,210
 ♫ Because I'm certain of this love ♫ 

550
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:16,170
 ♫ Summit of our youth ♫ 

551
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:23,010
 ♫ Even if the wind roars, it's okay ♫ 

552
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:26,770
 ♫ There's a figure approaching ♫ 

553
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:34,050
 ♫ I know it must be you ♫ 

554
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:47,132
 ♫ I try to open up my arms ♫ 

555
00:44:47,132 --> 00:44:51,090
 ♫ Because I'm certain of this love ♫ 

556
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:53,960
 ♫ Summit of our youth ♫ 

557
00:44:53,960 --> 00:45:00,746
 ♫ Even if the wind roars, it's okay ♫ 

558
00:45:00,746 --> 00:45:04,548
 ♫ There's a figure approaching ♫ 

559
00:45:04,548 --> 00:45:11,828
 ♫ I know it must be you ♫
