1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Try to grow the flowers in the summer

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now tell the truth about life

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's not complicated to count the flowers

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The youth is swaying

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We are getting stronger

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My heart is still hot and boiling

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Follow the rhythm and release it gently

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The night sky is brightening, only the fireflies are blocking

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'll fly with you bravely

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My love is still hot and boiling

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Shining in the smile

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let us cross the barrier of time

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Old man, I'll give you another toast.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Okay.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
My son is in the college entrance examination.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's thanks to Gu's guidance.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Your son is...

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Uncle, I have something to do in the company.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'll go first.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You're here.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Hello, uncle.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Qiao, nice to meet you again.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Isn't this Yi Tianyu?

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Tianyu?

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The classmate of the college has eaten on our rooftop.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I remember, we had dinner on the rooftop.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Not only did they eat, they were also taught by their parents.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
They were punished together.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
They are all people with difficulties.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Tianyu is so talented now.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's up to us.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This kid is amazing now.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He ordered the restaurant chain.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:37,160
Yunxing, are you

37
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,000
eating?

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's my son.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,360
Gu is going back to the company.

40
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,280
You can send him off.

41
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,040
No need.

42
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,920
It's not easy to get a taxi in the district.

43
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,000
We are all your colleagues.

44
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,960
Why are you so polite?

45
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,960
Go. Go.

46
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,000
I'll go first.

47
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,680
Go.

48
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,680
You two eat less.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,840
It's fate.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,720
Is it a promise?

51
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,360
What's the promise?

52
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,240
You two are so cute.

53
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,600
Let's get together more often.

54
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,080
Okay.

55
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Just treat it as our home.

56
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,600
I'm so polite.

57
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,280
It's okay.

58
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,040
If you have friends,

59
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,120
just make a call.

60
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,040
I'll arrange it.

61
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,760
It's okay.

62
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,960
Okay.

63
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,840
Is there no use to do it?

64
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,920
I was going to

65
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,240
attend plastic surgery dinner of Huasheng.

66
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,240
I'm just a little bit of a fight.

67
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,560
Did you two get into a fight?

68
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,120
Why are you so kind to our old classmate?

69
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,520
I don't dare to talk to him.

70
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,840
Qi Lei?

71
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,840
You're dressed like this, I can't recognize you.

72
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,840
You haven't changed.

73
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,840
You were so stubborn in high school.

74
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,840
You're so stubborn.

75
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,840
You're so stubborn that we're more aggressive before the college entrance exam.

76
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,840
You're not stubborn about your classmates,

77
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,840
but about your colleagues.

78
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,840
I heard from Yu Zi that

79
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,840
you're doing well in work.

80
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,840
Then you don't want to see his boss?

81
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,840
Isn't this my mom's WeChat?

82
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,840
My aunt is asking me

83
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,840
about the investment problem.

84
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,840
What's wrong?

85
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,840
Can't I answer?

86
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,840
Don't be ridiculous.

87
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,840
Okay.

88
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,840
Tian Yu, I'm talking to you.

89
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,840
What are you doing?

90
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,840
Go back to your room.

91
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,840
Go back to your room.

92
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,840
Go back to your room.

93
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,840
Are you confident?

94
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,840
Yes.

95
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,840
Three, two, one, fighting.

96
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,840
Let go of the memories.

97
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,840
Every line is a wrong footstep.

98
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,840
We're approaching each other.

99
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,840
Drink some water.

100
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,840
Thank you.

101
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,840
Let go of the fate.

102
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,840
Let us give up all courage.

103
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,840
Who's not looking at my car?

104
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,840
What's up?

105
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,840
This is my car. Please move it.

106
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,840
Your car

107
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,840
is registered as a fake?

108
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,840
Who are you?

109
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,840
Are you from our company?

110
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,840
Why haven't I seen you before?

111
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,840
I'm telling you, drive the car away.

112
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,840
Foreign officials are not allowed to park here.

113
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,840
Do you know who I am?

114
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,840
How dare you ask me to drink?

115
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,840
Who are you?

116
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
Who am I?

117
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,840
I'm the general manager of Hua Chen Group.

118
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,840
Assistant.

119
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,840
The company's office is all under my control.

120
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,840
I'm the card reader.

121
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,840
Why haven't I seen you before?

122
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,840
Which department are you in?

123
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,840
I'm the director of the investment company, Yi.

124
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,840
I'm the driver.

125
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,840
You're so shy to steal my car?

126
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,840
You're so shy to steal Yi's car?

127
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,840
Let's go.

128
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,840
You're a driver.

129
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,840
You're so arrogant.

130
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,840
You're so arrogant.

131
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,840
What are you talking about?

132
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,840
Come in.

133
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,840
Master, this is the meeting agenda.

134
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,840
Take a look.

135
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,840
It's him again.

136
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,840
You've seen him before?

137
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,840
I've seen him before.

138
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,840
He's a driver.

139
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,840
He's a man of his word.

140
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,840
There's this guy.

141
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,840
In 2017, he bought the digital currency for 730 dollars.

142
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,840
By the end of the year, he sold it for 20,000 dollars.

143
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,840
By 2018, before the stock fell,

144
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,840
he cleared all the stocks.

145
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,840
The house he owned was a generation older.

146
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,840
He sold it one after another.

147
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,840
In 2019, he had the technology version.

148
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,840
He was the biggest hitter.

149
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,840
In 2019, he sold the gold.

150
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,840
He was the biggest hitter.

151
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,840
It's a big hit.

152
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,840
He's a legend.

153
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,840
This is Mr. Yi.

154
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,840
Mr. Yi is at the finance department.

155
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,840
You'll be in charge of the reception.

156
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,840
I'm not serving you anymore.

157
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,840
Why is Chief Steward Lin so angry?

158
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,840
I don't know. I'm afraid he's lying.

159
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,840
He's the boss, but he's already forgotten about it.

160
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,840
Who's been with you when you were creating?

161
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Everyone else has gone through a few rounds.

162
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,840
I've arranged everything for you.

163
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,840
You're really a failure.

164
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,840
You're a fraud.

165
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,840
You're really a bad guy.

166
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,840
Hello.

167
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,840
Hello.

168
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,840
Who are you?

169
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,840
Help me clean up.

170
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,840
Thank you.

171
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,840
Not all capitalists are good at this.

172
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,840
Mr. Yi, this way, please.

173
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,840
Actually, I don't have a price to pay.

174
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,840
Because it's all market choices.

175
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,840
What's the problem?

176
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,840
The era of BNC is over.

177
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,840
A new brand will be released soon.

178
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,840
And it will bring a new windfall in our industry.

179
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,840
That's good.

180
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Now I'll report to the leaders.

181
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,840
Currently, the most critical VRX module of C3 is running stable.

182
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,840
But the difference between the test run and the actual scene is still very big.

183
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,840
Even if it can handle the complex situation in the simulation,

184
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,840
can it do a perfect job in the actual situation after it's on the road?

185
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,840
This is the first question your project team needs to answer.

186
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,840
Yes.

187
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,840
What does this mean, Mr. Gu?

188
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,840
What do you mean by seeing?

189
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,840
You really expressed your emotions well.

190
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,840
We're used to the first and second part of the technical battle.

191
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,840
Show him the meeting.

192
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,840
Really.

193
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,840
I'm not a good person.

194
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,840
I'm not a good person.

195
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,840
Show him the meeting.

196
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,840
Really.

197
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,840
It's like a primary school reunion.

198
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,840
Who are you talking about, Mr. Gu?

199
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,840
Did you record the meeting?

200
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,840
It's a work document.

201
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,840
It has nothing to do with work.

202
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,840
I dare not write it in the newspaper.

203
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,840
I'm sorry.

204
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,840
There are many things today.

205
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,840
How is Gao Rui taking you to the museum?

206
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,840
It's good.

207
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,840
Why is Mr. Ming alone?

208
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,840
Where is the assistant?

209
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,840
Just say it.

210
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,840
Come on.

211
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,840
You can continue to visit.

212
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,840
Mr. Li, this way, please.

213
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,840
Who didn't save the room?

214
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,840
Mr. Li, come here.

215
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,840
Come here.

216
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,840
From today on, the technical team and the technical team will cooperate.

217
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,840
What?

218
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,840
V2X's non-connection

219
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,840
conversion efficiency and connectivity

220
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,840
are so powerful.

221
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,840
The two teams should cooperate.

222
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,840
You two can cooperate.

223
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,840
I think you can cooperate.

224
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,840
And you have a good understanding.

225
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,840
Now it's a unified front line.

226
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,840
It's the board's decision

227
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,840
to unite against me.

228
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,840
Let me come back at once.

229
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,840
In the next room,

230
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,840
we will all talk at once.

231
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,840
We don't want to talk anymore.

232
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,840
Let's rest today.

233
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:36,200
Won't you treat us a long

234
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,240
time today?

235
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,080
I'm not a good person.

236
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,800
Can you do that?

237
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,880
As much as I can.

238
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,800
What do you mean?

239
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,680
I want to do my best.

240
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,560
Do your best.

241
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,040
I'm here.

242
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,560
Three cups for myself.

243
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,200
Are you thirsty?

244
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,400
You're still

245
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,600
the hope of Qizhong.

246
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,800
What are you drinking?

247
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,080
Jackie.

248
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,360
I've stored two bottles of good wine here.

249
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
Bring it to me.

250
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,080
Okay.

251
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,600
Next time,

252
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:32,180
sell it with the sales

253
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,060
Mr. Sun.

254
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,120
The water would gold.

255
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,400
Right.

256
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,760
Here.

257
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,920
Thank you, President Sun.

258
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,400
You went on a business trip again?

259
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,880
My life is different from those of someone else.

260
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,960
In my life,

261
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,520
there are not only work,

262
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,040
but also guys as well.

263
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,360
Stop it.

264
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,480
You won't run into that trouble.

265
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,320
I've been living here for a while.

266
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,080
My parents are worried

267
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,400
that we'll argue

268
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,800
like his parents.

269
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,040
They told me

270
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,200
to give it a try.

271
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,680
Just give it a try.

272
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,000
Then why are you here

273
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,320
wasting time with me?

274
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,360
Well...

275
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,640
We're getting to the point.

276
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,880
I'm here to ask

277
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,440
my brother.

278
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,040
He keeps asking me

279
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,600
what you've been busy with.

280
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,720
Why don't you answer his messages?

281
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,040
What's going on with you two?

282
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,120
Nothing's going on.

283
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,480
That's great.

284
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,560
I get it.

285
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,760
What do you get?

286
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,440
A straight guy like my brother

287
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,200
is in his prime.

288
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,880
He even has to rely on Mu Mu to protect him.

289
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,900
After all,

290
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,660
he'll become

291
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,240
the photos crying senator reached for the top.

292
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,240
What are you going to

293
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,280
do with him?

294
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,920
How about

295
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,160
going helter skelter with me?

296
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,400
What's your deal?

297
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,500
Give me a break.

298
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,620
You're only giving me a call.

299
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,120
And a pressure?

300
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,420
Give me a break.

301
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,660
Give you?

302
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,740
So what?

303
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,740
You're too red.

304
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,740
You're so red.

305
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,740
No, no, no.

306
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,740
This is Romani-Condi.

307
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,740
I know, I want Romani-Condi.

308
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,740
Hurry, call that person.

309
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,740
I can't.

310
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,740
No, no, no.

311
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,740
I'm so hungry.

312
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,740
Why are you pretending to be drunk?

313
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,740
Look.

314
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,740
Even the audience can see it.

315
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,740
But you can't act.

316
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,740
If you can see it,

317
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,740
then the straight guy can't.

318
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,740
Straight guy?

319
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,740
Who has a straight guy?

320
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,740
You're talking nonsense.

321
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,740
Sang Zuo.

322
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,740
How about you help me

323
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,740
to play a role?

324
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,740
My ticket is very expensive.

325
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,740
Forget it.

326
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,740
I have to rely on you.

327
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,740
Act seriously.

328
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,740
I'm dizzy.

329
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,740
Okay.

330
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,740
Hold me tight.

331
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,740
Okay.

332
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,740
Is he drunk because of me?

333
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,740
You ask yourself.

334
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,740
Watch out.

335
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,740
You're not drunk.

336
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,740
I'll come back to you after I send him back.

337
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,740
Don't come back.

338
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,740
Thank you.

339
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,740
Now you have a sister-in-law.

340
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,740
You're so stubborn.

341
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,740
I'm always stubborn.

342
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,740
Get in the car.

343
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,740
Okay, be careful.

344
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,740
I'm fine.

345
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,740
Don't worry.

346
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:28,740
I'mRY

347
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,740
Pretending to be great.

348
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,740
I know your feelings.

349
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,740
Stop!

350
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,740
Take your Mattress.

351
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,740
Lower your'.

352
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,740
Leave.

353
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,740
You want to take them?

354
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,740
I'm late.

355
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,740
No.

356
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,740
You came just in time.

357
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,740
Really?

358
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,740
Yes.

359
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,740
Did you drink?

360
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,740
I drank a little.

361
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,740
I'm sorry.

362
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,740
Didn't you say you wanted to endure the world?

363
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,740
Why did you become like this?

364
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,740
Tomorrow night.

365
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,740
I will definitely put my work behind me.

366
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,740
I'm sorry.

367
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,740
Go eat.

368
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,740
You.

369
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,740
Get out.

370
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,740
You.

371
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,740
You should forget what I did just now.

372
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,740
Okay, I won't.

373
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,740
I will.

374
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,740
I will.

375
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,740
I will.

376
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,740
I will.

377
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,740
I will.

378
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,740
I will.

379
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,740
I will.

380
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,740
I will.

381
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,740
I will.

382
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,740
I will.

383
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,740
I will.

384
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,740
I will.

385
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,740
I will.

386
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,740
Okay, I won't forget.

387
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,740
I'm sorry.

388
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,740
I'm not used to living with you.

389
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,740
But I will pay attention next time.

390
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,740
I will knock on the door next time.

391
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,740
You can see me hanging a bag on the handle in the future.

392
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,740
You will know I'm inside.

393
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,740
Okay.

394
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,740
Shi Yue.

395
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,740
You are here too?

396
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,740
What's wrong?

397
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,740
I'm sorry.

398
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,740
I'm sorry.

399
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,740
I'm sorry.

400
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,740
You are still so deep in love.

401
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,740
Is there something wrong with your brother's body or his heart?

402
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:24,740
Maybe he is not sick.

403
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,740
Am I really not attractive?

404
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,740
You.

405
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,740
He is just a fool.

406
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,740
I'm sorry.

407
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,740
Let's talk about Mr. Ling.

408
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,740
I saw the work group yesterday.

409
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,740
Why are they still working at four o'clock in the morning?

410
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,740
Don't do anything.

411
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,740
We are...

412
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,740
We are adults.

413
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,740
No need to explain.

414
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,740
I'm leaving.

415
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,740
Hello, Deputy Director.

416
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,740
My graduation declaration is that I'm the best.

417
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,740
I'm the best.

418
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,740
I don't want to say goodbye.

419
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,740
I'm sorry.

420
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,740
I'm sorry.

421
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,740
I'm sorry.

422
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,740
I'm sorry.

423
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,740
I'm sorry.

424
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,740
I'm sorry.

425
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,740
I'm sorry.

426
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,740
I'm sorry.

427
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,740
The past is the truth of youth.

428
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,740
The future is a great adventure.

429
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,740
Luo Man and Luo Lan once said that

430
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,740
people shouldn't be greedy for the past.

431
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,740
What people should do is look forward.

432
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,740
Don't look back.

433
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,740
Time flies.

434
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,740
In a while, your senior and senior sisters

435
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,740
will become social elites.

436
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,740
Isn't it good to rely on the Deputy Director?

437
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,740
No, no.

438
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,740
Now I should call him the Deputy Director.

439
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,740
Why are you like them?

440
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,740
But I like it.

441
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,740
By the way, when I just came here,

442
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,740
I saw a lot of scholarship programs on the school's public relations.

443
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,740
These students are so happy.

444
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,740
It's all thanks to you.

445
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,740
Senior and senior sisters are so successful.

446
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,740
They also established an educational foundation.

447
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,740
Isn't it all because of you?

448
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,740
Educational foundation?

449
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,740
Yes.

450
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,740
The leader of the educational foundation.

451
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,740
You know him.

452
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,740
He's your classmate.

453
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,740
He seems to be your classmate.

454
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,740
Yes.

455
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,740
He's here.

456
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,740
Why don't you say hello to him?

457
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,740
The Deputy Director said that

458
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,740
the person who established the educational foundation is you.

459
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,740
We've been graduated for ten years.

460
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,740
The changes are so big.

461
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,740
I can't recognize it.

462
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,740
It's getting better.

463
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,740
Nothing is worth the pity.

464
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,740
I'm sorry.

465
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,740
I'm sorry.

466
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,740
It's not worth the pity.

467
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,740
Are you talking about people or school?

468
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,740
All of them.

469
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,740
Fortunately, nothing has changed here.

470
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,740
Do you remember you used to watch me play basketball?

471
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,740
Come on! Come on!

472
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,740
Come on!

473
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,740
I don't remember.

474
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,740
Actually, there are many things that haven't changed.

475
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,740
It's late.

476
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,740
I have something to do in the company.

477
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,740
Old classmates.

478
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,740
I'll have a classmate party later.

479
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,740
Let's talk about it.

480
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,740
Hu Xuejiao.

481
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,740
What are you afraid of?

482
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,740
Yi Tianyu.

483
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,740
Let me go.

484
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,740
Yi Tianyu.

485
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,740
Hu Xuejiao.

486
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,740
I used to think I could be like you.

487
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,740
Pretend to know nothing.

488
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,740
But I found out later that I didn't like it.

489
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,740
I'm not as cruel as you.

490
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,740
Yes.

491
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,740
I came back for you.

492
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,740
You know it very well.

493
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,740
So you're avoiding me, right?

494
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,740
We are classmates after all.

495
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,740
I avoid you to make you feel embarrassed.

496
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,740
I have a boyfriend.

497
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,740
And we are very affectionate.

498
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,740
If you don't know how to keep the appropriate distance.

499
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,740
Then we won't see each other again.

500
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,740
I just want to tell you.

501
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,740
I'm your best choice.

502
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:07,740
We have always been just ordinary classmates.

503
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,740
Let go.

504
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,740
Gu Xuejiao.

505
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,740
I gave up basketball for you.

506
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,740
I changed the blue umbrella.

507
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,740
I changed everything you don't like.

508
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,740
But I haven't changed one thing.

509
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,740
Stop it.

510
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,740
I became what you like.

511
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,740
Why can't we try it?

512
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,740
Don't go to the path you haven't walked.

513
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,740
I have someone I like.

514
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,740
Whether it's the past, now or the future.

515
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,740
We can't.

516
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,740
It's impossible.

517
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,740
Why?

518
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,740
Because I tried it.

519
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,740
How do you know Yi Tianyu is my ex-boyfriend?

520
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,740
This time, I have always been just ordinary friends with him.

521
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,740
Do you think Yi Tianyu is different this time?

522
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,740
What if he changes?

523
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,740
Xuejiao.

524
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,740
I will get my own life.

525
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,740
Our own life.

526
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,740
You are back.

527
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,740
I'm going to cook some dishes.

528
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,740
Who is this monkey?

529
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,740
So smart.

530
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,740
Thank you.

531
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,740
Lin, don't be busy.

532
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,740
Come on.

533
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,740
Come on.

534
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,740
One table is enough.

535
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,740
Lin, you are so busy.

536
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,740
You cook by yourself.

537
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,740
No, it's the last dish.

538
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,740
It's rare to show a craft.

539
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,740
Let him show it.

540
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,740
Sit down.

541
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,740
Uncle, aunt.

542
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,740
I invite you two here for the last time.

543
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,740
I'm sorry.

544
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,740
It's not your fault.

545
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,740
It's an accident.

546
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,740
Right?

547
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,740
It has nothing to do with you.

548
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,740
Xuejiao told us later that

549
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,740
your mom taught your dad how to cook.

550
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,740
We were relieved.

551
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,740
We were worried that you were young people.

552
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,740
If you had any conflict with Xuejiao...

553
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,740
No, I mean

554
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,740
if Xuejiao wanted to teach you,

555
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,740
what do you think?

556
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,740
It's okay.

557
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,740
Uncle, I propose a toast to you.

558
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,740
Okay.

559
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,740
If you are lucky,

560
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,740
you can drink with my son-in-law in advance.

561
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,740
You will be a family in the future.

562
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,740
Don't say anything.

563
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,740
Come on.

564
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,740
Okay.

565
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,740
Today at noon,

566
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,740
there was an accident in the high-rise area of Jinhai.

567
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,740
The driver was seriously injured.

568
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,740
The crowd reacted.

569
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,740
The accident vehicle was a C2 model of the Chinese brand.

570
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,740
There are signs of the car being lost.

571
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,740
This station will connect with the industry experts.

572
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,740
Are you always here?

573
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,740
Is this the place?

574
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,740
Under the safety of the car.

575
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,740
How is Mr. Yi?

576
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,740
We are here to apologize on behalf of Huachuan.

577
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,740
How can you still have the face to come here?

578
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,740
Tianyu said that

579
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,740
he didn't see anyone from Huachuan.

580
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,740
I understand his mood.

581
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,740
He drove the car

582
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,740
that we gave to the C2 model of Lanshan Capital.

583
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,740
Now the accident is not confirmed.

584
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,740
We are the first to be responsible.

585
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,740
So we are here to apologize on behalf of Huachuan.

586
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,740
When Mr. Yi is willing to see us,

587
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,740
we will come again.

588
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,740
Qi Lei.

589
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,740
I am not only on behalf of Huachuan.

590
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,740
I also represent myself.

591
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,740
We are classmates after all.

592
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,740
I am just like you.

593
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,740
I am very worried about Yi Tianyu's injury.

594
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,740
If he doesn't want to see us,

595
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,740
we can leave immediately.

596
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,740
But can you tell me

597
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,740
his current situation?

598
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,740
Qi Lei.

599
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,740
Wait a moment.

600
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,740
Tianyu said that

601
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,740
he only sees you.

602
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,740
I will do it.

603
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,740
I will do it.

604
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,740
I am sorry.

605
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,740
Drink some water.

606
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,740
No need. It will get hotter.

607
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,740
I came here to...

608
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,740
I will forgive you.

609
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,740
After all,

610
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,740
we are friends

611
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,740
for so many years.

612
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,740
I am sorry.

613
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,740
As a friend,

614
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,740
I want to apologize to you.

615
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,740
As a member of CR Technology,

616
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,740
I want to apologize to you more.

617
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,740
When the matter is decided,

618
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,740
I will definitely give you an explanation.

619
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,740
I am tired.

620
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,740
You can go first.

621
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,740
I will go first.

622
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,740
I will go first.

623
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,740
It's more like saying goodbye to the past.

624
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,740
Besides,

625
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,740
the bowman should be let Lin Zhihua come.

626
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,740
Now, even this

627
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,740
can be taken to jail.

628
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,740
Please believe me.

629
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,740
I will definitely give you an explanation

630
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,740
for the reason of the accident.

631
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,740
I am going to rest.

632
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,740
You can go.

633
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,740
I really can't say anything today.

634
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,740
I will go first.

635
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,740
Yi Tianyu!

636
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,740
Don't touch him!

637
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,740
The patient's spine is injured.

638
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,740
If he wears a suit,

639
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,740
it might cause secondary damage.

640
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:33,740
Why is it still not clear

641
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,740
about the accident?

642
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,740
We checked the information

643
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,740
of CR's car and service equipment.

644
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:38,740
But we haven't found

645
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,740
anything yet.

646
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,740
Are you suspecting the software

647
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,740
or the hardware problem?

648
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,740
I don't know.

649
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,740
I don't have any clue.

650
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,740
No matter what method I use,

651
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:54,740
the accident description committee

652
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,740
must find out the reason before.

653
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,740
I am now assigned to the task report.

654
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,740
You are responsible for the hardware.

655
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,740
I will go first.

656
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,740
I will go first.

657
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,740
I will check the hardware.

658
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,740
Send all the hardware

659
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,740
to the lab.

660
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,740
Zhou Xun, you are responsible for the software.

661
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,740
Especially the Hedis

662
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,740
support system's avoidance function.

663
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,740
Re-summon all the original codes.

664
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,740
I will be responsible for the software.

665
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,740
I am familiar with this.

666
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,740
Mr. Gao, if you have any

667
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,740
dissatisfaction with my ability,

668
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,740
you can tell me in person.

669
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,740
Is this the time to argue about this?

670
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,740
Inform Gu Xuejiao

671
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,740
to do environmental analysis

672
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,740
at the car accident scene.

673
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,740
Try to find out the car's

674
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,740
driving pattern under all conditions.

675
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,740
Siqi, check your cloud server

676
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,740
twice.

677
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,740
Hurry up.

678
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,740
Lin Jia Dong.

679
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,740
I haven't approved

680
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,740
your resignation report.

681
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,740
Now is the time to

682
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,740
ask the old colleagues.

683
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,740
I came on behalf of

684
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,740
Mr. Lan Shan and Mr. Yi.

685
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,740
After Mr. Yi's death,

686
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,740
the black draft for Huashuang

687
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,740
is now full of bandits.

688
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,740
The C-2 has been

689
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,740
greatly reduced.

690
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,740
Including all the funds

691
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,740
in Lan Shan,

692
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,740
they have been very suspicious

693
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,740
of Mr. Lin's ability.

694
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,740
I am here to clean up

695
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,740
the mess.

696
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,740
Master Lin,

697
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,740
we are

698
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,740
in a whirlpool.

699
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,740
What are you looking at?

700
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,740
Continue working.

701
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,740
Brother Zhi,

702
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,740
I'll go with you.

703
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,740
I quit.

704
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,740
I quit too.

705
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,740
Brother Zhi, I'll go with you.

706
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,740
I quit too.

707
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,740
I quit too.

708
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,740
Brother Zhi, I'll go with you.

709
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,740
What's the fuss about?

710
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,740
You need to take the technical responsibility.

711
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,740
The branch hasn't been prosecuted.

712
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,740
Lin Jia Dong,

713
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,740
since your aunt's death,

714
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,740
you have immediately

715
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,740
come to the center of our report.

716
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,740
You are the one

717
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,740
who has been in the middle

718
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,740
of the whole thing.

719
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,740
You are the one

720
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,740
who has been in the middle

721
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,740
of the whole thing.

722
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,740
You are the one

723
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,740
who has been in the middle

724
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,740
of the whole thing.

725
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,740
I should know that

726
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,740
you are a thief.

727
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,740
I won't bother you

728
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,740
to pursue us.

729
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,740
We will

730
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,740
go with Brother Lin now.

731
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,740
Men are indeed

732
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,740
important until death.

733
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,740
Thank you all.

734
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,740
But...

735
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,740
Mr. Lin needs

736
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,740
everyone to stay.

737
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,740
Xue Jiao,

738
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,740
what the company is doing

739
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,740
is no different

740
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,740
from the BIC of that year.

741
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,740
Whoever wants to stay,

742
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,740
stays.

743
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,740
Anyway, I won't stay.

744
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,740
But you have to

745
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:26,740
leave with a clear conscience.

746
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,740
The most important thing now

747
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,740
is to investigate

748
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,740
the cause of the accident.

749
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,740
Don't be impulsive.

750
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,740
Old Lin,

751
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,740
the rights of the members

752
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,740
of our accident investigation

753
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,740
have been stopped.

754
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,740
What nonsense are you talking about?

755
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,740
The resignation state

756
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,740
is to deny the company's employees.

757
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,740
If you say one more word,

758
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,740
I will sue you

759
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,740
for revealing the company's business secrets.

760
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,740
I'm sorry, Director Gu.

761
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,740
Considering the relationship

762
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,740
between you and Lin Zhi Hua,

763
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,740
before the official investigation

764
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,740
results come out,

765
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,740
we can only

766
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,740
keep your low-risk

767
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,740
and safe rights.

768
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,740
Okay.

769
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,740
I respect the decision of the company.

770
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,740
I'll come to see you tomorrow.

771
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,740
If you come to visit me

772
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,740
just to let me

773
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,740
let go of Lin Zhi Hua,

774
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,740
I advise you not to come.

775
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,740
I'm sorry.

776
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,740
I'm sorry.

777
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,740
I'm sorry.

778
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,740
I'm sorry.

779
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,740
I'm sorry.

780
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,740
I'm sorry.

781
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,740
I'm sorry.

782
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,740
I'm sorry.

783
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,740
I'm sorry.

784
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,740
I'm sorry.

785
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,740
You misunderstood.

786
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,740
I just want to express

787
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,740
my own apology.

788
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,740
It has nothing to do with Lin Zhi Hua.

789
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,740
I believe that Lin Zhi Hua

790
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,740
can rely on his own strength

791
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,740
to make a big difference.

792
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,740
I don't need your help.

793
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,740
Okay.

794
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,740
Then I wish him

795
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,740
as you said,

796
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,740
to make a big difference.

797
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,740
Hello.

798
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,740
Senior, please come back quickly.

799
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,740
You're found.

800
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,740
What's wrong?

801
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,740
I'm sorry.

802
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,740
I'm sorry.

803
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,740
I'm sorry.

804
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,740
I'm sorry.

805
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,740
I'm sorry.

806
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,740
I'm sorry.

807
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,740
I'm sorry.

808
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,740
I'm sorry.

809
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,740
I'm sorry.

810
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,740
I'm sorry.

811
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,740
I'm sorry.

812
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,740
I'm sorry.

813
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,740
I'm sorry.

814
00:39:52,740 --> 00:40:02,340
The

815
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:05,440
Idf

816
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:13,780
The

817
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:19,120
We practically

818
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,120
Episode 16

819
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,720
Good morning, everyone.

820
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,400
I bought breakfast for you.

821
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,520
Thanks.

822
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,920
No, it's for Shi Yuan.

823
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,200
He likes sweets.

824
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:38,760
Hurry up.

825
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:39,920
Have a rest.

826
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,000
I'm busy. Don't go.

827
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,680
Brother Ling Shi.

828
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,120
No wonder your name is on the hot search.

829
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,120
You're not the only one who's trying to suppress the employees.

830
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,040
We were also dragged by you.

831
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,360
Why do you even have to work at your place?

832
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,720
The situation is special.

833
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,640
We are all restricted to the investigation authority.

834
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,640
Now it's all about your family's bad luck.

835
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,040
Yes.

836
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,720
Luckily, you two work in the company every day.

837
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,160
Otherwise, Lanshan won't agree to

838
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,480
continue software inspection in the business.

839
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,520
No, Li.

840
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,920
You didn't expect Lanshan

841
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,240
to restrict our team, right?

842
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,520
Yes.

843
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,760
You're bothering Shi Yuan.

844
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,000
No.

845
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,840
I have a new discovery.

846
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,760
Look here.

847
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,880
I've combined

848
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,520
all our driving patterns.

849
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,120
I found a very interesting phenomenon.

850
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,760
That is, all the patterns

851
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,520
are not compatible with Yi Tianyu's real driving pattern.

852
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,280
Why is Yi Tianyu's driving pattern so flat?

853
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,520
Because he didn't do the direction board movement

854
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,160
in case of emergency.

855
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,240
That's right.

856
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,240
Normally, we normal people,

857
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,160
especially experienced drivers,

858
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,680
would start the car when there was a danger.

859
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,920
If the car was lost,

860
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,440
they would instinctively turn the direction board to avoid danger.

861
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,920
But his driving pattern is so flat.

862
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,240
There are only two situations.

863
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,200
Either he was scared to death

864
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,400
and didn't react immediately.

865
00:41:59,400 --> 00:41:59,800
Or...

866
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,600
Or...

867
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,440
He predicted that the car would be out of control.

868
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,800
How is that possible?

869
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,600
We can't just ask.

870
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,160
In the car program diary,

871
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,240
there are all the car's operating records.

872
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,760
We can figure it out.

873
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,000
This is what I find more interesting.

874
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,720
The server of the company

875
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,080
was just being repaired during that period.

876
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,560
So the diary of the car of Yi Tianyu

877
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,480
has been lost.

878
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,400
Is it good?

879
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,280
I'm shocked.

880
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,320
Bro.

881
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,200
How should I say this?

882
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,680
Even if you don't wanna say it,

883
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,680
that means it's out of your first charge.

884
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,680
You also can't say it.

885
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,120
Gonna be dollars on it.

886
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:50,760
If you read the secrets in my eyes,

887
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:57,040
you'll find that you're always in my heart.

888
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:07,360
I tried to open my arms

889
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,520
because I'm sure that I love you.

890
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,160
I'm waiting for you at the top.

891
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,520
It doesn't matter if the wind blows in the big night.

892
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,800
There's a sound that's very close.

893
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:30,440
I know it must be you.

894
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:37,120
I tried to open my arms

895
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,880
because I'm sure that I love you.

896
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,920
I'm waiting for you at the top.

897
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:51,720
It doesn't matter if the wind blows in the big night.

898
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:56,640
There's a sound that's very close.

899
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:02,440
I know it must be you.
