 "Burning Tempo" - Duan Aojuan 

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,920
♫  One, two, three, four  ♫

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,610
♫  Don't be afraid of the so-called star student  ♫

5
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,345
♫  You are also someone else's legend  ♫

6
00:00:29,345 --> 00:00:32,223
♫  Don't hold back, grow with all your might  ♫

7
00:00:32,223 --> 00:00:36,813
♫  Midsummer's flowers  ♫

8
00:00:36,813 --> 00:00:40,526
♫  Now is the time to format your life  ♫

9
00:00:40,526 --> 00:00:43,475
♫  Math and physics are not complicated  ♫

10
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:48,929
♫  Youth is full of obstacles, but we'll slowly become stronger  ♫

11
00:00:50,324 --> 00:00:54,098
♫  My heart still burns passionately  ♫

12
00:00:54,098 --> 00:00:57,804
♫  Follow the tempo, set yourself free  ♫

13
00:00:57,804 --> 00:01:01,642
♫  The illuminated night sky guides me to success  ♫

17
00:01:13,048 --> 00:01:19,598
♫  Let us transcend the obstacles of time  ♫

18
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,970
   

19
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,860
   

20
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,000
That... That way...

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,030
 My eyesight's poor, and I can't see petty people. 

22
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,160
 If you don't even know who you should rebel against, 

23
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,030
 you're either weak or stupid. 

24
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,750
This doesn't look like the path to the bathroom.

25
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,770
It's raining. I better get back to the camp.

26
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,390
Don't you guys feel that it has become cold suddenly?

27
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,430
Yeah, mountain weather changes in a heartbeat.

28
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,600
Pull yourself together. The breeze is amazing!

29
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,670
- Senior Brother Lin. 
 - Why are you still here?

30
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,490
It's raining!

31
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,010
The forecast said there's going to be thunderstorms.

32
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,270
Thunderstorms?

33
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,540
Awesome! We'll camp in the rain tonight.

34
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,770
Listening to the rain fall, how chill is that?

35
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,200
Yeah, right. Keep dreaming. Let's head back like Senior Brother Lin said.

36
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,494
Where's Xuejiao?

37
00:03:31,494 --> 00:03:34,084
Yeah, where is she?

38
00:03:34,084 --> 00:03:36,200
Where'd she go?

39
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,550
Strange. She went to the bathroom, right?

40
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,212
I didn't see her. I think...

41
00:03:42,212 --> 00:03:43,910
Call her.

42
00:03:46,222 --> 00:03:49,909
 Sorry, the number you dialed is unavailable. 

43
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:51,769
No one's answering!

44
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,120
Her phone's here.

45
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,770
No way. We need to find her!

46
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,240
- Go! 
 - I'll check over there.

47
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,598
- I'll go this way. 
 - Whatever! Just go!

48
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:02,010
Wait, don't panic!

49
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,420
How can we not panic?

50
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,092
The camp is huge and right next to the woods.

51
00:04:05,092 --> 00:04:07,400
What if we get lost, too?

52
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,830
Here's the plan.

53
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,050
Gu Mingze, you check over by the lake.

54
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,330
I'll search the woods.

55
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,480
The rest of the guys take the girls to the hotel.

56
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,082
I'm not going to the hotel, I'll help search.

57
00:04:17,082 --> 00:04:18,456
All right.

58
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:21,696
Gu Mingze, you're a bit older, keep an eye on him.

59
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:23,960
If we don't find her in half an hour, we'll call the police.

60
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,000
Zhou Shiyun and I can help.

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,470
- Yes. 
 - Count me in.

62
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,810
Xuejiao left her phone, she might find her way back.

63
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,220
Qi Lei, wait here just in case.

64
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,640
Girls, wait in the car.

65
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,900
And no matter what, everyone meets at the hotel in half an hour.

66
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,670
- Okay. 
 - Got it.

67
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,620
Are you sure you didn't see her?

68
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,520
I'm not really sure if that was her or not.

69
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,060
I think I saw her heading...

70
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,690
 Emergency Broadcast! 

71
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,080
 Attention, everyone. 

72
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,120
 - There's a landslide warning. 
 - Xuejiao!  

73
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,760
 - All visitors must evacuate immediately. 
 - Xuejiai! Gu Xuejiao! 

74
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,460
 - Landslide alert! Evacuate now! 
 - Xuejiao! 

75
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,570
- Xuejiao! 
 - Xuejiao!

76
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,550
 Xuejiao! 

77
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,760
Xuejiao!

78
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,420
Big Brother, let's split up.

79
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,220
No way, it's pouring now!

80
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,680
What if something happens?

81
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,980
- Let's try searching over there. 
 - All right.

82
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,570
Xuejiao!

83
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,900
Why am I so unlucky?

84
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,330
Gu Xuejiao!

85
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,090
Gu Xuejiao!

86
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,060
 Where even am I? 

87
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,960
 Xuejiao! 

88
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,540
 Where are you? 

89
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,470
Gu Xuejiao!

90
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,260
Gu Xuejiao!

91
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,462
 I finally got a second chance at life, 

92
00:06:45,462 --> 00:06:48,119
 I can't lose those important to me again. 

93
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,590
 I finally got a second chance at life. 

94
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,140
 Please, don't let it end here. 

95
00:07:01,276 --> 00:07:03,336
Gu Xuejiao!

96
00:07:07,457 --> 00:07:12,910
♫  Drenching the regret of the past  ♫

97
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,780
Gu Xuejiao!

98
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,573
♫  Forgetting the past is easier said than done  ♫

99
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:22,960
♫  Every ripple of yearning  ♫

100
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,102
♫  Engraves memories in my heart  ♫

101
00:07:27,102 --> 00:07:33,182
♫  I cannot remove you from my heart  ♫

102
00:07:34,057 --> 00:07:39,857
♫  I will find you  ♫

103
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:46,117
♫  I'll always recognize your figure  ♫

104
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:51,110
♫  I don't want you to ever be   ♫

105
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,151
♫  Stranded again  ♫

106
00:07:54,151 --> 00:07:59,491
♫  Leaving us both in misery  ♫

107
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:07,271
♫  I will find you   ♫

108
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:13,564
♫  Searching to the ends of the earth  ♫

109
00:08:13,564 --> 00:08:18,647
♫  Waiting for the wind to brush past  ♫

110
00:08:18,647 --> 00:08:21,608
♫  As we stand together  ♫

111
00:08:21,608 --> 00:08:27,788
♫  I'll be yours through every turn of time  ♫

112
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,870
- Did you find her? 
 - Any luck?

113
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,820
I haven't heard from Senior Brother Lin, and I have no clue where Yi Tianyu went.

114
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,510
There's still no sign of Xuejiao.

115
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,530
This is driving me crazy.

116
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,820
Go ahead and change your clothes first.

117
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,080
I grabbed these from your bag while you were out searching.

118
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,280
They're clean. Don't catch a cold.

119
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,440
Thanks, Shiyun.

120
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,300
I honestly have no idea where Xuejiao went.

121
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,350
- Yu'zi? 
 - Yu'zi?

122
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,750
- Did you find her? 
 - Any news?

123
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,300
- I'm going to keep looking. 
 - Don't!

124
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,930
Let's just call the police like Senior Brother said.

125
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,940
- Xuejiao's back! 
 - Xuejiao!

126
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,000
Careful!

127
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,110
Xuejiao, where were you? Xuejiao!

128
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,340
I... I just got lost in the woods.

129
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,050
Why'd you go in there?

130
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,280
- Are you hurt? 
 - Are you hungry? Cold?

131
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,530
I just slipped and fell, I'm fine.

132
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,110
- Did you get hurt? 
 - I'm fine, really.

133
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,340
Are you cold?

134
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:53,910
- Who were you with? 
 - It's fine, really.

135
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,160
You knew Xuejiao got lost in the woods

136
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,910
but you didn't tell anyone, did you?

137
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,630
Dad.

138
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,470
 Did you find your sister? 

139
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,960
Don't worry, we found her.

140
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,280
 Glad to hear it. 

141
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,140
Let's go, you should apologize to Xuejiao.

142
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,830
I don't need to.

143
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,950
You don't have to make excuses for me.

144
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,870
 Go ahead and change your clothes first. 

145
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,080
 I grabbed these from your bag while you were out searching. 

146
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,330
 They're clean. Don't catch a cold. 

147
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,870
- Your ankle's swollen! 
 - I'm okay.

148
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,890
Sir, here's what you asked for.

149
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,860
You're hopeless with this. Let me do it.

150
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,080
Xuejiao, talk about bad luck.

151
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,910
You got lost in the rain, and it stopped the second you got back.

152
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,780
It's a pity that Senior Brother Lin spent so much effort setting up that tent.

153
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,960
Here, I got rooms for you.

154
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,470
- Go take a shower. 
 - Thank you, Senior Brother Lin.

155
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,490
Maybe I should book you a nicer suite.

156
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,920
Wait til you're making your own money.

157
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,200
   

158
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
Hello, Dr. Cai?

159
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,290
Aren't you also a student, too?

160
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,560
Too cold?

161
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,020
No, it's fine.

162
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,260
Shiyun!

163
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,910
Shiyun!

164
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,730
Let's head back.

165
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,850
You told me to leave, remember?

166
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,420
Stop it. It's dark and the road's slippery.

167
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,730
What if you get hurt?

168
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,700
Don't worry about me!

169
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,180
I said to leave me alone!

170
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,590
Let go!

171
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,940
You...

172
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,960
Gu Mingze!

173
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,320
Gu Mingze!

174
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,451
Put me down!

175
00:12:29,451 --> 00:12:31,280
Let me go!

176
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,870
Put me down!

177
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,720
   

178
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,530
Sorry, sir.

179
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,005
If the room is locked from inside,

180
00:13:03,005 --> 00:13:05,700
we can't open it unless there's a fire.

181
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,360
Well, just book me another room.

182
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,100
I really need a shower.

183
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,220
I'll need your ID, please.

184
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,080
My ID is in that locked room.

185
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,940
Senior Brother Lin!

186
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,890
Senior Brother Lin!

187
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,440
Thank you.

188
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:36,630
This is Gu Mingze's card, use his room to take a shower and get some rest.

189
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,770
Thanks.

190
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,180
Here, this is for you.

191
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,120
Huh?

192
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,490
Just take it.

193
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,080
We found Xuejiao all thanks to you.

194
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,820
You earned it.

195
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,400
I'll grab these to cheer Xuejiao up.

196
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,590
Thanks.

197
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,630
Shiyun, it's getting late.

198
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:21,100
Do you want to head back?

199
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,720
I'd rather just go home.

200
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,880
Okay, forget it.

201
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,200
I'm with you wherever you want to go.

202
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,610
How about I just take you home?

203
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,490
Home?

204
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,940
No.

205
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,670
I don't want to go back there either.

206
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,840
I'd rather just be sitting here alone.

207
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,720
You know, Xuejiao told us

208
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,300
that you didn't mean it.

209
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,610
Shiyun,

210
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,220
everyone makes mistakes sometimes.

211
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,180
Why not just apologize to Xuejiao?

212
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,490
She'll forgive you, for sure.

213
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,820
No!

214
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,960
I don't need her playing the saint.

215
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,530
I don't need it! I meant what I did!

216
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,230
I saw her heading the wrong way, and I let her!

217
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,080
I'm a terrible person!

218
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,350
But...

219
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,370
But why?

220
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,910
You and Xuejiao used to be so close.

221
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,730
You two were inseparable, like you shared everything.

222
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:46,610
How did things get this ugly,

223
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,350
all of a sudden?

224
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,360
Do you want the truth?

225
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,010
I...

226
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,830
I'm jealous of her.

227
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,510
I always have been,

228
00:16:17,948 --> 00:16:20,474
since we were kids.

229
00:16:20,474 --> 00:16:23,604
So jealous it was eating me up inside.

230
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,290
You?

231
00:16:29,995 --> 00:16:32,045
Jealous of her?

232
00:16:40,745 --> 00:16:44,045
Wait, is it because of me?

233
00:16:48,905 --> 00:16:49,980
Is it because of me?

234
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,830
You?

235
00:16:53,505 --> 00:16:55,445
So it is because of me...

236
00:16:56,453 --> 00:16:58,013
No.

237
00:16:58,735 --> 00:17:00,145
Gu Mingze, are you nuts?

238
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,585
Why would this be about you?

239
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,900
Unbelievable.

240
00:17:25,895 --> 00:17:27,815
   

241
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:34,255
   

242
00:17:37,245 --> 00:17:38,645
Why are you not picking up?

243
00:17:38,645 --> 00:17:42,555
I thought good girls always answered their moms' calls.

244
00:17:43,841 --> 00:17:46,501
Guess all I am is a good girl.

245
00:17:53,025 --> 00:17:54,305
Hungry?

246
00:17:54,305 --> 00:17:55,745
I'll go find you something to eat.

247
00:17:55,745 --> 00:17:58,195
Come on, you're the hungry one.

248
00:18:38,675 --> 00:18:40,855
Gu Mingze! Where'd you get that bread?

249
00:18:40,855 --> 00:18:42,675
Leftovers.

250
00:18:42,675 --> 00:18:44,105
You...

251
00:18:45,475 --> 00:18:47,175
Hang on a sec.

252
00:18:59,065 --> 00:19:00,265
Wait, what?

253
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,355
Why is it a sad face?

254
00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:15,405
See? Now it looks like a smile.

255
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:16,539
That's ugly!

256
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:18,189
No thanks.

257
00:19:20,965 --> 00:19:22,395
That's more like it.

258
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:26,645
If you don't like someone, be straight with them.

259
00:19:26,645 --> 00:19:29,895
If you like someone, own up.

260
00:19:29,895 --> 00:19:31,815
Just be honest, like you said.

261
00:19:31,815 --> 00:19:33,395
This is who you are.

262
00:19:33,395 --> 00:19:34,855
If they accept you, that's great.

263
00:19:34,855 --> 00:19:37,439
If not? It's their loss.

264
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:41,719
Someone will love the real you eventually.

265
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,050
What's wrong?

266
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,197
Nothing.

267
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,447
I just realized...

268
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:06,499
you're not as clueless as I thought you were.

269
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,100
Wait!

270
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,900
Just how clueless did you think I was?

271
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,410
Zhou Shiyun, be honest with me.

272
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,690
Not that much.

273
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,390
Be nice!

274
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,070
- Tell me or I'll smear this on your face! 
 - Seriously, not that clueless!

275
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,010
Just a tiny bit.

276
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,590
A tiny bit? That won't do!

277
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,620
I'm super smart.

278
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,510
- Put down the bread first! 
 - Honestly, I feel like a genius.

279
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,240
No! Stop!

280
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,870
This is for you anyway!

281
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,490
No!

282
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,300
I thought you promised me a real treat.

283
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,580
But all we get is instant noodles?

284
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,450
Do you have a problem with instant noodles?

285
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,820
It's got everything. Broth, greens, meat, noodles.

286
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,790
A perfectly balanced meal!

287
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,540
It could use more meat.

288
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,840
So, is it good or not?

289
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,960
Amazing.

290
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,930
Warming me up from the inside.

291
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:05,140
I was freezing just now, and all I craved was this.

292
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,050
I understand you best, right?

293
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,540
Excuse me, are you Ms. Gu Xuejiao?

294
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,930
I am.

295
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:17,010
Mr. Lin bought these meds for you.

296
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:20,320
He's busy now, but asked me to deliver them as soon as I see you.

297
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,550
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

298
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,980
Thanks.

299
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,920
Take a look.

300
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,520
He thought of everything.

301
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,650
Older guys are so thoughtful, huh?

302
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:39,410
Not only meds, he even remembered chocolate.

303
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:43,760
Unlike Yi Tianyu, his ice pack felt like a weapon ready to kill.

304
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,500
You know, Senior Brother Lin literally carried you back today.

305
00:21:55,471 --> 00:21:58,213
Were you nervous?

306
00:21:58,213 --> 00:22:00,113
Why would I be nervous?

307
00:22:00,113 --> 00:22:01,334
No big deal at all.

308
00:22:01,334 --> 00:22:03,200
Nothing to be nervous about.

309
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,167
Come on, be honest. Okay?

310
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:07,160
Check your phone. You got a lot of texts.

311
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,190
Did something happen?

312
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,300
Qi Lei just said in the group chat that his school just dropped the cutoff scores!

313
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,970
What about Jinghai University?

314
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,830
Let me check.

315
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,970
Jinghai...

316
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,680
Not yet.

317
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,270
Ugh, why can't they release their scores all at once?

318
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:34,840
This waiting game is torture.

319
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:40,970
Right, my throat's parched from stress.

320
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:43,140
Tiantian, I could use an ice-cold cola.

321
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,940
Let's go grab one.

322
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,750
Cola can wait.

323
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,720
I've got something urgent to deal with.

324
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,990
I have to run to my room.

325
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,920
These are the replacement keys for Gu Mingze and Zhou Shiyun. Make sure they get these.

326
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,400
Here's yours and mine.

327
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,380
I'm heading up.

328
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,710
Okay.

329
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,720
Hey, Mom.

330
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,560
 Xuejiao, Jinghai University just dropped their cutoff scores! 

331
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,820
 Sun Tiantian, you hid such a large stash of snacks 

332
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,280
and all you fed me was instant noodles?

333
00:23:35,534 --> 00:23:37,484
Oh, showering?

334
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,380
 I'm still starving. 

335
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,100
 How's the shower? 

336
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,060
 Mind if I come in to wash my hands? 

337
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,180
 I want to eat a bit more. 

338
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,360
 You locked the door? 

339
00:23:54,968 --> 00:23:56,878
You treat me like an outsider.

340
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,400
I'm so happy right now. I can't hold it in!

341
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,672
Let me just say this...

342
00:24:05,672 --> 00:24:08,800
I was going to tell Senior Brother Lin first.

343
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,030
My dream came true.

344
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:16,600
I got into Jinghai University!

345
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:23,830
Screw everything else right now,

346
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,270
I just want an ice-cold cola.

347
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,250
Hurry up and finish your shower

348
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,200
so we can go and get one together.

349
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,550
Actually, never mind, I'll call Senior Brother Lin real quick

350
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,660
and share the good news with him.

351
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,960
 Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off. 

352
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,600
 Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off. 

353
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,900
He must be busy, I guess.

354
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:55,140
Tiantian, earlier you asked if I was nervous. Right?

355
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,010
The truth is,

356
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:08,380
the moment I saw him in the woods earlier,

357
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:13,420
 I really hoped I'd keep seeing him in college. 

358
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,540
Tiantian?

359
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,720
 Why are you so quiet? 

360
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,860
 Tiantian? 

361
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,510
Are you okay in there?

362
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,860
 Tiantian? 

363
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,880
Did you pass out?

364
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,200
 Say something or I'm breaking in! 

365
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,900
Tiantian!

366
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,450
W-Why are you here?

367
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,400
This is Gu Mingze's room.

368
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,570
You got lost, right?

369
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,760
Well, enjoy your shower. Bye.

370
00:26:13,451 --> 00:26:15,560
Tiantian.

371
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,790
How was I supposed to know Senior Brother Lin was showering?

372
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,500
Relax, don't worry.

373
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,670
It's my fault, I bolted too fast and messed up the keys.

374
00:26:26,906 --> 00:26:30,617
You were the first person I wanted to share my good news with,

375
00:26:30,617 --> 00:26:32,437
and you set me up like this?

376
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,780
So, how was the view?

377
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,640
 This is Gu Mingze's room. 

378
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,173
- Looks like... 
 - He...

379
00:26:42,173 --> 00:26:43,820
 You got lost, right? 

380
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,450
I didn't see anything!

381
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,285
Come on, you totally did.

382
00:26:47,285 --> 00:26:48,860
- No, I really didn't. 
 - You definitely did!

383
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,240
That's your guilty face!

384
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,770
I can always tell when you lie.

385
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,720
- I swear, I didn't see a thing. 
 - Come on, tell me!

386
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,380
Eight-pack abs?

387
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,180
Six-pack? Right?

388
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,870
Six or eight, did you count? Did you?

389
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,885
- Just one! 
 - Did you count?

390
00:27:01,885 --> 00:27:03,716
- No way... 
 - I really didn't see!

391
00:27:03,716 --> 00:27:05,646
You totally did!

392
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,720
 Xuejiao, 

393
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,350
 first, my apologies for today's mishap. 

394
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,750
 But weirdly, that made me the first person you shared your good news 

395
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,650
 about getting into Jinghai University. 

396
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,320
Dr. Cai, take a look.

397
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,360
  The Least I can do is get you this ice-cold coke. 

398
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:35,470
 And lastly, I wish you all the best at Jinghai University. 

399
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,310
 Lin Zhihua. 

400
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,520
   

401
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,030
 Why couldn't you get into Jinghai University like Gu Xuejiao? 

402
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,300
 You're such a disappointment. 

403
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,121
 All three years of high school, 

404
00:27:54,121 --> 00:27:57,260
 - think about how much time and money I spent on you.  
 - Shiyun?

405
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,310
 Go ahead, do the math for me. 

406
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,400
 Is this how you thank me? 
   

407
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,200
 My daughter lost to Li Sitong's daughter! 

408
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,130
 Do you know how humiliating that is? 

409
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:09,160
 How am I supposed to hold my head up in front of others? 

410
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,370
 What good are you anyway? 

411
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:14,530
 You're nothing but an embarrassment! 

412
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,420
 Say something. 

413
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,666
 What, now? 

414
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:20,917
 You can't even make a sound? 

415
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:22,708
Who cares about your pride?

416
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:25,319
She's your daughter, not some trophy to show off!

417
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:27,560
What's wrong with you?

418
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,841
 What's wrong with you? 

419
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:30,620
 Who do you think you are? 

420
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,490
 Who are you to talk to me like that? 

421
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:34,739
 Put Zhou Shiyun on! 

422
00:28:34,739 --> 00:28:38,180
I'm just someone who can't stand this crap.

423
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,315
 Where is she? 
   

424
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,830
Shiyun.

425
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,320
So your mom...

426
00:29:11,889 --> 00:29:14,199
has always treated you like this?

427
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:19,069
 After that day, none of us saw Zhou Shiyun again. 

428
00:29:19,069 --> 00:29:20,769
 Word is, she didn't get into her top choice school. 

429
00:29:20,769 --> 00:29:22,349
 Too many applied. 

430
00:29:22,349 --> 00:29:24,549
 Nobody knew where she ended up. 

431
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:28,679
 For Auntie Wanjun, this must be the ultimate shame. 

432
00:29:29,635 --> 00:29:34,915
 Yi Tianyu got into JUFE thanks to his athletic skills. 

433
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:39,171
 Sun Tiantian didn't bother repeating a year 

434
00:29:39,171 --> 00:29:40,830
 and started working as a pastry apprentice 

435
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:43,870
 with her parents' support. 

436
00:29:43,874 --> 00:29:47,055
 Gu Mingze, unsurprisingly, also didn't get in. 

437
00:29:47,055 --> 00:29:49,200
 But over the summer, he gathered a team 

438
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,231
 of like-minded people to create a Triple A game, 

439
00:29:53,231 --> 00:29:55,839
 forging a unique path for himself. 

440
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,491
 Qi Lei headed off happily to a technical college out of town. 

441
00:29:59,491 --> 00:30:03,361
 And me, Gu Xuejiao, I'm going to Jinghai University! 

442
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:06,789
Two.

443
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:11,529
One.

444
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:19,639
Two.

445
00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:22,899
Halt.

446
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:29,889
Everyone. Eyes left!

447
00:30:29,889 --> 00:30:31,939
Pick up those feet! Move it!

448
00:30:35,349 --> 00:30:36,629
- What are you doing? 
 - Sorry.

449
00:30:36,629 --> 00:30:37,839
I couldn't stop!

450
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:40,279
Blind or just uncoordinated?

451
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:46,049
You still got energy to fight?

452
00:30:48,489 --> 00:30:51,769
Those who were talking, step forward!

453
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,720
Don't make me ask twice.

454
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,570
Otherwise, everyone here will be doing extra drills with you.

455
00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:13,789
All right.

456
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,729
You four, stand at attention.

457
00:31:15,729 --> 00:31:17,489
So loyal!

458
00:31:17,489 --> 00:31:19,429
The rest of you, dismissed!

459
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:22,179
Worst luck ever.

460
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:25,309
Day one, and we're already doing double extra drills.

461
00:31:25,309 --> 00:31:27,059
Thanks to you.

462
00:31:28,873 --> 00:31:29,909
That's your own fault.

463
00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:32,109
What? You want to keep going?

464
00:31:32,109 --> 00:31:33,709
Attention!

465
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:36,639
See you.

466
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,769
Bye-bye.

467
00:31:44,829 --> 00:31:46,349
It's boiling out there.

468
00:31:46,349 --> 00:31:48,779
Finally made it back.

469
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,810
Does this count as our first roommate dinner?

470
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,760
Of course not. Once training's over,

471
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,930
we're going out for a proper meal.

472
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,500
I'm in.

473
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,960
Why are you eating so little?

474
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,930
Are you not worried about low blood sugar?

475
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,370
Here, have a drumstick.

476
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:15,170
I'm good.

477
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,940
Thanks.

478
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,040
What is that?

479
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,320
Extra stinky snail rice noodles!

480
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,850
Shu Lan, I'm so sorry.

481
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:37,960
Stay away from me.

482
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,830
New rule: no more smelly food in the dorm.

483
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:48,480
The AC's on, why are you opening the window?

484
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,480
Come on!

485
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,170
It's so freaking hot.

486
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,520
Please don't turn off the AC.

487
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,610
I get cold easily, okay?

488
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,280
It's 36 degrees out today.

489
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,520
Are you sure you're cold?

490
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,330
AC's bad for you.

491
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:05,000
You'll get chilled to the bone.

492
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,720
Ever heard of that?

493
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,000
Whatever.

494
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,170
I'm fine.

495
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,890
Don't you feel like this dorm is a giant steamer?

496
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,490
We're just buns waiting to be cooked.

497
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,640
You'll stop being cold when we're medium-rare.

498
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,550
Today,

499
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:24,160
I'm just going to skip the common sense for once.

500
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,550
You guys don't believe me, huh?

501
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:27,570
Fine, let's see some numbers.

502
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,040
Check out these stats.

503
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,430
Cities with AC have way more people with cold symptoms.

504
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,718
Case closed.

505
00:33:34,718 --> 00:33:36,593
Numbers don't lie.

506
00:33:36,593 --> 00:33:39,373
So I'm telling you, no AC today.

507
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,769
Save yourself the embarrassment.

508
00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:49,670
I won first in the math Olympiad,

509
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,431
scored perfect on all my major math exams,

510
00:33:51,431 --> 00:33:53,891
even five of you combined couldn't out-calculate me.

511
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:01,200
Just like you said, numbers don't lie.

512
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,080
In every city, the figure on the left is lower than the one on the right,

513
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,480
but when you look at the overall total, the left is actually higher.

514
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,230
Which means your whole "AC makes you cold" theory is totally wrong.

515
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:15,101
Yeah, Shu Lan, what if we just messed up the math?

516
00:34:15,101 --> 00:34:17,820
You're the math whiz, why don't you check?

517
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,110
And besides, the sample sizes are all different.

518
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,900
We don't know if they had any control variables.

519
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,280
This data's basically useless.

520
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:29,610
Shu Lan, math whiz or not, you can't just treat us like we're fools.

521
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:32,650
I mean, we all got into Jinghai University,

522
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:35,230
clearly we're not bad at math.

523
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,600
Whatever. Run the AC if you want.

524
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,691
Don't blame me if you get sick.

525
00:34:40,691 --> 00:34:43,066
No need, thanks for the warning.

526
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,940
How about we crack the window for some fresh air?

527
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:54,260
It'll help the air circulate, and we won't feel so stuffy.

528
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,550
- Works for me. 
 - No problem.

529
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,790
Whatever.

530
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,841
Guess the internet wasn't kidding.

531
00:35:24,841 --> 00:35:29,380
Dorm drama in university is totally normal.

532
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:33,960
Guess that was our very first battle.

533
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,900
We made a pretty good team just now.

534
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,600
Fist bump.

535
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,650
You know, your name sounded so familiar.

536
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:46,570
Wait, aren't you Zhao Feifei, that genius girl from No.7 High

537
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,450
who skipped grades and aced the college entrance exam?

538
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,140
How'd you know?

539
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,780
We went to the same school.

540
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,720
I'm the one who stood up in front of the whole school

541
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,610
and swore I'd get into Jinghai University.

542
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,630
I know who you are.

543
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,840
Gu Xuejiao, the ultimate rebel queen,

544
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:08,420
somehow top of both the honor roll and the detention list!

545
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:12,225
Wow, am I really that infamous?

546
00:36:12,225 --> 00:36:13,440
Guess word gets around.

547
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,670
Half of that is exaggerated.

548
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,610
After seeing how you handled Shu Lan? I kind of believe it.

549
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,710
I am looking forward to working with you!

550
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,530
And if you find good food or fun stuff, I'm coming with.

551
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,020
Deal!

552
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,530
I'm so tired.

553
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:29,740
I'm barely awake, and we have to do more drills?

554
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,860
It's only day one. How are we going to survive the rest?

555
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,610
Just bite the bullet and it'll be over soon!

556
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,950
My teeth will shatter.

557
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,720
Sir, that's her.

558
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,550
We were just wondering where you'd gone.

559
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,328
I went to talk to the instructor so he could sort things out.

560
00:36:48,328 --> 00:36:49,898
You...

561
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,130
Go ahead to the drill field.

562
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,210
I'll handle this.

563
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,930
I...

564
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,240
Go on.

565
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,060
See you.

566
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,350
You, stay here.

567
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,882
Why have you been dodging me lately?

568
00:37:29,882 --> 00:37:31,512
I haven't.

569
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:39,010
 You... 

570
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,455
 Thanks. 

571
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,761
 Xuejiao. 

572
00:37:54,761 --> 00:37:56,039
 Hello? 

573
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:57,590
 Mom? Everything's fine. 

574
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,475
 I'll be back soon. 

575
00:37:59,475 --> 00:38:02,305
 I've been swamped, you know how it is. 

576
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,050
 I just picked up my training uniform. 

577
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,310
 Yeah. Yep. 

578
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,910
 - So busy. 
 - You're holding your phone upside down. 

579
00:38:10,315 --> 00:38:16,236
♫  To journey through time with you  ♫

580
00:38:16,236 --> 00:38:18,340
♫  If you can also  ♫

581
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,670
It's really not what you think.

582
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,010
I'm still settling into this new environment.

583
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,855
I'll be fine soon.

584
00:38:23,855 --> 00:38:29,066
♫  You'll realize you've always been in my heart  ♫

585
00:38:29,066 --> 00:38:31,347
Unlike in high school, you no longer have parents

586
00:38:31,347 --> 00:38:34,087
or teachers here breathing down your neck 24/7.

587
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,650
How'd you already have a conflict with your classmates on day one?

588
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,040
You're our instructor?

589
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,920
Your instructor is my college classmate.

590
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,340
He's busy today, so I'm covering.

591
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:55,860
Then let's hand it over to my actual instructor.

592
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,960
Senior Brother Lin, if you're busy, go ahead, I'll get to training.

593
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,610
Attention!

594
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,945
♫  Let fate run its course  ♫

595
00:39:17,945 --> 00:39:23,000
♫  Let us give all our courage  ♫

596
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,780
I'm not bothered.

597
00:39:28,306 --> 00:39:31,336
♫  If you can also  ♫

598
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:35,282
♫  Read the secret in my gaze  ♫

599
00:39:35,978 --> 00:39:37,820
 You still haven't explained. 

600
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,970
 Why are you avoiding me? 

601
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:43,010
 I need to control every variable right from the start. 

602
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:46,050
 And Senior Brother Lin, you are one of those variables. 

603
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,360
 Starting now, the nickname "Abbess Miejue" 

604
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,660
 will be the greatest praise for me. 

605
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:57,100
 I really hoped I'd keep seeing him in college. 

606
00:39:58,417 --> 00:40:00,967
 W-Why are you here? 

607
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:06,648
♫  There's a figure approaching  ♫

608
00:40:06,648 --> 00:40:10,600
♫  I know it must be you  ♫

609
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,970
   

610
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,300
Let's hurry to the cafeteria.

611
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,000
We'll go back after eating.

612
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,740
I'm exhausted.

613
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,000
I lost my appetite already.

614
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,610
Xuejiao, does this mean we can't bring takeout

615
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:23,130
back to the dorm anymore?

616
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,400
You can!

617
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,300
Just pick stuff that doesn't smell, like Si Qi does.

618
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,720
Shu Lan's okay with her food.

619
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,720
No way.

620
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,380
If I can't eat what I want, what's the point of even being here?

621
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,260
Shu Lan is definitely a handful.

622
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,960
Living with her is going to be a challenge.

623
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,340
Easy, we just need to break the ice.

624
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:43,700
Let's play a game. Truth or Dare, or something.

625
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,010
That could be fun.

626
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,970
But you really think she will join?

627
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,010
- If not, we'll tie her up and force her! 
 - I have egg yolk pastries.

628
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,150
Do you want to try some?

629
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,480
No thanks.

630
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,340
Seriously, everyone here is a top student.

631
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,670
So what if she aced math?

632
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:56,620
Everyone has their own strengths.

633
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,932
We said no! Why are you so...

634
00:40:58,932 --> 00:41:00,440
Tiantian!

635
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,930
What are you doing here?

636
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:05,750
The bakery where I'm apprenticing is right here in the campus cafeteria.

637
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:06,960
Let me introduce you.

638
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,930
She's my best friend from high school. My ride-or-die!

639
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:10,530
Hello! Nice to meet you.

640
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,480
- Egg yolk pastry. 
 - Thanks!

641
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,990
No problem.

642
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,800
It's really good. But you're the worst promo girl.

643
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,740
Just shoving it in people's mouths?

644
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,820
At least make us scan a code or follow your socials.

645
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,180
Turning freebies into followers.

646
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,470
You need to slow down,

647
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:30,014
or Tiantian won't be able to keep up.

648
00:41:30,014 --> 00:41:33,080
- How'd you even get in here? 
 - Look, same training uniform.

649
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,060
I just walked right in, no one stopped me.

650
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,250
Xuejiao, you guys all know each other?

651
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,560
Then I'll let you catch up.

652
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,600
I'm heading back to the dorm to eat.

653
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,520
Shu Lan can say what she wants; I don't care.

654
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,560
- Bye! 
 - Bye.

655
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,490
- Bye! 
 - See you guys. Bye!

656
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:45,290
Come by for dessert sometime!

657
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:46,640
It's really good.

658
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,120
- Isn't it? 
 - Let's go.

659
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,540
I have to help you with your business.

660
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,990
- In the cafeteria? 
 - Yep!

661
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,330
Coming!

662
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:57,370
Enough already!

663
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,330
There's more in the back, don't worry.

664
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:00,930
Here, your favorite.

665
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:05,250
It's my first day working at the campus dessert counter,

666
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:08,790
so I figured I'd show off and make the whole menu.

667
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,560
I heard one of the security guards here got into college.

668
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,016
Sun Tiantian,

669
00:42:16,016 --> 00:42:17,770
you're not planning on pulling the same move, are you?

670
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:19,500
I'm not that wishy-washy.

671
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,290
I've always wanted to be a pastry chef.

672
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,250
That's great, a girl with ambition!

673
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,580
How about you? Any goals?

674
00:42:29,791 --> 00:42:31,580
Come on...

675
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:34,140
Xuejiao swore back in senior year she'd get into Jinghai University.

676
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,190
Now she's living her dream. Isn't that right?

677
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:40,250
- Keep it low‑key! 
 - No, brag about it!

678
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,790
When I told my parents I was going to apprentice at Jinghai University,

679
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:45,040
they said yes without hesitation.

680
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,040
"Jinghai University," those two words

681
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,370
carry a ton of weight all across China.

682
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:50,640
Just flash your student ID,

683
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,210
and people treat you with respect.

684
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,070
For real?

685
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:57,760
Then, before classes start,

686
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,410
I should take my student ID out for a spin.

687
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:01,770
Just the thought makes me happy.

688
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:04,590
Even better, find a boyfriend to carry your shopping bags!

689
00:43:05,896 --> 00:43:07,586
That...

690
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,350
Word of warning. For first-year girls,

691
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:13,350
the top three dangers are:

692
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:16,037
fire, theft, and boys.

693
00:43:16,037 --> 00:43:19,967
Date someone you really know, like...

694
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,620
Senior Brother Lin!

695
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:45,080
