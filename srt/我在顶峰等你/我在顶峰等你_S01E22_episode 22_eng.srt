00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,660
 ♫ Don't be afraid of the so-called top scorer ♫ 

4
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,480
 ♫ You're a legend in someone else's story too ♫ 

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,180
 ♫ Don't hold back, grow with all your might ♫ 

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,820
 ♫ Flowers bloom at the height of summer ♫ 

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,600
 ♫ Now let's reformat this life anew ♫ 

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,480
 ♫ Physics and math aren't that hard ♫ 

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,920
 ♫ In the flaming youth,
we grow stronger together ♫ 

10
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,260
 ♫ My heart still burns with fiery heat ♫ 

11
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,020
 ♫ Follow the rhythm, let your spirit relieve ♫ 

12
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,785
 ♫ The night sky lights up, guiding my flight ♫ 

13
00:01:01,785 --> 00:01:05,520
 ♫ I'll be brave with you, chasing the height ♫ 

14
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,260
 ♫ My love still burns, glowing so bright ♫ 

15
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,026
 ♫ Shining in eyes that smile with grace ♫ 

16
00:01:13,026 --> 00:01:19,214
 ♫ Let us break through time and space ♫ 

17
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,960
 

18
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,750
We can't jump to conclusions yet.

19
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,310
The vehicle's onboard system logs all operations.

20
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,800
If we analyze them, it'll be clear.

21
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,240
This part is even more suspicious.

22
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,700
The company's server was undergoing
maintenance during that exact period.

23
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,110
So the program logs from Yi Tian Yu's
accident vehicle has been lost.

24
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,700
But such an operation
requires great technical support.

25
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,340
Mr. Yi is in the financial field.

26
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,460
How did he do it?

27
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,250
If this car accident was a man-made one,

28
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,430
he must have a technical helper in Huachuang.

29
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,960
We can track the technical issues.

30
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,880
But the traitor...

31
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,090
Let's put this on hold.

32
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,090
How can we stop?
The accident briefing is in two days.

33
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,560
They only gave us 72 hours
because it's the golden hours for crisis PR.

34
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,475
I bet they want to make it final at the briefing.

35
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:38,695
After that, we won't be able to turn the tables.

36
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,190
Wait for my update.

37
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,140
I need some fresh air.

38
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,340
He's already given up?

39
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,870
You underestimate him.

40
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,456
Do you really think
Yi Tian Yu orchestrated all this?

41
00:03:03,456 --> 00:03:07,538
He staged this car accident?

42
00:03:07,538 --> 00:03:09,238
What do you think?

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,410
I don't know.
That's why I'm so clueless right now.

44
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,690
But if he did orchestrate this,

45
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,160
I bet he was coming after me.

46
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,490
Then I'm more obligated to solve the problem.

47
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,850
Never blame the victim.

48
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,620
What you need to do now

49
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,690
is to take a nap and rest well.

50
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,160
Come on.

51
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,960
So?

52
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,290
Do you trust me?

53
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,280
Do you believe that
we can get through this together?

54
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,170
Of course.

55
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:12,630
Just like every time before.

56
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,490
This time, we'll surely get through it, too.

57
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,770
Stop thinking.

58
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,810
 Tackle a problem at its source. 

59
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,640
 We can't let it drag on. 

60
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,540
- You're so heavy.
- Xue Jiao.

61
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,690
- Xue Jiao.
- It's me, Qi Lei.

62
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,790
You're always thinking about Gu Xue Jiao.

63
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,092
-Xue Jiao?
- I heard that he had been discharged.

64
00:04:46,092 --> 00:04:47,130
I came to visit.

65
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,960
Uncle Yi told me that he lives here.

66
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,970
Perfect. Give me a hand. I couldn't even park because of him.

67
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,380
Let me park first. Come on, hold him.

68
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,290
Be careful.

69
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,810
Be careful. Here's the key card.

70
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,500
Here.

71
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,790
- Be careful.
- Okay.

72
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,100
You got wasted first thing out of the hospital?

73
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,710
Bring me another bottle.

74
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,580
I can drink.

75
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,180
Yi Tian Yu.

76
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,650
Yi Tian Yu.

77
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,990
 Although the program log
stored in the cloud is lost, 

78
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,580
 there must be clues left in his mobile phone,
more or less. 

79
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,373
 It's the same as last time. 

80
00:06:15,373 --> 00:06:18,843
 His password is still my birthday. 

81
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,630
Someone's a pro at typing passwords.

82
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,550
You've recovered.

83
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,920
You tricked me.

84
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,810
You tricked me, too.

85
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,480
Didn't you come to get something from me?

86
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,060
What is it? I'll help you.

87
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,970
I want the truth about the C2 accident.

88
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,450
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

89
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,180
Everything's gone.

90
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,860
The game isn't over yet.

91
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,230
What's the rush?

92
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,110
Your game is ending.

93
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,110
I'm calling the police.

94
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,500
You...

95
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,160
Why are you calling the police?

96
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,500
Because my leg recovered too soon?

97
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,420
You orchestrated the C2 accident.

98
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,690
How could you wrong me?

99
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,940
I'm the victim.

100
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,500
Lin Zhi Hua is the victim.

101
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,630
He may be the victim,

102
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,940
but I'm the one who's hurt.

103
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,820
You've lost it.

104
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,840
Open the door.

105
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,800
Nobody has figured out
why the brakes of the C2 suddenly failed.

106
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,531
If you just walk away, aren't you scared

107
00:07:59,531 --> 00:08:02,551
that those sold C2s will have the same problem?

108
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,790
I hold the switch right here.

109
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,050
If you walk out of that door today,

110
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,240
this accident won't be the only one of its kind.

111
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,470
Will you bear to see innocent people

112
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,280
suffer the consequences of your choice?

113
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,360
Yi Tian Yu.

114
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,520
You're not like this.

115
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,790
Am I not?

116
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,240
Give it a try and you'll see.

117
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,070
Give it a try.

118
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,670
I'll keep this for you.

119
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,280
Do you know how many laws you've violated?

120
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,890
It's because you don't play along.

121
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,599
I told Lin Zhi Hua you were going to your parents.

122
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:33,309
Am I considerate?

123
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,330
Where will you sleep? I only have one bedroom.

124
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,570
If you don't feel comfortable,

125
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,340
sleep on the sofa.

126
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,040
This is my home.

127
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,310
You think you can lock me out?

128
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,550
Stop looking.

129
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,690
There's nothing in there.

130
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,570
What's wrong? Why did you ask me to come here?

131
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,970
I got the footage outside the server room.

132
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,380
How did you get it?

133
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,880
But the footage on the day of the accident
was intentionally overwritten.

134
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,520
Home PCs can't handle this computing load.

135
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,570
I asked for permission to use the lab.

136
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,330
Data recovery can be accelerated.

137
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,050
We'll find the traitor very soon.

138
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,200
Done.

139
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,900
Isn't it...

140
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,120
Is Si Qi at the company?

141
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,660
- What's wrong?
- She's taken a long leave.

142
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,070
I bet Xue Jiao knows where she lives.

143
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,310
 Hello. The subscriber you dialed is powered off. 

144
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,770
 Sorry. The subscriber you dialed is powered off. 

145
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,480
Hello, Auntie.

146
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,450
May I speak to Xue Jiao?

147
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,660
Xue Jiao? She hasn't been back these days.

148
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,790
What's wrong?

149
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,540
Nothing, Auntie. I got confused.

150
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,360
Xue Jiao came to the company early in the morning.

151
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,260
Bye.

152
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,640
 

153
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,300
Mom, the operation is tomorrow.

154
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,970
You'd better be careful.

155
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,610
The caregiver said you slipped a few days ago.

156
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:37,320
Thankfully, the surgery
doesn't have to be delayed.

157
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,810
I heard that the surgeon
who's going to operate on me

158
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:45,000
came all the way from a different city.

159
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,770
Is it very expensive?

160
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:54,790
You changed my medicine to the imported ones.

161
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:58,400
Where did you get so much money?

162
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:04,810
The company offered me equity and gave me a raise.

163
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:11,120
Xue Jiao helped with that again, didn't she?

164
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,908
She's such a good friend.

165
00:13:22,908 --> 00:13:27,378
You must repay her well.

166
00:13:32,092 --> 00:13:35,342
You wanted to be a civil servant

167
00:13:35,342 --> 00:13:39,212
in our hometown to take care of me.

168
00:13:39,212 --> 00:13:41,520
But my treatment

169
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,040
is costly.

170
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,360
So, you gave up on the exam

171
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,840
and joined Huachuang for a high salary.

172
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,190
If only I hadn't held you back.

173
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,860
Mom.

174
00:14:03,457 --> 00:14:05,957
Why are you saying this?

175
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,180
We've looked everywhere for her.

176
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,690
Seriously, where else could she go?

177
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,280
One more place to check.

178
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,890
Where?

179
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,780
H-How did you get in?

180
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,380
What do you want for breakfast?

181
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,550
I'll cook for you.

182
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,671
 The virus program of C2. 

183
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:47,782
 The safety of drivers. 

184
00:14:47,782 --> 00:14:49,290
You...

185
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,490
You...

186
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,520
You're quite something.

187
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Yi Tian Yu.

188
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,850
The show is about to begin.

189
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,860
Don't forget what I told you.

190
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,600
Xue Jiao!

191
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,270
Xue Jiao!

192
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,730
Show some manners as a visitor, okay, Lin?

193
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,500
Xue Jiao.

194
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,280
Not the bedroom.

195
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,070
My girlfriend is in there.

196
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,430
Whenever you see a strap on the handle,

197
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,590
you'll know that I'm inside.

198
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,830
If you barge into the bathroom,

199
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,920
I swear I'll call the police.

200
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,950
So?

201
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,270
Do you trust me?

202
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:59,640
Do you believe that we can
get through this together?

203
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,630
Of course.

204
00:17:02,743 --> 00:17:05,120
Just like every time before.

205
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,410
Hear that? She's in the shower.

206
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,160
You can't go in there.

207
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,520
Why do you have the time to visit my home?

208
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,230
If I remember correctly, the accident briefing
is in a day and a half.

209
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,740
Yeah, I remember.

210
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,940
Since you're here, have some tea.

211
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,110
I forgot.

212
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,790
You're probably not in the mood.

213
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,620
After all, you're going to lose everything.

214
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,810
Actually, you reminded me.

215
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,970
Xue Jiao's college roommate

216
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,720
brought her a box of fine tea
made in her hometown.

217
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,110
I forgot where I put it.

218
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,880
Once I find it,

219
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,290
I'll bring you some to try.

220
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,670
Alright, I'll be waiting.

221
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,030
Yi Tian Yu.

222
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,230
Stop making mistakes.

223
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,990
They don't serve nice tea in jail.

224
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,580
You made me do this.

225
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,960
 My roommate brought me a nice tea? 

226
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,240
 Si Qi brought us tea. 

227
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,200
 My hometown is known for tea production. 

228
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,070
 Si Qi. 

229
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,900
 Flash drive. 

230
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,350
 It's one and a half days left
until the accident briefing. 

231
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,030
 Yi Tian Yu still holds all the evidence. 

232
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:22,020
 Gu Xue Jiao. You can figure something out. 

233
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,450
Xue Jiao.

234
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,220
What's wrong?

235
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,730
Xue Jiao.

236
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,470
Get lost.

237
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,380
Okay. I'll leave.

238
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,450
I'll do whatever you ask me to

239
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,730
as long as you stop crying.

240
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,870
What if I ask you to stop?

241
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,850
No way.

242
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,710
Anything except for that.

243
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,730
How about this?

244
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,490
As long as you behave, I'll take you out.

245
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:36,810
 The soft approach works on him. 

246
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:41,660
Don't have to go to work?

247
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,340
I have my staff.

248
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,380
Anyway, Huachuang is already in my possession.

249
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,860
Nothing matters more than you.

250
00:20:50,177 --> 00:20:52,777
I don't like love-struck guys.

251
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,875
Okay.

252
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,574
Then I'll go to work.

253
00:20:57,574 --> 00:20:59,480
Qi Lei will take you out.

254
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,320
Where do you want to go?

255
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,460
None of your business.

256
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:10,170
I want my card back.

257
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,420
How could I let you pay?

258
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,240
Listen.

259
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,240
Use my add-on card to buy some outfits

260
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,646
for the upcoming accident briefing.

261
00:21:24,646 --> 00:21:27,048
After all, you'll come with me.

262
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,140
You just came out alone?

263
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,520
Lin, you can't give up without a fight.

264
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,390
I'm still biding my time.

265
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,880
I didn't see her,

266
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,011
but I'm sure she has a plan.

267
00:22:00,011 --> 00:22:03,281
I just don't know what she's planning.

268
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,530
I believe in her.

269
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,660
We share the same goal.

270
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,900
So what are we doing next?

271
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,760
Next?

272
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:20,130
Next, things must unravel
according to Yi Tian Yu's plan.

273
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,100
The more we play along,

274
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,720
the more likely it is
for Xue Jiao to find a chance.

275
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,740
That's it for now.

276
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,210
Just ignore him and do your thing.

277
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,910
Let's go.

278
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,990
Wait.

279
00:22:49,892 --> 00:22:52,050
I went shopping for Tian Yu and forgot to tidy up.

280
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,310
It's been a bit chilly.

281
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,290
Put it on.

282
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,120
Thanks.

283
00:22:58,770 --> 00:22:59,940
Get in.

284
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,870
Sit tight.

285
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,356
 The navigation history is deleted. 

286
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:12,586
Which shopping mall do you like?

287
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,100
Any mall will do.

288
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,910
Okay.

289
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,821
 First Hospital. 

290
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:26,660
 Hematology Department. 

291
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,050
 Si Qi's mom. 

292
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,000
Your seat belt.

293
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,210
Come on.

294
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,580
You won't let me try on clothes.

295
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,530
Is he going to follow me to the toilet?

296
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:33,530
Tian Yu said you could buy
everything without trying it on.

297
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,760
 

298
00:25:00,884 --> 00:25:02,484
Thank you.

299
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,970
Show me that one.

300
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,570
Okay.

301
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:35,040
Thank you.

302
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,220
I'll take both, thank you.

303
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:52,000
 

304
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,070
Your phone number, please.

305
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,540
I'll credit your points.

306
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,060
 

307
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,040
 

308
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,600
Okay, thank you.

309
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:14,070
I have added these points
to your membership account.

310
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,124
Are you shopping more?

311
00:26:17,124 --> 00:26:19,880
Of course. Let's go.

312
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,870
You're back?

313
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,490
There are more.

314
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:51,280
You turned your anger into consumption impulses?

315
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,740
Does it hurt your wallet?

316
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,730
Go on tomorrow.

317
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,770
I'm glad you're happy.

318
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,580
 

319
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,190
 What is she trying to tell me? 

320
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,230
Okay.

321
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,610
All set.

322
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,480
Have a taste.

323
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,010
I don't know what flavor you like.

324
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,850
So I made two flavors for one dish.

325
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,090
Was it bad?

326
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,340
Yi Tian Yu.

327
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:31,100
I hope you understand that
whatever happened between us

328
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,720
was my personal choice.

329
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,870
It has nothing to do with anyone else,

330
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,950
including Lin Zhi Hua.

331
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,010
You should come after me, not him.

332
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:45,150
So, you've been playing along for a whole day

333
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,940
just to make me give up?

334
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,380
What a pity.

335
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:52,890
The more you defend him,
the less I want to let him go.

336
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,260
What will you do?

337
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,770
Have a taste.

338
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:13,840
I don't know if I cooked for you
in your previous life.

339
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,420
But my cooking skills have definitely improved.

340
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:23,640
After all, I worked really hard
to learn to cook overseas

341
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:29,530
because I wanted to cook for you like I did today.

342
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:38,070
What "previous life"?

343
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,110
What's that nonsense?

344
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,750
I don't get it.

345
00:29:42,345 --> 00:29:44,485
Let me remind you.

346
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,580
Outside the lab of Capital University.

347
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,390
Look at you.

348
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:54,930
Yi Tian Yu, your ex in the previous life,
kept pestering you.

349
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:57,590
How do you know he was my ex in the previous life?

350
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:02,200
Someone slacked off at work
and kept wiping that photo.

351
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,420
It's all in the past.

352
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:08,490
This time, we are nothing but ordinary friends.

353
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,830
Why are you holding on to the past?

354
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:14,420
We're already living our second lives.

355
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,920
I... I heard something.

356
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,900
Someone is outside.

357
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,948
Wouldn't you hate the person

358
00:30:34,948 --> 00:30:39,770
who took away the only thing you had?

359
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,350
Over the years, I have been asking myself.

360
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:49,390
Yi Tian Yu, why can't you try a little harder

361
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,960
and do better than him?

362
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,250
Then everything might be different.

363
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,320
Tell me.

364
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,150
Will it?

365
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:07,370
I like Lin Zhi Hua
not because of his achievements.

366
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,340
We've been together for eight years.

367
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,940
Every day of those eight years,

368
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,970
we've been trying to be our better selves.

369
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,940
You're making it up. I don't buy it.

370
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,280
But this is the truth.

371
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,690
Since you have both changed this time,

372
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:43,680
why are you so sure that I won't become better

373
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,590
and learn to cherish you?

374
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,210
You have become better.

375
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:51,100
Why would you dwell on the past?

376
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,680
Really.

377
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,280
Don't glorify the path you didn't take.

378
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,820
I swear it is

379
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,770
a complete mess.

380
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,560
It's terrible.

381
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,970
I don't care.

382
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:37,380
Even if it's a terrible mess, that's what I want.

383
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:48,390
Because you're with me

384
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,730
in that world.

385
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,360
I'll try it.

386
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,390
It's really good.

387
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,700
But I want you to eat with me.

388
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:15,300
Sorry. Let's drink.

389
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,960
Yi Tian Yu.

390
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,860
 

391
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:19,500
 Could it be that each digit corresponds
to the input on a phone's T9 keypad, 

392
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,740
 and the resulting characters
are Xue Jiao's message for me? 

393
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,550
 9-4, Y-I. 

394
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,360
 3-4, D-I. 

395
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,270
 9-8-2-6, Y-U-A-N. 

396
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,630
 9-4, Y-I. 

397
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:37,700
 D-I, Y-U-A-N, Y-I... First Hospital. 

398
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,900
 Si Qi. 

399
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,380
 Hospital. 

400
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:45,480
 

401
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,860
 

402
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,880
 

403
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,300
 

404
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,970
The patient was transferred a few days ago.

405
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:01,700
Can you tell me where she's been transferred?

406
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,940
Sorry. We're not allowed to disclose that.

407
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,410
- Thank you.
- No problem.

408
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:12,190
Hello.

409
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,230
How's it going?

410
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:15,320
As you requested, Gao Rui and I looked into

411
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,280
all the hematology experts' recent itinerary

412
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,190
and found that Professor Wei's IP address on Weibo

413
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,740
turned into Jinghai last night.

414
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:25,670
Judging from the photos, his hotel
should be opposite Xiehe General Hospital.

415
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,352
- Okay.
- I don't care about the company.

416
00:38:27,352 --> 00:38:30,190
 But if you don't get Xue Jiao
back, I'll teach you a lesson. 

417
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,890
Rest assured.

418
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,740
Mr. Yi. The accident briefing
will start in one hour.

419
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,780
I've uploaded your speech to the teleprompter.

420
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,860
It's exactly 20 minutes according to your speaking speed.

421
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,000
Here's the printed version.

422
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,750
Please take a look.

423
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,440
Does Lin Zhi Hua use a teleprompter?

424
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,210
Zhi... He is always semi-improvisational.

425
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,230
Take the teleprompter away.

426
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,590
No problem.

427
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:08,190
Well, here's the confirmed list of media.

428
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,900
Please have a look.

429
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:16,340
Congratulations.
You're about to take over Huachuang.

430
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,250
Stop flattering me.

431
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,096
Director Gu doesn't have to be there.

432
00:39:22,096 --> 00:39:24,440
 
I appreciate her support.

433
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:31,110
Why haven't you put away
the outstanding alumni sign of Capital University?

434
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,220
My apologies.

435
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:39,740
Honestly, your temperament fits this office best.

436
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,630
Yeah.

437
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,710
How could Lin Zhi Hua compare with me?

438
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,260
Right?

439
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,520
 

440
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,560
 

441
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,001
 

442
00:40:22,001 --> 00:40:23,630
 

443
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,070
Xue Jiao.

444
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,480
Didn't you want breakfast outside No. 7 High?

445
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,300
Tian Yu asked me to get it.

446
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,880
Have a taste.

447
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,940
- Have some.
- Okay.

448
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,210
This is authentic.

449
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:01,420
Tian Yu craved for this right after he came back
from abroad.

450
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,700
You two have the same taste.

451
00:41:04,572 --> 00:41:05,740
Qi Lei.

452
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:09,970
Do you remember how we had fun in high school?

453
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,050
Of course.

454
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:14,457
We've had skewers at your place many times.

455
00:41:14,457 --> 00:41:17,537
And we went on a graduation trip together.

456
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,710
It's been ten years.

457
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:25,080
It feels like it was just yesterday.

458
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,150
I was quite happy.

459
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:35,880
Now that we've grown up,
it's harder to feel happy.

460
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,900
 

461
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,050
Mom.

462
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,530
Want an apple?

463
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:51,080
I'll wash some. Okay?

464
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,680
 

465
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:19,710
Si Qi.

466
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,840
Let's sit down and talk.

467
