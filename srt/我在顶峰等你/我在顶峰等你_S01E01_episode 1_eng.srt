18
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,000
   

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,960
   

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,170
My dream is to go to Jinghai University. 
    

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,340
 I, Gu Xuejiao, 

22
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,110
 dreamed of becoming a star student ever since I was young. 

23
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,130
 So, I worked very hard every day to achieve my dream. 

24
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,130
 But the harder I tried, the more off-track I got... 

25
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,240
    
    

26
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,570
 ...and thus the more disappointed I became. 

27
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,360
 That tan jock will eventually 

28
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,020
 become a foot-scratching homebody. 

29
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,166
 Compared to men's troubles, 

30
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:43,140
 the hardships of work is nothing. 

31
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,770
 It's a good thing that work isn't just about your resume, 

32
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,520
 but also your skills. 
     

33
00:02:52,532 --> 00:02:53,650
   

34
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,200
Today, Sister Jiao will officially enter the programming department.

35
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,150
From admin to the core programming department.

36
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,320
I'm so jealous.

37
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,040
   

38
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,300
 Other fresh grads start off as software engineers. 

39
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,987
 But it took me five years. 

40
00:03:08,987 --> 00:03:11,220
 September 5th, 2024. 

41
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,670
 My 28th birthday. 

42
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,510
 Gu Xuejiao, you're about to start a brand-new chapter. 

43
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,590
Wait, you're pulling the offer?

44
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,240
Yes, my first degree might not meet your hiring criteria.

45
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,480
But I still want to fight for this opportunity.

46
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,830
I earned a bachelor's degree in software engineering

47
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,900
through a part-time correspondence program.

48
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,100
Please take a look. 
    

49
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,120
I truly value this opportunity.

50
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,960
I even gave up the offer to become a full-time employee in my original position.

51
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,960
The truth is, you didn't pass our technical review.

52
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,820
I have the email. I did pass.

53
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,600
There is a critical bug in your code.

54
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,760
Can you show me the error log?

55
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,780
Do you think I made a mistake?

56
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,020
Ms. Gu, the last thing I want is to lose a talent.

57
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,040
So we'll help you reapply

58
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,900
for a full-time headcount on your original team.

59
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,120
Your past performance has been truly outstanding. 
     

60
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,010
But your resume doesn't fit our programming department.

61
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,680
Forget it.

62
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,390
I quit.

63
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,530
I've got the skills.

64
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,660
I'll survive anywhere.

65
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:25,070
 I was too impulsive. I should've negotiated my severance before quitting. 

66
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,520
Babe,

67
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,000
congrats on going full-time.

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,590
We broke up ages ago.

69
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,050
Xuejiao,

70
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,970
can we get back together?

71
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,620
I haven't played a game in two weeks for you.

72
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,700
Wow, you're awesome.

73
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,840
Stop acting out.

74
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,750
People are watching.

75
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,840
You weren't like this before.

76
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,790
You changed your college application to go to the same school as me.

77
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,280
To avoid a long-distance relationship,

78
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,740
you even rejected two offers for overseas promotions. Remember?

79
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,130
I was always the one giving in this relationship.

80
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,340
I gave up so much just to be with you. And you?

81
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,230
That's not what you used to say.

82
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:04,190
You said I was cool and charming,

83
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,760
just like the male lead in a drama.

84
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,740
That's why I needed to snap myself out of it.

85
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,620
I was blinded by love and chose to stay in poverty.

86
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,940
We're almost 30.

87
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,600
To me, you'll always be 18.

88
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,100
I...

89
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,272
- Xuejiao. 
 - Sir...

90
00:05:20,272 --> 00:05:22,420
You said we'd be together forever!

91
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,560
Manager Lin, thank you for walking me out.

92
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,380
You're Director Lin's most valued hire.

93
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,360
Official headcount is tight these days,

94
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,160
I had to kick a contractor out to make room for you.

95
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,530
We planted a critical bug in her code.

96
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,500
 - That was Director Lin's idea?  
 - Yes.

97
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,570
Pull up Gu Xuejiao's program logs.

98
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,410
I'd like to review them.

99
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,640
Lin Zhihua, did I somehow offend you?

100
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,070
Why are you targeting me?

101
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,720
How is not hiring targeting you?

102
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,200
Why don't you take a look at yourself first?

103
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,820
You gave up everything for a guy, turning down promotion chances.

104
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,790
After five years, you're still a highly replaceable contractor.

105
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,120
You're almost 30.

106
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,240
You gave up your full-time offer because you failed the transfer.

107
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,900
That shows you lack priorities and crack under pressure.

108
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,360
You'd be a burden in the programming department anyway.

109
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,600
Why did you change my code?

110
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,880
I changed your code?

111
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,540
You planted a bug in my code,

112
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:23,360
so that your precious Zhou Shiyun can take the job, didn't you?

113
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,000
If the hiring process is unfair, I won't have it.

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,520
You won't let me go to B1 for my laptop,

115
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,150
how am I supposed to review your code?

116
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,580
Then I'll come with you. I'll be watching you.

117
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,840
What's happening?

118
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,110
Don't panic, hit the alarm button!

119
00:06:51,907 --> 00:06:54,180
   

120
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,985
 I was blinded by love and chose to stay in poverty. 

121
00:06:56,985 --> 00:06:59,910
 I just want to go back ten years ago and slap myself. 

122
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,540
 Please take your seat in the exam room accordingly. 

123
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,070
 You gave up everything for a guy, turning down promotion chances. 

124
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,150
 After five years, 

125
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,580
 you're still a highly replaceable contractor. 

126
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,060
 Good luck on the exam. 

127
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,420
 You said we'd be together forever! 

128
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,120
 If Yi Tianyu hadn't shown up, 

129
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,230
 she might've gone to Jinghai University, not me. 

130
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,251
   

131
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:17,990
   

132
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,950
   

133
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,100
You've got half an hour left.

134
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,746
Hurry up.

135
00:07:38,746 --> 00:07:39,990
 Wait. 
   

136
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,160
 Jinghai No.7 High School? 

137
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,970
 2014? 

138
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,860
 Senior year? 

139
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,770
Oh my!

140
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,990
What are you doing?

141
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,940
What's wrong with you? Acting all jumpy.

142
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,040
 Why do you also look like a Grade 12 student? 

143
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,540
 Babe. 

144
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,720
 You changed your college application to go to the same school as me. 

145
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,750
 To avoid a long-distance relationship, 

146
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,140
 you even rejected two offers for overseas promotions. Remember? 

147
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,600
 I was the only one giving in this relationship. 

148
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,770
Gu Xuejiao.

149
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,990
What are you doing? You're taking an exam.

150
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,540
I...

151
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,480
I'm turning in my test.

152
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,350
She didn't finish yet.

153
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,900
 Meet me at the pedestrian bridge. 

154
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,930
   

155
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,740
 It's so real. Too real. 

156
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,240
 If this isn't a dream, then I must be... 

157
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,900
 I'm dreaming. 

158
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,790
 Senior year was always a nightmare for me. 

159
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,592
 Since the day I started high school, 

160
00:09:15,592 --> 00:09:18,030
 my mind drifted further away from studying. 

161
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,670
 My grades kept dropping, 

162
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,710
 that's why I kept running into setbacks later at work. 

163
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,790
 Even in a dream, I want to slap myself so bad. 

164
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,030
 For someone almost 30, 

165
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,280
 dreaming of returning to their adolescence is kind of unreasonable. 

166
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,560
 It's better to wake up now. 

167
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,730
What are you doing?

168
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:54,330
 Yi Tianyu? Why are you still haunting me in my dream? 

169
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,680
 Ex-boyfriend. 

170
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,410
 But this 18-year-old face is way too real. 

171
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:04,000
You asked me out for this?

172
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,340
Ow, it hurts, ouch!

173
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,910
You asked me here so you can pinch me like this?

174
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,470
Ow! It hurts me, too!

175
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,460
 It hurts me, too... I can also feel it... 

176
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,390
 This isn't a dream. 

177
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,030
 It is a dream. 

178
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,150
 No, it's not. 

179
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,330
 Is it? No? 

180
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,480
 And finally, let's take a look at September 5th's weather forecast for Jinghai. 

181
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,980
 Daytime high, 28°C. 

182
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,880
 Low, 20°C. 

183
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,740
 It'll be hot. Sun protection is advised when heading out. 

184
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,190
Come take a look! Two pairs of socks, five yuan!

185
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,530
Come take a look! 
    

186
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,100
   

187
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,610
I... have been reborn?

188
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,650
Aren't you surprised?

189
00:11:11,783 --> 00:11:14,203
Who wanted to see you?

190
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,640
You left me this note yourself.

191
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,690
No wonder you turned in your exam as soon as you saw me.

192
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,950
You wanted to ask me out, but you were shy.

193
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,590
 That really is my handwriting. 

194
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,100
 It's hard to deny it now. 

195
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,650
Teacher Yin!

196
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,610
What? Where is she?

197
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,740
She's here?

198
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,520
Today, let me teach you a lesson.

199
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,840
Next time you read a note, don't just read the front.

200
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,520
I'm off.

201
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,290
 Focus on your studies. 

202
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,480
 2014. 

203
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,740
 Senior year. 

204
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,260
 My 18-year-old self. 

205
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,220
 The one I kept regretting over and over again. 

206
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,710
 Gu Xuejiao. 

207
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,050
 Don't say the heavens didn't give you a chance. 

208
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,580
 Restarting the game. 

209
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,450
 Let's check my memory first. 

210
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,880
   

211
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,047
You can predict the lottery numbers?

212
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:15,810
Seriously?

213
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:19,510
Trust me. You'll win for sure.

214
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:25,030
 The red balls are 31, 24. 

215
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,850
 I don't remember the numbers at all. 
   

216
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,180
   

217
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,790
Forget the double-color ball. Try something else.

218
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:40,070
   

219
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,650
Sir, I made a mistake.

220
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,260
I meant sports lottery.

221
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,830
That insane upset match with record-breaking odds.

222
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,861
Germany vs. Brazil in the World Cup.

223
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:52,155
Bet 7 to 1.

224
00:12:52,155 --> 00:12:53,840
You'll get rich for sure.

225
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,740
Not happening.

226
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,070
- Why not? 
 - The World Cup is over.

227
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,760
Where am I supposed to bet?

228
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,045
 September 5, 2014. 
   

229
00:13:05,045 --> 00:13:07,640
 Right. Today's the placement test. 

230
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,370
 Summer's over already. 

231
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,690
 Oh! And it's my 18th birthday. 

232
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,480
   

233
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,500
 Birthday? 

234
00:13:20,154 --> 00:13:21,950
Birthday!

235
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,560
Oh, no.

236
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,160
Did she just scam me for a lottery ticket?

237
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,130
Don't tell anybody I let you play the lottery.

238
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,200
   

239
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,160
 As reported by our station, the famous phone brand Yano 

240
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,240
 officially declared bankruptcy today. 

241
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,740
 Yano's largest parts supplier, 
   

242
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,280
 our city's South District Component Factory 

243
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,890
 was hit with huge order cancellations. 
   

244
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,710
 A large stockpile is stuck in the plant. 

245
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,190
 Insiders say 
   

246
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,340
 the factory's cash flow has completely dried up. 

247
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,860
 Salaries are no longer being paid. 

248
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,730
 Workers are not getting any compensation. 

249
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,730
 Coming up next, financial news. 

250
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,092
 On my 18th birthday, 

251
00:13:57,092 --> 00:14:02,924
 Old Gu chose loyalty over severance and pay cut, 

252
00:14:02,924 --> 00:14:06,420
 but ended up losing both his job and the compensation. 

253
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:12,160
 That was the starting point of our family's decline over the next ten years. 

254
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,310
 I'm not just here to change my fate, 

255
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:19,270
 but to help those I love live a better life. 

256
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,040
 This time, there's no way I'll let Old Gu sign that form. 

257
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,770
Dad! I'm...

258
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,460
You're back.

259
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:39,030
   

260
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,160
Dad.

261
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,000
You signed it already?

262
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,010
The factory's going under...

263
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:53,430
 Forget it. He won't believe me anyway. 

264
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,060
I, I mean... We should think it over.

265
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,330
Nowadays, everyone uses smartphones.

266
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,190
Who uses keypads...

267
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,020
What's wrong with you, kid?

268
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:09,810
You were supporting me to stand with the factory.

269
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,150
What now?

270
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,950
Changed your mind?

271
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,910
Look at this phone.

272
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:22,530
I won it for you at the factory's assembly contest as your tenth birthday gift.

273
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,610
Eight years have passed.

274
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,740
Not a single issue.

275
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,390
So, what does that tell you?

276
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:37,000
It means some things can stand the test of time.

277
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,330
People can, too.

278
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,891
   

279
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,384
   

280
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,870
Oh, right. I've got something for you.

281
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,050
Wait here.

282
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,090
Let me get it.

283
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,370
   

284
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,790
   

285
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,750
Here.

286
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,880
Look.

287
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,980
Uncle Sun from the canteen heard it was your birthday

288
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,480
and made you a big cake.

289
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,370
- Let's wait for your mom and brother. 
 - Okay.

290
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,290
You get some rest. I'll make two more dishes.

291
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,900
Okay.

292
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,430
   

293
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:53,320
 This time, I won't let Old Gu repeat the same mistake.  
    

294
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:11,870
   

295
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,753
Who are you tying to scare standing there?

296
00:17:44,753 --> 00:17:47,673
You think I don't know why you're sneaking out?

297
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,730
I'm just going out for a bit. Don't tell Mom and Dad.

298
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,300
I won't let you go.

299
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,960
Roller Blast beta's today! I'm the backbone of the design team!

300
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,950
I must be there!

301
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,390
You're just an intern rendering stuff. What backbone?

302
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,200
What is it?

303
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,020
What's going on?

304
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,620
- Did I hit anyone? 
 - You hit me.

305
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,300
Are you all right?

306
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,020
That punk didn't shut the window.

307
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,580
Look at this. It must've been the wind rattling everything.

308
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,050
Everything's been knocked over.

309
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,840
Thought it was a thief,

310
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,300
turns out it was just my bad luck.

311
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,160
You're right.

312
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,440
- Why did I catch up to you? 
 - My bad, sorry.

313
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,540
Gu Xuejiao, I knew you still cared about your big brother.

314
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,630
You covered for me at a time like this.

315
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,950
I'll bring you breakfast.

316
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,580
Bye.

317
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,710
Gu Xuejiao. Give me the key.

318
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,740
I'm in a rush.

319
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,890
Wait, are you crazy?

320
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:01,240
Stop. Hurry, give me that.

321
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,020
Today, I'll stay right here, watching you.

322
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,790
You're not going anywhere.

323
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,740
 Admin, two instant noodles for No. 40! 

324
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,870
 Okay, coming. 

325
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,340
 Use the E skill. 

326
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,220
 I broke up. 

327
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,260
 I got kicked out by my landlord, 

328
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,065
 because I didn't pay the rent. 

329
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:53,160
 Look, just crash in my booth for now. 

330
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,460
 Gu Mingze. 

331
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:58,520
 This time, let me help you reinvent your life. 

332
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,600
The key?

333
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,650
Gu Mingze!

334
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,874
Xuejiao, why did you sleep here?

335
00:20:15,874 --> 00:20:18,434
Dad, Brother...

336
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,570
It's the weekend, he has no class,

337
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,600
so he went to buy us breakfast.

338
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,260
Who said he doesn't have class?

339
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,850
Teacher Xiao Gao's coming over soon to tutor him.

340
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,940
Those two trial lessons went well,

341
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,230
so your mom and I decided to hire him.

342
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,780
I'll skip breakfast.

343
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,610
Auntie Zhou's husband is having a party today,

344
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,260
I have work to do.

345
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,830
Right, Xuejiao, you sit in on the lessons with your brother.

346
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,360
And keep an eye on him.

347
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,960
Make sure he pays attention.

348
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,200
Teacher Xiao Gao is a top student from Jinghai University.

349
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,260
Last year, he helped a senior improve by 200 points in just 6 months.

350
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,680
It's a bargain for us.

351
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,330
- One payment, two senior students. 
  - Hurry up, Wife. The shuttle's here. 

352
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,500
I have to go now.

353
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,010
- Bye-bye, Mom. 
 - Bye-bye.

354
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,220
Focus, okay?

355
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,890
I remember you wanted to get into Jinghai University, too.

356
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,780
Jinghai University.

357
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:16,960
 My dream is to go to Jinghai University. 

358
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,110
   

359
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:22,510
 Gu Xuejiao, you used to have such ambition. 

360
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,970
 How did you go astray halfway? 

361
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,272
 If you'd worked as hard in your senior year 

362
00:21:30,272 --> 00:21:32,340
 as when you took the correspondence program later, 

363
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,510
 you'd have reached the peak long ago. 

364
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,810
♫  Although troubles always outnumber the solution  ♫

365
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,550
♫  Even if I fall, I fall with grace  ♫

366
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,750
♫  Whether life can be restarted   ♫

367
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,150
♫  I can't say for sure  ♫

368
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,050
♫  If I fail again, I won't be sad  ♫

369
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,630
♫  Even Zhao Zilong took seven tries at the Battle of Changban  ♫

370
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,410
♫  If there are no second chances in life  ♫

371
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:50,970
♫  Then now is the last chance  ♫

372
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,210
♫  No more signals of being tired and worn out  ♫

373
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,310
♫  No more channels of being lost and confused   ♫

374
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,550
♫  No more heartbeats full of fright  ♫

375
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,770
♫  I don't want my life to be in quotes  ♫

00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,020

378
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:07,290
♫  No more invasions of laziness  ♫

379
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:10,370
   

380

♫  Let me pick up my pencil again  ♫

381
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,910
Star of Wisdom, hear my vow.

382
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,050
Let Gu Xuejiao rise again now.

383
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:18,430
With laser focus, exams I ace.

384
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,810
To the dream school, I claim my place.

385
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:23,590
PhD and Master's, mine to keep.

386
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:27,190
A winner's life on the main street.

387
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:31,100
   

388
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,390
   

389
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:37,300
♫  I'd rather be a broken piece of jade than a perfect tile  ♫

390
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,330
 I can't remember the college entrance exam questions. 

391
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,880
 But maybe the essay topic. 

392
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,607
   

393
00:22:44,607 --> 00:22:46,290
 I don't remember the lottery numbers. 

394
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,345
 As well as the exam questions. 

395
00:22:48,345 --> 00:22:51,850
 Looks like in this new life, I still can't cheat. 

396
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:55,460
 Fine. Let's do a mock exam first. 

397
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,530
♫  No more embraces of insecurity   ♫

398
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,750
♫  No more lonely noises  ♫

399
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,260
♫  No more invasions of laziness  ♫

400
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,700
I have no idea...

401
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,790
What are these questions about? 
    

402
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,500
Gu Mingze, you finally came back.

403
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,190
 Lin Zhihua. 

404
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,670
 Why are you targeting me? Did I somehow offend you? 

405
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,290
 You won't let me go to B1 for my laptop, 

406
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,910
 how am I supposed to review your code? 

407
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,860
Is this the Gu residence?

408
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,237
Haunting me like a ghost.

409
00:23:54,237 --> 00:23:56,047
What did you say?

410
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:05,050
I said, "Why didn't Senior Brother Xiao Gao come here himself, and instead had to send a sub?"

411
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,020
Something came up at home.

412
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,780
I'm covering all his gigs.

413
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,110
Forget him.

414
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,680
Let's talk about you.

415
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,710
So you're the idiot who failed

416
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,240
the college entrance exam twice in a row?

417
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,220
Teaching isn't something you can just wing.

418
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,540
Education is a matter of national importance.

419
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:33,430
If you mess me up, who's responsible?

420
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,400
 Kiddo, you may be smart, but you're barely 20. 

421
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,450
 It's time for me, your elder sister, to teach you a lesson. 

422
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,910
You say you're Senior Brother Xiao Gao's classmate,

423
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,060
so you're from Jinghai University, too?

424
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,580
Where's your resume and diploma?

425
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,120
I'm a direct-entry Ph.D. student. I haven't graduated yet.

426
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,720
So no diploma, right?

427
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,720
You could say that.

428
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,970
 Then don't blame me for getting my revenge. 

429
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:09,420
Though this is a free trial class,

430
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:13,400
Senior Brother Gao just sent some random guy over here,

431
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,850
isn't it kinda inappropriate?

432
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,550
In that case, I'll take my leave.

433
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,190
Wait!

434
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,630
You just gave up like that?

435
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,620
How about trying to persuade me?

436
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:38,360
Should I get on my knees, crying and begging you to give me a chance?

437
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,620
I won't say no to that.

438
00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:44,540
Imagine a top student from Jinghai University failing a trial class.

439
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,920
That'd be so embarrassing, right?

440
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,761
You leave without even saying goodbye?

441
00:25:55,761 --> 00:25:58,001
So you've always been rude.

442
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,780
   

443
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,571
I should just be an internet café admin with Gu Mingze.

444
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:12,271
Jiao Jiao.

445
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,380
Jiao Jiao, we are not in the same class this semester.

446
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,630
I'm going to miss you.

447
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,400
How could I bear to see you so sad?

448
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,320
Don't worry, Shiyun. I'll be back in Class One in no time.

449
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,380
Nothing matters more than besties, right?

450
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,380
Jiao Jiao, what's wrong?  You...

451
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,900
Who'd fall into the same trap twice?

452
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:49,440
I mean, from now on, I'm all about studying.

453
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,580
So you really don't want to stay in Class Eight?

454
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,100
No. You worked so hard to get into Class Eight.

455
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,130
You can't just leave. That'll be a waste.

456
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:00,470
So don't give up, Xuejiao.

457
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:03,230
I'll join your 8:00 p.m. soap-opera drama later.

458
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,150
Sun Tiantian!

459
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,720
Who are you?

460
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,210
I'm Gu Xuejiao. Our dads work together.

461
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,820
I remember now.

462
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:17,120
I baked your birthday cake base for my dad.

463
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,320
My dad said you were in Class Eight. I'm in Class Eight, too.

464
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,990
We can go to and from school together.

465
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,730
Sounds good!

466
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,150
Make way, make way!

467
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,550
- Watch it! 
 - No biking on campus!

468
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:37,080
Get out of the way!

469
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,360
Xuejiao, you okay?

470
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,240
No.

471
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,640
- Xuejiao, run. 
 - Who did that?

472
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,830
Xuejiao, just run. Or she'll know it's you.

473
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,080
I've already started over. I'm not scared of her.

474
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,680
Let's go.

475
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:57,100
Gu Xuejiao. Just you wait.

476
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,370
Don't let me get you. Or you're done for.

477
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,900
Classmate,

478
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,790
are you okay?

479
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,580
Get up.

480
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:10,350
Class, to encourage everyone to study harder this semester,

481
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:16,450
I've decided to rearrange your seats based on the placement test results.

482
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:20,540
I hope this new reward system will motivate you guys.

483
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,880
It's senior year. Time to sprint for the finish line.

484
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,540
Anyone whose name I call out

485
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,470
go into the classroom and pick your seat.

486
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,960
- Liu Jiaxue. 
 - Here.

487
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,620
- Xi Junyang. 
 - Here, ma'am.

488
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,720
- Bai Yubin. 
 - Here.

489
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,510
Isn't that Gu Xuejiao?

490
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:37,750
Xuejiao, aren't you afraid of offending Chen Xiao?

491
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,690
Don't you know she's the top dog at No. 7 High?

492
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,680
I know that all too well.

493
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,300
Then why you...

494
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,600
You don't get it.

495
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,440
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

496
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,720
- Zhou Zilin. 
 - Here.

497
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,780
She dropped in the rankings and ended up in our class.

498
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,720
Why would I care?

499
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,990
I didn't say you cared.

500
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Qi Lei.

501
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,160
Here!

502
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,070
See you later.

503
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,620
- Sun Tiantian. 
 - Here.

504
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,750
Isn't she Yi Tianyu's table mate?

505
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,440
- Gu Xuejiao. 
 - Teacher Yin.

506
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,230
Did you call the wrong name? It should've been me.

507
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,360
No.

508
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,600
You're next.

509
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,055
She scored higher than you. Look.

510
00:29:20,055 --> 00:29:21,270
   

511
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,600
- I... 
 - Yi Tianyu.

512
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,780
- I... This... 
 - You're here.

513
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,100
She beat you by one point. That's still higher.

514
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,540
- Do better next time. 
 - Do better next time.

515
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,340
- Go. 
 - Okay.

516
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:34,320
Class, if you don't use your brain, it's just decoration.

517
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,020
I'm not asking you to top the whole school.

518
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:41,440
But can we at least not all fail?

519
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,930
 How did I do worse than last time? 

520
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,020
   

521
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,300
 After all I've done, 

522
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,440
 I still became Yi Tianyu's tablemate. 

523
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,260
You...

524
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,470
 I knew you were staring. 

525
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,740
Got a stiff neck?

526
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,540
You got a stiff neck.

527
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,720
Yi Tianyu!

528
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,170
If you don't want to study, don't bother those who do. Okay?

529
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,970
No, Teacher...

530
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,580
 Turning your back on me already? 

531
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:25,140
Now, turn to page two.

532
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,830
Study god, bless me.

533
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,270
Tiantian, are you crying?

534
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,350
Did you fail?

535
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,370
I'm thanking the god.

536
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,270
Do not disturb.

537
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,920
Who's that?

538
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,300
You don't know?

539
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,410
That's the legend of No. 7 High.

540
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:50,890
He went from a failing student to a top scorer in one year.

541
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,100
He made it to Jinghai University.

542
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,750
Jinghai University and Hua University

543
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,400
fought over him like an espionage thriller show.

544
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,200
Our school had someone like that?

545
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,990
It took some effort to get this picture.

546
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:04,100
I prayed to him for three days before the exam.

547
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,020
And I scored 80 in math for the very first time.

548
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,830
Am I lucky or what?

549
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,830
Yeah, right.

550
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,790
You just guessed right on a few multiple-choice questions.

551
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,200
What study god?

552
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,340
Said the one who scored 18.

553
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,820
- Let me see. 
 - Return it after.

554
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,400
He's not as handsome as me.

555
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,910
Tiantian.

556
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,750
Do you want my photo?

557
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,620
I'll give you mine. It's way better than his.

558
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,070
I'll find one for you later.

559
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,500
I think I have one here.

560
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,390
Yi Tianyu!

561
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,030
Let's continue.

562
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,320
I'll find it for you later.

563
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,140
   

564
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,060
 Do you like it? 

565
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,750
 Did you bring me anything tasty today? 

566
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,200
 I asked you yesterday to charge the scooter's battery. 

567
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,600
 You said you would, did you forget again? 

568
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,830
 You didn't answer my calls. 

569
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,350
 I had to push it back in the rain. 

570
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:14,810
 I was so focused on creating this "I love Xuejiao" thing. 

571
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,920
 I didn't hear it. 

572
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,520
 Screw Yi Tianyu. 

573
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,160
 Screw the study god. 

574
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,450
 This time, I only believe in myself. 

575
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,950
 Who would've thought, 

576
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,390
 the capitalist who bullied me ten years later 

577
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:45,250
 is just a barista at some café now. 

578
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,000
 As long as I put in half the effort 

579
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,520
 I use to please clients at work, 

580
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,670
 I'll have him tutoring me in no time. 

581
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,670
What are you doing?

582
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,430
I'm worshipping the study god.

583
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:14,650
Why waste time on these supersititons?

584
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:17,230
Let me see which demon you're worshipping.

585
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,330
Senior Brother Lin,

586
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:26,060
I'm sorry I failed to recognize your great talent.

587
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:31,460
I really, really hope you can help me ace my exams.

588
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,350
This is a café.

589
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:36,050
If you're ordering, the menu's up there.

590
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,130
Okay.

591
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,680
Will you stop?

592
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:03,600
Senior Brother Lin, I'm sincerely asking you to help...

593
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,760
If you're not ordering, the door's right there.

594
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,760
Fine.

595
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,030
I'll order.

596
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:19,732
I'll have a cappuccino, no sugar, for you.

597
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,830
How will you pay?

598
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,080
Pay?

599
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,620
I'm leaving. Bye-bye.

600
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,940
- Bye-bye. 
 - Take care.

601
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,050
Senior Brother Lin.

602
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,980
You waited the whole day?

603
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,200
I wasn't just waiting.

604
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,430
I was studying.

605
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,100
Senior Brother Lin, I've done a lot of reflecting the past few days.

606
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,940
When you came to my house, I had just flunked an exam.

607
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,270
So I took it out on you.

608
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,650
I'm terribly sorry for that.

609
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,350
Scold me all you want.

610
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,600
I was blind to your talent.

611
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,390
I'm deadwood.

612
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,390
But look how eager I am to learn.

613
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:17,370
Would you please consider being my tutor?

614
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,060
First,

615
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:27,420
my current student is Gu Mingze, not you.

616
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,830
Second, I've already spoken to his parents.

617
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:35,060
Once Gao Rui is available, he'll return to tutoring him.

618
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,940
I'm me. My brother is my brother.

619
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:40,400
I'm asking you to tutor me, Gu Xuejiao.

620
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,650
- Please step aside. 
 - Senior Brother Lin.

621
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:47,870
Senior Brother Lin, if you don't say yes, I won't leave.

622
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,470
What's that?

623
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,090
Senior Brother Lin!

624
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,220
S-Senior Brother Lin!

625
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,830
Senior Brother Lin, you're waiting for me. Right?

626
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,080
Overconfidence is an illness.

627
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,060
You need help.

628
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,950
I tested it. This is the safest speed.

629
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:07,390
I didn't expect you to value your life this much.

630
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:09,870
Burning bright in a limited life span.

631
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,770
So, our goals are actually the same.

632
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,960
You spent just one year in senior year going from flunking to the top scorer.

633
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,660
I want to follow in your footsteps and get into Jinghai University.

634
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,570
You investigated me?

635
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,820
It's not investigation, it's worship.

636
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,980
The study god of No. 7 High. A comeback legend.

637
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,730
Nonsense.

638
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,350
There's no legend.

639
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,310
I was just managing my scores.

640
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,530
Flunk when I wanted to, top when I felt like it.

641
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,080
S-Senior Brother Lin!

642
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,720
S-Senior Brother Lin!

643
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:54,800
What happened to your safe speed?

644
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,700
Being bugged by a kid is mentally exhausting, much less safe.

645
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,950
If it weren't for Jinghai University, I wouldn't bother with you.

646
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,570
Kiddo.

647
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,350
 I had a very good seat. 

648
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:29,640
 The play was very interesting. 

649
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,420
 I didn't enjoy it. 

650
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:35,100
 A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. 

651
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,230
 They were talking... 

652
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,730
Left, a bit to the left.

653
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,230
Yun Yun, that claw machine hack you taught me works like a charm.

654
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:52,110
Told you.

655
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,880
   

656
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,460
   

657
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,170
Three. Two.

658
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:01,500
One.
    

659
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,720
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

660
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:15,390
Shiyun, is that you?

661
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,180
What a coincidence. Why didn't you go home, but came here instead?

662
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,350
Well, there's a bookstore up ahead.

663
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,240
I went to buy some books.

664
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,790
You actually got that plushie?

665
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:32,840
That's a limited edition from the arcade down the street.

666
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,460
Thi-This?

667
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,720
Is it?

668
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,560
The owner probably gave it to me because I bought so many books.

669
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,900
What are you doing out here at this hour?

670
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,580
What else would I be doing?

671
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,780
Shiyun, don't tell my sister.

672
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:54,770
Xuejiao has been ignoring my texts recently.

673
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,000
How dare she? I'll talk to her when I get back.

674
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,560
It's fine.

675
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:04,520
She's probably in a bad mood because she did worse than Yi Tianyu this time.

676
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,170
She's at the bottom of the class this time?

677
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:12,620
Interesting.

678
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,540
You didn't know?

679
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:17,440
My mistake. Pretend you never heard.

680
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,250
It's all right. You're just worrying about her.

681
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,170
Don't worry, I won't rat you out.

682
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:26,670
Gu Xuejiao's lucky to have a friend like you.

683
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,270
Just keep it to yourself.

684
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:32,870
And do not tell your parents about it.

685
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,210
Right.

686
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,540
Mom and Dad don't know yet.

687
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,950
If they find out, they'll break her legs.

688
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,910
Gu Xuejiao, look at you now.

689
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:48,460
Anyway, don't say you heard it from me.

690
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,140
I should go home now. Bye-bye.

691
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,680
- Let me walk you back. 
 - No need.

692
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:56,350
Be careful on your way.

693
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:58,070
Bye-bye.

694
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,549
Gu Mingze!

695
00:40:13,549 --> 00:40:17,960
It's not fair! Why do you get snacks when you study, and I don't?

696
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,330
You call that studying?

697
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,380
Of course, I'm studying!

698
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:26,410
I'm studying history, the tragic history of my dear sister.

699
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:28,720
I heard you scored even lower than Yi Tianyu.

700
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,020
- Dead last, huh? 
 - Give it back!

701
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,430
Isn't he the guy always showing off on the basketball court?

702
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,580
He's not bad.

703
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,980
But still a little off compared to me.

704
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,850
- Give it back! 
 - No, no, no.

705
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,050
Give it to me!

706
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:40,880
Don't make me hit you! Hurry up!

707
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,460
Hit me. Beg me.

708
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,560
- Beg, and I may give it back. 
 - Not happening, just give me that!

709
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,460
What's with all the noise? 
    

710
