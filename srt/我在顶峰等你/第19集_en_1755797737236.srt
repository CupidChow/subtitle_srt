1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Try to grow the flowers in the summer

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now tell the truth about life

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's not complicated to tell the truth

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The youth is swaying

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We are getting stronger

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My heart is still hot

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Follow the street and release it

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The night sky is brightening, only the clouds are blocking me

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will fly with you bravely

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My love is still hot

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The bright and smiling eyes

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let us cross the barrier of time

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The Blue Team gets the score

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The score on the court is now 18 to 18

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Captain, I'm coming

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
OK

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Shuai, let's attack together

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's okay

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm in

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The Red Team gets the score

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm in

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The Blue Team gets the score 20 to 20

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's the last one

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm ready

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm ready

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm ready

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm ready

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Ladies and gentlemen

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The game is about to start

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
This will be the last round of the competition

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let's see if we can win

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The car is swaying

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The battle between the two teams is still going on

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
OK

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The car is in control

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The Blue Team is in the blue zone

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The Blue Team wins

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Ladies and gentlemen

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The winner of the final of the National Smart Security Competition is

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Golden Ocean University

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Thank you to the two high school teams

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Let's give a round of applause to the team members of the Blue Team

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Golden Ocean University

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Golden Ocean University

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Golden Ocean University

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Golden Ocean University

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Golden Ocean University

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Golden Ocean University

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What's going on?

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Didn't you say that there was no problem?

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Golden Ocean University

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I have a surprise for you

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What surprise?

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Next, let's welcome the champion team to shine

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
OK

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Winning

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I heard that after we made a mistake

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You set up a targeted plan

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I almost lost your money

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
If it were you

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Can you give me a chance to pass?

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Of course not

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
But I still have to say

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You are great

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Congratulations

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Winning

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Please give the champion team three awards

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Congratulations

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Congratulations

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You are so lucky

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
According to the strength

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
True driving

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Cautious

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Keep it up

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You are so lucky

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Congratulations

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Jin Da

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Congratulations

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Congratulations

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Jin Da

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Congratulations

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Congratulations

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Congratulations to Jin Da

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
In the last ten minutes

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The wind turned the plate and won the championship

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The audience on site

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm sweating for you

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What do you want to say?

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This time to win

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's actually our long-term training result

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Although the process was a bit complicated

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But the result is also expected

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Here

96
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I want to thank someone

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,840
This is a big screen.

98
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,840
Pay attention to the image.

99
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,920
This is

100
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
President Zheng of BNC.

101
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,440
President Zheng,

102
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,000
Captain Jing is especially grateful to you.

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,440
Is this related to the long-term cooperation agreement

104
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,320
signed by Jingda and BNC?

105
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,240
Well, comrade reporter,

106
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,320
we should interview

107
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,520
the champion team, right?

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,680
So, President Zheng,

109
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,440
BNC is working with

110
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,080
Captain Li Zhihua of Jingda.

111
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,640
They are working on the news cooperation.

112
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,920
The champion is transferred to Jingda.

113
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,000
Is there any internal agreement?

114
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,200
I promise you

115
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,760
that this competition

116
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,000
is fair and just.

117
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,240
There is no internal agreement.

118
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,680
Please interview

119
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,840
our champion team.

120
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,760
Give them time.

121
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,200
President Zheng,

122
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,000
does the competition

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,320
represent the highest level

124
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,120
in the country?

125
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,920
Of course.

126
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,400
Does it mean

127
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,680
Jingda's intelligence and information technology

128
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,000
is the top in the country?

129
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,800
But it's higher.

130
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,160
Here,

131
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,240
I want to announce

132
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,880
something to you.

133
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,320
Jingda's intelligence and information technology

134
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,600
will be used

135
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,720
by our honor captain,

136
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,600
Li Zhihua,

137
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,400
and CE's unmanned vehicle.

138
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,760
President Zheng,

139
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,920
do you have confidence in CE?

140
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,920
We have seen the result of the competition.

141
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,800
And it's a competition

142
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,880
organized by BNC.

143
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,360
If the organizer

144
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,160
has no confidence in the champion,

145
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,200
then we should

146
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,320
ask the team

147
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,600
and the users.

148
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,960
President Zheng,

149
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,320
please answer me.

150
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,120
Do you have confidence

151
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
in the champion technology

152
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,640
selected by BNC?

153
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,120
Of course.

154
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,880
If we have confidence in the technology

155
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,200
represented by BNC,

156
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
will he not

157
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,280
give us a half-way?

158
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,760
Once, it's half-way.

159
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,160
The second time, it's half-way.

160
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,240
You're so shameless.

161
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,120
Can't you say something nice?

162
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,160
That's right.

163
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,080
Okay.

164
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,520
This is not a school.

165
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,200
It's interesting.

166
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,400
I believe that after Jingda

167
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,360
and BNC,

168
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,120
the cooperation will

169
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,280
be better.

170
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,600
Dear reporters,

171
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,240
President Zheng has something to do.

172
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,120
I'll answer

173
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,000
President Zheng's question.

174
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,760
This way, please.

175
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,040
This way.

176
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,440
Wait for me.

177
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,080
We haven't finished yet.

178
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,200
This is the surprise you mentioned.

179
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,840
How is it?

180
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,800
It hurts.

181
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
It hurts so much.

182
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,360
Congratulations.

183
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,640
Thank you.

184
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,600
I'm coming.

185
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,400
What are you doing?

186
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,720
Why are you here so early?

187
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,640
I haven't finished my decoration yet.

188
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,600
I want to come early

189
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,920
and help you decorate.

190
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,000
Did you buy all these?

191
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,120
Sister Yue.

192
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,440
No.

193
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,280
Lin Zhiyue.

194
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Thank you for coming.

195
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,920
You called me with your name.

196
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,160
What's up?

197
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,080
Let's talk later.

198
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,400
Let's hurry up and decorate.

199
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,680
You bought these flowers?

200
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,720
So pretty.

201
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,880
Thank you.

202
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,320
Take it.

203
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,040
Thank you.

204
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,000
Come with me.

205
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,720
Thank you.

206
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,320
I looked everywhere.

207
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,920
There is also a high force signal.

208
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,220
The

209
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,460
router is...

210
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Shi Yue.

211
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Shi Yue.

212
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
What?

213
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
Your sister won the championship.

214
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
You're not going to congratulate her?

215
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,400
Don't be so serious.

216
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,400
It's just a gold medal.

217
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
I have a lot.

218
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
I'll go back and give it to you.

219
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
Are you showing off?

220
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,400
No, absolutely not.

221
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
What I mean is

222
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
I can give you

223
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
all the gold medals

224
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
for the design contest.

225
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
If you don't think it's enough,

226
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,400
I'll continue to participate in the contest and win.

227
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Then you see,

228
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Xue Jiao only has one gold medal.

229
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
You have so many.

230
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
You still won her.

231
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
No need.

232
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
I'll earn my own gold medal.

233
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
Shi Yue, don't be angry.

234
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
I'm not saying the second place is bad.

235
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,400
I just want to say

236
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,400
you're already very good.

237
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
The ranking doesn't mean

238
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
your real strength.

239
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
You have to believe in yourself.

240
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Your future will be better.

241
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
I'm not stupid.

242
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,400
You're angry.

243
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
I saw the trend of the contest just now.

244
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
I quickly copied some

245
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
of the comments of the second place online.

246
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
What's good about the second place?

247
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
No, no, no.

248
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
Look at this one.

249
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,400
Winning is not important.

250
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
Happy is the most important.

251
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,400
Who said I'm not happy?

252
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
You're not happy.

253
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
I'm not happy.

254
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
I'm not happy.

255
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
I'm not happy.

256
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,400
I'm not happy.

257
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
I'm not happy.

258
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
I'm not happy.

259
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,400
I'm not happy.

260
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
I'm not happy.

261
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,400
You don't have to force yourself to laugh.

262
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
If you're not happy,

263
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
just say it.

264
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
The way to make me happy is very simple.

265
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
As long as you promise.

266
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
As long as I promise what?

267
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
You just have to promise

268
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
that in your heart,

269
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,400
I'll always be the first.

270
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
This is the champion.

271
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
The captain of the champion team.

272
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,400
The lead of the champion team.

273
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,400
The design of the experimental new car.

274
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Work plan.

275
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,400
This is the captain's boyfriend.

276
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
The date plan made for the champion himself.

277
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
I'll take a look first.

278
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,400
Not bad.

279
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
There are eating, playing, moving, and quiet.

280
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,400
It's not bad.

281
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
It's just...

282
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,400
It's too time-consuming.

283
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Yes.

284
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
This date time is too time-consuming.

285
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
I'm talking about this.

286
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,400
I think this work is a little unreasonable.

287
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,400
We have to consider

288
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,400
the overall efficiency of the entire lab.

289
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
You're so hard.

290
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,400
Don't you want to be the senior sister of this lab

291
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,400
after I graduate?

292
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
This senior sister

293
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
always wants to be.

294
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400
I just want to take advantage of your time

295
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
to learn from you.

296
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,400
I can imagine

297
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,400
what you look like when you grow up.

298
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
Just like my sister.

299
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
You're strong.

300
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,400
The national intelligence security competition

301
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,400
Jinghai University team's regulation and operation.

302
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,400
The board of directors has decided

303
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
to cancel its qualification for the champion.

304
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Shameless.

305
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
Let's go.

306
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,400
Where to?

307
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
It's time to decide.

308
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,400
President Zheng.

309
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,400
What's the matter with canceling

310
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
our qualification for the champion?

311
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,400
You're talking about this?

312
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,400
We have to complain

313
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
that Jinghai University team

314
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,400
has violated the rules during the competition.

315
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Canceling the qualification

316
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,400
to win the championship

317
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
is the decision of the board of directors.

318
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,400
I'm also very embarrassed.

319
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
After all,

320
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
I expressed my confidence

321
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
to the women in front of all the media.

322
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
Whose complaint?

323
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,400
Complaints from all aspects.

324
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
Otherwise,

325
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
I would have been in trouble.

326
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,400
I'm sorry.

327
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
I'm sorry.

328
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
I'm sorry.

329
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
Otherwise,

330
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,400
it will damage the reputation of BNC.

331
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,400
You're the one who has been

332
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
destroying the reputation of BNC.

333
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Dr. Cai.

334
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
I didn't expect to send you away.

335
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
I've always admired

336
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
the technical storage speed of the Asia region.

337
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,400
Especially the benefits you have.

338
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,400
I often praise you

339
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
in front of other technical teams

340
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
in other regions.

341
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,400
Thank you for your training.

342
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,400
But I didn't expect

343
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,400
that it would cost the technical results

344
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
of so many innovative teams.

345
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
So I changed your title and award.

346
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,400
It's you, Cai Guo Zhi.

347
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,400
You sent me the list.

348
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
Iger got it.

349
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
This is the content they replied to me.

350
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
What list?

351
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,400
That...

352
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
That's right. It's me.

353
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,400
Give me all the team contact

354
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,400
that BNC has been concocted.

355
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
I know you must have.

356
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,400
We'll wait for your return.

357
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
I'll call you back.

358
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,400
I'll go to them.

359
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,400
I'll go to the team.

360
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
Sorry.

361
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
Sorry for the inconvenience.

362
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,400
Xiaolin.

363
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
Thanks to you,

364
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,400
you saved a major assistant

365
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
of BNC.

366
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,400
You can rest assured.

367
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,400
We'll take care of this seriously.

368
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
It won't affect

369
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,400
our future cooperation.

370
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,440
to cooperate with BNC.

371
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,560
I'm sorry, Dr. Cai.

372
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,320
We've decided

373
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,320
to end the technical cooperation with BNC.

374
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,120
Why?

375
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,800
Everyone knows that

376
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,120
we and other entrepreneurial teams

377
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,800
have been treated unfairly.

378
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,840
It's true that your company is the first to break the contract.

379
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,640
Then we have the right to choose not to cooperate.

380
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,800
Is this also a spirit of contract?

381
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,000
Okay.

382
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,320
I respect your choice.

383
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,920
But

384
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,840
if you need any help in the future,

385
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,440
please remember to come to me.

386
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,240
I will.

387
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,320
So you've contacted Dr. Cai long ago.

388
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,240
You've easily

389
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,640
brought Mr. Zheng down.

390
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,480
You even lied to me that you were going to fight a long-term war.

391
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,920
Thanks to you, the champion.

392
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,600
Otherwise, how could we

393
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,800
have lost the game?

394
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,000
Of course.

395
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,760
The winner's fruit is picked by himself.

396
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,760
It's not like we can wait for the opponent to surrender.

397
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,360
Let's go.

398
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,600
Let's celebrate.

399
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,920
You forgot the time table?

400
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,720
I have a task in the afternoon.

401
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,720
I'll help you with the test.

402
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,760
Let's relax now.

403
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,320
Brother Lin.

404
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,800
You have a complete preparation this time.

405
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,160
It's a good chance.

406
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,720
But I hope next time,

407
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,160
if you have anything,

408
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,240
you can tell me first.

409
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,360
I can be the one

410
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,760
you trust completely.

411
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,720
Okay?

412
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,600
Trust.

413
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,560
Trust.

414
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,120
Should I tell you the truth?

415
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,520
After no one knew,

416
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,400
the evaluation?

417
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,960
How would the game work?

418
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,880
Without listening to you,

419
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,240
no one knew what'd had been going on.

420
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,400
Since The King Dan has already

421
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,520
squirrels香港

422
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,040
You do have some true talent.

423
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,720
Everything's not going to be from a practice.

424
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,240
워

425
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,960
positive

426
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,360
Good came a shadow

427
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,320
in the process.

428
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,800
You be careful

429
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,080
Lady

430
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,000
Some people

431
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,040
Will always wordt

432
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,960
a gun

433
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,780
Just come

434
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,080
Now that you beat him

435
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,760
Let's go

436
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,040
Go

437
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,880
Go

438
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,600
She has other thoughts.

439
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
So what is it?

440
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
I can't tell you what it is.

441
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
You won't believe me. It's not important.

442
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
What can't I say?

443
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
You haven't said it yet. How do you know if I believe it or not?

444
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,600
Let me tell you. The most rebellious thing about a girl is not being honest.

445
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,600
What happened? Tell me.

446
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
I zodiac to sell Xiyi to Bianxi.

447
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
You know about this?

448
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
Hello, Xu Jiao? Where are you?

449
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
I am on my way back to the lab.

450
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,600
I am going to give this award back to the lab.

451
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
After all, it is the honor of our laboratory.

452
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
I'll go to you.

453
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,600
What's up?

454
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,600
Talk to me.

455
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
I am going.

456
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
What is it? You are so mysterious.

457
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
I am going back and looking for you.

458
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,040
What's going on?

459
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,800
You're the one who kissed in the fridge.

460
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,520
What?

461
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,600
What kiss?

462
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,120
Kid,

463
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,920
why are you here alone?

464
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,480
My mom went to the toilet.

465
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,800
She asked me to wait for her here.

466
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,720
Besides,

467
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,200
I'm not a kid anymore.

468
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,560
I'm in the fifth grade.

469
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,840
Fine.

470
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,720
Let me stay here

471
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,920
with you.

472
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,640
Let's go.

473
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,740
K Déjeun

474
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,800
Can you guess where I am?

475
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,200
You took such an effort?

476
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,640
Journey to Learning the Mongoose?

477
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
You like soccer?

478
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,400
Yes. Did you watch the World Cup?

479
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
China is 1-0 to Korea.

480
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,600
Of course.

481
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,400
Over 100 people watched it with me.

482
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
That's a hot-blooded person.

483
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,900
You're just like your boyfriend.

484
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,400
You don't play the grass.

485
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,900
What did he say?

486
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,800
Tell me.

487
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,200
He'll come over and we'll hit him in person.

488
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,800
It's impossible.

489
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,400
Because he's so tired of it.

490
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,600
Tired?

491
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Yes.

492
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,600
He told me in the ward last time that China is 1-0 to Korea.

493
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,200
He was right.

494
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,200
He also told me that Meixi will win the World Cup in 2022.

495
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,800
There are still so many years to go.

496
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,400
Hey, your boyfriend...

497
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,100
Actually, I have a secret.

498
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,200
Actually, I have a secret too.

499
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,600
My mom said...

500
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Do you want to know

501
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,200
what you'll be like 10 years from now?

502
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,000
I've liked you for 10 years.

503
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,000
Xue Xiao!

504
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,200
Why are you sitting here?

505
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,200
I've been looking for you.

506
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
I'm here.

507
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,200
Do you remember where this is?

508
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,600
Actually, I have a secret.

509
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
What secret?

510
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,200
You remember everything?

511
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,200
If I didn't meet that kid today,

512
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
when are you going to hide it from me?

513
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,200
I'm sorry.

514
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,800
But whether you believe it or not, I was going to tell you today.

515
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,600
And I've been looking for the right person to tell you.

516
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,200
I'm sorry.

517
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,600
I was going to tell you today.

518
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,400
And I've been looking for the right person to tell you.

519
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,200
When is the right time?

520
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm afraid that our memories will be mixed up

521
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,400
and affect our relationship.

522
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,600
I'm afraid that you can't accept it.

523
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,000
Do you know what I can't accept the most?

524
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,600
That high-class you last time.

525
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,600
Even if you have to live again,

526
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,200
you still like to treat people like fools.

527
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,800
Xue Xiao, it's not like what you think.

528
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,000
No matter which time, I didn't treat you like a fool.

529
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,600
But you did it.

530
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,800
You know everything.

531
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,800
I know that everything I'm saying is late.

532
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,200
But I was going to tell you before signing the contract with BNC.

533
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,400
But... He sold the suit.

534
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,600
Can you help me pick up the ball? Thank you.

535
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,600
Okay.

536
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,800
Xue Xiao, listen to me explain.

537
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,200
Don't explain anymore. I don't want to listen.

538
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,000
Why do I have to listen to what you want to say?

539
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,200
Xue Xiao.

540
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,000
Don't follow me.

541
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,200
Let's go.

542
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,200
I'm sorry. There's...

543
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,600
Don't think that I'm willing to come. I'm meeting your brother.

544
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,600
What about my brother?

545
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,400
He's your boyfriend.

546
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,800
I'm celebrating that I...

547
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,600
finally got to know someone.

548
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,600
You didn't go anywhere, right?

549
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,400
Say it.

550
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,000
Why did you fight with my sister like this?

551
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,000
You didn't fall in love with someone else, right?

552
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,800
Is that kind of person?

553
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Why would a man fall in love with someone else?

554
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It seems that no matter how lazy a man is, he can't escape from his natural enemy.

555
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,800
Natural enemy? What natural enemy?

556
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,800
The nature of a person is the nature of a person.

557
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,200
But if you can't be sorry to my sister...

558
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,400
The nature of a person.

559
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,400
I did let your sister lose her trust, but it's not because of that.

560
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,800
Then why? Hurry up and say it.

561
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
I was just a good lie.

562
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,200
A good lie isn't a lie anymore?

563
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,000
Can a good lie be forgiven?

564
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,600
What kind of a lie? That's just an excuse.

565
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,600
The most important thing between a couple is trust.

566
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,200
If you love her, you must be 100% honest with her.

567
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,400
For the sake of her good lie, will she really feel good?

568
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,600
That's what you think.

569
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,000
No matter how much you love her, she's still two different individuals.

570
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,200
She can't be completely made into what you think she is.

571
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,400
You understand, right?

572
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,600
For the sake of her good lie,

573
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,200
as long as she really loves her, it's nothing.

574
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,200
Right?

575
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,600
You don't care about her heart.

576
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,600
What about my brother?

577
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,400
Did he escape from his natural enemy?

578
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,000
Your brother...

579
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,400
He's more than enough.

580
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,800
He's different.

581
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,600
He's different.

582
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,200
Phone.

583
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,600
I'm listening.

584
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,400
I'm listening.

585
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,600
Hello, Mr. Sun.

586
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,800
Your sister is drunk. Hurry and take her away.

587
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,800
I can't comfort her anyway.

588
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,400
Okay.

589
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,600
Sun Tiantian.

590
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,000
Yes?

591
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,600
Okay.

592
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,200
Are you hungry?

593
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,000
I'm not hungry. I won't eat.

594
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Eat less.

595
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,000
It smells so good.

596
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,200
I'm not eating.

597
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
I'll bring you food.

598
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,200
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

599
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,800
Junior Sister.

600
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,600
I'll go eat.

601
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,600
What's a male ticket?

602
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
A sister is a strong man.

603
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,600
Hello, Dad.

604
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,400
What are you doing, brat?

605
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,800
You suddenly went back to China and you're not even in the city.

606
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,000
Are you doing something wrong over there?

607
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,600
Why did you come back?

608
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,600
Dad, just be good to me.

609
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,400
I'm on my way to my visa. I'll come back to renew my visa.

610
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,400
I'm going to the airport.

611
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,200
I'll be back in a few days.

612
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,000
I'll be back in a few days.

613
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,800
I'll be back in a few days.

614
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,200
I'll be back in a few days.

615
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,600
I'm on my way to my visa. I'll come back to renew my visa.

616
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,600
No.

617
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,200
I remember you still have a long way to go before you get your visa.

618
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,800
I just sent you the information.

619
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,000
Dad, I'm not going to talk to you anymore.

620
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,200
I'll go home after I finish this. Bye.

621
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,400
This brat.

622
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,000
He's got something on his mind.

623
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,200
He's not here for your new classmate.

624
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,800
Hello.

625
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,800

It is all in your heart

632

When you think of it

633
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,600
Your life

639
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:12,820
nobright

640
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,840
it's not me

641
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,920
my friend broke up with her boyfriend

642
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,080
I want to buy it

643
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,080
I wish their love will be complete.

644
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,080
Keep it safe.

645
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,080
Okay.

646
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,080
Xue Xiao,

647
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,080
I know

648
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,080
honesty is the foundation of everything.

649
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,080
But sometimes,

650
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,080
hiding it is really not a bad thing.

651
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,080
Last time, for you,

652
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,080
I was just some memories that I couldn't get back.

653
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,080
I was just thinking,

654
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,080
if it's destined,

655
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,080
let's start over.

656
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,080
I thought that

657
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,080
it would be better if I didn't tell you about some things.

658
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,080
But I was wrong.

659
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,080
Does this

660
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,080
sound like a little bit of a joke?

661
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,080
I'm sorry.

662
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,080
I'm sorry.

663
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,080
I'm sorry.

664
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,080
I'm looking for an excuse.

665
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,080
Go to hell with your last lie.

666
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,080
Then I was wrong.

667
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,080
Any hidden and deceitful

668
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,080
is an irresponsible act.

669
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,080
Forgive me for having too many concerns

670
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,080
and not telling you the truth in time.

671
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,080
I apologize to you

672
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,080
for my selfishness.

673
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,080
I'm sorry.

674
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,080
Why are you here?

675
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,080
I don't think there's any need to explain.

676
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,080
This is the lab.

677
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,080
It's working time now.

678
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,080
It's a waste of time.

679
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,080
Please go back.

680
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,080
I'm here to find Xue Xiao,

681
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,080
not you.

682
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,080
What?

683
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,080
You want to ask for your consent?

684
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,080
You're not her boyfriend now.

685
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,080
Who says I'm not her boyfriend?

686
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,080
Don't care who says it.

687
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,080
I know anyway.

688
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,080
Do you know the flower language of yellow roses?

689
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,080
Why are you asking this?

690
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,080
Check it out.

691
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,080
Xue Xiao must be very happy

692
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,080
to have an old classmate

693
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,080
with four limbs like you.

694
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,080
I'm sorry.

695
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,080
I'm sorry.

696
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,080
Four limbs?

697
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,080
What do you mean?

698
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,080
Yellow roses are the only

699
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,080
roses without romance.

700
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,080
They are the symbol of friendship and relationship.

701
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,080
You're so cute.

702
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,080
Hello, Tiantian.

703
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,080

I called you just now.

706
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,080
I'm just a student.

707
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,680
So,

708
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,040
I need your help.

709
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,040
Coming.

00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,480
Tiantian.

711
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,360
Sun Tiantian

712
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,920
is taking our new milk tea again.

713
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,520
We should talk to him.

714
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,920
Your brother drank a lot.

715
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,440
He's getting fatter.

716
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,880
What Sun Tiantian?

717
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,200
That's Mr. Sun.

718
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,400

Esballilla fr Greghman Why is this tea so expensive?

721

It's like,

We need to sell this tea.

Here.

730
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,640
There are clogged pores.

731
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,520
Be careful.

732
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,240
Let me introduce you.

733
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,040
I'm a high school student in the school.

734
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,400
I'm a very good relationship guy.

735
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,600
You can choose what you want.

736
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,640
Thank you.

737
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,360
What flavor do you want?

738
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,480
I forgot. I don't drink.

739
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,640
Who said I don't drink?

740
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,560
You don't like the strong one?

741
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,640
I love you so much.

742
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,240
You...

743
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,640
Choose what you want.

744
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,840
Don't waste others' time.

745
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,760
That's right.

746
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:47,880
You...

747
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,200
Hurry up and leave.

748
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,320
Don't waste others' time.

749
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,160

Put when you are at home

751
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,520
You still know to go home?

752
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,520
I just came back to pack these things.

753
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,520
I'll bring the useful things back to the dormitory.

754
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:46,520
The rest of these will be taken care of before we move.

755
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,520
Who said we're moving?

756
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,520
The more people think we're down,

757
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,520
the more we have to save our face.

758
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,520
Mom, it's already this time.

759
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,520
Just accept the reality.

760
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,520
We sold the house,

761
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,520
and we have to pay the debt.

762
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,520
Maybe there's a chance to start over.

763
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,520
You've always lived in other people's eyes.

764
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,520
To keep your last bit of face,

765
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,520
you're really happy.

766
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,520
So I think you're not good enough.

767
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,520
You failed the college entrance examination.

768
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,520
You finally took part in a national competition.

769
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,520
You lost to him again.

770
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,520
Sometimes I think you did it on purpose.

771
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,520
You deliberately did it to me.

772
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,520
You wanted to piss me off and lose my face.

773
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,520
I'm sorry.

774
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,520
Now that it's done,

775
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,520
they moved to a big house.

776
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,520
But we have to move from this luxurious community

777
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,520
to an old and broken community.

778
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,520
Are you willing to go?

779
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,520
The second place in the national competition.

780
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,520
Is it embarrassing?

781
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,520
In this world,

782
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,520
who will remember the second place?

783
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,520
You've been the best since you were a child.

784
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,520
I'm the best for you.

785
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,520
I'm the best for you.

786
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,520
I'm the best for you.

787
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,520
I'm the best for you.

788
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,520
But you, look.

789
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,520
Look.

790
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,520
How many first places have you won?

791
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,520
How can my daughter lose to others?

792
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,520
Forget it.

793
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,520
You're just a life.

794
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,520
Yes.

795
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,520
When I failed the entrance examination,

796
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,520
you always scolded me.

797
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,520
But even if I got into the first place in English,

798
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,520
you would still blame me.

799
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,520
Why is the score not high enough?

800
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,520
So sometimes I'm really curious.

801
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,520
If I really got into the top school,

802
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,520
and really won the first prize

803
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,520
in the national competition,

804
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,520
will you really be satisfied?

805
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,520
You will never be satisfied.

806
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,520
Because in your heart,

807
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,520
I will never be the daughter you like.

808
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,520
So sometimes I forget

809
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,520
that I'm actually quite good.

810
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,520
Yes.

811
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,520
I did lose this competition.

812
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,520
But I lost in a glorious way.

813
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,520
The second place in the national competition

814
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,520
is just the beginning of my research.

815
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,520
From now on,

816
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,520
I will not be influenced by anyone's ideas.

817
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,520
But I won't move to the new house.

818
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,520
I'll live there myself.

819
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,520
Thank you.

820
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,520
Shi Yuan,

821
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,520
if you're sad,

822
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,520
you can cry.

823
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,520
Then let's go.

824
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,520
Let's go.

825
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,520
You've been walking from the front door

826
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,520
to here with me.

827
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,520
Why don't you

828
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,520
ask why I'm crying?

829
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,520
When you're sad,

830
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,520
I just want to be with you.

831
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,520
And I've been calling you

832
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,520
but you didn't answer.

833
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,520
Now I can see you're fine.

834
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,520
I'm fine.

835
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,520
Nothing is more important than you.

836
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,520
Say it again.

837
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,520
I said something wrong.

838
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,520
Don't cry.

839
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,520
I'm sorry.

840
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,520
Don't cry.

841
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,520
What are you looking at?

842
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,520
You look like

843
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,520
two white tears on the sky.

844
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,520
You're the one who's wearing makeup.

845
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,520
You can't be like this.

846
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,520
Don't use your bone marrow.

847
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,520
You look better

848
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,520
when you cry.

849
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,520
You said I look ugly when I cry?

850
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,520
I didn't say that.

851
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,520
I swear I didn't mean that.

852
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,520
I'm sorry.

853
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,520
The room is dark.

854
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,520
Light a lamp.

855
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,520
Be careful.

856
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,520
There will be no

857
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,520
empty voices.

858
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,520
Break up memories.

859
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,520
Every line is a wrong path.

860
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,520
We're thinking about

861
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,520
how to get closer to each other.

862
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,520
I'm sorry.

863
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,520
Get closer.

864
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,520
Let fate

865
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,520
let us

866
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,520
hand over all our courage.

867
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,520
I'm willing to spend

868
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,520
time with you on this journey.

869
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,520
If you also

870
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,520
read the secrets in my eyes,

871
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,520
you will find that

872
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,520
you're always in my heart.

873
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,520
I tried to

874
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,520
open my hands

875
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,520
and legs.

876
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,520
I tried to open my hands

877
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,520
and legs.

878
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,520
Because I knew

879
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,520
I loved you.

880
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,520
I was listening to the wind.

881
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,520
It doesn't matter

882
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,520
if the wind is strong.

883
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,520
It doesn't matter

884
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,520
if the wind is strong.

885
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,520
I knew

886
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:46,920
I know it must be you

887
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:00,520
I tried to open my arms

888
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,320
Because of love

889
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,120
I'm waiting for you at the top

890
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:14,120
The wind is blowing, it doesn't matter

891
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,120
There is a sound, very close

892
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:25,120
I know it must be you
