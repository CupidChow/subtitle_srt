1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Try to grow the flowers in the summer

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now tell the truth about life

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's not complicated to count the flowers

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The youth is swaying

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We are getting stronger

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My heart is still hot and boiling

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Follow the rhythm and release it gently

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The night wind is blowing, only the fireflies are in the way

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will fly with you bravely

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My love is still hot and boiling

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The bright and bright eyes

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let us cross the barrier of time

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't eat this meal

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We just finished the college entrance examination

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We are helping out some of the volunteers

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Isn't this to increase the pressure on the children?

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You just said that they are here

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I understand that Li is sighing these days

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I didn't ask her

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So I just invited all of them to be my guests

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Is this a snail?

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's got mosquitoes

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You can tell by the smell

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Our family is lucky

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
There's no pressure

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Don't be anxious to come back

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's not an important guest

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I won't talk to you anymore

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm really embarrassed

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Our old Zhou has a meeting and can't come back

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
He told me to entertain and understand the family

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I understand the family

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Look, Xue Jiao and the others have worked so hard in the exam

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We should also reward them

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes, yes, yes

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Come on, everyone, move your chopsticks

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I asked the restaurant to customize every dish today

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Try this boiled cabbage

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's their signature dish

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm embarrassed to bother you, Sister Li

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Water

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thank you

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Where's your soup spoon, Sister Li?

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'll get it

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Miss Ban Jun

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Boiled cabbage is a soup with a strong flavor

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's refreshing and refreshing

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But it's not greasy

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Look at this dish

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's covered with a layer of fat

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's not the soup we cooked

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Which big restaurant is so stingy?

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What big restaurant?

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's not as good as the soup I cooked

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes, Dad

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yes, yes, yes

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Are you stingy?

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Sister Li, take it away

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'll do it

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Xue Jiao, how's your exam this time?

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You were waiting for me here

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's not good

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You're worse than ten points

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What a pity!

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's the most unfortunate that you're worse than ten points from the first book

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You can't get good two books

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The bad two books are so bad

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What a pity

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But you can choose a better three books

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You should help Xue Jiao make good ideas

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
After all, there is a university to ask about the school

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No problem

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Xue Jiao

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This time, my old Zhou really spent a lot of money

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He invited a teacher who applied for the exam

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Finally, he decided to go to理大

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I fell for it at once

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
After all, the college entrance examination is the most important choice in life

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Still have to be a little more stable, right?

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yes, yes

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Xue Jiao, which three universities are you more interested in?

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm a little worse than the past year's Jinhai University score line

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
How many six hundred?

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Six hundred and seventy-nine

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Shiyuan, your grade must be higher than my sister

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
How much?

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Six hundred

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Hurry up

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Mom, I'll change my clothes first

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You are so ungrateful

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I have been training you for so many years

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You can't pass her

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The only thing you are happy about now is

96
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
With her score, you must be guaranteed to go to Jinhai University

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm so worried about her

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
She is so poor

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
How can she afford to be poisoned?

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Why are you here?

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You are all gone

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I can still eat

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You eat better than anyone

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I really can't sit on that table

105
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Did you feel it?

106
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Why are you so good at comparing yourself with our family?

107
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Brother, you just found out

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You have a Mariana Hitch in the anti-shark lake

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But why?

110
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Her family lives in a big villa

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Why do you compare yourself with our family?

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You don't know that

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Our mother was excellent when she was young

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
She couldn't catch up with the little one behind her

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Even if she's grown up now

116
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
She's still self-pitying

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Some people are from childhood to retirement

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Our mother was so excellent when she was young

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
How can she look up to our father?

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Our mother is obviously not good at looking

121
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Now, this problem is passed on to you

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
One generation is better than the other

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
My eyes are not good

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
My eyes are better than yours

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You are jealous of me, right?

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Shi Yue, you look better in this dress

127
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Thank you

128
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Sister Li, why didn't you persuade Xue Jiao?

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
She must not pass the examination

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Such a high score is a waste

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
She is so stubborn

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We just hope that the family can develop fully

133
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Our family doesn't need her to make money for us

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The examination of Li Da is also her personal hobby

135
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
We don't expect our children to be born in the world by themselves

136
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I had to report it myself

137
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
My parents didn't say a word

138
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Can we change the job we filled in?

139
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Of course not

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's all in the paper

141
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What should we do?

142
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's too late

143
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What should we do?

144
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What?

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Stop it, it's a serious matter

146
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
We can just review it

147
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
We can have a higher score next year

148
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Xue Jiao, if you don't have the job this time

149
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
How many exams will you two take?

150
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Isn't it a burden to increase the family's burden?

151
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It may not be a good result

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Sister Li, don't worry about money

153
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I will help you

154
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
How about this?

155
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I will ask Zhou to raise your salary

156
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I will call him now

157
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
No, no

158
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Where is my phone?

159
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Where is my phone?

160
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Sorry, sorry

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
No need

162
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm sorry

163
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
After all, my mom may not be able to work in your house

164
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Aunt Lan Jun

165
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Three, two, one

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Recently, the residents of the Jinshai City's home-stay area

167
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
have been collecting money

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The local government will provide a discount

169
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
for the purchase of a house, children's education and other multi-faceted discounts

170
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Let residents in the new living environment

171
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Discount

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's like going to the store

173
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
This family has brought all kinds of

174
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I received a discount on the electronic version of the compensation

175
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Look

176
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Seven sets of compensation

177
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Isn't it eight sets on the compensation?

178
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
No, no, how many sets?

179
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I forgot to calculate the commercial version of the compensation

180
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yes, yes, yes

181
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Commercial version

182
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Show your mother

183
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's really eight sets

184
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Eight sets

185
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Then we must have a rich person

186
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
OK, eight sets

187
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Sorry, Aunt Lan Jun

188
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I may have to trouble you to re-sale the house

189
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
After all, my mom is very tired every month to collect rent

190
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What are you talking about?

191
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I and the school are in debt

192
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What nonsense

193
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Prepare a big bag for your mother

194
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm going to collect rent

195
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Found it

196
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Our house is here

197
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Our house is here

198
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Look

199
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Our community is a former house demolition

200
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
We can choose to re-sale after three years

201
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's good to go back

202
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's great to go back

203
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
When we go back

204
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
My old friends

205
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The old friends in the factory live in this area

206
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
We can walk together

207
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You can choose the city's east outer ring to settle the community

208
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Good city east

209
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The economy is good in the city east

210
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Home is busy

211
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The demand for home affairs is large

212
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
OK, let's go here

213
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Dad, mom

214
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Listen to me

215
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
We can also choose the city west

216
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The one that Shi Jun chose is also nearby

217
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
In short, the academic atmosphere in that area is particularly rich

218
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The academic atmosphere is rich

219
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
This is called ear like wood

220
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But son you

221
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Can't get it

222
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You are a blank paper

223
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Mom, he is still blank paper

224
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What is his paper

225
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
He is a cowhide paper

226
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Cowhide paper

227
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The woman with a cowhide

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The woman with a cowhide

229
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Then we

230
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We choose the city north

231
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The city north is a deserted wilderness

232
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Why choose it

233
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I am the next ten years of reconstruction planning

234
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The focus is here

235
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
In the next ten years

236
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
This will be built into a new CBD core area

237
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Introduced to the Internet

238
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The city is built as the landmark building of my city

239
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Don't look at the Internet companies now

240
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's okay to let go

241
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The future is the head of each one

242
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
We are going to let go of the future

243
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And this is the future

244
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Let me see

245
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What does this city north look like

246
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Dad, you will drive a car from now on

247
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Take my mom to the world

248
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What about me

249
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You, you just stay in that city west

250
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Just feel the academic spirit

251
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Anyway, this smelly smell

252
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You don't care

253
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Girl, this is also the little Lin's

254
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The algorithm model is calculated

255
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Correct

256
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
This is awesome

257
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Then you let him calculate

258
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
When will Mingze grow up

259
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You give him the model

260
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's hard to calculate

261
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's hard to calculate

262
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This city north is so good

263
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Can't see

264
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Nothing now

265
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Ten years

266
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Can't imagine

267
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
This piece

268
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
New publicity materials

269
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
In a few days, the industry will be in a meeting

270
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
We will definitely be generous

271
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
When you look good

272
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Let's go out and search

273
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But this kind of social education has no nutrition

274
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I think it's a good idea

275
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm not in your seat

276
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I feel guilty alone

277
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Or let Lin Jia Tong take you

278
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm fine

279
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I just have a small flu

280
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Just sleep

281
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Hello

282
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Brother Wei, emergency

283
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I said I won't go back

284
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You just do it

285
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You don't feed your dad, you don't feed your mom

286
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Just for your show

287
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Can you be stable for a day?

288
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You don't know

289
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Although I am your dad's person

290
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But stand on your mom's post

291
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
He and his two are going to fight

292
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The first one to take me to the sky

293
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I really can't do it

294
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Hello, Hua Hua, hello

295
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I

296
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Big and small

297
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Who is this

298
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You care about yourself first

299
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Take medicine, remember

300
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
When will the result be out?

301
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Hello, Tiantian

302
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Sleep

303
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I found the secret of Brother Lin's golden sky

304
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The secret of Brother Lin's golden sky

305
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Wait for me

306
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's like this

307
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I was online at home yesterday

308
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Guess what I found

309
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I found that Jinghai New opened a very high-end dessert shop

310
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Then I went over

311
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Guess what I found again

312
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I found it really delicious

313
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But I think my ability is completely perfect

314
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So I decided

315
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What is not high-level

316
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I am determined to become an excellent dessert shop

317
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Stop

318
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Tiantian, first of all

319
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Congratulations on finding what you like

320
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Thank you

321
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But what does this have to do with Brother Lin's secret?

322
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Brother Lin

323
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I am near the dessert shop today

324
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I found Brother Lin on a car of a rich woman

325
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Rich woman

326
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You are wrong

327
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I followed all the way

328
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And my eyes are a little bit bright

329
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What if it's an ordinary friend

330
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's all a collusion

331
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It can't be an ordinary friend

332
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's over

333
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What happened

334
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The man is back

335
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
What happened

336
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The man is back

337
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What happened

338
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Fight

339
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You say

340
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You say it

341
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Don't pick up the things

342
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You put it down

343
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Do you know what that is

344
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You are kneeling down

345
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Then I'm going to hit

346
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Who is coming back

347
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
What happened

348
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What happened

349
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Brother

350
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I tell you

351
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I definitely didn't see it wrong

352
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
1.85 meters long legs

353
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
White skin, love to lick the mouth

354
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
With glasses, human skin

355
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I didn't expect him to help with the money

356
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You got his ID card

357
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Are you sure it's him

358
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You see

359
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You see

360
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Definitely him

361
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Really

362
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What other questions do you have

363
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Hurry up and say it

364
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Save it for a while

365
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Your problem of dropping things

366
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Too hateful

367
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Really ignorant

368
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
This is a pair of gold shoes I just shot

369
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You broke one

370
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I can't get it right, you know

371
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Anyway, the couple has the same property

372
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Half each

373
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You just take it as the half I broke

374
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Ok, you want half, right

375
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'll give you half

376
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
What are you doing

377
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Half

378
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You let go

379
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Half of me

380
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Half of me

381
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Half of you

382
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Half of me

383
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Half of me

384
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Half of me

385
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Satisfied

386
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Don't guess

387
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Brother Lin, don't be killed by them

388
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'll go see

389
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
what happened

390
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
We don't take this matter seriously

391
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Mainly Brother Lin doesn't take it seriously

392
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
If you go now

393
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
They are the ones who give him the wind

394
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Isn't that going with us?

395
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
That's it

396
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That's it

397
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Sorry, I'm not his accomplice

398
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I didn't come to help him forget the wind

399
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Brother Lin Ye

400
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Why are you here

401
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,960
Dalong.

402
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,560
Where's Tiantian?

403
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:24,880
It doesn't matter.

404
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,880
Seeing how considerate you are now,

405
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,640
I feel relieved.

406
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:27,880
Let's run.

407
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,760
We find him dangerous.

408
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,600
What.

409
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,280
is my home in danger?

410
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,160
Your home?

411
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
I'm sorry.

412
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,560
It was Tiantian who made a mistake.

413
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,560
I've already criticized him.

414
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,160
Thank you, Auntie, for the cake.

415
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,760
After eating, hurry up and leave.

416
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,160
Why are you in such a hurry?

417
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,960
We like it when

418
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,360
Hua Hua brings her friends back.

419
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,160
Our Hua Hua

420
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,560
is the first time

421
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,960
that she brings her friends back.

422
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,160
She's so kind.

423
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,160
She's so kind.

424
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
She's so kind.

425
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,160
She's so kind.

426
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,160
She's so kind.

427
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
It's the first time

428
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,160
that she brings her friends back.

429
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,760
I don't know

430
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,160
what you like to eat.

431
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,160
Later,

432
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,360
I'll find someone

433
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,360
to order you to cook.

434
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,160
Let's eat together, okay?

435
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
Well,

436
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,760
actually, we

437
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,160
live abroad all year round.

438
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,160
It's a very short trip back today.

439
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,360
And we're going to be busy later.

440
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,560
We're leaving.

441
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,360
Is your house far away?

442
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,360
I'll ask Hua Hua to drive you home.

443
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,960
She's one of the students.

444
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,560
I just took a few classes.

445
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:40,960
Yes.

446
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,360
I just finished high school.

447
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,360
Today, I happened to

448
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,960
meet that senior here.

449
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,760
You're so young.

450
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,360
Forget it.

451
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,360
Isn't she also

452
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,360
three, four, five, six, seven, eight years

453
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,560
younger than us?

454
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,760
Right?

455
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,160
And our Hua Hua

456
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,760
has been a good girl since she was a kid.

457
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,760
She's going to college now.

458
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,960
She said she's a freshman

459
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,360
and she's not a problem at all.

460
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,360
Yes.

461
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,960
Let me ask you.

462
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,760
Which university do you want to take the exam?

463
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,160
Jinghai University.

464
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,760
Really?

465
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,360
Jinghai University?

466
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,760
That's our Hua Hua's school.

467
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,160
She'll be our junior in the future.

468
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,760
By the way,

469
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,760
did we take a photo

470
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,960
with Hua Hua when we were reporting

471
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,960
at the gate of Jinghai University?

472
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,560
Yes.

473
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,360
Honey, go get the photo album.

474
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:34,760
Go.

475
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,160
Hurry up.

476
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,760
Okay.

477
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,360
Why are you here?

478
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,560
I'll get you a taxi.

479
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,360
I can walk anywhere.

480
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,360
Let me see the photo of Hua Hua first.

481
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,560
Come on.

482
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,160
When we were young.

483
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,760
She had big eyes when she was a kid.

484
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,360
She's so cute.

485
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,160
I like this one the most.

486
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,960
Look, she's even crying.

487
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,360
She's crying so cute.

488
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,160
You should leave as soon as possible.

489
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,160
Don't worry.

490
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,760
I don't remember anything when I go out.

491
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,760
Hua Hua.

492
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,560
You can't talk to a girl like that.

493
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,360
Be gentle.

494
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,760
Smile.

495
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,360
I'm used to it.

496
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,960
When she was teaching me,

497
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,160
she was also moving her face.

498
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,760
Her expression is too serious now.

499
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,960
She doesn't like to smile.

500
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,560
Let's go here.

501
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,400
The day he reported to the University of Jinghai,

502
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,760
his father and I went with him.

503
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,360
This family is so happy.

504
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,360
We have nothing else. It's just a family harmony.

505
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,760
Let me get you some food.

506
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,960
This is...

507
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,760
Limited edition.

508
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,160
Yes.

509
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,360
Limited edition.

510
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,160
Yes.

511
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,960
What are you filming?

512
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,960
Nothing. I'm just following the light.

513
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,960
By the way, Brother Lin.

514
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,960
We're going to the military camp for graduation.

515
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,960
Do you want to come with us?

516
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,960
I don't think I have time.

517
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,760
I think you should learn to relax.

518
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,760
Look at your face.

519
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,560
You have to go home.

520
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,560
I have to act with them.

521
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,560
Why don't you act with them?

522
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,160
Brother Lin, let me take a picture for you.

523
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,160
What picture?

524
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,960
I've seen so many pictures of you.

525
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,160
They're all with a face.

526
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,560
Not a smile.

527
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,160
Let me take one for you.

528
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,360
Smile.

529
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,760
Three, two, one.

530
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,160
Eggplant.

531
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,760
Eggplant.

532
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,760
Can you smile less?

533
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,760
I might not like to smile.

534
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,760
Then don't blame me for being rude to you.

535
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,760
Eggplant, eggplant, eggplant, eggplant.

536
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,760
Enough.

537
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,760
Are you childish?

538
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,760
If you don't smile, I'll go to the supermarket

539
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,760
and buy you two drops of lychee.

540
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
What do you mean?

541
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,760
A red dust is not a smile.

542
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,760
No one knows what is coming.

543
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,760
Tea.

544
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,760
That's right.

545
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,760
Smile less.

546
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,760
Okay. Are you satisfied?

547
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,760
Let's go.

548
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,760
See? How beautiful you smile.

549
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,760
I'd rather know.

550
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,760
I'd rather know.

551
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,760
See? How beautiful I smile.

552
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,760
Say it.

553
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,760
Who did you go on a date with behind my back?

554
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,760
What date? I came back home.

555
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,760
I bought you medicine and temperature meter.

556
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,760
Go home?

557
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,760
If you go home,

558
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,760
you can write down the word.

559
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,760
Love or not, test your body temperature.

560
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,760
I'm almost recovered.

561
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,760
What medicine should I take?

562
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,760
Let me tell you.

563
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,760
I didn't expect that

564
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,760
the next industry exchange meeting

565
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,760
would be held in the same place.

566
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,760
I'm so worried.

567
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,760
I didn't expect that

568
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,760
the next industry exchange meeting

569
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,760
would be held in the same place.

570
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,760
All the guests are

571
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,760
famous and famous.

572
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,760
And the meeting place is

573
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,760
Junshan Hotel.

574
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,760
It's natural and elegant.

575
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,760
It's suitable for me to recover my body strength.

576
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,760
Wait. Junshan?

577
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,760
Yes.

578
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,760
You're worried?

579
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,760
No.

580
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,760
Lin.

581
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,760
Don't stand there and move around.

582
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,760
You'll get dizzy.

583
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,760
Let me see your temperature meter.

584
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,760
39 degrees.

585
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,760
You're a fireman.

586
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,760
You can't take medicine.

587
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,760
It's okay. I can stand.

588
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,760
You can't stand.

589
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,760
You must rest now.

590
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,760
Group.

591
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,760
Let's go.

592
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,760
Hong Mingzi.

593
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,760
Can you help me?

594
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,760
I'll help you.

595
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,760
Will you play the Chinese game?

596
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,760
I told you.

597
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,760
At critical time,

598
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,760
men are the best.

599
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,760
I'm coming.

600
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,760
Bro.

601
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,760
You're the last one.

602
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,760
I slept here last night.

603
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,760
I'll do it.

604
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,760
I'm so tired.

605
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,760
I've been busy with Xuejiao for a long time.

606
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,760
You can take it.

607
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,760
Don't let Xuejiao move.

608
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,760
Why are you wearing such a big bag?

609
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,760
You're wearing makeup.

610
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,760
I brought some food for Xuejiao.

611
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,760
I'm going to thank Xuejiao.

612
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,760
You can't close the car door.

613
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,760
Take this out.

614
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,760
What's wrong?

615
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,760
You hit me.

616
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,760
I'm drunk.

617
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,760
Are you okay?

618
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,760
Sorry.

619
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,760
Are you okay?

620
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,760
I'm fine.

621
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,760
Sorry.

622
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,760
I'm late.

623
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,760
You're here.

624
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,760
Give it to me.

625
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,760
I'm so drunk.

626
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,760
You've been waiting for a long time, haven't you?

627
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,760
No.

628
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,760
I'm just in time.

629
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,760
Wait.

630
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,760
Be careful.

631
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,760
Why did your brother bring her here?

632
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,760
She even asked him to go to the exam for the family court.

633
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,760
My suitcase is a little heavy.

634
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,760
There's a lot of stuff.

635
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,760
I need to help you.

636
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,760
It's okay.

637
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,760
It's a little short.

638
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,760
I'll go with you.

639
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,760
You go first.

640
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,760
I'll go with you.

641
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,760
Why do you care so much?

642
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,760
Thank you.

643
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,760
You go up there.

644
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,760
My bag is so big.

645
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,760
Come on.

646
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,760
Go away.

647
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,760
Go away.

648
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,760

651
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
Hello, I am of Jinghai University's

652
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
Overseas Institute of Engineering and Engineering.

653
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,760
I'd like to know about our recent projects.

654
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,760
Hello, I am of Jinghai University's

655
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,360
I'm from the U.S. University of the Sea.

656
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,600
I'm from the U.S. University of the Sea.

657
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,120
Hello.

658
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,440
This is the industry exchange meeting.

659
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,680
You're not allowed to sell insurance.

660
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,480
I'm not selling insurance.

661
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,680
I'm from the University of the Sea.

662
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,120
You can't sell it to any university.

663
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,920
I'm sorry.

664
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,160
I'm not allowed to sell it.

665
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,360
Okay, I'm sorry.

666
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,560
Hello.

I'm from the University of the Sea.

669
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,160
Can you give me five minutes

670
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:33,920
to introduce

671
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,160
our latest research results?

672
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,760
I'm sorry.

673
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,840
I don't know the technology.

674
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,040
Just tell me

675
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,600
how much is the investment return?

676
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,880
You're so right.

677
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,920
Our investment return is

678
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,000
about...

679
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,440
Our asset.

680
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,240
This is my business card.

681
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,000
You can keep it.

682
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,440
Thank you.

683
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,760
Yu, why aren't you here yet?

684
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,120
You're finally here.

685
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,880
Come on, friends.

686
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,720
I'm so happy.

687
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,400
Xi Lei.

688
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,120
You're so great.

689
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,800
Coming.

690
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,240
So great.

691
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,040
So great.

692
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,520
Come on.

693
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,080
Look.

694
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,720
Do you have a camera?

695
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,640
Of course.

696
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,880
Remember to keep your eyes on

697
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,200
when you take pictures.

698
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,160
Xi Lei.

699
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,080
You even have a camera.

700
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,120
Yes, of course.

701
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,640
You're so great.

702
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,520
How about

703
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,600
taking a picture together?

704
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,560
To commemorate our senior year.

705
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:35,760
Okay.

706
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,280
Let's go.

707
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,000
To your senior year.

708
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:38,800
Let's go.

709
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,560
Let's go.

710
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,280
Your rolling.

711
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,320
My classmates and I

712
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,360
are playing at summer vacation.

713
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,320
You're so lucky.

714
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,520
Did you hear that?

715
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:54,760
Take a picture.

716
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,480
Come on.

717
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,520
Xi Lei, come closer.

718
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,360
Stand in a good position.

719
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,120
Ten seconds.

720
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,400
Are you happy?

721
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,640
Yes.

722
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,960
What are you looking at?

723
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,720
Nothing.

724
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,640
How is it?

725
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,840
Our people in Jinghai

726
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,960
are still not blind enough.

727
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,040
You're so blind.

728
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,080
You're so stupid.

729
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,120
You're so stupid.

730
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,120
You're so stupid.

731
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,120
You're so stupid.

732
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,120
You're so stupid.

733
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,040
I've been there for a long time.

734
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,120
I've been there for a long time.

735
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,560
I have this business card.

736
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,880
Military Industrial Working Οt 촬영.

737
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,680
Do you know it, Mr. czasie?

738
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,680
I heard about it.

739
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,000
Return home as soon as possible.

740
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,920
Mr. Wireless TV.

741
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,360
That's the Пом använd w ISA.

742
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,440
He's so술.

743
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,440
Thanks a lot.

744
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,800
It's good that our company can be liked by him.

745
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,120
We've been working hard.

746
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,400
Thank you.

747
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,800
I'll say it again.

748
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,920
What BNC is looking for

749
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,760
is a more advanced

750
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,280
and innovative partner.

751
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,240
But I believe that BNC

752
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,160
is definitely not a company

753
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,120
that only focuses on

754
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,040
technology.

755
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,920
Right, Dr. Cai?

756
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,000
I think

757
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,080
unmanned driving

758
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,760
is not only about breaking the technical barrier,

759
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,280
but also involves a lot of

760
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,640
social and legal issues.

761
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,880
We need to consider these

762
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,880
while solving the technical problem.

763
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:37,680
Good.

764
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,800
Go further.

765
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,600
The new Xiyi system

766
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,320
developed by our lab

767
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,440
allows cars to collect environmental data

768
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,840
from cameras

769
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,440
and other sensors.

770
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,040
We also started to try to

771
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,840
let machines

772
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,360
learn how to complete tasks

773
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,440
that are as excellent as humans.

774
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,360
Good.

775
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,240
This is my business card.

776
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,040
Thank you.

777
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,080
If you have time,

778
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,680
you can come down and talk alone.

779
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,440
Thank you, everybody.

780
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,600
Good.

781
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,120
This is so fun.

782
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:27,920
Wait a minute.

783
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,440
Let you try my craft.

784
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,440
I'll wrap it up.

785
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,200
I'll wrap it up.

786
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,000
I'll wrap it up.

787
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,560
I'll never forget

788
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,880
what you've eaten.

789
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,200
I'm the chef today.

790
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,200
Nobody wants to steal my food.

791
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,640
Stop bragging.

792
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,240
I'm the official apprentice

793
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,240
of the dessert shop.

794
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,440
You can compete with me?

795
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,560
You made all these?

796
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,080
Yes.

797
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,200
That's amazing.

798
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,800
You made this?

799
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,320
Yes.

800
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:48,960
Is it nice?

801
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,720
You made it yourself?

802
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,600
It looks like we're right.

803
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,600
Yuzu,

804
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,600
you see the الا

805
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,280
that pukaه

806
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:04,560
near the campsite?

807
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:07,480
Good.

808
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,600
You can go there

809
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,080
and step on thesmall one.

810
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,520
Is there a technical problem there?

811
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,360
Can you move forward a bit?

812
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,120
A little height can get hurt!

813
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,500
You, move forward!

814
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,780
Come on, Xiao Qing Zhou!

815
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,580
Great idea, similar to Nasty Rice Cakes!

816
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,720
Senior Lin!

817
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,760
Hello, Senior.

818
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,640
Morning, Senior.

819
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,480
It's beautiful here.

820
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,080
Oh my gosh!

821
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,120
Seriously?

822
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:25,560
Senior Lin,

823
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,480
good morning.

824
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,240
Good morning.

825
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,080
You two are quite good.

826
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,520
Brother Ling, why are you here?

827
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,640
I...

828
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,560
I have a school-study exchange nearby.

829
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,560
And the hotel is right next to it.

830
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,560
What a coincidence.

831
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,560
Let's go together.

832
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,560
Okay.

833
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,120
Good job.

834
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,560
Sister, let's go.

835
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,240
I've been working hard with your dad all day.

836
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,240
I'm so tired.

837
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,520
I hope you can fix it.

838
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,680
Help me to get a few more cars.

839
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,680
Okay.

840
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,760
Welcome, Brother Ling.

841
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,760
Why are you...

842
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,840
It's not good.

843
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,840
It's interesting.

844
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,840
Fix that.

845
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,840
Brother Ling, I'm here to get a few more cars.

846
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,960
You'll walk over there later.

847
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,320
And step on the ground on purpose.

848
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,120
Get up.

849
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,760
I'm going to do it too?

850
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,240
What about this?

851
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,640
This...

852
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,640
It's a mask.

853
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,640
I'll give you a mask.

854
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,840
Look carefully.

855
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,640
This is a perfect picture.

856
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,240
When your parents left,

857
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,440
the documents were here.

858
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,640
I'll leave after I get them.

859
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,040
I won't touch anything.

860
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,240
Okay.

861
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,240
Look.

862
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,240
This is it.

863
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,840
Hua Hua.

864
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,040
You'd better be training me to raise a dog.

865
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,640
I might run into a thief.

866
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,040
By the way,

867
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,440
a classmate of mine has a fever.

868
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,040
She's afraid that she'll infect her classmate.

869
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,640
She's quarantined at my house.

870
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,040
Go inside and put on a mask.

871
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,840
Classmate?

872
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,040
Hello.

873
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,240
Did I just...

874
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,640
ife?

875
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,840
I'm so tired.

876
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,200
Come on.

877
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,240
It's hot.

878
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:30,960
It looks so delicious.

879
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,440
Be careful.

880
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:31,800
Come on.

881
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,440
Turn around.

882
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,200
One more.

883
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,840
It's true that people rely on a horse.

884
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,680
Brother Lian looks more handsome in this.

885
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,920
Just like a devil.

886
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,520
Try it.

887
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:56,960
Am I good?

888
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,480
Yes.

889
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,640
Just hang the rope and light it.

890
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,600
Let me help you.

891
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,560
Are you ready?

892
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,080
Light it.

893
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,880
Okay.

894
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,720
Let me help you.

895
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,920
Be careful of the fire alarm.

896
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,120
Here's your food.

897
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,920
Almost done.

898
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,920
分点好了

899
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,640
I'm coming.

900
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,920
I called the police.

901
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,720
It's so good.

902
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,720
Senior, there's a guest in the room.

903
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,720
When will you come back?

904
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,720
Except for Dr. Cai from BNC,

905
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,720
the other investors are not going to be contacted.

906
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,720
The news spread quickly in the investment circle.

907
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,720
Let's stabilize BNC first.

908
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,720
Are you sure?

909
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,720
I'm sure.

910
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,720
BNC is very impressed with our project.

911
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,720
I know it.

912
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,720
Okay, I got it.

913
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,720
Didn't you tell me last time

914
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,720
that you care about the investment return ratio?

915
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,720
Yes.

916
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,720
My teacher just sent me the calculation formula.

917
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,720
How about this?

918
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,720
You go back first.

919
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,720
Then I'll contact you when I'm done.

920
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,720
Okay.

921
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,720
Okay, come on, I'll send you.

922
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,720
Come on, come on, have a try.

923
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,720
It's unforgettable.

924
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,720
I'm afraid you're talented in cooking.

925
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,720
Of course.

926
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,720
I'll make it clear to you.

927
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,720
Where's Guo Xueqiao?

928
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,720
She went to the bathroom.

929
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,720
Zhou Shunyun went there too.

930
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,720
I wonder if they met each other.

931
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,720
They're going to change the route.

932
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,720
Did they bring an umbrella?

933
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,720
Central TV station today

934
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,720
issued a warning to the city

935
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,720
to protect the city from the strong wind.

936
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,720
Yellow raincoat and blue raincoat.

937
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,720
The city is now under the strong wind

938
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,720
and ice.

939
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,720
Xueqiao.

940
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,720
You really applied for Jinhai University?

941
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,720
I've paid the application form.

942
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,720
How can I be fake?

943
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,720
You can't get the score line

944
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,720
of Jinhai University.

945
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,720
You're just mad at me.

946
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,720
What if you can't get the score line

947
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,720
of Jinhai University

948
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,720
and you're tied down?

949
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,720
It's not worth it.

950
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,720
I'm not.

951
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,720
I'm not.

952
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,720
I'm not.

953
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,720
I'm not.

954
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,720
I'm not.

955
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,720
I'm not.

956
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,720
I'm not.

957
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,720
I'm not.

958
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,720
I'm not.

959
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,720
In order to piss you off,

960
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,720
you've misunderstood me.

961
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,720
I've never

962
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,720
put you in my shoes.

963
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,720
Do you know why?

964
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,720
Because

965
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,720
I'm not good at it.

966
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,720
I can't see the villain.

967
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,720
I'm not done yet.

968
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,720
Let go.

969
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,720
You did it on purpose.

970
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,720
You went to my house last time

971
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,720
and did it on purpose.

972
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,720
You're only 679 cm.

973
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,720
Is there anyone so disgusting?

974
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,720
Do you know how many days

975
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,720
my mom has been locked up because of this?

976
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,720
What kind of person are you?

977
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,720
What does it look like to see the world?

978
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,720
Secondly,

979
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,720
your mom is the one who locked you up.

980
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,720
You shouldn't be angry with me.

981
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,720
I didn't figure out who I should fight against.

982
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,720
I'm not weak.

983
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,720
I'm just stupid.

984
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,720
Gu Xue Jiao!

985
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,720
I'm leaving.

986
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,720
You should think about it.

987
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,720
It's not this way.

988
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,720
It's wrong.

989
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,720
Well...

990
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,720
I'm not good at it.

991
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,720
I can't see the villain.

992
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,720
I didn't figure out who I should fight against.

993
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,720
I'm not weak.

994
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,720
I'm just stupid.

995
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,720
The room is dark.

996
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,720
Light a lamp.

997
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,720
Be careful.

998
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,720
There won't be

999
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,720
any empty voices.

1000
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,720
Break up memories.

1001
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,720
Each line is a wrong path.

1002
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,720
We are thinking

1003
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,720
about getting closer to each other.

1004
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,720
Let fate

1005
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,720
give us all the courage.

1006
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:01,720
I'm willing to travel with you through time.

1007
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,720
If you

1008
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,720
understand the secrets in my eyes,

1009
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:15,720
you will find that you are always in my heart.

1010
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:25,720
I try to open my arms

1011
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,720
because I'm sure

1012
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,720
I'm waiting for you at the peak.

1013
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:39,720
It doesn't matter if the wind blows.

1014
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,720
There is a sound close to me.

1015
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,720
I know it must be

1016
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,720
you.

1017
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:02,720
I try to open my arms

1018
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,720
because I'm sure

1019
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,720
I'm waiting for you at the peak.

1020
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:16,720
It doesn't matter if the wind blows.

1021
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,720
There is a sound close to me.

1022
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,720
I know it must be

1023
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,720
you.
