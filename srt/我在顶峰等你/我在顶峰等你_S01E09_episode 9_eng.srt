18
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,000
   

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
   

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,880
 Maybe we should just skip this meal. 

21
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,030
 The college entrance exam has just finished, 

22
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,190
 it's a critical time to choose schools. 

23
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,090
 Isn't this adding more pressure on the kids? 

24
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,440
But they're already here.

25
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,270
Sister Li has been sighing and worrying these past few days.

26
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,390
And she won't tell me anything.

27
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:59,520
So I thought, why not invite her whole family over?

28
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,910
- And let's see... 
 - There's a mosquito.

29
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,520
What's their real deal?

30
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,520
Our Shiyun did well on the exam, and she's not stressed.

31
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,750
There's no need to rush back.

32
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,200
They're not really important guests.

33
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,870
I won't say any more.

34
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,546
Sorry about that. My husband has a meeting, so he can't make it back.

35
00:02:18,546 --> 00:02:22,540
He asked me to take good care of you guys.

36
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,640
Look, our kids have been working so hard for the exam.

37
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,390
We should properly reward them.

38
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,150
- Yes, yes. 
 - Come on, everyone, dig in.

39
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,270
I specially ordered these dishes from a big restaurant.

40
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:38,440
Try this boiled cabbage soup. It's their signature dish.

41
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,130
I didn't want to trouble Sister Li with all this.

42
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,270
Shiyun.

43
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,800
Thanks.

44
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,150
Where's your soup spoon?

45
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,110
Sister Li.

46
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,690
I-I'll go and get it.

47
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,760
Auntie Wanjun, this boiled cabbage soup

48
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,830
should have a rich, flavorful broth,

49
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,920
and should taste fresh and light, but not oily or greasy at all.

50
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,670
But look at this one, there's a layer of fat on top.

51
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,760
It's obviously not made from fresh broth.

52
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,920
What kind of big restaurant is this?

53
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,080
Even my mom's soup tastes better than this.

54
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,640
- Right, Dad? 
 - Exactly.

55
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,040
Did you get ripped off?

56
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,820
Sister Li, take this dish away.

57
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,050
- Okay. 
 - I'll do it.

58
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,710
Xuejiao, how did you do on the exam?

59
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,486
 So that's what this is really about. 

60
00:03:28,486 --> 00:03:29,710
Not great.

61
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,920
I missed the cut by a dozen points.

62
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,520
That's such a shame!

63
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,270
Missing the first-tier cut-off by just a bit is the worst.

64
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,830
You can't get into a good second-tier university,

65
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,270
but a bad one doesn't feel worth it either.

66
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,200
What a pity.

67
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,080
But you could always choose a decent third-tier university.

68
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,590
Shiyun, give Xuejiao some advice.

69
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,430
After all, choosing a college is no small matter.

70
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,830
No problem.

71
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:57,080
- Xuejiao is... 
 - This time, my husband paid good money

72
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,480
to hire a college application consultant.

73
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,520
And we settled on Polytechnic University.

74
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,320
It felt like a huge weight was off my chest.

75
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,890
You know, the college entrance exam is one of life's most important decisions.

76
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,640
- It's better to play it safe, right? 
 - Right.

77
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,580
Xuejiao, are there any third-tier schools you're interested in?

78
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:23,100
Actually, I'm a dozen points short of Jinghai University's usual cutoff.

79
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,900
600 something?

80
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,490
 679. 

81
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,120
Shiyun, you must've done better than my sister.

82
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,300
- By how much? 
 - Yes.

83
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,980
By...

84
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,340
Mom, I'll go change my clothes.

85
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,030
You're such a disappointment.

86
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,320
I worked so hard to raise you all these years,

87
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,640
and you can't even score higher than her.

88
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,520
The only thing you can be thankful for now

89
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,590
is that with her score, she certainly won't get into Jinghai University.

90
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,030
And their family's flat broke,

91
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,370
so I'm sure they can't afford to let her repeat senior year.

92
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,270
Why are you hiding here?

93
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,710
Everyone disappeared. How could I eat all alone?

94
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,390
You were clearly enjoying your food.

95
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:26,130
I just couldn't stand sitting at that table anymore.

96
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,440
Didn't you notice?

97
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,300
It felt like Auntie Wanjun was just trying to compete with us today.

98
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,640
Brother, you're only realizing that now?

99
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,830
Aren't you a bit slow to catch on?

100
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,340
But why?

101
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,220
They live in a big fancy villa.

102
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,200
Why does she want to compare it to our tiny, shabby house?

103
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,760
You have no idea, don't you?

104
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,020
Our mom was amazing when she was young.

105
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,080
Auntie Wanjun was nowhere near her level.

106
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,590
She may have a comfortable life now,

107
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,000
but deep down, she's still insecure.

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,080
Some people just never grow out of their mean-girl phase.

109
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,270
No way.

110
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,200
If Mom was really that awesome back then,

111
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,880
how did she end up marrying Dad?

112
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,300
Mom clearly had bad judgment.

113
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,880
And now, that problem has been passed down to you.

114
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,030
You are even worse.

115
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,150
Bad judgment?

116
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,440
My judgment is better than yours.

117
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,490
You're just jealous of me, aren't you?

118
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,680
Shiyun.

119
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,030
You look even better in this outfit.

120
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,080
Thanks.

121
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,350
Sister Li, why didn't you stop Xuejiao?

122
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,990
There's no way she's getting into Jinghai University with that score.

123
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,810
What a waste of such a good score.

124
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,790
That girl's stubborn like a mule.

125
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,960
We just hope Yunyun can grow in a well-rounded way.

126
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,080
We don't count on her to support us in the future.

127
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,350
She applied to Polytechnic University out of personal interest.

128
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:53,080
We don't really expect her to raise the whole family.

129
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,590
It was my own decision.

130
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,880
My parents didn't say a word.

131
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,520
Then can we make changes to our application?

132
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,640
Of course not.

133
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,640
It's already submitted.

134
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,640
T-Then, what should we do?

135
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,680
It's too late.

136
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,200
What now?

137
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,150
Put down your phone, this is serious.

138
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,470
She can always repeat the year and score higher next year.

139
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,960
Xuejiao,

140
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,572
if you fail this time,

141
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:19,080
how many times have you two siblings taken the exam?

142
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,000
Aren't you just adding more burden to the family?

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,200
It's not necessarily impossible, right?

144
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,640
Sister Li, don't worry about money.

145
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,520
I'll help however I can.

146
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,290
Tell you what, I'll ask my husband to give you a raise.

147
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,030
- No— 
 - I'll call him right now.

148
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,580
- My phone. Where's my phone? 
 - How can I ask for that?

149
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,610
- Wait. 
 - That's not necessary.

150
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,080
- It really isn't necessary. 
 - Yes, that really isn't necessary.

151
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,520
After all, my mom might not be able to work for you anymore.

152
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,220
Auntie Wanjun.

153
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,520
 Three, two, one. 

154
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,760
 Recently, the former Jinghai mobile phone factory's 

155
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,470
 employee housing complex celebrated its demolition and relocation. 

156
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:03,710
 The local government is offering subsidies for housing, education, and more. 

157
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,250
 - So the residents can...  
- Demolition?

158
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,470
We're on TV!

159
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,160
 This area carried many people's memories... 

160
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,977
I got a digital copy of the demolition compensation agreement. Look.

161
00:08:13,977 --> 00:08:16,200
 - But as time passed...  
 - Compensation for seven apartments.

162
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,350
Didn't the agreement say eight?

163
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,390
Wait, how many is it exactly?

164
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,790
I forgot to count that commercial unit.

165
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,320
- Yes, yes. 
 - Quick, the commercial unit.

166
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,010
Let your mom see.

167
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,910
It's really eight!

168
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,350
Eight!

169
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,830
We're going to be rich now.

170
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,410
Amazing! Eight of them!

171
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:36,350
Sorry, Auntie Wanjun, you might need to find another housekeeper.

172
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,440
My mom will be busy collecting monthly rent from now on.

173
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,920
What are you saying, kid?

174
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,870
Xuejiao and I are rich kids now.

175
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:48,100
- Cut it out. 
 - Go get a big bag for your mom to use to collect rent.

176
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,010
Here it is.

177
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,630
This is our house. See?

178
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,560
It's old housing being demolished.

179
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,200
We can choose to return to the original site in three years.

180
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,680
That sounds great.

181
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,200
That's awesome.

182
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,940
Once we move back,

183
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,160
we can live with my old buddies from the factory again.

184
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,040
We can hang out from time to time.

185
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,510
We could choose the relocation housing on the outskirts of the east side of the city.

186
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,590
The east side is nice.

187
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:15,350
The economy is good there. Everyone's busy, so there are tons of demand for housekeeping.

188
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,590
Okay, okay. Then let's look there.

189
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,040
Dad. Mom. Listen to me. We can pick the west side, too.

190
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,040
Shiyun's chosen university is also around there.

191
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,470
That whole area has a rich academic atmosphere.

192
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,230
I like an academic atmosphere.

193
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,110
That kind of environment rubs off on you.

194
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,732
But you...

195
00:09:33,732 --> 00:09:34,990
Nothing's rubbing off on him.

196
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,710
You're a blank sheet of paper.

197
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,710
- Mom. 
 - Just stay this way.

198
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,560
He's not a blank sheet of paper.

199
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,870
Then what is he?

200
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,580
He's a balloon bomb.

201
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,490
He's full of hot air.

202
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,010
Then let's...

203
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,920
Let's pick the north side.

204
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,110
That's a barren wasteland.

205
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,200
Why pick there?

206
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,830
That area is the focus of our city's ten-year development plan.

207
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,510
It'll be transformed into the next Central Business District,

208
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:11,040
attracting major internet companies, and will be full of landmark buildings.

209
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,990
Those companies might be nothing now,

210
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,160
but they're all future giants.

211
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:23,120
We have to look to the future, and this is the future.

212
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,680
   

213
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:33,731
Let me see what the north side looks like.

214
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,890
Dad, you'll be driving Mom all around to collect rent.

215
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,080
What about me?

216
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,200
You?

217
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,510
Just stay in the west side, and soak in the academic atmosphere.

218
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,590
You can't get used to the smell of money anyway.

219
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:59,140
Xuejiao, is this also based on Xiao Lin's algorithm model?

220
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,840
Yes.

221
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,192
That's impressive.

222
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:07,710
Then ask him to calculate when Mingze will develop a brain.

223
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,750
- Be careful not to ruin the model.
 - That's a tough one.

224
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,800
- The north side is that great? 
 - You can't see it now.

225
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,160
There's nothing there right now.

226
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,870
But in ten years. Can you imagine?

227
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,580
This area...

228
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,230
Here are fresh-off-the-press promotional materials.

229
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,590
We're going to shine bright 
    

230
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,440
at the industry conference.

231
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,280
Wear something nice. We should do some networking.

232
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,630
But that kind of socializing is pointless.

233
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,750
I think you can handle it on your own.

234
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,510
I feel nervous going without you.

235
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,990
Then should we let Lin Jiadong go instead?

236
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,960
I'm fine. It's just the flu.

237
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,920
I'll be good after a nap.

238
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,920
   

239
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,680
- Hello? 
  - Hey, cousin. 

240
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,870
 - Please help!  
 - I told you I'm not coming back.

241
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,160
 Come on. 

242
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,160
 If not for your Mom or Dad, do it for me. 

243
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,630
 Just help keep the peace for a bit, okay? 

244
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,200
It's not like you don't know.

245
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,750
I might be part of your dad's camp,

246
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,400
but I'm basically standing on your mom's side.

247
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,080
If they have a falling out, I'll be the first casualty.

248
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,800
 I really don't know what else to do— 

249
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,400
Hello? Petal?

250
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,800
Hello?

251
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,350
Cold-blooded.

252
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,750
Who was it?

253
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,470
She...

254
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,630
Worry about yourself first.

255
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,450
Remember to take your medicine.

256
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,800
When are the results coming out?

257
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,223
   

258
00:12:58,223 --> 00:12:59,780
   

259
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,110
Hello, Tiantian?

260
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,350
 Xuejiao. 

261
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,350
 I just uncovered Senior Brother Lin's big secret. 

262
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,160
 Senior Brother Lin's big secret? 

263
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,000
Hold on.

264
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,680
Here's what happened.

265
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,590
I was browsing online at home yesterday.

266
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,990
Guess what I found?

267
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,560
I saw that a super fancy dessert shop just opened in Jinghai.

268
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,590
So, I went to check it out.

269
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,990
And guess what I found out after?

270
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,400
 It was really delicious. 

271
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,978
 But I also felt like my skills were totally on par. 

272
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,581
So, I made a decision. Forget the college entrance exam.

273
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:39,080
I want to become an amazing pastry chef.

274
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,990
Stop! Tiantian.

275
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,920
- First, congrats, you found your true passion. 
 - Thanks.

276
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,960
But what's this got to do with Senior Brother Lin's secret?

277
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,470
About Senior Brother Lin.

278
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:56,650
When I was at that dessert shop, I saw him getting into a rich lady's car.

279
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,630
Rich lady?

280
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,750
Are you sure?

281
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,200
I followed them all the way.

282
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,350
I'm 100% sure.

283
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,400
 And I'm not near-sighted. 

284
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,990
What if they're just friends?

285
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,200
But she put her arms around him.

286
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,250
 How can they be just friends? 

287
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,920
Oh, no.

288
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,230
What's wrong?

289
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,680
The man of the house is back!

290
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,860
The... what?

291
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,060
What's going on?

292
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,110
 - I'm leaving you!  
 - They're fighting!

293
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,410
Fight...

294
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,710
 Say something, would you? 

295
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,710
 We can talk, but don't break stuff. 

296
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,800
 Put that down. 

297
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,510
 Do you even know what that is? 

298
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,920
 That's very expensive! 

299
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,940
 That gives me more reason to break it! 

300
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,780
Xuejiao, come here.

301
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,380
What's going on? Which house?

302
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,960
That one?

303
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,800
I'm telling you, I didn't get it wrong.

304
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,320
6'1, long legs, pale skin, curling his lip,

305
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,830
wearing glasses, and with serious husband vibes.

306
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,710
And turns out he's also a gold-digger!

307
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:25,280
You might as well say his name.

308
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,320
Are you really sure it's him?

309
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,700
Look.

310
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,960
It's definitely him.

311
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,650
You're right.

312
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,320
 If you have anything else to say, say it now 

313
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,200
before our son comes down.

314
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,710
I just hate your problem of smashing things!

315
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,200
You're so ignorant.

316
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,280
I just bought this pair of beautiful porcelain pieces.

317
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,560
Now that you broke one, the set's ruined! Don't you know that?

318
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,110
But this is marital property, so I'm entitled to half.

319
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,350
Just think that I smashed my half.

320
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,440
Fine. You want half, do you?

321
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,100
I'll give you your half.

322
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,740
- What are you doing? 
 - You said half.

323
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,800
- Put it down. Don't you dare! 
 - Your half, my half!

324
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,870
Your half, my half!

325
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,960
Your half, my half!

326
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,200
Your half, my half!

327
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,280
My half, your half!

328
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,510
My half... You happy now?

329
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,010
You psycho!

330
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,612
I hope Senior Brother Lin doesn't get beaten to death.

331
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:20,510
I'll go check.

332
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,960
What?

333
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,100
I don't think it's a good idea.

334
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,200
Technically, it's Senior Brother Lin's fault.

335
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,440
If we show up now, they might think we're his backup.

336
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,800
They may beat us with him.

337
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,700
But we have to save him.

338
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,600
Sorry! I'm not his backup!

339
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,620
I'm not here to help him...

340
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,230
Senior Brother Lin?

341
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,920
What are you doing here?

342
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,460
I... Tiantian told me to come. She...

343
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,030
Where is she?

344
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:24,270
That's not important. I'm relieved to see you alive and well.

345
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,350
Let's go. It's dangerous here.

346
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,710
I live here.

347
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,490
Why is it dangerous?

348
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,290
You live here?

349
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,000
 How could you lie to me and run away? 

350
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,200
I'm sorry. Tiantian made a mistake.

351
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,120
I already gave her a warning.

352
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,240
Thanks for the cake.

353
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,810
Eat it and get going.

354
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,470
What's the rush?

355
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,390
We love it when Petal brings friends home.

356
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,840
You know, it's his first time bringing a friend over.

357
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,310
What do you like to eat?

358
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,160
I will have someone make us a feast,

359
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,460
and we can have dinner together. Okay?

360
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,920
Actually, we live overseas most of the time.

361
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,120
We're only here for a short while today.

362
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,000
And we've got something else to get to later.

363
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,400
Do you live far away?

364
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,160
I'll have Petal drive you home.

365
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,960
She's a student at No. 7 High School.

366
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,220
I've simply tutored her a few times.

367
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,366
Yes. I just finished my college entrance exam

368
00:18:43,366 --> 00:18:46,910
and just happened to bump into Senior Brother Lin today.

369
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,730
Intergenerational friendship.

370
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,470
She's only, what,

371
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,880
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 years younger than Petal, right?

372
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,200
Besides, he's got a baby face.

373
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,880
You could pass him off as a college freshman.

374
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,640
People would believe that.

375
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,080
Yes.

376
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,800
Tell me.

377
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,400
Which university are you applying to?

378
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,030
Jinghai University.

379
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,230
Really?

380
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,120
Jinghai University?

381
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,120
That's our Petal's school!

382
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,074
You'll be his junior then!

383
00:19:25,074 --> 00:19:26,672
Wait!

384
00:19:26,672 --> 00:19:28,972
Didn't we take a photo with Petal

385
00:19:28,972 --> 00:19:31,030
at the university's gate when we went to check in with him?

386
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,120
Yes.

387
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,600
Hubby, go and get the photo album.

388
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,440
- Go. 
 - Okay.

389
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,270
How did you get here?

390
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,840
I'll get you a taxi.

391
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,230
I'm fine with any way.

392
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:48,190
Let me just finish looking at Petal's photos.

393
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,720
Here.

394
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,200
Look.

395
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
That's him when he was younger.

396
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,230
He had such big eyes as a kid.

397
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,880
Isn't he cute?

398
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,070
This one is my favorite.

399
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,030
Look! He has tears on his face.

400
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,220
He was so adorable.

401
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,510
Just say you need to get somewhere.

402
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,710
Don't worry. I won't remember a thing once I leave here.

403
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,560
Petal.

404
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,470
You can't talk to a girl like that.

405
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,400
You have to be gentle and smile a little.

406
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,470
I'm used to it.

407
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,710
When he tutored me, he always had that straight face.

408
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:31,970
He's just too serious now, and he doesn't smile much.

409
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,400
It's this one.

410
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,680
It was from the day he enrolled in Jinghai University.

411
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,920
His dad and I, we went there with him.

412
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,550
Look at you three, what a happy family.

413
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,310
If there's one thing about our family,

414
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,550
it's that we're very close.

415
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,870
Yes.

416
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,900
I'll get you a tissue.

417
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,970
- This is... 
 - A limited edition.

418
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,310
Right.

419
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,510
A limited edition.

420
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,220
Yes.

421
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,200
- What are you taking a picture of? 
 - Nothing.

422
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,350
I hit the flash accidentally.

423
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:10,470
Oh, Senior Brother Lin, we're going camping at Mount Jun for our graduation trip.

424
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,350
Do you want to join us?

425
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:17,030
I probably won't be available then.

426
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:20,310
Honestly, you really should learn to relax a little.

427
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,120
You always look so serious.

428
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,200
And when you're home, you...

429
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,530
I have to play along with them.

430
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,120
Senior Brother Lin, let me take a picture of you.

431
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,180
Why all of a sudden?

432
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,990
You were frowning in every single photo of you I'd seen today.

433
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,400
You weren't smiling in a single one.

434
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,030
Let me take one for you.

435
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,270
Come on, smile.

436
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,550
Three, two, one.

437
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,920
Cheese.

438
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,430
Cheese.

439
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,180
Will a smile kill you?

440
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,920
Maybe I was born this way.

441
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,680
Well, then don't blame me for this.

442
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,600
Tickle, tickle!

443
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,560
Enough. You're so childish.

444
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,840
If you still don't smile, I'll go to the supermarket

445
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,200
and buy you two kilos of lychees.

446
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,080
What does that mean?

447
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,920
The imperial concubine smiled at a horse galloping through red dust.

448
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,360
No one knew it was

449
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,840
because of the Lin Zhi* it had brought. 
  (*Original name for lychee) 

450
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,120
Snap.

451
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,760
There you go. You look good when you smile.

452
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,040
- That's enough. Are you happy now? 
 - Yes.

453
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,710
Let's go.

454
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,840
See? Doesn't it look good?

455
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,120
The Lin Zhi it brought...

456
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,510
Lin Zhihua.

457
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,660
Look! I took a great shot.

458
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,940
   

459
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,440
Spill it.

460
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,440
Who did you go on a date with behind my back?

461
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,640
What date? I went home.

462
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,840
I got you some medicine and a thermometer.

463
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,120
Home?

464
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,440
If you really went home,

465
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,770
why do you look so love-struck?

466
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,320
It's up to you whether you want to believe me. Just take your temperature.

467
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,440
I'm already getting better.

468
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,260
I don't need medicine.

469
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:50,500
You know what, I'm so fired up thinking about the upcoming industry exchange meeting.

470
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,680
All the attendees are important people.

471
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,400
And the venue is the Mount Jun Hotel.

472
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,680
There's fresh air and elegant surroundings.

473
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,550
It's perfect for my recovery.

474
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,680
Wait, Mount Jun?

475
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,070
Yes.

476
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,520
Are you tempted?

477
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:11,310
Wait, Lao Lin. Stand still, stop moving.

478
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,510
You're making me dizzy.

479
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,190
Let me see the thermometer.

480
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:21,230
39 degrees? Your fever's making you dizzy.

481
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,450
I told you to take the medicine.

482
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,360
I'm fine. I can still fight.

483
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,960
Forget it. You need to rest now.

484
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,440
It's a group fight! Open the ultimate one!

485
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,600
Gu Mingze, can you give us a hand?

486
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,750
Push the tower! Push!

487
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,710
Do you even know how to play?

488
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:41,350
I'm telling you, men are totally unreliable in crucial moments like this.

489
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,850
- Exactly. 
 - I'm here.

490
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,360
Brother, how can you be late to the event you organized?

491
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,052
I stayed up late last night. Let me do it.

492
00:25:50,052 --> 00:25:52,600
I can't believe you! Xuejiao and I have been busy here for ages.

493
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,160
Then you take care of this.

494
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,600
Let Xuejiao take a break.

495
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,510
Why'd you bring such a huge bag? Is it your makeup kit?

496
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,420
It's snacks I brought for Xuejiao.

497
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,310
I thank you on her behalf.

498
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,960
This won't do. The door won't shut.

499
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,460
- Take this out then. 
 - Take that out.

500
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,990
- What's wrong? 
 - It fell on my foot.

501
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,750
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm sorry.

502
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,790
Are you okay?

503
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,380
I'm fine.

504
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:20,080
Sorry, I'm late.

505
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,790
Shiyun, you're here.

506
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,310
Here, give me that.

507
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,600
I think I broke this bag.

508
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,200
- Have you been waiting long? 
 - No, you're right on time.

509
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,630
- Hey, wait. 
  - Be careful.

510
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,740
Why did your brother bring her here?

511
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,250
He even got a driver's license just for her.

512
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,710
My suitcase is a bit heavy.

513
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:03,990
There's a lot of stuff.

514
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,820
Do you need my help?

515
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,980
No.

516
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,250
It's a piece of cake.

517
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,240
Come here.

518
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,440
- Go and sit in the back. 
 - I called it first.

519
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,280
Why bother with all that?

520
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,850
- Thanks. 
 - Go over there.

521
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,180
I've got these two huge bags.

522
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,330
Let's go.

523
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,470
Hello, we're Jinghai University's Autonomous Driving Lab.

524
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,200
Would you like to know more?

525
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,070
Hello, I'm from Jinghai University's Autonomous Driving Lab.

526
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,000
This is our information.

527
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,880
Hello, I'm from Jinghai University's Autonomous Driving Lab.

528
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,360
Here are our latest projects.

529
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,310
Hello, I'm from Jinghai University's Autonomous Driving Lab.

530
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,640
Here are our latest projects.

531
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,470
Excuse me, this is an exchange meeting,

532
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,200
insurance sales aren't allowed.

533
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,510
I'm not selling insurance.

534
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,680
I'm from Jinghai University.

535
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,030
You can't sell here, no matter what university you're from.

536
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,310
Sorry, he's with me.

537
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,170
Okay, sorry about that.

538
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,030
Hello.

539
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,360
- Hello. 
 - I'm from Jinghai University's Autonomous Driving Lab.

540
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,120
Can I have five minutes to briefly introduce our latest research results?

541
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,990
Sorry, I don't know technology.

542
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:41,550
Just tell me what the return is on investment.

543
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,990
You've asked the right person!

544
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:46,535
Our return on investment is about... is... is...

545
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,360
I'm still calculating.

546
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,470
Here's my business card.

547
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,750
Contact me when you're ready.

548
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,420
Thank you.

549
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,380
Tianyu, why aren't you here yet?

550
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,510
Finally!

551
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,160
Come on, friends!

552
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,920
The sky is so blue!

553
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,100
- Qi Lei! 
 - The clouds are so white!

554
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,780
- Coming! 
 - The grass is so green!

555
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,350
We're coming!

556
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,750
Look.

557
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,640
- You even brought a camera? 
 - Of course.

558
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,510
When we take photos later, remember to stand close to Gu Xuejiao.

559
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,990
Qi Lei, you even brought a camera?

560
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,920
Yes, of course.

561
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:35,130
How about we take a photo together to remember our senior year?

562
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,200
- Okay, let's go! 
 - And your second senior year.

563
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,380
- Let's go! 
 - Go, go, go.

564
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,840
My classmates and I have been playing your Roller Blast all summer.

565
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,550
Shiyun knows what's good.

566
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,160
Did you hear that?

567
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,350
- Take the photo. 
 - All right. Qi Lei, step into the frame a bit more.

568
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,270
Get your pose ready.

569
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,870
Ten seconds.

570
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,920
Are you happy?

571
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,090
I'm happy!

572
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,800
   

573
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:24,200
   

574
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,880
Grandmaster, what are you looking at?

575
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,600
Nothing.

576
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,640
How's it going?

577
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,160
It seems like our Jinghai University is not famous enough.

578
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,200
They all ignored me.

579
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,440
I was in there for half a day,

580
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,570
but I only got this one business card.

581
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,230
   

582
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,200
Junlian Investment?

583
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,310
You know them?

584
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,050
I've heard of them.

585
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,550
 Hello, Dr. Cai. 

586
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,550
We'd also like to work with you.

587
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,790
That's the chief technology officer of B&amp;C Motors.

588
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,400
He's a very impressive person.

589
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,910
Thank you.

590
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,880
If he could take an interest in our project,

591
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,640
we'd be set for good.

592
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,150
 Thank you. 

593
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,030
Once again, for the record, B&amp;C Motors is seeking

594
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:18,120
more advanced and innovative partners.

595
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,280
But I believe B&amp;C is not just a multinational company

596
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,070
focused solely on technology.

597
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,160
Right, Dr. Cai?

598
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,070
I think autonomous driving isn't only about overcoming technological barriers.

599
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,880
It also involves many social and legal issues.

600
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,030
We must also consider them while solving the technical problems.

601
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,790
Good.

602
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,690
I'd like to hear more.

603
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,400
Our lab has developed a brand-new C1 system,

604
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,990
which allows cars to collect data about their surroundings

605
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,960
through cameras and other sensors.

606
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,960
We've also started to teach the machines

607
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,320
how to perform tasks as well as humans do.

608
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,050
Good.

609
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,900
Here's my business card.

610
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,750
Thank you.

611
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:17,290
If you have time later, we can talk more in detail next time.

612
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,990
Thank you, everybody.

613
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,360
Go.

614
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,880
 Dr. Cai. 

615
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,480
This is great.

616
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,360
Later, I'll let you all taste my cooking.

617
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,750
I promise it'll be unforgettable.

618
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,030
I'm the head chef today.

619
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,230
No one's taking my place.

620
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,510
Cut the bragging.

621
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:41,230
I'm now an official apprentice at a dessert shop.

622
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,510
You can't compete with me.

623
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,070
- You made all these? 
 - Yes.

624
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,770
You're awesome.

625
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,460
- You made this? 
 - Yes. Do you like it?

626
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,480
You made this yourself?

627
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,420
I think I'm getting close to a win.

628
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:11,280
Tianyu, do you see that raised tent peg next to Gu Xuejiao?

629
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,670
Go over there later, and step on it on purpose.

630
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,160
Good idea.

631
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,230
Senior Brother Lin!

632
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,010
You came!

633
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,120
Why did he come here?

634
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,840
I have no idea.

635
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,160
Senior Brother Lin!

636
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,490
- Hello, Senior Brother. 
 - Good morning, Senior Brother!

637
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,160
This place is nice.

638
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,570
No.

639
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,360
Hello, Senior Brother.

640
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,220
Hello to you, too.

641
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,050
You two... look good.

642
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,240
Senior Brother Lin, why did you come here?

643
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,890
I...

644
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,110
I have an academic conference nearby,

645
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:49,240
and the resort hotel is just next door.

646
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,150
What a coincidence. Then you should join us.

647
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,580
- Okay. 
 - What?

648
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,760
Okay, good.

649
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,240
Join us. Let's go.

650
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,440
Yi Tianyu, fix that.

651
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,590
Help me grill a few more skewers.

652
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,930
Okay.

653
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,332
- Welcome, Senior Brother Lin! 
 - How did you...

654
00:35:04,332 --> 00:35:05,972
Okay, okay.

655
00:35:05,972 --> 00:35:07,720
- Seriously? 
 - That's interesting.

656
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,240
Fix that.

657
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,570
Senior Brother Lin, I also baked some small cakes.

658
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:16,770
 Go over there later, and step on it on purpose. 

659
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,570
Qi Lei!

660
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,430
I need to fix that, too?

661
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,400
What about this?

662
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,280
This... I'll do the grilling.

663
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,950
Let me help you grill.

664
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,960
Watch closely.

665
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,110
This is a single take.

666
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,280
Your parents left some papers here when they left.

667
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,470
I'll get them and go.

668
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,700
I definitely won't touch your stuff.

669
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,760
See? This is it.

670
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:25,920
 Petal, you better be keeping a dog in the guest room. 

671
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,930
 Otherwise, I might have just run into a thief. 

672
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:41,070
 Oh, right, a classmate of mine has a fever 

673
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:44,590
 and is isolating at my place to avoid infecting others. 

674
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,440
 Wear a mask when you go in. 

675
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,890
Classmate?

676
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:00,410
Am I seeing things?

677
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,190
Goddess.

678
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,190
Goddess.

679
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,950
Don't go.

680
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,840
Don't go.

681
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,190
Here, eat it while it's hot.

682
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,480
- It looks delicious! 
 - Be careful, it's hot.

683
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,442
Come on, dig in.

684
00:37:32,442 --> 00:37:34,260
- Dig in. 
 - Thanks.

685
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,440
Clothes really do make the man.

686
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,670
Senior Brother Lin looks even more handsome in this outfit.

687
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,680
He's just pretending.

688
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,390
Try it.

689
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,880
Aren't I good?

690
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,030
Yes.

691
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,990
We just need to hang the rope and the lights now.

692
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,490
I'll help you.

693
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,350
Here.

694
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,350
Are you done?

695
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,880
- Hang the light. 
 - Okay.

696
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,650
Here, let me.

697
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,530
Wrap it up! The skewers are ready.

698
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,550
Okay, coming.

699
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,710
I need to make a quick call.

700
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,170
It looks good.

701
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,690
 Senior Brother, we've got guests in our room. 

702
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,280
 When will you be back? 

703
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,280
Other than Dr. Cai from B&amp;C Motors, don't approach any other investors yet.

704
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,240
Word spreads fast among investors.

705
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,960
We'll secure B&amp;C first.

706
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,150
Are you sure?

707
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,280
Yes.

708
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,760
They're showing strong interest in our project.

709
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,590
- I know what I'm doing. 
  - All right, got it. 

710
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:27,650
You mentioned last time that return on investment matters most to you, right?

711
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:30,110
- Yes. 
 - My senior just sent me the formula.

712
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,240
How about this?

713
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,110
You head back first, and I'll reach out to you after I finish calculating.

714
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,160
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

715
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,890
Here, let me walk you out.

716
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:45,070
Come on, eat it while it's hot.

717
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:48,470
- Impressive! 
 - I think you've got real talent in cooking.

718
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:51,940
Of course. I got the seasoning just right.

719
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:54,630
- Where's Gu Xuejiao? 
 - She went to the restroom.

720
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,440
Zhou Shiyun went earlier, too.

721
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,280
I wonder if they ran into each other.

722
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,720
It's about to rain.

723
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,700
Did they bring umbrellas?

724
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,720
 This morning, the Central Meteorological Observatory continues to issue  

725
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,280
 a Yellow Alert for severe convective weather 

726
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,280
 and a Blue Alert for heavy rain, 

727
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,090
 accompanied by widespread short-term downpours, 

728
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:14,100
 thunderstorms, strong winds, or hail. 

729
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,590
Xuejiao.

730
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,720
Did you really apply to Jinghai University?

731
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,130
I've submitted my application.

732
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,320
Why would I lie?

733
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,800
There's no way you'll get in with your score.

734
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,110
You just want to anger me.

735
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:52,960
What if you don't make the cut-off and fail?

736
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,740
It's not worth it.

737
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,630
I did it to anger you?

738
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,360
You've misunderstood me.

739
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:06,550
I never even saw you as competition before.

740
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,400
Do you know why?

741
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,060
Because...

742
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,100
my eyesight's poor, and I can't see petty people.

743
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,500
I wasn't done talking.

744
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:21,840
Let go.

745
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,320
You did it on purpose, right?

746
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,400
Last time you came to my house, you just wanted to show off.

747
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,070
"Only scored 679?"

748
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,550
What's your problem?

749
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:32,710
Do you know how long my mom grounded me because of this?

750
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,200
The way you see the world reflects the kind of person you are.

751
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,090
Also, it was your mom who grounded you.

752
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,190
So don't take it out on me.

753
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:53,960
If you don't even know who you should rebel against,

754
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,810
you're either weak or stupid.

755
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,320
Gu Xuejiao!

756
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,160
I'm leaving. Take your time and think about that.

757
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:19,020
 Where is it? 

758
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,630
 It's not that way. 

759
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,340
 It's the wrong direction. 

760
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,472
That... That way...

761
00:42:39,472 --> 00:42:42,421
 My eyesight's poor, and I can't see petty people. 

762
00:42:42,421 --> 00:42:44,590
 If you don't even know who you should rebel against, 

763
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:47,130
 you're either weak or stupid. 

764
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:12,010
