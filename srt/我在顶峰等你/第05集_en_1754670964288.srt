1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Try to grow the flowers in the summer

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now tell the truth about life

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's not complicated to count the flowers

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The youth is swaying

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We are getting stronger

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My heart is still hot and boiling

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Follow the rhythm and release it gently

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The night wind is blowing, only the fireflies are in the way

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will fly with you bravely

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My love is still hot and boiling

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The bright and bright eyes

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let us cross the barrier of time

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 16

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You graduated?

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's fine if you graduated.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
By the way, which university are you going to study at?

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The University of Gallaudet, England.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The University of Gallaudet?

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The University of Gallaudet?

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The University of Gallaudet, New York.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Really?

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Then you can go back to your work.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Thank you.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Why is it all wet all over the place?

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I don't play this.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Run.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Little doll, you are very enthusiastic.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What am I doing here?

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes, I don't care about you.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You are busy.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What child is playing?

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let's go.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Let me help you take it off.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This is my protective suit.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What if the deputy director kills me and steals it?

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I found the most important person.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You should go.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I won't go, master.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I want to guard the beautiful Eyseras Continent with you.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I mean, you should go back.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I won't see me later.

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You have to teach me a lesson.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Then I'll go with master.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
If you keep being so careless, I'll call the parents.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
How many parents do you have?

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I...

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'll call the parents.

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
How many parents do you have?

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I...

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
No, no, no.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'll go back after I finish eating.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Master.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Master.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll call you master later.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'll call you master.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Whatever you want to call me.

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Anyway, don't call me master.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Just call me master every day.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm starving.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You are dead.

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What?

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You...

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I...

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Stop.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Say it properly.

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Don't hit me.

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Li Shige, don't interfere with the family affairs.

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll beat you to death.

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You have to go home with me today.

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You hit me.

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Don't hit me.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Don't hit my master.

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Why are you here?

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You don't even have a formal employee number in the roll.

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Why are you so sad?

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You don't even write New Year's Day.

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I have a lot of big people in the New Year.

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't want to be angry with you.

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You can scold my master.

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But you can't scold roll.

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
No, I can't scold him.

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I've never seen a designer who knows more than him.

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But you scolded him like a dog.

90
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That's not true.

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Master also said that

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
he would put Gonggongle on the mobile phone.

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
By then, he must be more popular than this game.

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Don't give me a bad name.

95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Master, I've thought about it.

96
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'll change my name to Flag.

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Flag?

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Why does this name sound so familiar?

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Why are you laughing?

100
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You also think it's familiar?

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I just think it's quite important.

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And it goes well with the game name on the menu.

103
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The best designer of the Hangzhou Game Pagoda in 2023,

104
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
the owner of Flag.

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Now, the designer of the game Pagoda,

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Flag, is on stage to receive the award.

107
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
This kid used to be my apprentice.

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Gonggongle, mobile game?

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes, yes.

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Can you be more popular than this?

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Enough, stop bragging.

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Let's go home.

113
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I forgot how I covered for you before.

114
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You promised to repay me.

115
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Go back and report it.

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
If I'm afraid of you, I'll believe you.

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I don't know how to report.

118
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And you don't believe me.

119
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Gu Xuejiao, don't leave like this.

120
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm so nervous.

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Return it to me.

122
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What's going on?

123
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
See?

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The status of the owner of the game.

125
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Envy.

126
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm so nervous.

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I have to go back to sleep.

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll come back.

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Stop knocking.

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Xiao Wang,

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I went out after doing three sets of questions.

132
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Go back to sleep.

133
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's early in the morning.

134
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What are you doing?

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
We are...

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
practicing.

137
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yes, yes, yes.

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
New semester, new weather.

139
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Well,

140
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Brother Ling also said that

141
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
practicing in the morning is good for the brain.

142
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
He should practice more.

143
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Brother Ling is right.

144
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yes.

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
How can you practice in a sleeping clothes

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
and a jacket?

147
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Well,

148
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Guo Mingze said he was going out for a run.

149
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Okay, go.

150
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'll see you out.

151
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I just got up and ran.

152
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You want to kill me.

153
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's not the time for you to come back.

154
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Go out and sweat it out.

155
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Bye.

156
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Okay, okay, okay.

157
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Xue Jiang, be gentle.

158
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Don't get your waist wet.

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Come on, dad. Good night.

160
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's still late to get up in the morning.

161
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's still late to get up in the morning.

162
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
My good sister.

163
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You are so bad.

164
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
My name is so weak.

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Thank you for giving me such a good gift.

166
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The latest mobile phone.

167
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This is the return prize for the user of the stock exchange.

168
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Use it well.

169
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Thank you.

170
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's weird.

171
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
When did the stock exchange

172
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
be so generous to Jiucai?

173
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What's wrong?

174
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The exchange gave me a mobile phone

175
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
and was taken by Gu Mingze.

176
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Are you jealous?

177
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Not really.

178
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's just a mobile phone.

179
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
My goal is the star sea.

180
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You're going to be a good sister.

181
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Sit down.

182
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You made so many mistakes again.

183
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Hurry up and fix the wrong question.

185
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Today we are going to

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
implement the next stage of learning plan.

187
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
A, right?

188
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Gu Xuejiao.

189
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Your brother can do this question.

190
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I will help you plan the plan.

191
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The second one.

192
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Learn and use.

193
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Stabilize memory.

194
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Zhen Liu.

195
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Jiang Dongfeng.

196
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Jiang.

197
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Starch, sugar, high molecular composition.

198
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The molecule is a molecule chain

199
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
made up of N-glutamate, carbon dioxide, and oxygen.

200
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It can be converted into

201
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
sugar and oil.

202
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If you eat too much,

203
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
it can cause heart disease

204
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
and you will get fat.

205
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Then you eat this.

206
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Fruit sugar, single sugar.

207
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The molecule is the same as the grape sugar.

208
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Carbon dioxide, oxygen, hydrogen, and oxygen.

209
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
They are both a single molecule.

210
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
They are both in the same composition.

211
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's good for your brain.

212
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's good for your brain.

213
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Eat.

214
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
How do you know so much about health?

215
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
To make up for the society.

216
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You're so amazing.

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
If I memorize so much,

218
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
my brain will be blown up.

219
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Xuejiao.

220
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
There's food.

221
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Thank you.

222
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That's the last one.

223
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'll give it to you later.

224
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Why are they doing this?

225
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Go after them.

226
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You two wait for me.

227
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Don't run.

228
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Hello, Brother Lin.

229
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
When are we going to have a class tonight?

230
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
We can't.

231
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Gao Rui is awake.

232
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Gao.

233
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You're awake.

234
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You are...

235
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You don't recognize me?

236
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
We've got the wrong person.

237
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
We're leaving.

238
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
That's right.

239
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You're so serious.

240
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Why are you still so useless?

241
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Nurse.

242
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What's the second-degree disease after the operation?

243
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What should we pay attention to?

244
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
When can we leave the hospital?

245
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You just asked them to give you

246
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,360
a full set of post-op

247
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,000
and a personal protective treatment.

248
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Look at the nurse.

249
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
She's so polite.

250
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
How do you feel?

251
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm fine.

252
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I feel much better.

253
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
One, two, three,

254
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
two, three,

255
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
four, five, six, seven, eight.

256
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Please take care of yourself

257
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
and treat the hospital as your home.

258
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
They're all here to help the patients recover.

259
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
How can I treat the hospital as my home?

260
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I have to leave the hospital

261
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
and have a class with you.

262
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's a big mistake to leave the hospital.

263
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Brother Gao.

264
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Can you stay here for a while?

265
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I see.

266
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You're afraid that if I leave the hospital,

267
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
your senior won't be able to help you.

268
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
My big client is being robbed.

269
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Don't worry.

270
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm a student at times.

271
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
At most, I'm a potential client.

272
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Gu Mingze, the big client's main client,

273
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
will always be your exclusive delivery.

274
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Why?

275
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
After work today...

276
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You have an appointment?

277
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Who are you going to meet?

278
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Do I have to report to you?

279
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I want to go, too.

280
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Are you sure?

281
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yes.

282
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm going to have a family lesson.

283
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You should go, too.

284
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'll go.

285
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I want to do the physical training.

286
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Kill me.

287
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
To be honest,

288
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
are you afraid that I can't wake up,

289
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and I'll be sad and watch the TV at home every day?

290
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But you're running around the hospital every day.

291
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Do you have time to do experiments?

292
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Fried chicken?

293
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
This is for you.

294
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You just had the operation.

295
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's light.

296
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm celebrating my meal every day.

297
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I've been in the hospital for so long.

298
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Did you pay for the medical bills?

299
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Don't worry.

300
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
No one paid for the medical bills.

301
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I bought a lot of tickets.

302
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
No.

303
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I said your amount is a bit ridiculous.

304
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
With your face,

305
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I didn't convince you.

306
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I can't even stop you from eating.

307
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But seeing you so lively,

308
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm relieved.

309
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I have to go to school.

310
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'll see you tomorrow.

311
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
No, wait.

312
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You don't usually eat fried chicken.

313
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Who did you bring the fried chicken for?

314
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Your sister.

315
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Why should I have no treatment?

316
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Does she have?

317
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Did you secretly charge you?

318
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Shouldn't Lin Zhi Hua go to the lab?

319
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Gao Rui.

320
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Don't worry about the lab.

321
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
When you're recovered,

322
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
we'll all wait for you to come back.

323
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Is there Lin Zhi Hua among all of them?

324
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Professor Tan.

325
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Your researchers are almost gold medalists.

326
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Hello, Senior Gao.

327
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I just found out

328
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
that our mentor, Professor Tan,

329
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
thinks that Lin Zhi Hua is in a bad state.

330
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
He has been away from the lab for months.

331
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
But C1 is our hard work.

332
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Without C1, he can't make it.

333
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So I have to get him back to the lab now.

334
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Then you have to go to your professor.

335
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I don't know Professor Tan.

336
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Is this a bit of a burden?

337
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I know that you can convince him to be your tutor.

338
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Although I don't know how you did it,

339
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
but I believe you.

340
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You can definitely help me with this.

341
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Me?

342
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Now the truth is

343
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Professor Tan thinks that Lin Zhi Hua is in a bad state.

344
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
But now no one would want his students

345
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
to go back to the lab more than Professor Tan.

346
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
So we have to start from Lin Zhi Hua.

347
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Anyway, he's been feeling bad.

348
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
He's been feeling bad.

349
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Although he didn't say it,

350
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I know he's very responsible for this accident.

351
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Ten years later, Lin Zhi Hua didn't do technology,

352
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
but management.

353
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Could it be because of that accident?

354
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I have to make this world have one more technology genius

355
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and one less entrepreneur.

356
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I chose psychology in this class.

357
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I hope I can give you some inspiration.

358
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Just to solve the problem,

359
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
not to give the right way.

360
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's true that there is a difference between students and scholars.

361
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Brother Lei,

362
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I've been dreaming of going back to school to get the scholarship.

363
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I've been dreaming of going back to school to get the scholarship.

364
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Are you going or not?

365
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Today, our class teacher

366
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
specially pulled me to the office.

367
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
She wants me, your excellent junior,

368
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
to invite you, this excellent alumni,

369
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
to go back to school and give a lecture.

370
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
To encourage the junior students who are about to take the college entrance examination.

371
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
After the injury, the psychological book of the emergency case is written.

372
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The first step is to re-heat the room and shine again.

373
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm not free.

374
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You don't have to worry about delaying the class.

375
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's none of your business.

376
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You think about it.

377
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
How many junior students can you look at?

378
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Hello, is the medicine ready?

379
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Right away.

380
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Thank you.

381
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Thank you.

382
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You've been doing this for a long time.

383
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Is it a delivery?

384
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You've been doing this for nothing.

385
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
But Song Nang is gone.

386
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
So you don't have the spirit of a craftsman.

387
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yes.

388
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Not everyone is that senior.

389
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Senior, do you think you work in this bookstore?

390
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Just like the spicy flowers in the coffee delivery.

391
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
What do you mean?

392
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
A waste of money.

393
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Go to the bathroom.

394
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I...

395
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You're the one who gave me the orders.

396
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You promised Lin Zhi Hua that you would come.

397
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Now you tell me that I can't come.

398
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
What if the lecture is over?

399
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You go up and talk.

400
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Director, calm down.

401
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Drink some water first.

402
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Director, calm down.

403
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
The lecture is over.

404
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's over.

405
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Go to the bathroom.

406
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

407
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Go to the bathroom.

408
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Go to the bathroom.

409
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Calm down.

410
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Drink some water first.

411
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
At first,

412
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Gu Xue Jiao said to me with a big heart.

413
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
That Lin Zhi Hua can come.

414
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I just...

415
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I trust him too much.

416
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
To be honest,

417
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Lin has been a little bit out of it lately.

418
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yes.

419
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Deputy director.

420
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Yes.

421
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You're here.

422
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You can't be behind me.

423
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Thank you.

424
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Okay.

425
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Hello, students.

426
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm Lin Zhi Hua.

427
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Back to the beginning,

428
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
my original intention is simple.

429
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I hope everyone can get into the university they want.

430
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I also believe that all of you here

431
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
have unlimited potential.

432
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Next, I'll share some of my experience.

433
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
In high school,

434
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
many people simply categorized

435
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
as memory subjects and understanding subjects.

436
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
For example,

437
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
physics,

438
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
which makes many students have a headache.

439
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Everyone will think that

440
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
it's just a simple thing that needs to be understood.

441
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Actually, it's not.

442
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Like physics,

443
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
everyone may think

444
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
it's just a matter of understanding.

445
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Look, they're all taking pictures.

446
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
But actually,

447
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
memorizing formulas is the first step.

448
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You have to memorize the formulas first

449
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
before you can use them.

450
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
After this,

451
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
take a picture of me.

452
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Three, two, one.

453
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Cheese.

454
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Take a picture for me.

455
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Thank you.

456
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Thank you.

457
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Okay.

458
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Three, two, one.

459
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Cheese.

460
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Come on, Mr. Ling.

461
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I want one too.

462
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
This is the last one.

463
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Mr. Ling is very busy.

464
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Three, two, one.

465
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Okay, Mr. Ling.

466
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Hurry up.

467
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Senior, do you have a text version

468
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
of the learning method you shared?

469
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Can you send me one?

470
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I have one.

471
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Text version.

472
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'll share it with everyone.

473
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Mr. Ling, there's something else.

474
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Let's just forget about it.

475
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Senior, can you repeat

476
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
what you said today?

477
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Repeat it again.

478
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'll repeat it again.

479
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I have one.

480
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'll do it again.

481
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I have one.

482
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I have one.

483
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Let's go back to the school's forum.

484
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Let's go back.

485
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Senior, this is for you.

486
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Thank you.

487
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I bought this for you.

488
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I really like your lecture style.

489
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I heard that you're my sister's tutor.

490
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You're so fated.

491
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Your sister?

492
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Yes.

493
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
We're distant relatives.

494
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Besides,

495
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Aunt Si Tong has been working

496
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
in my family for years.

497
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I call her auntie.

498
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I call her auntie.

499
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Xue Jiao is like my sister.

500
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I heard from Aunt Si Tong

501
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
that Xue Jiao has found

502
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
a very honest and responsible tutor.

503
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm so envious.

504
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Senior,

505
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
can you also teach me?

506
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
My parents can pay you double the tutor fee.

507
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Jia Zheng.

508
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Wait, wait, wait.

509
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
No, no.

510
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I said no.

511
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm sorry.

512
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You're so annoying, Gu Xue Jiao.

513
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You're poor.

514
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
You don't let others pay for your tutor?

515
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You're so small.

516
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
A person like Senior Lin

517
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
is so humble,

518
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
noble, and generous.

519
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
He's so rich.

520
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Who's going to pay for him?

521
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm not worried about that.

522
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You're really not on the same level.

523
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Senior Lin.

524
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
This student

525
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
seems to be very good

526
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
and smart.

527
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But now the distance between them

528
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
is less than a month.

529
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I can't stand this anymore.

530
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I can't stand the second one.

531
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
But it's less than a month.

532
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Then we can't waste time

533
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
on such a

534
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
unimportant person.

535
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Let's go.

536
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Let's go.

537
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
What's wrong with you?

538
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You're so annoying.

539
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
The first major exam of a senior high school student

540
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
is the medical model.

541
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You have to simulate the state during the college entrance examination.

542
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Don't get up after you wake up.

543
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You should lie down for 30 seconds

544
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
to let the blood supply

545
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
and the brain and body functions

546
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
that have just been awakened.

547
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
A good mouthpiece and a good sense of taste

548
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
can keep the body balanced and stable.

549
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It helps to speed up the process

550
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
during the answer.

551
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
The new breathing method

552
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
is considered to be the most effective

553
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
to relieve anxiety

554
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
and anxiety

555
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
in the breathing method.

556
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Repeating three times

557
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
will help to temporarily relieve tension and anxiety.

558
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
The last time I brushed my teeth,

559
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I was always in the opposite direction.

560
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
If life is not like that,

561
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
then I will give up this chance

562
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
and give up this chance.

563
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Incompetent.

564
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
The signal of exhaustion.

565
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Incompetent.

566
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
The channel of confusion.

567
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Incompetent.

568
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Life is not as dense as it seems.

569
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Then let's embrace it.

570
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Kobe Bryant.

571
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
What?

572
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You want to show your results?

573
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Are you afraid of this?

574
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Here it comes.

575
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Here it comes.

576
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You are all looking forward to it.

577
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
The results of our model

578
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
and the ranking of age

579
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
have just come out.

580
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Next, I will read the name of the classmate

581
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
and come up to get the score.

582
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Qi Lei.

583
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
293.

584
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Yi Tianyu.

585
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
420.

586
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
27.

587
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Qi Lei.

588
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Help me get it.

589
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Take it down.

590
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Thank you.

591
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
This classmate is doing well.

592
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Qi Junyang.

593
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Here.

594
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
193.

595
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Keep going.

596
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Gu Xuejiao.

597
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Zhou Shiyue.

598
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
The ninth grade.

599
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Thank you, teacher.

600
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Liu Yanbin.

601
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
The thirteenth grade.

602
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
You are so amazing.

603
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I don't know

604
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
if he has passed the first grade.

605
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
If Sun Xiao can't pass the first grade,

606
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I will do my best to catch him.

607
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I don't know what to do.

608
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
How is he?

609
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
You ask.

610
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Xuejiao.

611
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Actually,

612
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
it's normal

613
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
that you can't pass the exam.

614
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It's okay.

615
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Don't worry.

616
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Go to your mom

617
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
and ask her to find Zhou Yizhang.

618
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Find a good relationship.

619
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
If you can't,

620
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
you can change to another school.

621
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Look at this kid.

622
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
99.

623
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
You didn't look at the flowers.

624
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
You are so amazing.

625
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Okay.

626
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Let's go out to eat tonight.

627
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
What to eat?

628
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
What to eat?

629
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
You say what to eat.

630
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Eat hot pot.

631
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Okay.

632
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Yizi, let's play football.

633
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I'm not going.

634
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
What's wrong?

635
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Look at the little cartoon.

636
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It's easy to die if you watch too much.

637
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Did I see the ghost?

638
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Or you are evil.

639
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
You look at this.

640
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Help me teach this to the team.

641
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
What's the point of this?

642
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I can teach you.

643
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
What?

644
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Apply for retirement.

645
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I'm going to start learning now.

646
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
What are you doing?

647
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Didn't you say

648
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
you'd rather go to the brick house

649
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
than study?

650
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Between 99 and 427,

651
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
there are a total of 27 teams.

652
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You are right.

653
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I have to start

654
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
narrowing the soul distance

655
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
between her and him.

656
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I'll teach him.

657
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
My exams used to be all about him.

658
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
But I don't need him anymore.

659
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I'm going to pass it on to you.

660
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
You can use it well.

661
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Don't.

662
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I can still pass the test

663
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
before I pass the test.

664
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I have to pass it on

665
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
before I pass the test.

666
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Life

667
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
can't be all about dreams.

668
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
You have to fight for your own future.

669
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
You are right.

670
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I'm going to pass it on to you.

671
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I didn't expect

672
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
you would come to

673
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
inform Gao about my results.

674
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Of course.

675
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
He is the matchmaker

676
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
between us.

677
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
What?

678
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
This...

679
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
This...

680
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
The middleman.

681
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
What's the middleman?

682
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Watch your words.

683
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I'm going to pass it on to you.

684
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I'm going to pass it on to you.

685
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I'm going to pass it on to you.

686
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I'm going to pass it on to you.

687
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Watch your words.

688
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Hello.

689
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Who is that?

690
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Three, two, one.

691
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I don't know.

692
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Hello.

693
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
What?

694
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
What's wrong?

695
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Gao Rui went to the car.

696
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
What's going on?

697
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Gao!

698
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Master.

699
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Will Gao Shige's

700
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
test result be re-released?

701
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
You are the dog's leg

702
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
of the school period.

703
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Chief Lin.

704
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Gao.

705
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
The bug hasn't been fixed yet.

706
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
There is another accident.

707
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It was just an accident last time.

708
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I don't believe in evil.

709
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
One-thousandth of the probability

710
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
won't happen again.

711
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I guarantee

712
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
that Gao Shige

713
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
will be able to

714
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
get the result.

715
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I'm sure

716
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
he will be able to.

717
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I'm sure he will be able to.

718
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
He will be able to.

719
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Gao, listen to me.

720
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
You are not in the project team.

721
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
What's your problem?

722
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I don't want you to die, okay?

723
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I've been studying

724
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
the re-release for a while.

725
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It's not a probability problem.

726
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
It's our testing system.

727
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It's not very efficient

728
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
at simulating the parameters of the environment.

729
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
It will cause the data to be out

730
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
and the problem will be solved.

731
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
You really need to get in the car.

732
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Wait until I fix the bug.

733
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Okay?

734
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
When can I fix it?

735
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Lin, Lin.

736
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I knew it.

737
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
You're trying to fool me again.

738
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
The hospital just informed me

739
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
that I have a half

740
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
of the probability of re-building.

741
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Instead of sitting in the wheelchair for the rest of my life,

742
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I might as well die in the car.

743
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Let's go.

744
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Now.

745
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
He can do it now.

746
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Who are you?

747
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Who are you?

748
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You asked me to

749
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
make the eighth code for the program.

750
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Whether it's when you're working for Senior Gao

751
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
or when you're helping me with my homework,

752
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
haven't you been fixing the eighth code?

753
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
No.

754
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Then why are you

755
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
playing with the computer all the time?

756
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Are you trying to chase me?

757
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Let's go. Get in the car.

758
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Don't be impulsive, Senior Gao.

759
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Give me ten minutes.

760
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Ten minutes.

761
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Hello.

762
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Hello.

763
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I'm Yao Di.

764
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Hello.

765
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
What are you doing?

766
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Just tell me what's going on.

767
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Don't be so impulsive.

768
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:55,860
Use the fake nail to make the

769
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Okay.

770
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
But it's just a model now.

771
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
We have to go through continuous

772
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
experimental tests before...

773
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Professor.

774
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
You...

775
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Professor.

776
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Your house is almost repaired.

777
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Report, Professor.

778
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Lin Zhi Hua, the lab assistant of Jingda Xiyi,

779
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
has applied for a team.

780
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I approved this time.

781
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Yes.

782
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
You lied to me.

783
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Actually, I wanted to fix it before.

784
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
It's much easier to change a way of thinking.

785
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Thanks to you, Professor,

786
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I went out for a walk and got a job.

787
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I changed a solution.

788
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I'm sorry.

789
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Senior Lin,

790
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
in order to make you go back to the team,

791
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I spent a lot of effort.

792
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
How can you thank me?

793
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Actually, I was going to go back

794
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
without your help.

795
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Who knows if you don't say it?

796
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Anyway, I was worried about you.

797
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I heard from Senior Gao

798
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
that you won the lottery.

799
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Do you have to show me?

800
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Actually, I don't need many gifts.

801
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
How about giving me a gift

802
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
that's 100 years old?

803
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Okay.

804
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Fifty sets of five-year college entrance examination,

805
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
three-year simulation.

806
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Is it thick enough?

807
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
One hundred sets.

808
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Change one.

809
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Change one?

810
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I'll give you a question.

811
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
You can't give me a question.

812
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I'm sorry.

813
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Gao, listen to me.

814
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
You're not in the next group.

815
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
What's your identity?

816
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I don't want you to die, okay?

817
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
You asked me to go back to the program

818
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
to bring the horse-drawn horse.

819
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Whether it's working for Senior Gao

820
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
or helping me with my homework,

821
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
you've been changing

822
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
the eighth proposal, haven't you?

823
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
No.

824
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Then why do you keep

825
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
holding the computer?

826
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You're just pretending.

827
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
What's going on?

828
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Liu Huang, call the police.

829
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I used to think that

830
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
the direction of fate

831
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
is in my hands.

832
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
It's like a toy car in my hand

833
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
when I was a child.

834
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
It's like the scores

835
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I got from the exam.

836
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Every score is not good.

837
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
The fun of going back to the air

838
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
is more important than the score.

839
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I'm not going to let you go.

840
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I'm going to give you a good lesson.

841
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I'm going to give you a good lesson.

842
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I'm going to give you a good lesson.

843
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
There's one more time to get full marks.

844
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
It's like the success

845
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
of starting a business

846
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
again and again.

847
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Compared to success,

848
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I cherish my friends

849
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
who are in the same boat.

850
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
No, my comrades.

851
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
But until many years later,

852
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
in my best friend's funeral,

853
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I suddenly realized that

854
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
fate never

855
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
is in my hands.

856
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
It's even in the portrait.

857
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
The more I want to keep everything,

858
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
the more I lose everything.

859
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Gao Rui,

860
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
the time of death is

861
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
September 5, 2014.

862
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It's 19 minutes and 32 seconds.

863
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
If fate wants to crush

864
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
a selfish person,

865
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
it's so easy.

866
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Until someone tells me

867
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
it's not.

868
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Why are you so secretive?

869
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Because someone told me

870
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
as long as you live,

871
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
there will always be a chance to turn the tables.

872
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Eight binary digits

873
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Because I am the real Murong changed three times.

874
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
You blocked me.

875
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
What did you say?

876
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,760
Thank you.

877
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,800
Do you know?

878
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,760
I invested 17 cents on the summer vacation.

879
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,640
But my school is so bad.

880
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,600
They don't want me.

881
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,840
I was rejected 17 times.

882
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,400
I didn't even think of getting married.

883
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,640
What's wrong with you?

884
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,360
Is it a big deal

885
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,640
that no one wants an intern?

886
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,080
Who said I wanted to get married?

887
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,640
Then why are you sitting on the top?

888
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:36,920
Go swimming?

889
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,880
Nothing

890
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,800
can take over your life.

891
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,160
So,

892
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,960
no matter what happens,

893
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,760
you don't deserve to give up your life.

894
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,440
Baby.

895
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,160
As long as you live,

896
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,560
you will have a chance to turn the tables.

897
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,760
I wish you a long life.

898
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,120
I only want my Cheng'er.

899
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,640
Cover view

900
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,960
This film

901
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,480
represents the skin skin of the male

902
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,120
of Cheng Feifei and me

903
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,680
of the female.

904
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,840
This is as good as

905
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,840
is the soul of the Wind Reversal.

906
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,840
What's this?

907
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,840
This heart...

908
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,840
How can it be?

909
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,840
The flower...

910
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,840
Gao Rui.

911
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,840
The time of death is September 5, 2014.

912
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,840
Poor thing.

913
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,840
Brother Li and he are best friends.

914
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,840
He's become a little bit more quiet.

915
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,840
There's no reason to affect the college's revival.

916
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,840
What?

917
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,840
You didn't find out either?

918
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,840
You didn't find out either?

919
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,840
Hello?

920
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,840
Gao?

921
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,840
What's wrong?

922
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,840
You haven't seen me in a long time.

923
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,840
What are you joking about?

924
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,840
Listen to me now.

925
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,840
Today, our time trial must be cancelled.

926
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,840
I think something might happen.

927
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,840
You stayed up all night to fix bugs and ruined your brain.

928
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,840
No.

929
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,840
How do you know?

930
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,840
Leave it alone. Listen to me.

931
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,840
Today must be cancelled.

932
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,840
The test is coming.

933
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,840
Okay?

934
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,840
This time trial is not our first time.

935
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,840
Moreover, the progress is important.

936
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,840
Even if it's cancelled, you must give me a reasonable reason.

937
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,840
Breaking out of the car accident.

938
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,840
Is that a reason?

939
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,840
No.

940
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,840
I mean, Li.

941
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,840
You're usually cold-hearted.

942
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,840
What's wrong?

943
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,840
You're a little more humorous today.

944
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,840
I'm serious.

945
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,840
Li, what's wrong with you today?

946
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,840
Don't worry.

947
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,840
I'm here.

948
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,840
The professors and experts are here.

949
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,840
Hello, experts.

950
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,840
I'm Lin Zhi Hua's partner.

951
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,840
My name is Gao Rui.

952
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:05,840
Gao Rui is mainly responsible for the test session online and offline.

953
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,840
Lin Zhi Hua is mainly responsible for the development and infrastructure of the car system.

954
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,840
Li will be here soon.

955
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,840
Professor Tan, we're going to start the test.

956
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,840
Please give us instructions.

957
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,840
You can start at any time.

958
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,840
Okay.

959
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,840
Gao Rui.

960
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,840
The room is empty.

961
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,840
How careful do you have to be to light a lamp?

962
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:16,840
There will never be a empty voice.

963
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,840
We separate memories.

964
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,840
Every line is a wrong path.

965
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:30,840
We are thinking of getting closer to each other.

966
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,840
Let fate decide.

967
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:38,840
Let us give up all courage.

968
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:44,840
I'm willing to travel with you through time.

969
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:51,840
If you also understand the secrets in my eyes,

970
00:43:51,840 --> 00:44:01,840
you will find that you are always in my heart.

971
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:08,840
I try to open my hands.

972
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:12,840
Because I'm sure to love you.

973
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,840
I'm listening to the wind.

974
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:22,840
The wind is blowing, it doesn't matter.

975
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,840
There is a sound, very close.

976
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:31,840
I know it must be you.

977
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:46,840
I try to open my hands.

978
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:50,840
Because I'm sure to love you.

979
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,840
I'm listening to the wind.

980
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:59,840
The wind is blowing, it doesn't matter.

981
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,840
There is a sound, very close.

982
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:09,840
I know it must be you.
