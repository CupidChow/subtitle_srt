3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,640
 ♫ Don't be afraid of the so-called top scorer ♫ 

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,480
 ♫ You're a legend in someone else's story too ♫ 

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,180
 ♫ Don't hold back, grow with all your might ♫ 

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,720
 ♫ Flowers bloom at the height of summer ♫ 

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,600
 ♫ Now let's reformat this life anew ♫ 

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,520
 ♫ Physics and math aren't that hard ♫ 

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,000
 ♫ In the flaming youth,
we grow stronger together ♫ 

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,360
 ♫ My heart still burns with fiery heat ♫ 

11
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,120
 ♫ Follow the rhythm, let your spirit relieve ♫ 

12
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,800
 ♫ The night sky lights up, guiding my flight ♫ 

13
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,560
 ♫ I'll be brave with you, chasing the height ♫ 

14
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,260
 ♫ My love still burns, glowing so bright ♫ 

15
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,040
 ♫ Shining in eyes that smile with grace ♫ 

16
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,145
 ♫ Let us break through time and space ♫ 

17
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:39,160
 

18
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,292
- Bro.
- Don't...

19
00:01:40,292 --> 00:01:41,670
- One more toast to you.
- Okay.

20
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,620
My son got into UFE
thanks to Xue Jiao's constant help.

21
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,012
Wait... Your son is...

22
00:01:50,012 --> 00:01:51,880
Uncle, I have work to do.

23
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,660
So I'll head off first.

24
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,160
- Speaking of my son.
- Hello, Uncle, Auntie.

25
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,500
What a coincidence. We meet again.

26
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,390
Isn't he Yi Tian Yu?

27
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,240
- Tian Yu?
- Xue Jiao's tablemate.

28
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,270
He even had meals up on our rooftop.

29
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,880
Oh yeah, I remember now.

30
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,150
Not just meals.

31
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,240
They both got called in by the school
and punished together.

32
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,150
They've been through thick and thin.

33
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,760
Tian Yu's turned into quite a catch.

34
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,080
He takes after me.

35
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,400
This kid's amazing now.

36
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,447
He came up with the business model
for our whole restaurant chain.

37
00:02:24,447 --> 00:02:28,440
All that "one percent rule", "marginal effect",
and stuff.

38
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,690
I have no clue. It's all his.

39
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,370
I just invest in whatever he says.

40
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,930
And we always make money.

41
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,627
Really?

42
00:02:35,627 --> 00:02:40,120
Tian Yu, look, Xue Jiao's mom
likes dabbling in little investments, too.

43
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,320
You two should share ideas.

44
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,920
- I'll call you my teacher.
- Please don't.

45
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,160
My investment is not that...

46
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,360
Don't be modest. They all helped us.

47
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,301
Do share your insights, hear me? Treat her like your own mom.

48
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:55,300
Xue Jiao has to get back to the office. Give her a ride.

49
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,160
- Okay.
- No!

50
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,200
It's fine.

51
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,960
- Just go.
- It's okay. It's hard to get a ride now.

52
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,960
He was your tablemate. Don't be so formal.

53
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,920
- Just go.
- Go on.

54
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,200
I'm gonna head out.

55
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,600
Go. Don't eat too much.

56
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,620
Our bond... Keeps going, huh?

57
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,110
Yeah. What a surprise.

58
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,020
- We should get together more often.
- Okay.

59
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,080
Make yourselves at home.
Bring your friends anytime.

60
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,270
- You're too kind.
- It's alright.

61
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,150
Just call me when you're coming.

62
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,800
I'll take care of it. Done.

63
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,780
- Come on.
- Okay...

64
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,660
I was going to Huachuang's business lunch,

65
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,520
but my dad called,
saying there was a fight at his restaurant.

66
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,890
But why was he drinking with your dad?

67
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,140
It wasn't a fight.

68
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,890
Just a little disagreement.

69
00:03:58,515 --> 00:04:01,025
Don't tell me it was your two families fighting?

70
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,600
Why so serious with old classmates?

71
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,190
I don't even dare to speak up.

72
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,680
Qi Lei?

73
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,290
I almost didn't recognize you dressed like that.

74
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,920
You haven't changed a bit.

75
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,550
You were crazy competitive back then.

76
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,950
Got our whole class hyped up
before the college entrance exam.

77
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,552
Now, are you competing with coworkers?

78
00:04:28,552 --> 00:04:33,457
I heard from Tian Yu that
you're doing really well at work these days.

79
00:04:34,803 --> 00:04:37,293
And who is her boss?

80
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,355
You're chatting with my mom?

81
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:50,961
Auntie's asking me some investment questions.

82
00:04:50,961 --> 00:04:52,990
What?

83
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,410
I can't answer her?

84
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,320
You... Answer wisely.

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,290
Okay.

86
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,830
Noted.

87
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,970
Yi Tian Yu, oh my gosh.

88
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,440
What are you doing? Defense!

89
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,320
- Tian Yu!
- Defense! Move!

90
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,050
Defense!

91
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,530
- Confident?
- Yeah!

92
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,650
Three, two, one.

93
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,320
Go!

94
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,720
 ♫ Flipping through memories ♫ 

95
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,927
 ♫ Every line a trail where our steps entwine ♫ 

96
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,270
Water?

97
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,000
Thanks.

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,430
♫ ♫

99
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,850
 

100
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,100
Who the hell is parking in my spot?

101
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,051
- Yes?
- This is my spot.

102
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:22,880
Please move your car.

103
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,530
Your spot?

104
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,160
Is your name on it?

105
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,441
Who are you? Do you even work here?

106
00:06:29,441 --> 00:06:31,320
I've never seen you before.

107
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,990
I'm telling you, move it now.

108
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,430
Outsiders aren't allowed to park here.

109
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,150
Do you know who I am? Talking to me like that?

110
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,550
Who are you?

111
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,180
Me?

112
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,020
I'm Huachuang Group GM... GM's assistant.

113
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,510
Half the people in this company
came in through me.

114
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,110
I'm the human punch clock here.

115
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,550
I've never seen you before.

116
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,880
- Which department are you from?
- I'm your check writer,

117
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,340
Blue Mountain Capital's investor, Mr. Yi...

118
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,430
Mr Yi's driver.

119
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,700
You're just a driver. How dare you take my spot?

120
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,920
How dare an assistant ask Mr. Yi to move?

121
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,610
Watch it.

122
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,170
A mere driver. How dare he?

123
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,270
What's he so smug about?

124
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,930
Come in.

125
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,120
Zhi Hua, here's the agenda for the weekly meeting.

126
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,660
Take a look.

127
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,340
Him again?

128
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,370
You've met him?

129
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:02,560
Met his driver, strutting around.

130
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,598
Do you know this man?

131
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:10,510
In 2017, he bought cryptocurrency at $730

132
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,870
and sold it at $20,000 by year's end.

133
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,800
In 2018, before the stock market crashed,

134
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
he cleared out all his US stocks.

135
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,550
His properties doubled in price, and he sold them off, too.

136
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,370
In 2019, he jumped into tech stocks and caught the biggest wave.

137
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,440
In 2020, he switched to gold as a safe haven,

138
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,000
and it immediately hit a record high.

139
00:08:27,795 --> 00:08:29,896
Sounds like he's got a crystal ball.

140
00:08:29,896 --> 00:08:31,996
Who is he?

141
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,180
That's Mr. Yi.

142
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,030
He should be over in Finance right now.

143
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,250
Later, I want you

144
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,510
to receive him.

145
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,180
I don't need it!

146
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,700
Why is Lin Jia Dong so angry?

147
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,530
I don't know. What's got into him?

148
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,960
Don't forget who you are!

149
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,310
When you were starting out, who was
the one who stuck with you through it all?

150
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,580
How many people have left?

151
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,960
The ones who stayed...
I calmed them down for you!

152
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,560
Talk about burning bridges. You just kicked me to the curb!

153
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,300
Capitalists are all rotten!

154
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,320
Who are you?

155
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,460
Throw it away. Thanks.

156
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,260
Not all capitalists are bad.

157
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,260
Mr. Yi, this way.

158
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,970
 I've never really seen them as "competitors". 

159
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,660
 The market makes its choice. 

160
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,310
 The fittest survive. 

161
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,780
 With B&amp;C's era ending, 

162
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,810
 another brand will rise to replace it soon. 

163
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,210
 And hopefully, they'll set a new, healthy standard 

164
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,670
 for competition in our industry. 

165
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,400
- Pretty good.
- Alright, let me brief you on our progress.

166
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,670
Currently, the most critical V2X module
for C3 is in trial operation.

167
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,710
Everything's stable.

168
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:19,000
But the trial operation and real-world scenarios
are different.

169
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,980
Theoretically, it can handle
all complex conditions in simulated road tests,

170
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,660
but once it hits the road,
can it perfectly avoid obstacles?

171
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,160
That's the number one challenge
you need to crack next.

172
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,640
Yes.

173
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,880
Gu Xue Jiao, what do you mean?

174
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,960
Exactly what you saw.

175
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,020
Emotions expressed loud and clear.

176
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,300
We're all used to the daily battles
between Tech Dept One and Two.

177
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,310
- Show her the meeting minutes.
- You don't say.

178
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,790
It's like a No. 7 High reunion.

179
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,060
Dodging responsibility.
You're just like a schoolkid.

180
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,240
- Who are you calling a schoolkid?
- Whoever I feel like.

181
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,590
Did you record the meeting?

182
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,360
Put together a work document and show it to her.

183
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,490
Who dares put non-work-related things
in the report?

184
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,540
Don't try to confuse matters.

185
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,400
When did I do that?

186
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,000
My apologies.

187
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,620
It's been a busy day.

188
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,670
How's the tour going?

189
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,260
Good.

190
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,430
How come you're alone?

191
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,620
- Where's your assistant?
- I fired him.

192
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,400
Just like that?

193
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,740
Go on, continue with the tour.

194
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:20,950
Mr. Yi, this way.

195
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,040
Focus on the business, okay?

196
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,660
Who's not focusing?

197
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,685
Mr. Lin, you're right on time.

198
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,760
You weigh in!

199
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,460
Starting today, we'll combine
Tech Dept One and Tech Dept Two.

200
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,380
The fight over the V2X protocol's
conversion efficiency and reproducibility

201
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,310
is way too intense.

202
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,620
You should be working together.

203
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,340
Not happening.

204
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:50,890
I think you can work together pretty well.

205
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,380
Now you're all united. United against me.

206
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,130
This is coming from the board.

207
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,290
- To my drinking buddy.
- To my drinking buddy.

208
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,430
Weren't you a bit too much today?

209
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,810
Coming to my turf to argue with me.

210
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,420
If anyone's being too much, it's you.

211
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,000
What does "my own little patch" even mean?

212
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,060
Fine.

213
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,490
Let's make a deal.

214
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,780
Anything work-related is just work.

215
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,940
Don't make it personal.

216
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,270
Okay?

217
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,570
- I'll try.
- Don't try. You must.

218
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,310
I must try.

219
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,480
I'm late.

220
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,420
I'll take three shots.

221
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,120
You're just thirsty, aren't you?

222
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,625
You call yourselves "the hope of No. 7 High"?

223
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,300
What on earth are you drinking?

224
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,310
Jackie, I have two nice bottles stashed away.

225
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,420
Bring them up.

226
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,960
Okay.

227
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,240
Thank you, Ms. Sun.

228
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,340
No biggie.

229
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,450
I just sat down to rest a bit,

230
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,190
but the phone won't stop ringing.

231
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,850
Like the world's gonna end without me.

232
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,310
Maybe it will.

233
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,360
Go take the call.

234
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,260
Don't let a drink get in the way of your business.

235
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,490
Yeah.

236
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,240
Fine. You guys drink up.

237
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,890
Don't save any for me. But save the gossip for me.

238
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,670
Hello?

239
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,846
Come on. To Ms. Sun.

240
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,860
You have a business trip again?

241
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,570
Unlike somebody, there's not only work in my life,

242
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,380
but also a man.

243
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,360
Oh, please. Don't bring that up.

244
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,400
I'm gonna move in with Lin Zhi Hua for a while.

245
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,810
My parents worry that we're gonna
fight all the time like his parents.

246
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,070
They told me, "If you've got guts, just try it."

247
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,780
So I'm trying.

248
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,180
Why are you wasting your time with me here?

249
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,430
Go.

250
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,270
Now that you asked me.

251
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,590
I'm here as a scout for my brother.

252
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,721
He keeps asking me what you've been up to.

253
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:34,722
Why didn't you text him back?

254
00:14:34,722 --> 00:14:35,910
What's going on?

255
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,880
Nothing.

256
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,370
Look at them.

257
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,406
I got it.

258
00:14:52,406 --> 00:14:54,680
What do you get now?

259
00:14:55,346 --> 00:14:59,950
Guys like my brother still think

260
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,590
love means protecting someone in silence.

261
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,210
Use the same tactics you used on me
in high school on him.

262
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,810
You went pretty hard on me back then.

263
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,310
Don't go easy on him.

264
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:21,140
How about you give me some help?

265
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,580
- Say the word.
- I'm in.

266
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,950
What's this?

267
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,610
Watch me.

268
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,590
- Isn't that too much?
- No.

269
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,900
That's like a monkey's butt.

270
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,760
No... It's gotta be like this.

271
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,320
You...

272
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,030
That's Romanée-Conti!

273
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,240
I know.

274
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,980
It has to be Romanée-Conti.

275
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,960
Quick!

276
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,405
Call your brother for me!

277
00:15:59,405 --> 00:16:00,510
I can't drink anymore.

278
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,550
- No...
- I'm drunk.

279
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,220
What's all this act for?

280
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,720
See?

281
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,540
Everyone can see it. Your acting sucks.

282
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,750
You can tell.

283
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,550
But that blockhead guy may not.

284
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,320
Blockhead guy? Was there a guy?

285
00:16:19,243 --> 00:16:21,433
Long story.

286
00:16:24,297 --> 00:16:25,480
Ms. Sun.

287
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,030
Would you like a part in my act?

288
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,510
My fee's pretty high.

289
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,860
Forget it.

290
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,100
Guess I'll have to rely on you.

291
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,460
Take it seriously.

292
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,740
So dizzy.

293
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,320
Okay.

294
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,750
- Hold her tight.
- Okay.

295
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,720
Did she drink so much because of me?

296
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,630
Ask your girlfriend yourself.

297
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,340
Watch your head.

298
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,500
You drank plenty, too.

299
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,550
I'll deal with you after I send her home.

300
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,310
Don't ever come back.

301
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,400
Thank you.

302
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,250
Wow, pretty daring, huh?

303
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,850
I've always been daring. Just get in.

304
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,211
Alright, be safe.

305
00:17:13,211 --> 00:17:14,631
Okay.

306
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,010
Jiao.

307
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,340
I'm late.

308
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,217
No.

309
00:17:56,217 --> 00:17:58,100
You're right on time.

310
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,770
Yeah?

311
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,500
Did you drink?

312
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,140
A little.

313
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,960
I thought we'd have a good night.

314
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,440
How did it end up like this?

315
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,160
Tomorrow night.

316
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,060
I'll definitely put work aside.

317
00:18:45,604 --> 00:18:47,274
Deal.

318
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,240
You!

319
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,380
Out...

320
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,660
You... Forget what you just saw.

321
00:19:40,663 --> 00:19:43,243
Okay, done.

322
00:19:43,243 --> 00:19:47,400
Sorry, I... I'm not used to living with you yet.

323
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,550
I'll be more careful next time. I'll remember to knock.

324
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,030
If you see a strap hanging on the handle,

325
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,020
you'll know I'm inside.

326
00:20:01,637 --> 00:20:03,087
Copy.

327
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,540
 

328
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,480
Shi Yun.

329
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,080
You're here, too?

330
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,860
What's wrong?

331
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,920
We're already together,
and he's still being so polite.

332
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,420
Is your brother physically or mentally defective?

333
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,692
He probably... maybe...

334
00:22:24,692 --> 00:22:26,360
I don't think he has a problem.

335
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,240
Am I that unattractive?

336
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,870
You...

337
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,720
He probably... just chickened out.

338
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,770
Fine, forget about him.

339
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,780
Let's talk about Lin.

340
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,590
I saw he was still working at 4 AM

341
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,110
in the work group yesterday.

342
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,732
- You weren't...
- We were...

343
00:22:53,732 --> 00:22:55,920
We're adults, save it.

344
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,340
I'm off.

345
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,600
 

346
00:23:04,292 --> 00:23:06,080
Hello? Mr. Fu?

347
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,690
 

348
00:23:11,731 --> 00:23:14,151
 

349
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,270
 My graduation motto is: 

350
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,301
 
 I am the best! I rock! 

351
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:24,200
 

352
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,640
 

353
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,360
 
 Don't wanna say goodbye! 

354
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,690
 

355
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,350
 The past holds our fearless youth. 

356
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:45,276
 The future awaits our boldest adventure. 

357
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,750
As Romain Rolland once said,
don't sigh over the time that's gone.

358
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:54,054
What we should do is look forward,

359
00:23:54,054 --> 00:23:55,654
never back.

360
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,880
How time flies.

361
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,620
Suddenly, you have all made it big.

362
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,920
All elites now.

363
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,520
That's because Mr. Fu taught us well.

364
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,830
Oh, no.

365
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:10,130
You're Principal Fu now.

366
00:24:11,101 --> 00:24:13,321
Don't talk like them.

367
00:24:13,951 --> 00:24:15,701
I like it though.

368
00:24:16,984 --> 00:24:18,795
By the way, on my way here,

369
00:24:18,795 --> 00:24:22,240
I saw the bulletin board
full of scholarship announcements.

370
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,880
This year's students are so lucky.

371
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,790
That's all thanks to our alumni.

372
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,960
You're all so successful

373
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,750
and have even set up an education fund.

374
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,530
We're just riding on your coattails.

375
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,004
Education fund?

376
00:24:37,004 --> 00:24:38,240
Yeah.

377
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,180
You actually know the one who started it.
He was in your class.

378
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,020
- I think he was your...
- Tablemate.

379
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,790
Right. Speak of the devil.

380
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:50,420
Hey, come on in and say hi.

381
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,430
Is it you who started the education fund?

382
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,270
It's been ten years since we graduated.

383
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,790
This place has changed so much.

384
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,600
I almost can't recognize it.

385
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,206
But it's all for the better.

386
00:25:25,206 --> 00:25:27,773
Nothing to regret.

387
00:25:27,773 --> 00:25:30,073
You mean the people or the school?

388
00:25:31,222 --> 00:25:32,832
Both.

389
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,210
At least this part hasn't changed.

390
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:39,796
Do you remember watching me play basketball here?

391
00:25:39,796 --> 00:25:43,376
Go!

392
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,150
I don't.

393
00:25:56,585 --> 00:25:59,325
Actually, many things haven't changed at all.

394
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,880
It's getting late.

395
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,380
I still have work to do.

396
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,640
We're old classmates.

397
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,750
I'll organize a class reunion.

398
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,620
We can catch up then.

399
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:18,513
Gu Xue Jiao,

400
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,340
what are you afraid of?

401
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,557
Yi Tian Yu, let go of me.

402
00:26:24,557 --> 00:26:26,480
Yi Tian Yu.

403
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,950
Gu Xue Jiao.

404
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,790
I used to think I could be like you,

405
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,880
pretending I didn't know anything.

406
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,270
But later, I realized I couldn't.

407
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,920
I'm not as cold-hearted as you.

408
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,349
Yes.

409
00:26:38,349 --> 00:26:40,070
I came back here for you.

410
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,790
And you know that.

411
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:44,310
That's why you're avoiding me, isn't it?

412
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,310
We were classmates after all.

413
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:49,010
I was trying not to embarrass you.

414
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,920
I have a boyfriend, and we're happy together.

415
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,830
If you don't know how to keep the right distance,

416
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:57,250
then we shouldn't see each other again.

417
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,570
I just want you to know I'm your best choice.

418
00:27:03,627 --> 00:27:09,297
You and I have only ever been just classmates.

419
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,590
Let go.

420
00:27:18,644 --> 00:27:20,350
Gu Xue Jiao.

421
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,400
For you, I gave up basketball.

422
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,290
I stopped being lazy. I changed
everything you didn't like about me.

423
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,200
But there's one thing that has never changed.

424
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,860
Stop.

425
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,720
I've become the kind of person you like.

426
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,330
Why can't we at least give it a try?

427
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,390
Don't romanticize a road you've never walked on.

428
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,309
I have someone I love.

429
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:49,412
In the past, present, or future,

430
00:27:49,412 --> 00:27:51,352
we'll never be together.

431
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:54,030
Why?

432
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,110
 Because I've tried. 

433
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,350
How do you know Yi Tian Yu was my ex last time?

434
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:13,920
This time, we are really just friends.

435
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,920
Do you think Yi Tian Yu
will be different this time?

436
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,070
What if he's changed?

437
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:24,350
 Xue Jiao, I'm taking back
the life that belongs to me, 

438
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,800
 the life that belongs to us. 

439
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,530
You're back?

440
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,530
I'm cooking.

441
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,160
I just saw a monkey.

442
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,880
Too agile.

443
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,550
Surprise.

444
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,120
Thank you.

445
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,340
Lin, enough already.

446
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:19,060
Come and sit down.
We've got more than enough food here.

447
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,830
Lin, you're a busy man.

448
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,030
No need to cook yourself.

449
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,480
Not really. This is the last dish.

450
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,920
He doesn't often show off his cooking skills.

451
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,360
Let him have his moment.

452
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,730
Sit.

453
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,750
Uncle, Auntie.

454
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,200
I invited you today
to apologize for what happened last time.

455
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,270
I'm so sorry.

456
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,960
It wasn't your fault.

457
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,720
It was just an accident, right?

458
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,510
Yeah. Nothing to do with you.

459
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:47,480
Xue Jiao told us, in your family,

460
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:51,160
your mom "disciplines" your dad.

461
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,440
That put our minds halfway at ease.

462
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,590
We were a little worried at first.

463
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,790
You're both young.

464
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,480
What if you wanna lay hands on Xue Jiao

465
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,580
when you have some conflict?

466
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,680
- Wait, no...
- What we mean is,

467
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,310
what if Xue Jiao wants to "discipline" you...

468
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,300
What do you think?

469
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,420
That's fine by me.

470
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,510
Uncle, a toast to you.

471
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,930
Okay. Here.

472
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:17,070
I'm happy to have a drink
with my future son-in-law.

473
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,550
We'll be family soon.

474
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,080
No need for apologies.

475
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,992
- Come on!
- Yes...

476
00:30:20,992 --> 00:30:22,370
Okay.

477
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:30,250
 This afternoon, a traffic accident occurred
in the High-Tech Zone of Jinghai City. 

478
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,830
 The driver was seriously injured. 

479
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:36,210
 According to witnesses, the vehicle
involved was a Huachuang C2 model. 

480
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,030
 There appeared to be signs of brake failure. 

481
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:40,380
 We will be speaking to industry experts
to bring you a special report. 

482
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,160
Is Mr. Yi here?

483
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,090
Please wait a moment.

484
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,400
How's Mr. Yi?

485
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,270
We're here to apologize on behalf of Huachuang.

486
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,930
How do you have the nerve to show up?

487
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:02,440
Tian Yu refuses to see anyone from Huachuang.

488
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,550
I understand how he feels right now.

489
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:07,510
The car he was driving was the C2
we gifted to Blue Mountain Capital.

490
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,640
The investigation isn't complete yet,

491
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,400
but we are the primary party responsible.

492
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,420
So we came to apologize on behalf of Huachuang.

493
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,980
Whenever Mr. Yi is ready to see us,
we'll come back.

494
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,940
Qi Lei.

495
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,060
I'm not just representing Huachuang.

496
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,820
I'm here as myself.

497
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,400
We were classmates.

498
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,160
I'm just as worried about Yi Tian Yu as you are.

499
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,070
If he doesn't want to see us,
we'll leave right away.

500
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:38,764
But can you at least tell me how he's doing?

501
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:40,336
Qi Lei!

502
00:31:41,907 --> 00:31:43,647
Wait here.

503
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,580
Tian Yu said he'll only see you.

504
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,070
Let me.

505
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,820
You just stand there without a word?

506
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,810
It's not my funeral.

507
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,980
- Have some water.
- No. Drinking makes it worse.

508
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,600
- I came here to...
- I forgive you.

509
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,640
After all,

510
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,980
we've been friends

511
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,960
for so many years.

512
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,480
As a friend, I need to apologize to you.

513
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,400
As a member of the C2 technical team,

514
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,270
I owe you an even bigger apology.

515
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,720
When the investigation is complete,

516
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,800
I promise you'll have an answer.

517
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,680
I'm tired.

518
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,430
You may leave.

519
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:39,060
Feels even more like a funeral now.

520
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,840
And shouldn't Lin Zhi Hua be the one bowing?

521
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,720
Can that even be delegated?

522
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,030
Please believe me.

523
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,480
I'll give you an answer
about the cause of the accident.

524
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,980
I need to rest. Leave.

525
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,960
I really can't talk anymore today.

526
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,645
Yi Tian Yu!

527
00:34:12,645 --> 00:34:14,670
- Yi Tian Yu!
- Don't touch him!

528
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,960
His spinal nerves are injured.

529
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,380
- If you move him carelessly...
- Easy...

530
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,590
You could cause secondary damage.

531
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,320
 
Why haven't we figured out the brake failure yet?

532
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,740
We've gone through all the C2's
onboard data and the cloud server.

533
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:43,820
But so far, we haven't found anything unusual.

534
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:47,450
So are we suspecting a software issue
or a hardware issue?

535
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:50,780
No idea. Not a single lead.

536
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,610
I don't care how you do it.

537
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:59,550
Figure it out before the accident briefing.

538
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,630
I'm assigning tasks now.

539
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,900
Gao, you're in charge of the hardware check.

540
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,380
Send every single component
from the car to the lab.

541
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,190
Zhou Shi Yun, you're on software,
especially the ADAS safety functions.

542
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:12,930
- Okay.
- Rerun all the source code in the simulator.

543
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,570
I'll take the software side.

544
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,800
I know it better.

545
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,110
Mr. Gao, if you have a problem with my competence,

546
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,760
just tell me to my face.

547
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,010
Is this really the time for this?

548
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:32,280
Get Gu Xue Jiao to run an environmental
simulation of the crash site.

549
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,230
Map out the car's path under every possible
failure scenario.

550
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:39,940
Si Qi, run a second sweep of the cloud server.

551
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,860
Move. Be quick.

552
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,110
Lin Jia Dong?

553
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,800
Your resignation letter is still on my desk.

554
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,160
Now's exactly when we need you back.

555
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,510
I'm here today on behalf
of Blue Mountain Capital and Mr. Yi.

556
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,880
Ever since Mr. Yi's crash,

557
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,360
there's been bad press about Huachuang
all over the place.

558
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,760
C2 orders are being canceled in bulk.

559
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,665
Every investor, including Blue Mountain,

560
00:36:01,665 --> 00:36:05,480
is now seriously questioning
Mr. Lin's capabilities.

561
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,100
I'm here to clean up your mess.

562
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:13,500
Zhi Hua, looks like the tables have turned.

563
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,248
 

564
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,400
What are you looking at?

565
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,190
Get back to work!

566
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:42,127
Lin, I'll go with you.

567
00:36:42,127 --> 00:36:44,070
I quit.

568
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,550
- Me, too.
- I quit, too.

569
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,760
- Lin, I'll go with you.
- Me, too.

570
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,590
I quit, too.

571
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,510
Lin, I'll go with you.

572
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,740
Stop making a scene.

573
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,230
Investors haven't even started
blaming you for the tech issues yet.

574
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:56,078
Lin Jia Dong, the moment your aunt went down

575
00:36:56,078 --> 00:36:58,180
and you rushed over to pledge loyalty to us,

576
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,633
I should've known you were just a fence-sitter.

577
00:37:00,633 --> 00:37:02,260
Let me save you the trouble.

578
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,940
We're leaving with Lin right now.

579
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:10,700
Men will always be boys until the day they die.

580
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,010
Thank you.

581
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:15,210
- But...
- Mr. Lin needs you to stay.

582
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,184
Xue Jiao, what the company's doing now

583
00:37:19,184 --> 00:37:21,230
is no different from B&amp;C back then.

584
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,900
If you want to stay, just stay.

585
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,150
But I'm leaving.

586
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,260
But even so, you should leave
with all the facts clear.

587
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:30,090
What matters most now
is finding out what caused the accident.

588
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:31,780
Don't act on impulse.

589
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,440
Lin, our accident investigation
team lost all access.

590
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,670
Cut the crap.

591
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,710
Once you're fired,
you're no longer considered an employee.

592
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:41,840
Say one more word, and I'll sue
you for leaking our trade secrets.

593
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,680
 

594
00:37:47,495 --> 00:37:49,320
Sorry, Ms. Gu.

595
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,380
Considering your relationship with Lin Zhi Hua,

596
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,380
we can only grant you

597
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,800
limited low-risk access until the investigation is completed.

598
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,230
You...

599
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:04,157
Fine.

600
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:06,617
I respect the company's decision.

601
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:17,020
 

602
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,570
I'll come to visit you tomorrow.

603
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,040
 

604
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:49,730
If you're visiting just to ask me
to spare Lin Zhi Hua,

605
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,310
then don't bother coming.

606
00:38:55,445 --> 00:38:56,820
You've got it wrong.

607
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,030
I'm here only to express my own apology.

608
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,710
It's not about Lin Zhi Hua.

609
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:04,630
I believe Lin Zhi Hua can survive this on his own,

610
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,960
without me meddling.

611
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,530
Alright.

612
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,930
I wish that he'll survive the crisis,

613
00:39:12,597 --> 00:39:14,527
just like you said.

614
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,030
Hello?

615
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,440
Xue Jiao, come back here now.

616
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,630
We found something.

617
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,420
What happened?

618
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,640
 

619
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,897
 

620
00:39:54,897 --> 00:39:56,680
 

621
00:40:03,173 --> 00:40:06,323
They don't have much time
left for crisis management.

622
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:09,360
The trending topic has to be Huachuang these days.

623
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,160
 The investor representative of Huachuang 

624
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,700
 was driving your C2 model when the car lost control and crashed. 

625
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,550
 Such explosive news. 

626
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:19,900
 Lin Zhi Hua, how are you gonna turn this around? 

627
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,720
Morning, everyone!

628
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,901
We brought breakfast for you all.

629
00:40:30,901 --> 00:40:32,030
Thanks.

630
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,013
Wait. This is for Shi Yun.

631
00:40:34,013 --> 00:40:36,003
She loves sweets.

632
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,030
Come on, dig in.

633
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,560
Take a break.

634
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,740
Busy. Don't mess around.

635
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:47,190
Lin, no wonder your name is trending.

636
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,320
Who exploits their employees like you do?

637
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,150
It's okay that you've dragged my sister here.

638
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:54,230
Why does Shi Yun have to work overtime
at your place, too?

639
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,710
Special occasion.

640
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,630
Our access is all restricted now.

641
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:00,370
We can only count on your Shi Yun now.

642
00:41:01,148 --> 00:41:05,030
Yeah. Luckily, you two always fight at work.

643
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,100
Otherwise, Blue Mountain wouldn't have agreed

644
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:10,260
to let Shi Yun continue
the software investigation.

645
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,190
Wait, Lin.

646
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:17,080
Did you anticipate that Blue Mountain
would limit our team?

647
00:41:18,563 --> 00:41:20,190
You're disturbing Shi Yun.

648
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,800
No.

649
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,840
I found a new lead.

650
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,752
Look here.

651
00:41:25,752 --> 00:41:28,504
I compiled simulation data
of the driving trajectories of all of us

652
00:41:28,504 --> 00:41:30,110
and discovered something interesting.

653
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:34,760
None of the simulated trajectories
matched the actual driving path of Yi Tian Yu.

654
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,110
Why is his trajectory so straight?

655
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:40,450
Because he didn't make the instinctive
steering move

656
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:42,080
most people do in emergencies.

657
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,190
Exactly.

658
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:46,150
Usually, when we encounter danger on the road,

659
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,670
especially experienced drivers,
we first hit the brakes.

660
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:52,400
If the brakes fail, we instinctively
steer to avoid the hazard.

661
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,920
But his driving path is so straight.

662
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,230
Only two possibilities.

663
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:59,400
Either he was too stunned to react in time.

664
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,372
- Or...
- Or...

665
00:42:01,372 --> 00:42:04,270
he knew the car would lose control.

666
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:08,470
How is that possible?

667
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,920
We can't jump to conclusions yet.

668
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,510
The vehicle's onboard system logs all operations.

669
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,030
If we analyze them, it'll be clear.

670
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,440
This part is even more suspicious.

671
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,030
The company's server was undergoing maintenance
during that exact period.

672
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:29,110
So the program logs from Yi Tian Yu's accident
vehicle have been lost.

00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,795
 ♫ In a dark room ♫ 

676
00:43:05,795 --> 00:43:09,795
 ♫ How carefully we light a single lamp ♫ 

677
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:15,320
 ♫ So there won't be an echoing sound ♫ 

678
00:43:16,036 --> 00:43:19,443
 ♫ Flipping through memories ♫ 

679
00:43:19,443 --> 00:43:23,480
 ♫ Every line a trail where our steps entwine ♫ 

680
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:29,730
 ♫ That's us drawing closer to each other ♫ 

681
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:33,200
 ♫ Let it be fate ♫ 

682
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,280
 ♫ Let us give all our courage ♫ 

683
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:43,400
 ♫ To journey through time with you ♫ 

684
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,944
 ♫ If you can ♫ 

685
00:43:46,944 --> 00:43:50,937
 ♫ Read the secret in my gaze ♫ 

686
00:43:50,937 --> 00:43:57,597
 ♫ You'll see you've always been in my heart ♫ 

687
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:07,560
 ♫ I try to open up my arms ♫ 

688
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:11,480
 ♫ Because I'm certain of this love ♫ 

689
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,320
 ♫ Summit of our youth ♫ 

690
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:21,160
 ♫ Even if the wind roars, it's okay ♫ 

691
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:25,220
 ♫ There's a figure approaching ♫ 

692
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:32,200
 ♫ I know it must be you ♫ 

693
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:45,210
 ♫ I try to open up my arms ♫ 

694
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:49,280
 ♫ Because I'm certain of this love ♫ 

695
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,000
 ♫ Summit of our youth ♫ 

696
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,892
 ♫ Even if the wind roars, it's okay ♫ 

697
00:44:58,892 --> 00:45:02,929
 ♫ There's a figure approaching ♫ 

698
00:45:02,929 --> 00:45:10,109
 ♫ I know it must be you ♫
