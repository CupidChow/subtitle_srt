1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Try to grow the flowers in the summer

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now tell the truth about life

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's not complicated to count the flowers

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The youth is swaying

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We are getting stronger

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My heart is still hot and boiling

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Follow the rhythm and release it

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The night is brightening, only the fireflies are blocking

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I will fly with you bravely

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My love is still hot and boiling

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The bright and small eyes

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let us cross the barrier of time

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 10

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's not this

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's not this

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Old Lin, don't be distracted

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Look for the information that Professor Tan asked us to find

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Old Lin

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
When you leave, your family

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Your sister

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'll send you

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
No, this one

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Come out

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This one

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
No

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No wonder you are not in a good mood

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
At least I lost a student

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't know if I should tell me in advance when I go to Germany

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You go to Germany to work hard

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I clean up here

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What the hell is this?

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Arrangement

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I need you

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Hello, nice to meet you

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Brother Wei, don't go to help me

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm not fighting alone

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I have a boss

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Me

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Boss

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You will help me

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You will help me

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The caretaker

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Li Yu

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Zhi Hua

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
This is when his first-year doctor just entered the lab

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This is a month before his college entrance examination

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Where are you going?

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm going to the lab

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Then you give me a reason to stay

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Coming

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Xue Qiao

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Where is Lin Shi Gang?

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He went to the lab

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You two, front and back

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Go

57
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Where is Lin Shi Gang?

58
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Gu Xue Qiao

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
A boy came to you just now

60
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
He's been waiting for you for a long time

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Where is he?

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Turn around

63
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Xue Qiao

64
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I just came. Where are you?

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Why are you here?

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm here to see you

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Where are you?

68
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm here to see you

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Where are you?

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm here to see you

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Where are you?

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm here to see you

73
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Why are you here?

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm here to give you homework

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I left the homework last time

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's efficient

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm kidding

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Gu left the homework

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
How can I be efficient?

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Do you think your question is right?

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Have we talked about this question?

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Didn't we talk about this last time?

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Which one?

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This one

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Shouldn't you choose A?

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Shi Yun

88
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What are you doing here?

89
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I have good news

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
We have been on the top three of the three weeks

91
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
How about it?

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Three consecutive weeks

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What does it have to do with me?

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I just want to share it with you

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I can't share it with you

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Shi Yun

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You

98
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Shi Yun

99
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Why are you following me?

100
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Shi Yun

101
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The suspension notice

102
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So we came here

103
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
to ask this

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Zhou Shi Yun

105
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
For many times

106
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
he has failed to check the class

107
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and tried to persuade the class to be invalid

108
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and was sentenced to warning and punishment

109
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
If he doesn't correct it

110
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I will be punished

111
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I will be punished

112
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I will be punished

113
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
If you don't correct it

114
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I will persuade you to withdraw

115
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Are you satisfied?

116
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What?

117
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You want me to congratulate you

118
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
on being on the top three?

119
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Then congratulations

120
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
No, I didn't mean that

121
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
If you don't mean that, get out

122
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Shi Yun

123
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Do you want to eat something?

124
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I want to drink milk tea

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
We want to chat

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
and change our mood

127
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What do you want to chat?

128
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Let me tell you

129
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Zhou Shi Yun

130
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I am now the top one

131
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Why are you getting more and more down?

132
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Every day, except drinking

133
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
you just don't do anything

134
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
serious

135
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You deserve to be like this

136
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You deserve to be expelled

137
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You deserve to be expelled

138
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You should be the good girl

139
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
you used to be

140
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
No need

141
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I never thought so

142
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I said

143
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
no matter what you do

144
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I am willing to be with you

145
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
No matter you were the good girl

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
or you are now being expelled

147
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
to me, you are you

148
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You never changed

149
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You never changed

150
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You are so fierce

151
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You never changed

152
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I almost don't know myself

153
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I am serious

154
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Go back

155
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You can talk about love here

156
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I will go back

157
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Listen to me

158
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Shi Yun

159
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
No matter what you think

160
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
you have become

161
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
to me, you are you

162
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I like you

163
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Where are the others?

164
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I am holding a transfer meeting for you today

165
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
They went to the site in advance

166
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
They are so serious

167
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Let's go there together

168
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Brother Lin

169
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You just

170
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
stepped on my new floor

171
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Sorry

172
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I will do it

173
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I am sorry

174
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I am sorry

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I am sorry

176
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
No need

177
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You can go

178
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I will stay here

179
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and clean it up

180
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's almost time

181
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Let's go together

182
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I won't go

183
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I am not familiar with

184
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
the people in the lab

185
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Not familiar?

186
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Gao Rui and I

187
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
are not familiar with each other?

188
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Cheers

189
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Gao Rui

190
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Help me sing

191
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Why are you still drunk?

192
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Aren't you afraid of getting drunk?

193
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I have one

194
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's okay

195
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You are so stubborn

196
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Who is so stubborn?

197
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You are not coming?

198
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I

199
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What are you hiding here for?

200
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What respect do you have?

201
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I want to kick it too

202
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Master

203
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
One more drink

204
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You must eat well

205
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and sleep well in the end

206
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Don't break your body because of work

207
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You can rest assured in the lab

208
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Brother Lin

209
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I didn't figure out

210
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
the code logic

211
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Can you tell me again?

212
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Gu Xuejiao

213
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You are too hardworking

214
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Jia Neng, Brother Lin

215
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Go, go, go

216
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I won't go

217
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Go

218
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Come

219
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What's the problem?

220
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
If I break into another letter here

221
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Then

222
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I will be the same as you

223
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
This is a letter-in-line code

224
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Which formula

225
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
can I use

226
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
to make the variables in the code

227
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
return to the starting point quickly?

228
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
There are seven or eight solutions

229
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
in the collection language

230
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Which one do you want to hear?

231
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The faster the better

232
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But don't let the data come out

233
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
and lead to a strange result

234
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Then

235
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
it depends on the code idea

236
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
See if you can

237
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
fully apply the CPU bandwidth

238
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and apply all the lines

239
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
to Lin's return

240
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I will definitely make full use of it

241
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
But

242
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I don't want to

243
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
cause the CPU to overheat

244
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
in the calculation process

245
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
After Lin's return

246
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
as long as it can ensure

247
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
that the daily result is normal

248
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
then it's okay

249
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Then

250
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
we have to run the test on time

251
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You want to run the test on time?

252
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
If the CPU is overheated

253
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I will pay for it

254
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
No, no

255
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I haven't prepared

256
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
the test environment yet

257
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's okay

258
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Let this variable

259
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
stay in the code system for a while

260
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But as long as you want

261
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
the target is still me

262
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and it will return quickly

263
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
My life is in the hands of you

264
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Time to leave

265
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The speed is too high

266
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I feel like

267
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
my CPU is going to overheat

268
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'll have a drink to calm down

269
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Let's meet again

270
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Aunt, I'm going abroad tomorrow

271
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Don't waste your time with her

272
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Let's go for a drink

273
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
See you

274
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
See you

275
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Come with me

276
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's really blowing

277
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Cheers

278
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Cheers

279
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Cheers

280
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The return and return meeting

281
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
is not over yet

282
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Do you want me to pick you up?

283
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Go on a date

284
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
What are you waiting for?

285
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm going to the class

286
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Where are you going to the class in such a dress?

287
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
KTV

288
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You think I will believe it?

289
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Really?

290
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
My class teacher is in KTV again

291
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Good guy, how can you do this?

292
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Why don't you take me with you?

293
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I want to go too

294
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm going to the class

295
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
with the four of us

296
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You can't go

297
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm going to the class

298
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
with the four of us

299
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You can't go

300
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm going to the class

301
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
with the four of us

302
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm going to the class

303
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
with the four of us

304
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm going to the class

305
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
with the four of us

306
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You're a sportsman

307
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You know it

308
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You're also a sportsman

309
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Besides, this is a college student

310
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You know it, okay?

311
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I know

312
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
But there is no good home-school

313
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You know you can't pass the exam

314
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Wait a minute

315
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You can go back after the training

316
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Thank you, father

317
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
for making a request

318
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'll bring you a night shift

319
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Then the night shift will bother your father

320
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm sorry

321
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It must be Dragon School

322
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Cheers

323
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Brother Ding

324
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I remember

325
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I haven't sent you a farewell gift yet

326
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
The school badge of our mother school

327
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I have it at home

328
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's different

329
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It has my name on it

330
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I didn't wear it when I was in school

331
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That's because

332
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
you don't love your mother school

333
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
That's because my sister has obsessive compulsive disorder

334
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
She doesn't allow me to poke holes in my clothes

335
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Sister, where did you get it?

336
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
No, I didn't

337
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Go to sleep

338
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I just thought about it

339
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
If you follow the code you just thought

340
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You want it and you want it

341
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
If you want it and you want it

342
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Then it will probably cause

343
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:28,740
a

344
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I don't understand

345
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I don't understand

346
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
But I don't want to understand

347
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I think I'm drunk

348
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I don't want to understand

349
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Do you know how to destroy the mental institute?

350
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You need to use some external force

351
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
to break the condition

352
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Where are you?

353
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Where are you?

354
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I want to drink

355
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Really?

356
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
This is your favorite Jinghai University

357
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What are we going to do now?

358
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You are all drunk

359
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I can only take you back to the dormitory

360
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I can't walk

361
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I won't go back

362
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I can't walk

363
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Didn't you say that a thousand cups are not drunk?

364
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
How many cups are there?

365
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
How many cups are there?

366
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Where do you want to go?

367
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Where are you going

368
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'll go

369
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Germany, right?

370
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Then I won't go

371
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You are not allowed to go either

372
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Didn't you say that you would go wherever I go?

373
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I don't understand

374
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You can go

375
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I don't want to go

376
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
All right, hurry up

377
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
If you don't go back,

378
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
it's time to go to the dormitory

379
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Lin Zhenhua

380
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Lin Zhenhua

381
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Actually

382
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I have a secret

383
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
What is it?

384
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I said

385
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Actually

386
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I have a secret

387
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
What secret?

388
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Bayi

389
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Bayi

390
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Leave

391
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Leave

392
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I will write

393
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Leave

394
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Bye

395
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I will write

396
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I really have a secret.

397
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Wanna sneak kiss me again?

398
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I want a bright and serious kiss.

399
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Fine. You are all bright and serious.

400
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You are all so naive.

401
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Okay?

402
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
But this time, you are more lovely.

403
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
This is the first time someone said that about me.

404
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
What do you mean by this time?

405
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Actually, I came back ten years later.

406
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I'm sorry.

407
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
This is the big picture.

408
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
This fish will be super active.

409
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Maybe there is a chance to make a great success.

410
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
How do you know the virus is spread?

411
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
You are just a doctor,

412
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
and you have some classes.

413
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I don't wanna go to the lab.

414
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I need to do some more homework.

415
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
What should I say to the kids?

416
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You are so mean.

417
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
But you made me...

418
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
What?

419
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I met you again.

420
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Do you wanna know what you will be like ten years later?

421
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I really cherish this opportunity.

422
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
In order to transfer to the technical college,

423
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I even gave up the opportunity to transfer to the original position.

424
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Miss Gu, your work is really excellent.

425
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
But your resume is not compatible with our technical department.

426
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I quit.

427
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Ling Zhihua, I have offended you.

428
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Why do you punish me like this?

429
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I didn't hire you to make fun of you.

430
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
For a man, I gave up the chance to make a living.

431
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I have been a very strong outsider for five years.

432
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You quit the job because you failed.

433
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It means you can't distinguish the main and secondary.

434
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
You are not good at anti-pressure.

435
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
You will be a burden to the technical department.

436
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I admit if the technical department is not good.

437
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I don't admit if it's not fair.

438
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I don't wanna know.

439
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It's not a good thing.

440
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
You.

441
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Your face is my nightmare.

442
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You are actually our outsider.

443
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
You changed my program and helped Zhou Shiyun to get promoted.

444
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I worked hard to get the job.

445
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
In your opinion, it's all useless.

446
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
If it's not you, I won't come back.

447
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
You don't have to curse me for being a fool.

448
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I am a fool.

449
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I have to be a fool.

450
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,000
But if I don't come back, I won't have all of this.

451
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Do you know how much I like myself now?

452
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,000
So I can't figure out whether I am a fool or not.

453
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I can't figure out whether I should hate you or thank you.

454
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
It doesn't matter.

455
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Anyway, if it's you ten years later, I will never like you.

456
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I will never like you.

457
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Absolutely not.

458
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It's okay.

459
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
It's okay.

460
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Anyway, you are not the one ten years later.

461
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I will never like you.

462
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I will never like you.

463
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I will never like you.

464
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I will never like you.

465
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I will never like you.

466
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I will never like you.

467
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I will never like you.

468
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I will never like you.

469
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I will never like you.

470
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I will never like you.

471
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I will never like you.

472
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I will never like you.

473
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I will never like you.

474
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I will never like you.

475
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I will never like you.

476
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I will never like you.

477
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Shulan, you scared me.

478
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,960
You scared me to death.

479
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,920
I just got a little better,

480
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,760
and you're like this.

481
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:58,840
Last night,

482
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,560
you came home drunk and killed someone.

483
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,520
I got up early in the morning

484
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,360
to line up at the supermarket.

485
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,480
I finally bought it.

486
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,600
Last night?

487
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,200
I amLI natürlich,

488
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,840
thanks.

489
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,880
To who?

490
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,200
She has to be.

491
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,800
Actually,

492
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,440
I have a secret.

493
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,400
You're vir Olá?

494
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
What secret?

495
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Did I say it or not?

496
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Did I say it?

497
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Did I not say it?

498
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Did I say it?

499
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Did I not say it?

500
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
What are you doing here?

501
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
You drank in the day?

502
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I drank too much last night.

503
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I can't find my way out.

504
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I can't find my way out.

505
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I can't find my way out.

506
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I can't find my way out.

507
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Are you looking for your memory?

508
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
You were so fast at memorizing words.

509
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I didn't see you

510
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
add memory by drinking.

511
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It's not the same thing.

512
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Do you know what you look like now?

513
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Losing love.

514
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Definitely not.

515
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
You're in a bad mood, right?

516
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Let me think about it.

517
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Yesterday you went out for a party.

518
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You met a very interesting man.

519
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
The more you two talk, the more you are attracted to each other.

520
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
You even think you met the love of life.

521
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Then he slowly came to you.

522
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
He told you,

523
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
you need to know about it.

524
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
When you woke up this morning,

525
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
you thought you were cheated.

526
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
The more you think, the more angry you are.

527
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
You met a bad man.

528
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
So you're here now to make a living, right?

529
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I really admire you, Sun Tiantian.

530
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
You didn't guess right.

531
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
But drinking is definitely more and more uncomfortable.

532
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Drinking makes you more and more worried.

533
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Come on.

534
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Try my new recipe.

535
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Sun Tiantian's unique secret recipe.

536
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
It's delicious and good.

537
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Pour milk tea.

538
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Thank you, Tiantian.

539
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
But I really can't drink it today.

540
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
You just take a sip.

541
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
This is my new recipe.

542
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It's refreshing and smooth.

543
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I promise you, after you take a sip,

544
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
whatever troubles you have, you will laugh immediately.

545
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Then I hope I can remember what happened last night.

546
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
What secret?

547
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
You want to kiss me again?

548
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Kiss?

549
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I want to kiss you in the light.

550
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Ning Zhi Hua.

551
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I'm sorry.

552
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I'm sorry.

553
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Ning Zhi Hua.

554
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Ning Zhi Hua.

555
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
You're awake.

556
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
What do you remember?

557
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I'm awake.

558
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
What's this recipe?

559
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I remember everything I should remember.

560
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I'm going back.

561
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
No, no.

562
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Your milk tea recipe is awesome.

563
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I'll change your name next time.

564
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Don't call me Pooh.

565
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I can't remember.

566
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I'm leaving.

567
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Help me.

568
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Dad.

569
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I'm leaving.

570
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Bye.

571
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Don't drink anymore.

572
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Bye.

573
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Hurry up.

574
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
The lights are out.

575
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
They're waiting for us.

576
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Are you that broken-hearted?

577
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Don't you have any feelings?

578
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
It's none of your business.

579
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You have feelings anyway.

580
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Hurry up.

581
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Hurry up.

582
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Hurry up.

583
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Hurry up.

584
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Hurry up.

585
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Hurry up.

586
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Hurry up.

587
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I can't let Xing Wan School go.

588
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
How about this?

589
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Let's buy some gifts and take it to Germany.

590
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Gifts?

591
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Gifts?

592
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Okay.

593
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I'll go to the school's mall.

594
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Good idea.

595
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Hurry up.

596
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Slow down.

597
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Be careful.

598
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Then put it in here.

599
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Don't worry.

600
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Go.

601
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
You're so weird.

602
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Where is Ning Xiao?

603
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
He's gone.

604
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Maybe he's at the mall.

605
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I'll be right back.

606
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I'll be right back.

607
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I'll be right back.

608
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Go.

609
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Go.

610
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Go.

611
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Go.

612
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Go.

613
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Go.

614
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Go.

615
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Go.

616
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Go.

617
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Go.

618
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Go.

619
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Go.

620
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Go.

621
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Go.

622
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Go.

623
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Go.

624
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Go.

625
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Go.

626
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Go.

627
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Go.

628
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,720
She left.

629
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,280
She left?

630
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,240
Yes.

631
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,440
She left for the afternoon flight.

632
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,040
She didn't come to the lab today.

633
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,600
She left without telling me.

634
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,320
She could have left me something.

635
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,520
Isn't this the hard disk of the God?

636
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,920
You pack up first. I'll go.

637
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,520
Bu Xuejiao.

638
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,000
Good night.

639
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,480
Why are you suddenly

640
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,520
so breakfast-dead?

641
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,240
Unbearable.

642
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,840
Someone with a long goal

643
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,120
is easier to succeed

644
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,080
while chasing after the goals.

645
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,480
So, I don't think it's funny.

646
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I have

647
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,840
Okay, okay, I bought it all

648
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,840
You are satisfied now, right? Let's go

649
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,340
What did you buy? Let me see

650
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,980
T-shirts, summer meeting, dry doll, I bought them all

651
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,780
What do you mean? Let me see

652
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,680
Doll, fur doll, T-shirt

653
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,680
Pink doll

654
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,680
Okay, okay, I bought them all

655
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,680
If it's not enough, let the test room's junior students send it to us

656
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,680
Let's go, let's go

657
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,680
Brother Nian

658
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,680
Hurry up, get in the car

659
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,680
Why are you here?

660
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,680
Brother Nian, let me go

661
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,680
Lin Zheng Hua

662
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,680
But this time you are more lovely

663
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,680
Did you sleep well last night?

664
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,680
Did I say anything last night?

665
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,360
I drank too much last night

666
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,360
If you say anything that makes you feel incredible

667
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,360
You must not

668
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,360
That thing about Lin Han Shu's code, right?

669
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,360
Yes, there is this thing

670
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,360
I drank too much last night

671
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,040
I drank too much last night

672
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,040
I only remember that

673
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,040
So you came to solve the plan to enter the city's toilet?

674
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,040
No

675
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,040
It's Lin Jia Dong

676
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,040
He said you were moving and wandering

677
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,040
I sent it to you

678
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,040
You came to send this to me?

679
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,040
Yes

680
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,040
Thank you, Gu

681
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,040
This is very important to me

682
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,040
Brother Nian, take care

683
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,040
I'm leaving, you can go back

684
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,720
Bye bye

685
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,720
I'm leaving

686
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,720
It should be almost time

687
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,720
Brother Lin

688
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,720
Don't take the secret I told you last night as real

689
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,720
No, no, what if I didn't say it?

690
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,720
Brother Lin, how was your journey?

691
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,720
Tell me if you are safe

692
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,720
This fake greeting

693
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,720
Obviously a thief

694
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,720
Xue Qiao

695
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,720
Did you see the bulletin board?

696
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,720
About that

697
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,720
What?

698
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,720
About my rebirth

699
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,720
Everyone knows

700
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,720
Oh no, oh no

701
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,400
This is a new one

702
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,400
Don't be a psycho

703
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,400
Not you

704
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,400
It's the high school classmate you threw in the canteen

705
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,400
He's on a new level recently

706
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,400
Let's go together tomorrow

707
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,400
This is

708
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,400
You scared me to death

709
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,400
OK, let's go tomorrow

710
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,400
Let's make a deal

711
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,400
Go and say hello to him

712
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,400
I'm sorry

713
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,400
I'm sorry

714
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,400
I'm sorry

715
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,400
I'm sorry

716
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,400
I'm sorry

717
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,400
I'm sorry

718
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,400
I'm sorry

719
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,400
I'm sorry

720
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,400
I'm sorry

721
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,400
I'm sorry

722
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,400
I'm sorry

723
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,400
I'm sorry

724
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,400
I'm sorry

725
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,400
I'm sorry

726
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,080
I'm sorry

727
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,080
I'm sorry

728
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,080
I'm sorry

729
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,080
I'm sorry

730
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,080
I'm sorry

731
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,080
I'm sorry

732
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,080
I'm sorry

733
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,080
I'm sorry

734
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,080
I'm sorry

735
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,080
I'm sorry

736
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,080
I'm sorry

737
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,080
I'm sorry

738
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,080
I'm sorry

739
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,080
I'm sorry

740
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,760
If you

741
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,760
Know the secret of my eyes

742
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,760
Will find you always in my heart

743
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,760
I try to open my arms

744
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,760
Because of the love

745
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,760
Confirm

746
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,440
I'm listening to the wind

747
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,440
The wind is blowing

748
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,440
It doesn't matter

749
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,440
There is a sound

750
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,440
Very close

751
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,440
I know that must be you

752
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,440
I try to open my arms

753
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,440
Because of the love

754
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,440
Confirm

755
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,440
I'm listening to the wind

756
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,440
The wind is blowing

757
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,440
It doesn't matter

758
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,440
There is a sound

759
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,440
Very close

760
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,440
I know that must be you

761
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,440
I try to open my arms

762
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,440
Because of the love

763
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,440
Confirm

764
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,440
I'm listening to the wind

765
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,440
The wind is blowing

766
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,440
It doesn't matter

767
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,440
There is a sound

768
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,440
Very close

769
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,440
I know that must be you

770
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,440
I try to open my arms

771
