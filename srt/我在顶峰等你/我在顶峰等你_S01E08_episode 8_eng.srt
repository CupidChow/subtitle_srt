 "Burning Tempo" - Duan Aojuan 

3
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,870
♫  One, two, three, four  ♫

4
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,664
♫  Don't be afraid of the so-called star student  ♫

5
00:00:25,664 --> 00:00:29,430
♫  You are also someone else's legend  ♫

6
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,155
♫  Don't hold back, grow with all your might  ♫

7
00:00:32,155 --> 00:00:35,895
♫  Midsummer's flowers  ♫

8
00:00:36,889 --> 00:00:40,581
♫  Now is the time to format your life  ♫

9
00:00:40,581 --> 00:00:43,526
♫  Math and physics are not complicated  ♫

10
00:00:43,526 --> 00:00:49,206
♫  Youth is full of obstacles, but we'll slowly become stronger  ♫

11
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:54,059
♫  My heart still burns passionately  ♫

12
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,103
♫  Follow the tempo, set yourself free  ♫

13
00:00:58,103 --> 00:01:01,720
♫  The illuminated night sky guides me to success  ♫

14
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,480
♫  I'll accompany you as you bravely take flight  ♫

15
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,300
♫  My love still burns passionately   ♫

16
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,860
♫  Shining in the smiling eyes  ♫

17
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:20,460
♫  Let us transcend the obstacles of time  ♫

18
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,000
   

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,910
   

20
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,190
Gu Xuejiao, think it over.

21
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,720
Jinghai University's cut-off is always above 690.

22
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,340
If you don't make it, you'll have to repeat a year.

23
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,120
 Leave your sister alone. 

24
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,750
Xuejiao, Mingze's got a point.

25
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,110
With scores like yours, you could get into almost

26
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,830
any top school in the country.

27
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,520
It doesn't have to be Jinghai University, right?

28
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,960
Honey, come talk to her.

29
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,630
I'll deal with him.

30
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,520
Made up your mind yet?

31
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,780
Honestly,

32
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,860
- JUFE and Jinghai University are pretty much in the same league. 
 - 50 spots apart in the rankings!

33
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,920
Listen! Since you're officially college-bound,

34
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,270
you're paying for this.

35
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,550
No problem.

36
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,240
When have I ever skipped out on a meal?

37
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,080
Still no reply from Gu Xuejiao.

38
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,110
Too busy celebrating?

39
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,000
Keep trying.

40
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,020
 Quiz time: know how far JUFE and Jinghai Univesity are from each other? 

41
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,650
 Basically walking distance. 

42
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,870
Why hasn't she messaged back yet?

43
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,200
She's probably thrilled they're so close to each other?

44
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,870
Get over here! Come on!

45
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,430
Just like the college entrance exam,

46
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,550
good things take effort, get it?

47
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,220
Shut up.

48
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,960
What are you talking about?

49
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,480
You know, the drama Sun Tiantian recommended is actually pretty good.

50
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,480
Do you think those two will end up together?

51
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,520
- Of course they will. 
 - Why?

52
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,550
Why not? Why else cast them as leads?

53
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,040
Are you dense, or do you think I am?

54
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,110
I mean, obviously the leads end up together.

55
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:30,480
I just want to know why, so I can talk about it with other people!

56
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,110
- Dude! 
 - Fine.

57
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:36,800
Look here. The leads are basically a perfect match.

58
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,320
Like hotpot and dipping sauce.

59
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,480
One of them is a hardcore scientist,

60
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,080
just like Gu Xuejiao.

61
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,640
The other one is a super thoughtful beauty vlogger.

62
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,870
A beauty vlogger?

63
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,270
I play basketball.

64
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,080
Fine.

65
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,550
A rising basketball star.

66
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,590
Wait a minute, I can't just tell her that the lead is just like her.

67
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,520
Now we have to distill the core message.

68
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,670
Two words: Be thoughtful.

69
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,340
Be thoughtful?

70
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,880
Thoughtful... What does that even mean?

71
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,960
I understand it. Explain it.

72
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,420
Okay.

73
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,150
Stop it!

74
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,200
- All right, I'm done. 
 - Come on, explain!

75
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,030
Look.

76
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,710
They already knew each other, right?

77
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,910
The pretty girl has had a crush on the scientist for years,

78
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,560
but he is cold as ice, thick as a brick.

79
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,790
The guy's basically buried in research 24/7.

80
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:47,710
She keeps popping up in his life, making memories,

81
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,880
big or small, just trying to get noticed.

82
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,150
She shows him there's more to life than lab work,

83
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,790
and eventually pulls him into her world.

84
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,440
So, how do I get her to notice me?

85
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,150
Get noticed?

86
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,540
Just keep showing up!

87
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,200
Like cramming before finals.

88
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,680
If you don't have anything to say, think up a topic.

89
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,590
No chance? Create one.

90
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,490
For example, say, "After we graduate,

91
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,528
no need to cram over break.

92
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:19,108
We finally have time to do other stuff."

93
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,080
Invite her to do something you never could in high school,

94
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,770
something that gives you more to talk about.

95
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,880
How about... video games?

96
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,150
Graduation trip, dude!

97
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,830
Gaming only bonds us dudes, not her!

98
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,910
Man, this is crazy spicy! It's killing me.

99
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,760
- Why'd you order this? 
 - Right, a graduation trip!

100
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,350
That makes sense!

101
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,390
Buddy, you're a genius.

102
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,120
- Here. 
 - You finally got it.

103
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,590
A graduation trip!

104
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,120
Why didn't I think of that?

105
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,010
Forget games!

106
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,860
I'm telling them now!

107
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,600
   

108
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,590
 - What are you doing it?  
 - Spit it out!

109
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,790
So, that graduation trip, what do you think?

110
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,080
 Will you go or not? 

111
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,790
What graduation trip?

112
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,760
I posted in the group, didn't you see?

113
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,390
Let's take a graduation trip!

114
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,830
I don't want to go.

115
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,000
 What's wrong with you? 

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,600
You got your results, aren't you supposed to be celebrating?

117
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,440
You scored 300 points higher than me!

118
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,030
To get into a university, if you're short one point, it means nothing.

119
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,080
 So what if you don't get into Jinghai University? 

120
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,790
 We can go somewhere else. 

121
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,520
 I'm thinking... 

122
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,960
Somewhere a bit...

123
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,910
Hello? You listening?

124
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,470
Hello?

125
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,080
Bait not taken, now what?

126
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,590
She hung up!

127
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,270
Totally not playing along!

128
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,610
How can that be?

129
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,270
Stop eating and think of something.

130
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,690
Okay.

131
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,520
Nothing's impossible if you're willing...

132
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
to quit...

133
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,760
   

134
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,040
 What did you score? 

135
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,120
 I didn't realize it was you earlier. 

136
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,790
 I'm begging you now! 

137
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,680
 Tutor me, help me reach the summit and ace this. 

138
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,760
 No tutoring. Period. 

139
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,640
 You knew what I was going to say before I even said it? 

140
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,000
 See? We're totally in sync! 

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,220
 Perfect reason to tutor me! 

142
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,270
 - Senior Brother Lin. 
 - Are you made of glue? 

143
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,120
 Stickier than Gorilla Glue. 

144
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,341
 I figured it out! Look! 

145
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,000
 I'll show you my calculations. 

146
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:24,900
 an2-1/an-1 ∴an＋12-1/an 

147
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,500
 Right? 

148
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,471
   

149
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,020
 Let's go eat. 

150
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,830
 If you have something to say, say it. 

151
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,590
 Don't stand so close. 

152
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,480
Senior Lin, we're heading out. See you later.

153
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,460
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

154
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,731
Bye-bye.

155
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,110
   

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,820
   

157
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,390
Want to get something to eat?

158
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,300
You go ahead, I'm staying.

159
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,160
Old Lin, is this you wanting to support me?

160
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,680
I'm touched, really!

161
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,570
I'm going to need your laptop.

162
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,220
You whipped out that meal card like it was an American Express!

163
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,800
Hurry. Go ahead and enjoy your meal.

164
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,160
You can't work on an empty stomach.

165
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,790
Swipe all you want.

166
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,059
   

167
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:48,319
   
   

168
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,590
What's happening?

169
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,360
Is it a virus?

170
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,640
   

171
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,960
Senior Brother Lin.

172
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,800
I ignored your messages, that was wrong.

173
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,200
But a Trojan?

174
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,990
That's a bit much, don't you think?

175
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:56,200
It was just a joke virus, not a real Trojan.

176
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,320
It was that simple?

177
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,630
Want something more complex?

178
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,210
No thanks.

179
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,490
I need it to submit my applications.

180
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,200
They say good relationships should be mutual.

181
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,080
But with Jinghai University,

182
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,820
it's like a one-sided crush.

183
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,230
I like it,

184
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,280
but who knows if it likes me.

185
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,750
You're 136 points above the first-tier cut-off,

186
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,730
and you still feel like that?

187
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,610
Negative infinity?

188
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:56,190
It won't mean a thing if I don't get into Jinghai University.

189
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,870
You exam is already ahead of 90% of the country.

190
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,210
If you said that out loud, someone would punch you.

191
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,340
But since I've got a second...

192
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,380
A second what?

193
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,470
Second chance to meet you!

194
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,600
You're from Jinghai University. If I can't get in,

195
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,060
I'll feel like I let you down after all your earnest tutoring.

196
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,460
Here.

197
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,320
Look.

198
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,070
What do you see?

199
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,530
In 2010, China's GDP hit 40 trillion yuan

200
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:48,820
and became the world's second-biggest economy.

201
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,110
Get to the point.

202
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,400
Before, people picked colleges based on estimated scores.

203
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,320
This year, you know your score ahead of time.

204
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,980
New rules, new chances.

205
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,230
Some will take a risk, some will play it safe.

206
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:15,490
Do you think Jinghai University is a long shot?

207
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,660
I say it's the opposite.

208
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,280
 I told you to take these in earlier. 

209
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,410
 You've stalled all day 

210
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,850
My mom is here to take in the sheets.

211
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,400
- So, you actually scored worse this year? 
 - Yes.

212
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,860
What planet are you living on?

213
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,580
- Sure! 
 - Don't you "sure" me!

214
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,440
I must be the unluckiest person alive.

215
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,630
If I had a cat, at least it would make me smile.

216
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,230
But raising you?

217
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,520
All I get is a headache.

218
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,870
Huh? Why is this sheet stuck?

219
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,360
This...

220
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,800
What's wrong with it?

221
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,710
Mom, I think a cat's stealing our socks.

222
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,430
Probably that rascal downstairs. Just wait, I'll go and catch it!

223
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,730
My mom's not always like this. She's usually sweet.

224
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,040
So the sneaky cat's here, right?

225
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,050
You?

226
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,750
Gu Xuejiao, that was really uncool of you.

227
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,280
Scores are out, and you left me at home alone?

228
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,240
Now, all the pride Mom and Dad had in you is turning into heat on me!

229
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,470
What are you two doing with a laptop?

230
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,630
Don't tell me you're still studying after the exam.

231
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,770
We're just talking about the applications that come after the exam.

232
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,590
Nothing good comes from hiding.

233
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,630
What are you thinking?

234
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,870
Now I understand why you're so hung up on Jinghai University!

235
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,440
It turns out...

236
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,560
I'm nothing like you.

237
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,180
- We were just... 
 - Okay, you don't need to explain.

238
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,160
I understand.

239
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,040
But you two are really in sync with those slaps.

240
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,590
But speaking of that, I'm not sure where Shiyun is applying.

241
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,690
Don't worry.

242
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,056
With your impressive 184 points,

243
00:15:50,056 --> 00:15:55,090
you're set for a security guard gig anywhere.

244
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:59,420
Senior Brother Lin, explain it to him.

245
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,400
Explain what?

246
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,750
If you're still struggling with your choices, meet me at Jinghai University

247
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,380
at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow.

248
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,320
He asked you out right in front of me,

249
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,750
and you're still telling me there's nothing?

250
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,350
What do you know?

251
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,970
I see right through you.

252
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,540
No one's here?

253
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,920
   
   

254
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,630
I can handle the truth; I can click.

255
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,630
   

256
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,000
Wait, what?

257
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,610
   

258
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,040
Hey, Old Lin.

259
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,440
Hurry!  Come and save me.

260
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,870
Whoever created this has to resolve it.

261
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,320
What is this?

262
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,360
Wait, you clicked it too?

263
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:08,110
This is just a joke virus.

264
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,000
Fixed.

265
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,030
Thank goodness you're here.

266
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,590
Otherwise, our presentation to Professor Tan tomorrow would've been toast.

267
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,200
The meeting with Professor Tan is tomorrow afternoon?

268
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,810
It's a day off in the lab; no need to come in.

269
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,470
Awesome!

270
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,600
Then let's hang out tomorrow afternoon!

271
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,640
I've got plans for tomorrow.

272
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,590
You go ahead.

273
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,710
You're acting weird!

274
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,360
Says the guy acting weirder! Did you finish the slides?

275
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,900
You're going to present the day after tomorrow.

276
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,580
All right.

277
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,772
But wait...

278
00:17:47,772 --> 00:17:49,840
Hurry up so we can go grab a late-night snack!

279
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,490
Okay!

280
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,750
Get up, it's already noon!

281
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,620
You're still not up?

282
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,160
Come on, aren't you going on a date?

283
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,940
What date?

284
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:57,010
 Meet me at Jinghai University, 3:00 p.m. tomorrow. 

285
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:11,230
Are you sure you want to wear that?

286
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,640
It's not a date!

287
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,940
 Was he really asking me out on a date? 

288
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,110
I washed my hair!

289
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,760
That's the highest level effort for a girl, you know?

290
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,250
   

291
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,360
   

292
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:35,880
Senior Brother Lin, the forum speech you just gave was impressive!

293
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,340
Did you ask me out today for that purpose?

294
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,070
This industry is developing very quickly this year.

295
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,230
There are a lot of exhibitions to attend.

296
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:47,680
I usually skip regular forums if I can,

297
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,740
but I can't escape the ones on campus.

298
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:57,510
Anything with "Jinghai University" on it just hits differently.

299
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:03,810
Here, today, I'm officially introducing you to Jinghai University's Autonomous Driving Lab.

300
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,140
 It's about the same as of Xintu Group's R&amp;D lab from back then. 

301
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:15,750
It's so state-of-the-art but still full of history.

302
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,570
Impressive!

303
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,440
So heavy!

304
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,750
I didn't call you here just to hang out.

305
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,070
You're my assistant today.

306
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,670
Assistant?

307
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,820
Look. I can't run this lab alone, can I?

308
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:36,880
I helped you catch up before; now you help me for a day.

309
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,390
Fair trade.

310
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:44,710
Senior Brother Lin, only you could make exploiting free labor sound noble.

311
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,140
Sit.

312
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:59,200
Use this format to write a literature review on these books.

313
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,438
If you can pull this off...

314
00:21:07,438 --> 00:21:10,420
Then that will mean I'm Jinghai University material?

315
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,110
Let's see how you do first.

316
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,840
What does that mean?

317
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,240
Senior Brother...

318
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,340
What are you asking about?

319
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,310
Right here.

320
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,030
Current autonomous driving systems can operate in all weather conditions,

321
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:56,120
primarily using millimeter-wave radar.

322
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,350
It has two operational modes...

323
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,190
You have to hold that handle...

324
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,250
so I can pull you back up.

325
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,750
This chair's seriously high-tech.

326
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,340
True.

327
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,440
 It's all because Gu Mingze put those thoughts in my mind. 

328
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,270
 Those suggestions are so scary. 

329
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,730
Master, I'm here to keep you company while we work.

330
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,210
Why is there a visitor here?

331
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,180
She's my assistant.

332
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,880
By the way, check this out.

333
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,980
I got BMC Motors' latest self-driving promo brochures.

334
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,600
Take a look! It's absolutely groundbreaking.

335
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,680
   

336
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,360
If by "groundbreaking,"

337
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,700
you mean flashy slides, then sure.

338
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,690
However, at their pace,

339
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,470
real autonomous driving is at least 5-10 years away.

340
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,710
It's all talk.

341
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,490
Don't bother reading it.

342
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,150
- Master... 
 - You aren't taking this personally, are you?

343
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,050
I was just stating facts.

344
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,880
Xuejiao,

345
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,920
have you picked a major yet?

346
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,070
Not yet.

347
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,000
How about AI?

348
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,680
What?

349
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,350
Trying to recruit me for your program?

350
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,150
Would that be bad?

351
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:10,050
I'm just saying, if you don't have a specific preference in mind, think about us.

352
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:15,990
The lab I just showed you has the country's top technology and top professionals.

353
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,050
You wouldn't regret it.

354
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:23,760
Of course, this is just a rational suggestion.

355
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,290
Plus, AI's a growing field.

356
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,810
Cover for me. Thank you.

357
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,530
Why so jumpy?

358
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,470
Help me out.

359
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,700
What's there to hide from anyway?

360
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,920
Senior Brother Lin?

361
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,800
What are you doing here?

362
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,090
What a coincidence. I was just passing by.

363
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,220
Boss, bring another bottle.

364
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,320
 When are you coming to pick him up? 

365
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:17,360
 If I come, there's a 99% chance we'll end up fighting. 

366
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,510
 I'm sparing you this sibling drama. 

367
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:22,160
 Who knows? Maybe you two will actually bond 

368
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,270
 and understand each other. 

369
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:27,620
 But I don't want to get too close to your brother. 

370
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,640
 Senior Brother Lin, you're meant to be a star in academia, 

371
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,400
 try to be smart and kind. Okay? 

372
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,800
Not the "be kind" speech again.

373
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:47,600
Senior Brother Lin, I never thought you'd be the one

374
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,290
who actually understands me best.

375
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,920
What did I say?

376
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,840
You think I can be smart and kind

377
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,680
and make something of myself. Right?

378
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,076
Someone from Jinghai's elite agrees

379
00:26:02,076 --> 00:26:04,270
I am on the right track!

380
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,680
That's it!

381
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,360
We should embrace diversity.

382
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,230
Maybe in ten years I'll bring honor to the country!

383
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:16,510
Never mind, my parents will never get it.

384
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:19,020
Just because I want to be a self-taught digital media designer,

385
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,030
Dad smashed my phone.

386
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:29,652
Xuejiao says I'm stepping into a blue ocean field... or something.

387
00:26:29,652 --> 00:26:31,600
Whatever. None of that matters.

388
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:37,050
Anyway, she said you told her, so it must be true.

389
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,480
Here.

390
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,390
Sometimes you've just got to get things off your chest.

391
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,710
Break down walls, you know?

392
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,600
But some walls don't budge.

393
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,120
Let's say, you're into a girl,

394
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,840
can you just blurt it out?

395
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,990
No way.

396
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,310
Like, "Hey, I like you, shall we date?"

397
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:02,460
She'd probably slap you.

398
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,570
Is it really that bad?

399
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,270
Don't play innocent with me. Okay?

400
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:15,230
You've got way more experience with girls than me.

401
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:18,140
Confess. How many have you dated?

402
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:22,870
Just give me a number, not a big deal.

403
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,790
One?

404
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,460
Ten?

405
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,960
100?

406
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,090
1,000?

407
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,470
No way? Seriously?

408
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:40,680
Don't tell me you've never dated.

409
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:45,120
You're a PhD student, and you haven't even had one relationship?

410
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,330
Thanks for that. Now academia is even more clearly not in my plans.

411
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:53,550
Thanks for the brutal truth.

412
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,290
Here's to you.

413
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,630
So, is there someone you like?

414
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,900
I'm not sure yet.

415
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,160
Not sure yet?

416
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,960
Can you not be sure yet?

417
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,840
You either like her or you don't.

418
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,250
What's there to be unsure about?

419
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,180
Kid, what do you know?

420
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,630
What do you think "liking someone" means?

421
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,470
Tell you what, I'll give you two tickets.

422
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:56,160
Tomorrow, bring that girl to my show,

423
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,420
and I'll help you figure it out.

424
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,140
Gu Mingze?

425
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,050
Gu Mingze!

426
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,970
 Come pick him up. 

427
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:41,270
Let's raise a glass to our dreams.

428
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,360
One more glass, really?

429
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,750
You're already drunk!

430
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,840
How are we getting home?

431
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,470
I'm not going home.

432
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:50,570
- I... I... 
 - What...

433
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:59,880
You two are really in sync, I'll give you that.

434
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,710
It... It was just a reflex.

435
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,830
Let me wipe that off for you.

436
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,070
There's something on your neck.

437
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,850
Here, let me get that.

438
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,470
Wait. I'll do it.

439
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,350
Take him.

440
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,550
Gu Mingze.

441
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,810
You've always been all talk and no substance, how'd you suddenly

442
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:02,160
become such a dead weight?

443
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,680
Lin Zhihua, help!

444
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,210
Lin Zhihua!

445
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,040
Gu Mingze!

446
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,380
Hang on.

447
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,970
 Relax, she's probably back already. 

448
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,960
Come on, let's go.

449
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,940
 No way. 

450
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,960
You go to sleep first.

451
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,860
 If she were back, we'd hear her. 

452
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:59,880
I'll give her a call.

453
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,070
Mom.

454
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,550
When did you get home?

455
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,750
Why didn't you say something to me?

456
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,120
Why call when we're all here?

457
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,200
I just got back, heading straight to bed.

458
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,540
Good night then. Don't forget to change into pajamas.

459
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,120
Good night, Mom.

460
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,790
Good night.

461
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,510
What's there to hide here?

462
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,550
It's not for me.

463
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,400
It's for you.

464
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,680
I've got nothing to hide.

465
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,510
Feeling guilty, huh?

466
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,840
Showing up here at this hour?

467
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,180
You'll give my mom a heart attack!

468
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,590
Fine.

469
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,920
I'm leaving.

470
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,400
What?

471
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,230
Well, at least help me drag him into his room.

472
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,470
I can't carry him alone.

473
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,510
He's your brother.

474
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,200
This is your house.

475
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,080
Figure it out yourself.

476
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,620
I'm begging you.

477
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,820
Please?

478
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,420
Come on, please.

479
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,570
Let's move him.

480
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,920
Your shirt got dirty. Here, change into this.

481
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,630
Thanks.

482
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,080
   

483
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,520
I'll wait outside.

484
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:10,320
Pentakill!

485
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,420
I'm...

486
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,370
- leaving. 
 - Okay.

487
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,810
Senior Brother Lin.

488
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:28,760
I think I dreamed about you.

489
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,620
I dreamed you were hugging a girl.

490
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,720
Congratulations.

491
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,110
First love at last!

492
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,760
Gu Xuejiao.

493
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,700
I think I dreamed about you, too.

494
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,890
Pretty sure you were hugging a guy.

495
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,800
Who was it?

496
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,150
Who dared touch my sister?

497
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:02,510
I'll break your legs!

498
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,060
Gu Mingze!

499
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,900
What is this, Inception? Too many dream layers.

500
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,510
Senior Brother Lin.

501
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,550
Good luck!

502
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:15,070
Hope you hit that big breakthrough soon.

503
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,320
Gu Xuejiao.

504
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,900
No breakthroughs for you.

505
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,610
Try it and I'll break your legs.

506
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:34,640
Explain this to him tomorrow.

507
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,360
I'm going.

508
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,310
I'll walk you out.

509
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,550
Bye.

510
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,240
   

511
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,190
 This year, you know your score ahead of time. 

512
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:13,320
 New rules, new chances. 

513
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,440
 Some will take a risk, some will play it safe. 

514
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,810
 Do you think Jinghai University is a long shot? 

515
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,860
How about...

516
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,840
I just take the risk?

517
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,300
Go big or go home.

518
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:33,120
   

519
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:35,720
   

520
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:40,070
Too risky! What will I do if I end up with nothing?

521
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,540
- Where's Xuejiao? 
 - I'll go get her.

522
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,860
Hurry!

523
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,880
Xuejiao!

524
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,510
Time to eat. Come on.

525
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:50,150
Mom, I'm not hungry, you go ahead.

526
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,000
You're not eating?

527
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,630
Where's your brother?

528
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,510
I don't know.

529
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,110
Okay, suit yourself.

530
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,880
So, that kid, Mingze...

531
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,360
I heard him come home last night.

532
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,880
You know what, he's faking it. Running away?

533
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,920
He left in the morning, and then?

534
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,800
He still came back for dinner and bed.

535
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,240
Come on, give him a break.

536
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,440
What? Are you really kicking him out?

537
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,550
He got 184. 
    

538
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,420
If we help him, maybe he can 
    

539
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,540
 scrape into a community college. Right? 

540
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,820
 Just call him! 

541
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,020
 Ask him where on earth he is! 

542
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:35,820
 Sorry, the number you dialed is powered off. 

543
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,840
I just don't get it.

544
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,930
Look at him... zero interest in books!

545
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,640
Who's to blame, you or me?

546
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,320
He's a boy.

547
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,920
Boys will be boys, right?

548
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,150
And Mingze's not a bad kid.

549
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,960
Not a bad kid? 'Boys will be boys'?

550
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,920
You always take his side, every time I try to straighten him out.

551
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,740
Wait till we're old and bedridden,

552
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,590
see if you still side with him then.

553
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,800
He doesn't care about his future at all!

554
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,990
It isn't even in his dictionary.

555
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:04,630
He just wants to play around, you know?

556
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,630
I'm telling you, I'll set him straight today!

557
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,110
Or I'll take his last name!

558
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,880
Please!

559
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,590
You can't be serious.

560
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,030
What are you doing?

561
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,240
Don't touch his computer! He'll be furious.

562
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,190
He might really run away, then what?

563
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,470
Let him leave if he wants.

564
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,650
When's he going to get into college, huh? Next year?

565
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:22,820
 Have you seen his grades? 

566
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,170
 I'm telling you, he won't make it next year! Mark my words! 

567
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,440
Even after Xuejiao graduates from college, he still won't make it in!

568
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,630
Wait, wait!

569
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:31,360
- Why be so harsh? 
 - Harsh?

570
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,510
His score was only 184, not even as high as his height!

571
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,280
Want to raise him right? Stop spoiling him!

572
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,420
From now on, we need to be on the same team.

573
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,720
We're helping him, not hurting him!

574
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,820
Dad! Mom!

575
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,790
Are you really kicking Gu Mingze out?

576
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:47,170
Your dad said he's helping your brother turn over a new leaf!

577
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,110
- Seriously... 
 - Dad!

578
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,730
At least leave him some hope!

579
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,880
- Hope for what? Move aside. 
 - Dad!

580
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,900
- Let me through. 
 - Dad!

581
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,590
Dad. Mom. I'm back.

582
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,990
Gu Mingze!

583
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,990
You're finally back.

584
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,590
What are you doing?

585
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,440
Hands off my computer!

586
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,840
Gu Mingze, listen up. You get into college this year,

587
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,630
or kiss all this junk goodbye!

588
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,670
None of it's helping you study!

589
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,190
Why are you calling this useless stuff?

590
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,360
I poured so much of my youth into these notes!

591
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,320
What do you know?

592
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,400
Now I see why your grades never improve!

593
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,350
This is the problem! Give it to me.

594
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:24,370
- Hand it over. 
 - No! Stop!

595
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,490
Give it to me, right now!

596
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:27,310
Hit me if you must, but don't take my stuff.

597
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:29,110
If you don't give it to me, I'll just take it.

598
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:32,120
- Calm down, Dad! 
 - Watch and see if I don't hit you today!

599
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,810
What are you doing here?

600
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,800
Test into college?

601
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,500
That's all you talk about, testing into college.

602
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,150
You know nothing else besides that.

603
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,960
I'm just not cut out for studying.

604
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,110
How could you not have seen that after all these years?

605
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:21,120
I just want to do what I love.

606
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,440
Dad. Mom.

607
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,670
Mingze signed up for a digital design contest.

608
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:32,320
He's been preparing for it. His hands are wrecked,

609
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,320
but he didn't quit.

610
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,930
- Dad... 
 - I know.

611
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:40,440
I'm nothing like Xuejiao.

612
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,840
You think I'm a loser, can't do anything right,

613
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,320
always scoring dead last.

614
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,590
If you look down on me, it's okay.

615
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:51,240
But at least I've now found something I like,

616
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,550
something I'm actually good at.

617
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:57,070
I wish you could just praise me for once.

618
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:02,440
Stand in front of me and say, "Son, you're amazing."

619
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,920
"We're proud of you."

620
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,340
Is that really so hard?

621
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,260
Is it impossible?

622
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,850
Mingze.

623
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,190
Son.

624
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,590
Son.

625
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:23,010
I see it. I know what you've done.

626
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,840
All right?

627
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:31,240
- Old Gu! 
  - This is the first championship I've ever won. 

628
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,570
I told you, stop it!

629
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:34,490
Just stop!

630
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,640
   

631
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:02,760
 Mom and Dad gave Mingze one month. 

632
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,800
 If he gets Roller Blast mobile up and running, 

633
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,880
 they'll back his choice. 

634
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,880
 Turns out anything's possible. 

635
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,840
 Just like Senior Brother Lin said, some will play it safe, 

636
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,720
 some will dive in and try. 

637
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,240
 Crab tastes great, but you have to be brave and crack it open. 

638
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,732
 Gu Xuejiao, do you dare? 

639
00:42:22,732 --> 00:42:26,432
   
   

640
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,400
   

641

00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,067
♫  There's a figure approaching  ♫

660
00:44:36,067 --> 00:44:43,047
♫  I know it must be you   ♫

661
00:44:49,189 --> 00:44:56,042
♫  I try to open my arms  ♫

662
00:44:56,042 --> 00:45:00,040
♫  Because I'm certain of this love  ♫

663
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,792
♫  I'll wait for you at the summit  ♫

664
00:45:02,792 --> 00:45:09,660
♫  Even if the wind's harsh, it's all right  ♫

665
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:13,818
♫  There's a figure approaching  ♫

666
00:45:13,818 --> 00:45:21,298
♫  I know it must be you   ♫
